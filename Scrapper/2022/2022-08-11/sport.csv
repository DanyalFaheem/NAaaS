0,Boult released from NZ contract to spend more time at home,New Zealand Cricket says the 33-year-old will continue to play for his country but have a “significantly reduced role”.,"WELLINGTON: World class fast bowler Trent Boult was released from his central contract with New Zealand Cricket (NZC) at his own request on Wednesday so he can spend less time travelling and more time at home with his family.
The 33-year-old, who has played 70 tests and 137 limited overs internationals since 2011, will continue to play for his country but have a “significantly reduced role”, NZC said.  
“This has been a really tough decision for me ... playing cricket for my country was a childhood dream and I’m so proud of everything I’ve been able to achieve,” Boult said in an NZC statement.
“Ultimately this decision is about my wife Gert and our three young boys. Family has always been the biggest motivator for me and I feel comfortable with putting it first and preparing ourselves for life after cricket.”  Boult and Tim Southee have been one of the most feared strike partnerships in international cricket over the last decade, helping New Zealand to the inaugural World Test title last year and the finals of the last two 50-overs World Cups.
The left-arm quick has taken 317 test wickets, 169 in ODIs and a further 62 in T20s.
Boult will make himself available for domestic leagues, NZC said, and had accepted that his decision would have an impact on his international career.
“I still have a big desire to represent my country and feel I have the skills to deliver at international level,” Boult added.
“However, I respect the fact that not having a national contract will affect my chances of selection.”

1,Four-member committee to probe boxers’ disappearance after CWG,"""The boxers had submitted a surety bond of Rs3m and it won’t be easy for them to remain in hiding in the UK,"" PBF official says.","LAHORE: The Pakistan Olympic Association has formed a four-member committee to probe the disappearance of two boxers from the athletes’ village at the end of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Pakistan Boxing Federation secretary Nasir Ijaz Tung said on Wednesday. 
Suleman Baloch and Nazeerullah Khan were nowhere to be found as the Pakistan contingent prepared to leave for home on Tuesday with the duo classified as missing and their information passed on to the concerned authorities including the Pakistan consulate in the United Kingdom. 
Nasir told Dawn that the travel documents of the boxers were in possession of the team management. 
The probe committee, which includes Nasir, is headed by Pakistan Handball Federation president Mohammad Shafique while the other members are Army Sports Directorate secretary Col Sadaf Akram and a representative of the Pakistan Sports Board. 
“The boxers’ parent department [Pakistan Army] has taken strict notice and is in contact with their families, which have been told to ask them to turn up or face serious consequences,” Nasir informed. 
“The boxers had submitted a surety bond of Rs3million and it won’t be easy for them to remain in hiding in the UK.” 
Suleman, who took part in the welterweight competition, and Nazeerullah, who fought in the heavyweight class, were only included in Pakistan’s boxing squad for the Commonwealth Games after they won in their respective categories at the National Championships this year. 
A special request was made to the Games’ organising committee for their accreditation with the PSB bearing the expenditure for their participation in Birmingham. 
Pakistan weren’t the only nation to see their athletes go missing at the Games. As many as nine athletes and one official from Sri Lanka disappeared after their events in Birmingham. 
Initially, two members of Sri Lanka’s judo team and a wrestler disappeared from the Games village without warning, prompting other seven athletes to follow suit. 
All the Sri Lankans, however, had their travel documents with them. British police had located the first three people who went missing but no action was taken against them as they had not violated any laws and had visas valid for six months.

2,Golden duck for Raza as Zimbabwe lose to BD,HARARE: Sikandar Raza’s golden run ended with a golden duck as his Zimbabwe side lost by 105 runs to Bangladesh in...,"HARARE: Sikandar Raza’s golden run ended with a golden duck as his Zimbabwe side lost by 105 runs to Bangladesh in a dead-rubber third One-day International here at the Harare Sports Club on Wednesday.
An unbeaten 85 by Afif Hossain lifted Bangladesh to 256-9 in 50 overs when put in to bat and Mustafizur Rahman then took 4-17 as Zimbabwe were all out for just 151 in 32.2 overs.
Pakistan-born Raza batted superbly in guiding Zimbabwe to a winning 2-0 lead in the series last weekend, hitting unbeaten knocks of 135 and 117 in superb run chases for two five-wicket victories.
But the 36-year-old, whose childhood dream to be a fighter pilot in the Pakistan Air Force was dashed by an eyesight glitch, finally met his match in ODI debutant Ebadot Hossain.
Facing his first ball with Zimbabwe reeling at 17-3, Raza fell victim to an in-swinging yorker that flattened the middle and off stumps.
Zimbabwe were heading for a hiding as subsequent wickets fell cheaply until tail-enders Richard Ngarava and Victor Nyauchi came together and put on 68 for the final wicket.
Unbeaten top scorer Ngarava made 34, including a six and six fours, while Nyauchi contributed 26.
Apart from the four wickets of Mustafizur, Ebadot and Taijal Islam captured two each for the tourists.
Hossain faced 81 balls and struck two sixes and six fours as seventh-ranked Bangladesh — eight places above Zimbabwe — regained some pride at the end of the six-match visit to southern Africa.
Opener Anamul Haque was the other visiting batsman to post a half-century, scoring 76 before edging a Luke Jongwe delivery outside off stump to debutant wicket-keeper Clive Madande.
Like Afif, Anamul scored quicker than a run a ball in his innings, which included four sixes and six fours.
A cautious 39 from Mahmudullah Riyad was the other significant Bangladeshi knock as they reached their lowest total in the series having scored 303 runs in the first ODI and 290 in the second.
Jongwe and Brad Evans took two wickets each for Zimbabwe, who have won nine of 11 ODI and T20 matches since former captain Dave Houghton began a second stint as coach in June.
Before the ODI matches, Zimbabwe edged Bangladesh 2-1 in a T20 series after winning a thrilling final match by 10 runs.
After a brief break, Zimbabwe will host India in a three ODI series from Aug 18, also at the Harare Sports Club.

3,Serena’s retirement heralds sunset of sport’s golden era,TORONTO: Serena Williams’ decision to bow out has left tennis staring at the beginning of the end of the sport’s...,"

TORONTO: Serena Williams’ decision to bow out has left tennis staring at the beginning of the end of the sport’s golden era, a dreaded but inevitable prospect that has long been on the horizon. 
The American, who will turn 41 next month, said in a Vogue article on Tuesday that she is “evolving away from tennis” and added in an Instagram post that “the countdown has begun.” for her to quit playing and devote more time to her family and business. 
The decision — though not unexpected given Serena’s struggles with form and injury in the past 12 months — would have sent shivers down the spines of tennis administrators and organisers. 
“She’s box office,” former British number one Greg Rusedski summed it up on Sky Sports. “She’s carried women’s tennis for the last two decades with her sister Venus as well, you’ve obviously had other great players around them, but she brings your non-tennis fan to the sport. 
“If you know absolutely nothing about tennis, you know the name Serena Williams. She’s iconic and we’re losing an icon of our sport and she will be truly, truly missed.” 
But it will not just be a loss for women’s tennis. She could well be the first in a series of ageing greats to call time on their playing careers in the near future. 
Like Serena, the triumvirate of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic, have also dominated tennis for the last two decades and revolutionised the sport, drawing in new and old fans and a long line of sponsors. 
All four of them continue to lure fans to the stands, mobile and television screens even after two decades on the tour, while their commercial pull still mesmerizes brands and advertisers. 
Injuries to Serena, Federer and Nadal in recent years have raised the ‘retirement’ question time and again and fans and pundits have wondered how the sport would cope with the prospect of losing their most marketable athletes. 
Federer, who turned 41 this week, has had multiple knee surgeries in the last two years and has not played a competitive match since going down in the quarter-finals of last year’s Wimbledon. 
The 20-time major winner has only committed to playing at his hometown tournament in Basel and the Laver Cup later this year and it remains unclear if the father of four would be ready to commit to the rigours of the tour again. 
At 36, Nadal is relatively younger but a chronic foot issue forced the Spaniard to contemplate retirement last year and in 2022 after he won a men’s record 22nd major title at the French Open, playing with numbing injection before each match in Paris. 
A radio frequency treatment eased pain in his foot and allowed him to play Wimbledon but the left-hander does not know whether the injury will flare up again. 
The 35-year-old Djokovic is the youngest among the lot and undoubtedly the fittest; and appears to be the best bet to keep the flag flying for tennis’ older generation. 
The Serbian won his 21st major title at Wimbledon last month and has made it clear that he does not lack motivation in chasing more silverware. 
While the so-called ‘Big Three’ of the men’s game have continued to stave off the younger generation when it comes to major success, Serena’s tennis career has been less productive in the past couple of years. 
Her last Grand Slam triumph came in 2017 and she has not won a WTA title since lifting the ASB Classic in Auckland at the start of the 2020 season. 
BIGGEST DRAW 
Despite all that, Serena has remained the biggest draw in women’s tennis whenever she takes the court. 
After suffering a torn right hamstring at Wimbledon last year, Serena was sidelined until playing doubles at Eastbourne in June and made a return at Wimbledon as a wild card, losing in the first round. 
On Monday, Serena competed in her first hardcourt match in 18 months, defeating Spain’s Nuria Parrizas Diaz to reach the second round of the WTA hardcourt event in Toronto, a tuneup for the US Open. It was her first singles victory since the 2021 French Open, 14 months ago. 
Serena is set to play next week at Cincinnati and compete at the US Open, where she won her first Grand Slam title in 1999 at age 17. 
“I have never liked the word retirement. It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me,” Serena wrote in Vogue. “I’ve been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people. 
“Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me. 
“Unfortunately I wasn’t ready to win Wimbledon this year. And I don’t know if I will be ready to win New York. But I’m going to try.” 
Serena, who made her professional debut in 1995 a year after her older sister Venus, revolutionised women’s tennis with a lethal mix of powerful serves, groundstrokes and superb athleticism and became the most successful player in the Open Era by collecting 23 Grand Slam titles. 
That success also inspired a generation of tennis players, including teen stars Coco Gauff and Emma Raducanu.. 
World number 11 Gauff, inspired to play tennis by Serena, said she was shocked to hear about the departure for an icon who can motivate another generation of superstars. 
“The legacy that she has left through her tennis career is something that I don’t think any other player can probably touch,” Gauff said after reaching the second round of the Toronto Open. “It is something that can inspire many more generations. “I grew up watching her -- that’s the reason why I play tennis.” 
Serena became an African American icon in a mostly white sport, just as Gauff is starting to do with two titles at age 19, and Gauff reminded fans that Serena is far from fading away even if her days in competitive tennis are nearing an end. 
“I mean, she’s not dead but people are talking about it like she’s dying,” Gauff said.  “She’s just moving onto different things.” 
Reigning US Open champion Raducanu admired how the speed, power and determination of Serena changed tennis. 
“She definitely changed the game,” Raducanu said. “To dominate that much, there has not really been someone who has dominated like her in the women’s game. She did change the game a lot in that respect.”

4,No Warner but Lynn signs up for new Emirati T20 league,ABU DHABI: Australian Chris Lynn will play Twenty20 cricket in the United Arab Emirates rather than his home Big ...,"ABU DHABI: Australian Chris Lynn will play Twenty20 cricket in the United Arab Emirates rather than his home Big Bash League (BBL) early next year, but David Warner was not included among the marquee players announced by the new International League T20 (ILT20).
Media reports had strongly linked Warner with a spot in the ILT20, which clashes with the Cricket Australia-owned BBL but is bankrolled in part by Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise owners and pays better.
In the event, Lynn was the only Australian on the list of 21 marquee players named late on Monday by the ILT20, in which up to 12 of the 18 members of each team squad can be from outside the country.
Bit-hitting Lynn, once one of the major stars of BBL but recently dropped by the Brisbane Heat for the next edition, will need the permission of Cricket Australia in the shape of a  “No Objection Certificate” to play in the UAE.
The proliferation of T20 leagues around the world, not least the new South African league backed by IPL cash which will also be played in January, has set the stage for an intense battle to get the best players on board.
Among the other marquee players announced by the ILT20 were England Internationals Moeen Ali, Dawid Malan and Chris Jordan as well as West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell and Afghan bowler Mujeeb Ur Rahman.
India’s governing BCCI forbids its players from taking part in T20 leagues outside the IPL, while Bangladesh hosts its own tournament in the new year and Pakistan has international matches over the period.
The ILT20 said it would announce more international players later in the week.
“The quality of the names announced today is outstanding and so is the interest in our league from top players from all around the world,” Mubashshir Usmani of Emirates Cricket said in a news release.
Australian batsman Usman Khawaja, who according to local media reports turned down an offer to play in the league, last month reiterated his view that the BBL needs to be privatised to compete in the newly crowded T20 marketplace.

PARIS: Two-time former champions Benfica will play Ukraine’s Dynamo Kyiv while Ruud van Nistelrooy’s PSV Eindhoven will face Glasgow Rangers after they all qualified for the final Champions League qualifying play-off round on Tuesday.
Luuk De Jong claimed an 109th-minute winner as PSV Eindhoven edged Monaco 3-2 in extra-time in the Netherlands, to go through 4-3 on aggregate. De Jong was adamant his side deserved the win.
“Monaco hit the bar and the post, I hit the target,” said the PSV captain.
Monaco had been awakened overnight when fireworks were set off outside their hotel, and there was a fiery atmosphere inside a packed stadium in a see-saw match.
Joey Veerman fired the Dutch ahead on 21 minutes with a sweet shot into the far corner but Guillermo Maripan then levelled clinically with a cool finish in a goalmouth scramble.
Monaco striker Wissam Ben Yedder then raced on to a sweeping through ball to smack home the go-ahead goal before PSV grabbed a late equaliser as Mexican Erick Gutierrez delivered PSV on 89 minutes.
Benfica beat Mitjylland 3-1 to win 7-2 on aggregate thanks largely to midfielder Enzo Fernandez and 20-year-old striker Henrique Araujo who scored before Pione Sisto responded for the Danes.
Argentinian Fernandez, 21, and Araujo were making just their second European appearances as Diogo Goncalves claimed the third goal for the 1961 and 1962 winners.
In Scotland Malik Tillman completed a turn around when he scored the decider with 11 minutes left as Rangers beat Union Saint-Gilloise 3-0.
The Belgian outfit had won the first leg 2-0 in their first appearance in European competition since 1964-65. Kostiantyn Vivcharenko and Viktor Tsygankov guided Dynamo Kiyv past Austrians Sturm Graz 3-1 over two ties with efforts in extra-time.
Dynamo were second in the Ukrainian Premier League when Russia invaded the country earlier this year.
Earlier, Moldovans Sheriff Tiraspol, who stunned Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu during last season’s group stages, were knocked out by Viktoria Plzen as the Czech outfit won 4-2 over two legs.
The first leg of the play-offs take place on Aug 16, 17 with the return fixtures a week later.

Werner, whose form over the past two years raised questions about whether he was the right striker for this year’s World Cup in Qatar, signed a four-year contract on Tuesday to return to Leipzig from Chelsea.
The 26-year-old spent the largest part of his senior career at RB Leipzig between 2016-20 and is the club’s all-time top scorer with 95 goals.
“I am very happy for the Bundesliga that Timo Wer­ner is coming back,” Flick said in a statement.  “With his qualities he is an enrichment for every league.”
“With Leipzig, where he matured into a international top striker, Timo will continue to test himself in the Champions League against the best players around,” Flick said.
Werner parted ways with Chelsea after two years at the Premier League club, where he lifted the Champions League trophy as well as the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup in 2021 but failed to hold down a starting spot.
He made 89 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 23 goals.
Werner hopes his return to Leipzig, who have qualified for the Champions league group stage this season, will provide him with the platform to rediscover his old form and get sufficient playing time to be in peak form at the World Cup.
“For me it was clear that Leipzig was a very good step,” Werner told a news conference on Wednesday.  “The transfer was the logical step to gain self-confidence.”

The record-breaking 30-year-old made the announcement just days after leading her all-conquering team to Commonwealth Games gold.
“After a busy couple of years I’ve made the decision to take a step back to enable me to spend time focusing on myself,” Lanning said in a statement.
“I’m grateful for the support of CA [Cricket Australia] and my team-mates and ask that my privacy is respected during this time.”
Commonwealth Games gold in Birmingham capped a hectic two-and-a-half-year string of successes for Australia and Lanning which included a World Cup triumph earlier this year.
“We’re proud of Meg for acknowledging that she needs a break and will continue to support her during this time,” CA women’s head of performance Shawn Flegler said.
“She’s been an incredible contributor to Australian cricket over the last decade, achieving remarkable feats both individually and as part of the team.
“The welfare of our players is always our number one priority and we’ll continue to work with Meg to ensure she gets the support and space she needs.”
Debuting at 18, Lanning’s skill with the bat shattered records from early on, holding the mark for the most centuries in women’s ODI cricket.
Becoming skipper at 21, she has led the side 171 times.
The loss of Lanning comes ahead of Australia’s T20 tour of India in December and after the departure of head coach Matthew Mott, who led the team for seven years.

News of the pending retirement of Serena Williams overshadowed proceedings at the tune-up for the year’s final Grand Slam but there were no shortage of first-round upsets for fans to enjoy, including one by local Bianca Andreescu. 
Twice US Open champion Osaka, in only her second tournament back from an Achilles injury, battled on gamely before retiring while trailing Kaia Kanepi 7-6 (7-4), 3-0. 
“I felt my back from the start of the match, and despite trying my best to push through it, I just wasn’t able to today,” said Osaka. 
Toronto-born Raducanu conceded a tight first set to Camila Giorgi but looked on course to level up the contest when she took a 2-0 lead in the second. 
The Italian defending champion stormed back to rattle off the last six games with a mix of solid returns, net play and movement, however, easing into the second round 7-6 (7-0), 6-2. 
Andreescu later delighted a packed house with a 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 victory over Daria Kasatkina in an evening match. 
There were also first-round wins for 10th seed Coco Gauff, China’s Zheng Qinwen, Belgian Elise Mertens, Spain’s Sara Sorribes Tormo and Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic. 
Greek third seed Maria Sakkari stamped out any chance of another upset in the final match of the day, fighting off a comeback from 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens to take a 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 victory in a second round tie. 
KYRGIOS WINS
At the ATP Montreal Masters on Tuesday, Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios let an early lead slip but regrouped for a 6-4, 6-4 first-round victory over Sebastian Baez. 
World number 37 Kyrgios, a title winner last week in Washington, next faces world number one Daniil Medvedev, who won last week’s Los Cabos crown. 
The day was a disaster for Britain’s Andy Murray as the treble Grand Slam winner was cut off in the first round, a 6-1, 6-3 victim of Taylor Fritz. 
Next up for Fritz is a meeting with countryman Frances Tiafoe after he battled back from a set down to see off Benjamin Bonzi 6-7 (6-8). 7-5, 6-3. 
Earlier, fellow Aussie Alex De Minaur finished off a match delayed from Monday by rain, winning four of the only five points remaining to add to the misery of Canadian Denis Shapovalov 7-5, 7-6 (7-4). 
In other first-round action, Frenchman Gael Monfils returned to the ATP Tour after a three-month break with a 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 6-2 win over Pedro Martinez and will next face American Maxime Cressy, who was a 6-4 6-4 winner over Aslan Karatsev. 
Matteo Berrettini’s comeback from the Covid-19 positive test which forced him to quit Wimbledon stalled out, with the Italian losing 6-3, 6-2 to Paolo Carreno Busta in the opening round. 
Alex de Minaur, Dan Evans, Marin Cilic, Tommy Paul and Grigor Dimitrov were among other first-round winners on Tuesday.

Marseille said the forward, with 143 caps for Chile, had signed a deal at the Velodrome after passing a medical. A club official told AFP he had agreed a one-year contract.
Sanchez, 33, recently terminated his contract with Inter and arrived at Marseille airport late on Tuesday to be met by several hundred adoring supporters.
His arrival is a major boost for Marseille ahead of their return to the Champions League.
They qualified for this season’s group stage after finishing as runners-up in Ligue 1 but then saw coach Jorge Sampaoli — who used to coach Chile — depart with ex-Croatia defender Igor Tudor replacing him.
Marseille will be Sanchez’s sixth club in Europe after Udinese, Barcelona, Arsenal, Manchester United and Inter.
He spent three years at Inter, helping them win the Serie A title in 2021. However, Sanchez started just nine games at San Siro last season.

“I stood in so many games with him. He was not only very good as an umpire but also an excellent colleague, always very cooperative on field and also always willing to help off the field.
Because of the way he was, he was also well-respected by players.”  Koertzen died while driving from Cape Town to Despatch in Eastern Cape, where he lived with his family.
Koertzen still umpired occasionally in amateur cricket in his hometown of Despatch in South Africa’s Eastern Cape.

George Dockrell struck the match-clinching boundary off the penultimate ball as Ireland, chasing 169, finished on 171-3.
The result was Ireland’s first win in any form of international cricket this season, with the side also having suffered three one-day defeats.
Ireland openers Paul Stirling (31 off 29 balls) and captain Andrew Balbirnie (51 off 38) got the hosts’ chase off to a good start with a stand of 61 in 7.3 overs at Stormont.
Wicket-keeper Lorcan Tucker maintained the momentum with 50 off 32 balls before Harry Tector (25 not out) and Dockrell (10 not out) gave Ireland a much-needed success.
Earlier, spinner Dockrell took 2-7 and paceman Barry McCarthy 3-34, with opener Usman Ghani top-scoring with 59, including six fours and two sixes for Afghanistan.
The tourists’ total of 168-7 was bolstered by 30 runs off the final two overs, with Ibrahim Zadran hitting an unbeaten 29 off 18 balls.
The teams will return to Stormont on Thursday for the second of a five-match series.

NAIROBI: The Confederation of African Football (CAF) launched a new club Super League concept on Wednesday which they claim will usher in a new era of prosperity for football on the continent, but final details over its structure and funding have yet to be confirmed.
The plan will see 24 as yet unnamed clubs from 16 countries compete in the pan-African competition that is targeted to start in August 2023, and which has been described by CAF president Patrice Motsepe as the  “most fundamental intervention to the significant improvement of the quality of football in Africa”.
The competition will have $100-million in prize money with $11.6 million for the winner. One of the spin-offs will be a solidarity fund that will see each of the 54 member associations of CAF receive $1-million per year towards football development.
Motsepe said CAF will use some of the 50 million dollars from the Super League  to make football attractive and ensure the best players remain in  Africa and improve the quality of the sport on the continent which has  lacked behind other continents. 
“The African Super League represents the very best on the continent and we have seen a big appetite from investors to be involved in this project,” Motsepe said in a news conference at the organisation’s General Assembly in Arusha.
“The intention is for kick-off in August 2023, and over the next few months there will be a process of engagement with various stakeholders.
“We will also explain to domestic competitions how this will affect their fixtures. At the end of the day, the future of club football is based on commercial competitiveness. The face of African football will never be the same again.”  Motsepe was flanked by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who had first mooted the concept at a CAF seminar in February 2020.
“There is a huge will to invest in a project like this, which will give a new visibility to African football,” Infantino said on Wednesday.
“The growth of African club and national team football contributes to the growth of world football. The competition will benefit each and every country, not just with the solidarity payment, but the exposure for African football.”  The Super League will play a pool competition first, divided into three groups of eight clubs, before the majority of teams move onto an American-style playoff system, including wild card berths.
CAF will continue with their club showpiece Champions League but officials said there were plans to revert back to a two-legged knockout competition, dispensing with the group phase.
Not everyone is excited about the Super League with Cape Town City FC owner John Comitis calling it a  “super silly idea”. “The Super League will kill African club football,” he warned. 
“You can switch off the lights on the domestic leagues.”
It follows a failed attempt by 12 European clubs to form a Super League in April last year, which was ditched, for now, after it received significant backlash from fans.

14,FIFA looking to bring forward World Cup start by one day,The original plan was for the opening ceremony to be held before Qatar’s game on Nov 21 against Ecuador.,"DOHA: The World Cup in Qatar could kick-off one day earlier than scheduled with FIFA looking at a plan to hold the opening ceremony and the host nation’s first match on Sunday Nov 20th, just over three months before the competition gets underway. 
News agencies Reuters, AFP and The Associated Press all cited sources close to the discussions on Wednesday as saying that Qatar will now play Ecuador 24 hours earlier than planned, in a move that FIFA’s ruling bureau comprised of president Gianni Infantino and the heads of the six continental football bodies was expected to confirm soon. 
The original plan was for the opening ceremony to be held before Qatar’s game on Nov 21 against Ecuador — which created the unusual situation of two matches being held before the ceremony. 
Normally the ceremony is conducted before the kick-off of the first game of the tournament. 
The Group ‘A’ match between Senegal and the Netherlands and the Group ‘B’ match between England and Iran were scheduled to take place before the ceremony on the Monday. The match schedule was finalised after the draw was made in Doha on April 1. 
The proposal to create a 29-day tournament instead of the long-planned 28 has been favoured by Qatari officials and South American football body CONMEBOL, with talks also involving the Qatar and Ecuador football federations. 
“There were discussions and agreement between the two respective teams and there was a request from CONMEBOL,” one World Cup source told AFP. “We wanted to follow the tradition that either the reigning champions or the host country be involved in the opening match.” 
FIFA and the Qatari organising committee declined to comment on the change to the mega event that ends on December 18. 
The switch to a Nov 20 opening ceremony and game would allow the Senegal-Netherlands match, scheduled for 1300 local time on Nov 21, to kick off later in the day. “It is a better slot for both teams for television and other areas,” said the source. 
The Group ‘B’ matches on that day, which also include the United States v Wales, would be unaffected. 
Another source close to the proposal said the switch could be confirmed as early as Thursday and that the plan was to ensure that fans did not have to pay for any changes to flights or accommodation. 
“The financial impact to fans has been assessed and that any additional costs to fans will be absorbed by organisers, but it is unclear who will bear these costs, whether it is FIFA, Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy or another entity,” the source told Reuters. 
“There will be an assurance from organisers that any additional costs for fans to change travel bookings or accommodation won’t be borne by them and this will be assessed on a case-by case basis,” the source added. 
It was not clear what the mechanism will be to manage any compensation for fans. 
Companies with major deals linked to the World Cup expressed confidence that the unusual schedule change could be handled smoothly. 
“It is something we will deal with,” said Jaime Byrom, chairman of Match Hospitality, which has a deal with FIFA to organise hospitality packages for World Cup matches and has locked in 450,000 tickets for the tournament. 
“It is really not — compared to the other challenges that we could have faced or have faced in the past — a particularly large problem,” Byrom told AFP. 
“We have to focus on those customers who are most affected and I guess in this case we will be looking at our Ecuadorian customers who are travelling from overseas, and making sure that they are on time for the match.” 
A Sunday start for the World Cup had been ruled out several years ago when a shorter, 28-day schedule requiring four games each day during the group stage was agreed to by FIFA after talks with influential leagues in Europe which will play club games through Nov 13. 
However, a Qatar-Ecuador game involves few players who are with European clubs and would give the host nation an exclusive day to open its tournament. 
The opening match is scheduled to be held at the 60,000-capacity Al Bayt stadium, one of seven new venues purpose-built for the tournament since Qatar was controversially awarded the World Cup in 2010. 
The wealthy Gulf state is preparing a spectacular opening ceremony in the stadium, whose structure was inspired by traditional Arab tents. 
Moving forward the opening match will also mean changing the 100-day countdown that had been scheduled to start on Saturday, with special events across the tiny nation of 2.8 million people. 
The 2022 World Cup is the first in the tournament’s 92-year history to be played outside of the traditional northern hemisphere summer. The previous 21 editions were all played between late-May and the end of July. 
FIFA finalised a decision in 2015 to avoid the searing heat in Qatar’s summer and move to November and December, despite opposition from most of European football unhappy at shutting down their domestic leagues for several peak weeks. 
The Nov 21-Dec 18 tournament schedule was agreed to so that European clubs could play on the Nov 12-13 weekend before releasing their players to the 32 World Cup teams. 
The final will be played on a Sunday that is Qatar’s National Day, allowing a full week for players to return to clubs before the Premier League plays its traditional Boxing Day games on Dec 26.
