• Ukraine accuses Russia of using N-plant as shield
• China calls US ‘main instigator’ of crisis
• 13 killed in rocket attacks 
KYIV/BERLIN: As Ukr­aine on Wedn­esday accused Russia of exploiting its position in a nuclear power plant it had seized to target a nearby town in rocket attacks that killed at least 13 people, foreign ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) nations called on Russia to immediately hand back full control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to Ukraine.
China has meanwhile called the United States the “main instigator” of the Ukraine crisis.
The town Marhanets that Ukraine claims was targeted is the one that Russia has alleged Ukrainian forces have used in the past to shell the Russian forces, holed up at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that they took over in March. There was no immediate comment from Russia on the Ukrainian allegations of a rocket attack on Marh­anets and Reuters could not independently verify the allegations.
Putting their weight beh­i­nd the Ukraine’s claim, the foreign ministers of G7 nat­ions said in a statement relea­sed in Germany dema­nded “Russia immediately hand back full control to its rightful sovereign owner, Ukraine, of the Zaporiz­hzhia nuclear power plant as well as of all nuclear facilities within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders to ensure their safe and secure operations.”
Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has urged both sides to exercise restraint, warning of the “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”.
Moscow says it does not deliberately target civilians in what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine aimed at preemptively safeguarding its own security against expansion of the Nato military alliance.
80 rockets fired
Andriy Yermak, Presi­dent Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, accused Russia of launching attacks on Ukrainian towns with impunity from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the knowledge that it was risky for Ukraine to fight back. “Eighty reactive rockets fired at residential buildings,” Yermak wrote on the Telegram messaging service, referring to the attack on Marhanets.
Ukraine, which accuses Moscow of waging an unpr­ovoked imperial-style war of aggression, says around 500 Russian troops with heavy vehicles and weapons are stationed at the plant, where Ukrainian tech­n­icians continue to work.
Russia says its forces are behaving responsibly and doing everything they can to ensure the facility’s safety. Moscow has accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the plant, something Kyiv denies.
Valentyn Reznychenko, governor of Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, said the Russian attack on Marhanets was carried out with 80 Grad rockets, damaging more than 20 buildings in the town, which is located on the other side of the Dnipro River from the power plant.
The same attack damaged a power line, leaving several thousand people without electricity, he added. A hostel, two schools, a concert hall, the main council building and other administrative buildings had been hit too, he said.
Crimean air base attack
Also, the origin of a series of explosions at a Russian air base in Russian-annexed Crimea a day earlier remained contested, with Moscow saying ammunition stores had detonated and Ukrainian officials hinting Kyiv may have been responsible.
Two US newspapers cited unnamed Ukra­inian officials as saying that Ukrai­nian special forces had carried out an attack on the air base, which had resulted in the destruction of Russian military aircraft there.
Zelenskiy did not dire­ctly mention the blasts in his daily video address late Tuesday but said it was right that people were focusing on Crimea. “We will never give it up ... the Black Sea region cannot be safe while Crimea is occupied,” he said, repeating his government’s position that Crimea would have to one day be returned to Ukraine.
US ‘main instigator”
Meanwhile, China, which Russia has sought as an ally since its invasion of Ukraine, has called the United States the “main instigator” of the crisis.
In an interview with the Russian state news agency TASS published on Wedn­esday, China’s ambassador to Moscow, Zhang Han­hui, accused Washi­ngton of backing Russia into a corner with repeated expansions of the Nato defence alliance and support for forces seeking to align Ukraine with the European Union rather than Moscow.
“As the initiator and main instigator of the Ukrainian crisis, Washi­ngton, while imposing unprecedented comprehensive sanctions on Russia, continues to supply arms and military equipment to Ukraine,” Zhang was quoted as saying.
“Their ultimate goal is to exhaust and crush Russia with a protracted war and the cudgel of sanctions.”

1,Trump ‘pleads the Fifth’ in civil probe,Former US president declines o answer questions under oath in New York over alleged fraud at his family business.,"NEW YORK: Donald Trump on Wednesday decl­ined to answer questions under oath in New York over alleged fraud at his family business, as legal pressures pile on the former president whose house was raided by the FBI just two days ago.
Trump said he had “no choice” but to invoke the fifth amendment — which allows individuals to remain silent under questioning to protect against self-incrimination — during a deposition at the New York attorney general’s office.
In a statement apparently issued after the deposition began, Trump said: “I decli­ned to answer the questions under the rights and privileges afforded to every citizen under the United States Constitution,” adding he took the advice from his legal counsel.
“I once asked, ‘If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?’ Now I know the answer to that question,” he continued.
“When your family, your company, and all the people in your orbit have become the targets of an unfounded, politically motivated Witch Hunt supported by lawyers, prosecutors, and the Fake News Media, you have no choice.”
The deposition follows an extraordinary Federal Bur­eau of Investigation search earlier this week on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, signaling an escalation of legal probes into the 45th president.
Trump took aim at the search in his statement on Wed­n­esday, saying, “The current Administration and many prosecutors in this Country have lost all moral and ethical bounds of dece­ncy”. He arrived early on Wednesday in a convoy of cars guarded by the secret service at the offices of New York Attorney General Leti­tia James, whose investigation is one of several active probes into the brash billionaire’s business practices and other actions.
James suspects the Trump Organisation of fraudulently overstated the value of real estate properties when apply­ing for bank loans, while understating them with tax authorities to pay less in taxes.
If James, a Democrat, finds any evidence of financial misconduct, she can sue the Trump Organisation for damages but cannot file criminal charges, as it is a civil investigation.
The Manhattan district attorney’s office, meanwhile, is running a parallel probe into the Trump Organisation that does have the potential for criminal charges. That investigation could be a reason Trump’s legal team advised him to remain silent, as his deposition could energise the case.

2,Search for militants in Swat’s mountains continues,The militants had opened fire at a police party two days ago in the mountainous area bordering Swat and Dir districts.,"SWAT/LOWER DIR: Swat police on Wednesday said that a search operation was being conducted in different areas to arrest the militants who opened fire at a police party two days ago in the mountainous area bordering Swat and Dir districts.
According to a statement issued by District Police Office, a search operation was being conducted on Monday in the mountains of Matta tehsil’s Balasoor area, which borders Swat and Dir districts, when some miscreants opened fire on police. The operation was started after militants were spotted in the mountains of Kanala and Balasoor areas.
Matta Circle DSP Pir Syed Khan was injured in the firing, while the militants escaped when the police opened retaliatory fire, the statement added.
Following the incident, the district police, counterterrorism department and Elite Force reached the spot and extended the search operation to adjoining areas.
The injured DSP was rushed to Saidu Sharif Hospital, where he remains under treatment, the statement added.
Swat police spokesperson Moin Fayaz also confirmed that operations were being conducted in the mountains of Kabal and Khwazkhela tehsils.
A video being circulated on social media purportedly shows a man — claiming to be a Taliban militant — interviewing DSP Khan and two officers, who as per unverified claims, belonged to Pakistan Army.
The video also claimed that the three individuals were held captive by Taliban militants.
Similarly, a recorded telephone call, allegedly between a Taliban militant and a journalist, was also making rounds on social media, in which the militant could be heard saying that they [Taliban militants] have made a DSP and two army officers hostages and would not free them until a jirga meets them.
Dawn was unable to independently verify both claims.
According to unofficial sources, all three captives were later released after successful negotiations with jirga members. However, the administration and police were still tight-lipped about any hostages taken by the militants.

4,FO denounces Indian move to distort history,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wedne­sday strongly deno­un­ced the Indian governme­nt’s “mischievous move” of...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wedne­sday strongly deno­un­ced the Indian governme­nt’s “mischievous move” of obser­ving “Part­ition Horrors Rem­e­mbrance Day” on Aug 14.
In a statement, the Foreign Office called the move “depl­orable” and “part of the BJP government’s divisive political agenda”.
This is a wanton attempt to play with sentiments of people through distorted interpretation of history, the statement added.
“True to its characteristic revisionist agenda, the BJP-RSS-led dispensation has again sought to hypocritically and one-sidedly invoke the tragic events and mass migration that occurred in the wake of Independence in 1947.”
The FO added that if the Indian leaders genuinely cared about the pain and suffering, they should work to improve the conditions of Muslims and other minorities in India.
“Today’s India was an undeclared Hindu Rashtra that has no place or tolerance for other religious minorities, especially Muslims who faced discrimination, persecution and political and socioeconomic exclusion,” it said.
The FO advised the Indian government to “desist from politicising the events of Independence” and honour the memories of those who sacrificed their lives.
Last year, Indian Prime Minister Nar­e­ndra Modi had announced to observe Aug 14 as Partition Horrors Reme­mbrance Day from 2022.

5,"Despite truce, Israeli forces kill commander, three other Palestinians",16 children among 44 Palestinians killed in conflict prior to truce.,"

NABLUS (West Bank): Despite the truce, Israeli security forces on Wedn­esday killed a Palestinian commander and another fighter in a gunbattle in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, the military said, triggering further clashes in which Palestinians said two teens were killed in separate incidents.
Israeli forces surrounded the house of Ibrahim al-Nabulsi, a senior commander of Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades militant group long on Israel’s wanted list.
The shootout, in the northern West Bank city of Nablus, was the deadliest incident in the West Bank since Israel and the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad ended three days of fighting in Gaza, the worst in more than a year.
Palestinian officials said at least 44 Palestinians, half of them civilians, were killed during three days of Israeli strikes on Gaza, which ended with an Aug 7 truce between Israel and Islamic Jihad.

16 children among 44 Palestinians killed in conflict prior to truce

Al-Nabulsi was a member of the recently formed “Nablus Brigade”, a Palesti­nian militant alliance in the city which also includes Islamic Jihad’s militants. Hours after the shootout, tens of thousands attended his funeral and called for revenge.
Al-Nabulsi, barricaded inside, refused to surrender and was killed along with another militant during a gunbattle with Israeli forces, who also used shoulder-fired missiles in the fighting, the Israeli military claimed.
The gunbattle was followed by clashes during which the military said its troops responded with live fire against Palestinians throwing rocks and explosives at soldiers.
Islamic Jihad said a 16-year-old was killed while participating in a confrontation with Israeli troops.
In the West Bank city of Hebron, Palestinian health officials said a 17-year-old succumbed to his wounds after Israel shot him with live fire.
The military said it responded to a “violent riot” in the area and “a hit was identified”. Palestinian health officials confirmed the four deaths and said 40 more people were injured in total. There were no reports of Israeli casualties.
16 children killed
The latest conflict between Israel and Islamic Jihad militants has left 16 children dead. One of them was five-year-old Ala who was the first to be killed in the three days of intense fighting.
“It was a Friday like any other,” said Rasha Qadoom, 27, the mother of Ala, clutching tight the tiny pink rucksack belonging to her five-year-old daughter.
She said Alaa had been dressed in a pink T-shirt to match her pink bag with a pink ribbon tied in her hair.
“She was happy, she wanted to go to the park with her aunt.” But as she went to her aunt on Friday afternoon, Israel launched an intense “pre-emptive” bombardment of militant positions.
Alaa was knocking on the door of her aunt’s home when a missile smashed down from the sky.
Later that day — hours after Alaa was killed — militants began firing barrages of rockets in retaliation. The violence raged until a tenuous truce came into force on Sunday.
The Israeli army claimed it “only strikes military targets” and that Alaa’s father Abdullah, who was wounded in the strike, was a high-ranking member of Islamic Jihad.
“Unfortunately, according to reports received following this strike, his daughter who was in his presence during the strike was hurt,” the Israeli army said in a statement.
