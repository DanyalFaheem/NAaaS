The sprawling camps house nearly one million Rohingya refugees that fled to Bangladesh after a military offensive in neighbouring Myanmar five years ago.
Police spokesman Kamran Hossain said at least eight suspected Rohingya assailants shot Syed Hossain, 40, and Abu Taleb, 35, at around midnight.
“Both were rushed to hospitals where they were declared dead,” he said, adding that a manhunt was launched and security stepped up in the camps. Police have not named any suspects.
Rohingya sources said that the insurgent Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which operates both in Myanmar’s western Rakhine state and in the Bangladesh camps, was behind the shootings.
In the last three months, ARSA has been blamed for at least five killings including three senior Rohingya leaders, two Rohingya sources said.

1,Former Twitter employee found guilty of spying for Saudi royals,SAN FRANCISCO: A former Twitter worker was found guilty of spying for Saudi officials keen to unmask critics on the...,"SAN FRANCISCO: A former Twitter worker was found guilty of spying for Saudi officials keen to unmask critics on the platform. 
Ahmad Abouammo was pronounced on Tuesday guilty on criminal counts including money laundering, fraud, and being an illegal agent of a foreign government, according to a copy of the verdict.
Prosecutors in federal court in San Francisco told jurors that Abouammo sold Twitter user information for cash and an expensive watch some seven years ago.
His defence team contended that he did nothing more than accept gifts from free-spending Saudis for simply doing his client management job.
“The evidence shows that, for a price and thinking no one was watching, the defendant sold his position to an insider of the crown prince,” US prosecutor Colin Sampson said in final remarks to the jury.
Defence attorney Angela Chuang countered that while there certainly appeared to be a conspiracy to get revealing information about Saudi critics from Twitter, prosecutors failed to prove Abouammo was part of it.
Abouammo quit Twitter in 2015 and took a job at e-commerce titan Amazon in Seattle, where he lives, according to court documents.
Jurors deliberated for three days before finding Abouammo guilty on six of the 11 charges against him.
Chuang conceded to the jury that Abouammo did violate Twitter employee rules by not telling the San Francisco-based company that he had received $100,000 in cash and a watch valued at more than $40,000 from someone close to the Saudi crown prince.
However, she downplayed the significance of the gift, saying it amounted to “pocket change” in Saudi culture known for generosity and lavish presents.

2,TV journalist faces jail for speaking out against Putin,"Marina Ovsya­nnikova now faces up to 10 years in prison, if convicted.","

Marina Ovsyannikova.

 
MOSCOW: Russian investigators on Wednesday laun­ched a criminal probe against Marina Ovsya­nnikova, who denounced President Vlad­imir Putin’s attack on Ukraine on live TV, and detained the journalist, her lawyer said.
In mid-July, Ovsyannikova staged a one-woman protest near the Kremlin, holding a poster that read  “Putin is a murderer, his soldiers are fascists.” 
Three  “blood-soaked” toy dolls were laid on the ground in front of her. She now faces up to 10 years in prison, if convicted.
“A criminal case has been launched,” lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said, adding they were waiting for investigators to decide on a pre-trial measure for the 44-year-old.
Ovsyannikova has been charged with spreading information about the Russian armed forces deemed false by the government and will spend the night in pre-trial detention, said Zakhvatov.
In an interview last week, Ovsyannikova had expressed hope that the authorities would not place her in pre-trial detention because she has two children. Writing on messaging app Telegram earlier in the day, Ovsyannikova said that 10 members of law enforcement had raided her home at 6am. “They scared my young daughter,” she added.
In March, Ovsyannikova, then an editor at Channel One television, shot to prominence when she barged onto the set of its flagship Vremya (Time) evening news, holding a poster reading  “No War” in English.
Criticism of Putin’s decision to send troops to Ukraine has been virtually outlawed in Russia, and her protest made headlines around the world.
French President Emm­anuel Macron has offered Ovsyannikova, who worked for Russian state TV for 19 years, asylum or other forms of consular protection.
Putin launched the attack on Ukraine after a historic crackdown on the opposition, with top Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny in prison and his political organisations outlawed. Authorities are now seeking to snuff out the last vestiges of dissent, and nearly all well-known activists are now in jail or out of the country.
Earlier this year prominent Putin critics Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza were put in pre-trial jail for denouncing Moscow’s Ukraine offensive.
The criminal probe against Ovsyannikova was launched after two Moscow courts ordered the journalist to pay fines for discrediting the Russian army on various occasions.
Writing on Telegram on Wednesday, she said that more than 350 children had already died in Ukraine. “How many children have to die before you stop?” she added.
In the months following her TV protest, Ovsya­nnikova spent time abroad, working for Germany’s Die Welt for three months.
In early July, she announced that she was returning to Russia to settle a dispute over the custody of her two children.

3,Arson suspected as huge French wildfire reignites,"More than 6,000 hectares of tinder-dry forest have burned in just 24 hours in the so-called Landiras blaze.","LANDIRAS: A wildfire that officials thought was under control in southwest France has reignited amid a record drought and extreme heat, possibly the result of arson, officials said on Wednesday.
More than 6,000 hectares (15,000 acres) of tinder-dry forest have burned in just 24 hours in the so-called Landiras blaze, the largest of several that scorched the region last month.
It had been brought under control — but not fully extinguished — after burning nearly 14,000 hectares, before flaring up on Tuesday, forcing the evacuation of some 6,000 people.
No one has been injured but 16 homes were destroyed or damaged near the village of Belin-Beliet, and officials said six fire-
fighting trucks had burned. “The risks are very high” that parched conditions will allow the fire to spread further, said Martin Guespereau, prefect of the Gironde department.
“The weather is very unfavourable because of the heat, the dry air, the record drought and the fact that there is a lot of peat in the ground... the fire didn’t go out in July, it went underground,” he told journalists.
Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said more than 1,000 firefighters were now battling the blaze, adding that investigators suspected arson may be involved.
“There were eight fires that erupted between 8and 9am that erupted at intervals of a few hundred metres, which is extremely unusual,” he said in Mostuejouls, north of the Mediterranean city of Montpellier, where another fire was raging in the Grands Causses natural park. He also told reporters that Sweden and Italy would send fire-fighting aircraft to France within 24 hours to help.

4,Rainwater unsafe to drink due to chemicals: study,STOCKHOLM: Rainwater everywhere on the planet is unsafe to drink due to levels of toxic chemicals known as PFAS that...,"STOCKHOLM: Rainwater everywhere on the planet is unsafe to drink due to levels of toxic chemicals known as PFAS that exceed the latest guidelines, according to a new study by Stockholm University scientists.
Commonly known as ‘forever chemicals’ because they disintegrate extremely slowly, PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) were initially found in packaging, shampoo or makeup but have spread to our entire environment, including water and air.
“There is nowhere on Earth where the rain would be safe to drink, according to the measurements that we have taken,” Ian Cousins, a professor at the university and the lead author of the study published in Environmental Science and Technology, said.
A compilation of the data since 2010 that his team studied showed that  “even in Antarctica or the Tibetan plateau, the levels in the rainwater are above the drinking water guidelines that the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) proposed”, he said.
Normally considered pristine, the two regions still have PFAS levels  “14 times higher” than the US drinking water guidelines.
The EPA recently lowered its PFAS guidelines significantly after discovering that the chemicals may affect the immune response in children to vaccines, Cousins noted.
Once ingested, PFAS accumulate in the body.
According to some studies, exposure can also lead to problems with fertility, developmental delays in children, increased risks of obesity or certain cancers (prostate, kidney and testicular), an increase in cholesterol levels.
Planet ‘irreversibly contaminated’ Cousins said PFAS were now  “so persistent” and ubiquitous that they will never disappear from the planet.
“We have made the planet inhospitable to human life by irreversibly contaminating it now so that nothing is clean anymore. And to the point that’s it’s not clean enough to be safe”, he said.
“We have crossed a planetary boundary”, he said, referring to a central paradigm for evaluating Earth’s capacity to absorb the impact of human activity.
However, Cousins noted that PFAS levels in people have actually dropped  “quite significantly in the last 20 years” and  “ambient levels (of PFAS in the environment) have been the same for the past 20 years”.
“What’s changed is the guidelines. They’ve gone down millions of times since the early 2000s, because we’ve learned more about the toxicity of these substances.” Cousins said we have to learn to live with it.
“I’m not super concerned about the everyday exposure in mountain or stream water or in the food. We can’t escape it... we’re just going to have to live with it.”  “But it’s not a great situation to be in, where we’ve contaminated the environment to the point where background exposure is not really safe.”

TikTok has “emerged as a top social media platform for US teens” while Google-run YouTube “stands out as the most common platform used by teens”, the report’s authors wrote. 
Pew’s data comes as Facebook-owner Meta is in a battle with TikTok for social media primacy, trying to keep the maximum number of users as part of its multi-billion dollar ad-driven business. 
The report said some 95 percent of the teens surveyed said they use YouTube, compared with 67 percent saying they are TikTok users. 
Just 32 percent of teens surveyed said they log on to Facebook — a big drop from the 71 percent who reported being users during a similar survey seven years ago. 
Once the place to be online, Facebook is now seen as a venue for older folks, with the young drawn to social networks where people express themselves with pictures and video snippets. 
About 62 percent of the teens said they use Instagram, owned by Facebook-parent Meta, while 59 percent said they used Snapchat, researchers stated. 
“A quarter of teens who use Snapchat or TikTok say they use these apps almost constantly, and a fifth of teen YouTube users say the same,” the report said.

6,Taliban torn over reforms one year after seizing power,Some cracks are opening within their ranks over the crucial question of just how much reform their leaders can tolerate.,"KANDAHAR: One year on from the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan, some cracks are opening within their ranks over the crucial question of just how much reform their leaders can tolerate.
Infamous during their first reign for their brutal crackdowns on rights and freedoms, the Islamists vowed to rule differently this time. On a superficial level at least, they appear to have changed in some respects.
Officials in Kabul have embraced technology, while cricket matches are cheered in full stadiums. Televisions were banned under the Taliban government’s first incarnation, while Afghans now have access to the internet and social media.
Girls are allowed to attend primary school and women journalists are interviewing government officials — unthinkable during the Taliban’s first stint in power in the 1990s.
The group’s hardline core, composed of battle-hardened veteran fighters, is against any significant ideological change that could be viewed as a sign of capitulation to their enemies in the West.
“You have one (Taliban) camp, which is pushing ahead with what they’re seeing as reforms, and another camp that seems to think even these meagre reforms are too much,” said Ibraheem Bahiss, an Afghanistan analyst with International Crisis Group.
The United States and its allies — which had bankrolled Afghanistan for 20 years — have locked the country out of the global banking system and billions in frozen assets abroad, as they hold out for reforms from the Taliban.
Without significant progress, it is the Afghan people who suffer as the country reels under a massive economic crisis that has seen some families choose between selling their organs or their infant daughters.
‘Retrograde dogmatic views’
On whether the Taliban are even capable of reform, analysts are wary that recent policy changes amount to little more than  “tokenism”.
“There are some cases where we could point to an evolution in policy, but let’s be very clear... We’re still looking at an organisation that has refused to move beyond very retrograde, dogmatic views,” said Michael Kugelman, an Afghanistan specialist with the Washington-based Wilson Center think tank.
Most secondary schools for girls remain closed. Many women have been forced out of government work, while many fear venturing out and being chastised by the Taliban.

7,Chinese court rejects appeal in landmark #MeToo case,Zhou Xiaoxuan stepped forward in 2018 to accuse popular state TV host Zhu Jun of forcibly kissing and groping her in 2014.,"BEIJING: A Chinese court rejected an appeal in a landmark sexual harassment case on Wednesday, dealing a blow to the country’s fledgling #MeToo movement.
Zhou Xiaoxuan stepped forward in 2018 to accuse popular state TV host Zhu Jun of forcibly kissing and groping her during her 2014 internship at the broadcaster.
Zhou’s case inspired many others to share their experiences of sexual assault publicly and sparked a social media storm. A Beijing court rejected her appeal on Wednesday, citing insufficient evidence.
Zhou’s case was rejected last year on similar grounds, prompting her to appeal.
But the court said it had  “rejected all the appeal requests by Zhou and will uphold the previous judgment”. Police cordoned off long stretches of pavement outside the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People’s Court ahead of her arrival this morning, with officers logging the details of passers-by.
“I still feel a little scared and dejected,” she said ahead of her appeal this morning.
“The process of the first trial was a deep secondary injury.” Zhou, 29, said before returning to court that her legal team would focus on getting access to more evidence, such as police transcripts of interviews with her parents after she reported the incident — which were not included in the earlier trial — and surveillance footage.
Zhou said Zhu was absent from earlier proceedings, and that while he had sued her for defamation, she was not aware of further developments in that case.
A small group of supporters came to wish Zhou luck on Wednesday, holding up signs that said  “#MeToo” and balloons spelling out  “All the best” in Chinese.

8,US claims uncovering Iranian ‘plot’ to kill Bolton,"US says 45-year-old Shahram Poursafi offered to pay an individual in the US $300,000 to kill former White House NSA John Bolton.","

Shahram Poursafi.—Reuters

 
WASHINGTON: The US Justice Department said on Wedn­esday it had uncovered an Iranian plot to kill former White House National Security Advisor John Bolton, and announced charges against a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
The Justice Department said 45-year-old Shahram Poursafi, also known as Mehdi Rezayi, had offered to pay an individual in the United States $300,000 to kill Bolton, the former US ambassador to the United Nations.
The Justice Department said that plan was likely set in retaliation for the US killing of top Guard commander Qassem Solei­mani in Iraq in January 2020.
The allegation came as Iran weighs a proposed agreement in Vienna talks to revive the 2015 agreement that aims to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons.
For months Tehran has held up the deal, demanding that the United States remove its official designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a sponsor of terrorism.
“This is not the first time we have uncovered Iranian plots to exact revenge against individuals on US soil and we will work tirelessly to expose and disrupt every one of these efforts,” said US Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen.
According to the charges, Poursafi tried to arrange Bolton’s murder beginning in October 2021, when he contacted online an unidentified person in the United States, first saying he wanted to commission photographs of Bolton.
That person passed the Iranian onto another contact, who Poursafi then asked to kill Bolton. He offered $250,000, which was then negotiated up to $300,000.
“Poursafi added that he had an additional ‘job,’ for which he would pay $1 million,” the Justice Department said. But that second person, court documents say, was a confidential source for the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The ostensible assassin stalled, waiting for an initial payment, but only in late April did Poursafi send money, paying a total of $100 in cryptocurrency.
Poursafi was charged with the use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire, which brings up to 10 years in prison, and with providing and attempting to provide material support to a transnational murder plot, which carries a 15-year sentence.
Bolton, one of the leading  “hawks” of the US foreign policy establishment and a strong critic of Iran, was national security advisor in the White House of president Donald Trump from April 2018 to September 2019.
In the administration of president George Bush, he was ambassador to the United Nations from 2005-2006.
He was strongly opposed to the 2015 agreement between Tehran and major powers to limit its nuclear program, and supported the Trump administration’s unilateral pullout from the pact in May 2018.
The court documents indicated Bolton was aware of the plot and cooperated with investigators, allowing photographs of himself outside his Washington office to be sent to Poursafi.
