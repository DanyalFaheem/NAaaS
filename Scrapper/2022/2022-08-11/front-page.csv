0,PTI seeks reprieve from ECP verdict at IHC’s door,Petition not fixed for hearing yet as it was submitted after prescribed deadline.,"• No immediate relief on plea to delay by-polls on NA seats
• FIA told to re-issue notices to party’s lower staff
ISLAMABAD: The Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has moved the Islamabad High Court against the Ele­c­tion Commission of Pakis­tan’s judgement in the prohibited funding case against the party.
Filed by PTI Additional General Secretary Omar Ayub, the court registrar office received the petition on Wednesday. However, the petition could not be fixed for haring since it was submitted after the prescribed deadline with the result that the department concerned could not scrutinise the annexure and documents consisting of over 6,000 pages.
Wednesday also saw the party involved in other legal matters as well, such as the schedule for by-polls for nine National Assembly seats that it opposed; and the notices that the FIA had issued to some PTI officials in wake of the ECP verdict in the funding case.
The main petition filed by the party stated that the Supreme Court had examined the matter and referred it back to the ECP for scrutiny of the accounts of all political parties, including the PTI. “Sadly, only PTI was targeted.”
According to the petitioner, the case against PTI pertains to an allegation of receiving “funds from prohibited source”.
The petition said, “the party explained and reconciled each and every account through a financial expert, orally as also by submitting a written financial summary, reconciling each and every transaction and, exp­la­ining all amounts rece­ived with its reconciliation with the audited accounts. How­ever, in complete disregard to all the submissions and without giving any reasoning for such disregard the respondent [ECP] passed the impugned fact finding report”.
The petition pointed out the ECP is not complete “in the absence of the total number of members as defined in the Constitution and deficient representation from all provinces? If so, does it not disenfranchise the provincial representation on the ECP as envisaged by the Constitution of Pakistan permitting manipulation and outside political interference in the work of the ECP?”
Mr Ayub said ECP had not considered, not even rebutted, the information provided by PTI and “acted with sheer mala fide, without application of mind and has based its findings on fabricated facts, which were aimed to harm and tarnish the political image of the petitioner”.
The petition requested the court to suspend the ECP’s verdict and the show cause notice issued to PTI as well as set aside the ECP’s report on the foreign funding.
By-polls delay plea
In a separate case, the IHC declined to grant immediate relief to PTI on its petition seeking suspension of by-elections on nine NA seats.
Acting IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq issued notices to ECP and NA Secretariat, seeking their reply till Aug 16.
PTI had requested the IHC to suspend the by-polls schedule till disposal of another petition seeking court’s direction to the NA speaker and ECP to approve resignations of and de-notify all the 123 MNAs belonging to the party.
Justice Farooq asked the counsel for PTI Faisal Hussain Chaudhry to explain legal reasoning for seeking suspension of the by-elections schedule.
Advocate Chaudhry argued that the petition against acceptance of resignation of 123 MNAs in piecemeal is pending before the court and the PTI wanted the ECP to de-notify all the MNAs.
Justice Farooq said the party may contest the election and in case the ECP de-notified the 123 MNAs, the PTI could go for election on these seats. The petition contended that after the regime change, the PTI had decided to quit NA since it was seeking a fresh mandate from the people of Pakistan. Pursuant to the decision of PTI’s parliamentary party on April 11, 123 MNAs tendered resignations before the deputy speaker who accepted all of them forthwith, it argued. However, the incumbent NA Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf withheld the resignations and did not forward them to the ECP on the pretext of “so-called verification of the resignation”.
FIA notices to be reissued
In yet another matter, the IHC disposed of a petition filed by lower staffers of PTI challenging the notices issued by FIA to them after the investigation agency assured it of re-issuance of the same in accordance with the standard operating procedure (SOP).
The petition contended that FIA had not mentioned the reason for summoning in its notices to the staff.
Justice Aamer Farooq while hearing case court noted that FIA had issued notices while violating its own SOP that makes it mandatory to explain detailed reasons for summoning.
He observed that it was the responsibility of the investigation agency to explain the reason in details to person being summoned.

1,Imran sees conspiracy to split his party from army,Concerned at foreign press reports of Pakistan airspace being used for drone attacks; warns ‘national security will be compromised,"ISLAMABAD: Former premier Imran Khan has said ‘elements facing corruption cases’ are creating differences between Pakistan’s largest party Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and the army, while also recalling that the country was divided in the 1970s when the then largest party was made opponent of the army. He alleged that efforts were made to wipe out his party during the recent by-polls and attempts were being made to break the party through foreign funding case. Referring to Toshakhana case, he said former presidents, prime ministers and army chiefs had also received gifts.
He also cited foreign newspapers reports that the drone that killed Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri flew through the airspace of Pakistan. “If it was done for monetary benefit, the country would suffer more,” he said at a presser, days after the army denied that Pakistan’s soil was used in the attack.
The PTI chairman claimed he had street power but he decided to hold peaceful protests so that the economy of country would not suffer.
While speaking to a news conference through a video link, Mr Khan said those who alleged that the army was involved in terrorism, were trying to create differences between largest party of Pakistan i.e. PTI with the army.

Concerned at foreign press reports of Pakistan airspace being used for drone attacks; warns ‘national security will be compromised’ if free, fair elections not held

“While I was 18 years old, I went to East Pakistan and come to know that supporters of largest party of Pakistan [Awami League] hated Army. It is a foreign conspiracy to create difference between PTI and Army,” he said.
He alleged that it was earlier assumed that PTI would be wiped out after the government ouster, but public came out on the roads and on May 25 remained on the roads despite crackdown by the government.
“During by-elections the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and administration used all possible means but PTI managed to clean sweep. Then it was decided to break the party by using foreign funding case. However fact is that PTI is the only party which did political fund raising and provided names of 40,000 donors to ECP but overseas Pakistanis were declared foreigners,” he said.
While defending Arif Naqvi, Mr Khan said he (Mr Naqvi) purchased K-Electric during the tenures of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N). He explained that the PTI had received the donation in 2012 while allegations were levelled against Mr Naqvi in 2018. He said he signed a certificate in which he mentioned that to the best of his knowledge all the data of audit report, provided to the ECP, was correct.
“I am being blamed for receiving gifts from Tosha Khana but fact is that all the presidents, prime minister and army chief received gifts. Asif Zardari purchased three vehicles from Tosha Khana and Nawaz Sharif purchased one vehicle. They have started character assassination and media houses are being used against me. On the other hand ARY, which was giving my version, has been closed. Soon they will move towards YouTube channels and social media accounts,” he said.
The PTI chairman said foreign newspapers were reporting that drone, which killed Al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri, used airspace of Pakistan.
‘TTP threatening ministers’
“If we did that for some financial benefit, we need to remember that during Afghan Jihad we supported the US and in return we faced terrorism. We again supported the US in war against terrorism and received US $ 20 billion but our 80,000 people died. We will face similar situation again as I have been hearing from my ministers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) that Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan has started threatening them,” he said.
While defending party leader Shehbaz Gill, Mr Khan said that even if he (Mr Gill) had violated the law, proper chance should have been given to him to clarify himself. He alleged that his driver was also thrashed by the police.
During the presser, videos of PPP and PML-N were run in which leaders of both parties criticised the armed forces (role in politics).
The ex-premier was of the opinion that free and fair election should be held or else ‘national security would be compromised’.
Also addressing the presser, PTI senior leader Murad Saeed said the game plan of the ‘imported government’ had been exposed, but warned that the nation would not allow them to play with the lives of people.
He said Pakistan was plunged into the war on terror despite the fact that not a single Pakistani was involved in 9/11 incident due to which the whole country especially KP suffered the most. He warned that the country should not be dragged into the dirty game again because it was very easy to ignite the fire but it was very difficult to extinguish it. He said that peace in the restive Swat valley was restored after sacrificing over 80,000 lives in Waziristan, Bajaur and Kurram tribal districts.

2,PM Shehbaz demands report on delays in power projects,Seeks detailed report on amount received as fuel price adjustment through electricity bills.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Min­ister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday asked the auth­o­rities concerned for an early submission of report on po­wer projects that were suspended during the past four years.
Presiding over a meeting held to review measures aimed at promoting solar energy in the country, the prime minister lashed out at PTI chairman Imran Khan for suspension of power projects and bashing of Pakis­tan Army and shuhada.
Soon after coming to power in April, the PM had ordered an inquiry to probe into suspension of power projects. However, the formation of an inquiry team had not been announced.
At that time, he had clai­med that suspension of power projects had caused loadshedding in the country.
According to PM Office, the PM also sought a detailed report on the amount received as fuel price adjustment through electricity bills.
He said people would be provided with solar systems as an alternative to the cos­tly electricity being generated by using imported fuel.
The prime minister said that the alternate energy policy introduced by Imran Khan’s government in 2020, did not only fail to produce required results but also didn’t attract any investment in the sector.
PM Shehbaz called for prioritising Balochistan while providing solar systems. He said solarisation would not only reduce the import bill of costly fuel but would also help generate low-cost and environment-friendly electricity.
The meeting was briefed on solar projects as an alternative to costly power projects. It was told that the government would launch solarisation projects of around 14,000 megawatts within next few months. Of these, solar projects of around 9,000MW would be executed on a priority basis.
Under the initiative, solar systems would not only be provided on reduced prices but tax incentives would also be given in this regard.
The prime minister directed the authorities concerned to carry out comprehensive planning for an early execution of solar projects.
Later, in a tweet, PM Shehbaz said that families of martyrs would never forget what he called “derogatory campaign of Imran Khan against Pakistan Army”.
The whole nation has witnessed what kind of remarks have been given by Imran Khan for last four months, he added.
He further said: “His (Imran) social media trolls run a full of hate trend against the army. Will families of Shuhada (martyrs) forget it? Niazi can make himself a fool but not the nation.”

 





 
According to the Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR), armed forces of the country and families of martyred security personnel on Aug 5 expressed “deep anguish” over what the military spokesman called a “regretful media campaign after unfortunate helicopter crash in which senior army officials died.

3,‘Personal animus’ may have led to New Mexico killings,Police official says sectarian animus by the suspect towards his fellow Muslim victims may have played a role in the violence.,"WASHINGTON: A false sense of honour seems to have caused a 51-year-old man to kill four men in the US state of New Mexico because he believed they facilitated his daughter’s marriage against his will.
The suspect, Mohammed Syed, killed three men in the last two weeks and one in November in Albuque­rque, a city in New Mexico. Three of them were from the Shia community, like the man his daughter married, and one was a Sunni.
The Albuquerque Police Department (APD) has cha­rged Syed with two of the homicides, the July 26 murder of Aftab Hussein and the Aug 1 murder of Muha­mmad Afzaal Hussain. All four victims were of Afghan or Pakistani descent.
The police are still working with the District Attorney’s office on potential charges for the other two homicides — the Aug 5 murder of Nadeem Hussain and the November 2021 murder of Mohammad Zaher Ahmadi.
APD Deputy Commander Kyle Hartsock told a news conference that investigators were still piecing together motives for the killings.
Syed’s daughter, whose name has not been disclosed, told police she did not believe her father could have murdered four innocent people. “He just cannot, he is a peace-loving person who came to the US to escape the tyranny of the Taliban.”
After his arrest, Syed told investigators he was trained by US Special Forces to fight the Taliban and he did. He arrived from Afghanistan six years ago.
Interviews with community members, media reports and police statements show the girl had a love marriage, even though Syed opposed it.
This happened nearly four years ago. Gradually, Syed accepted the marriage and maintained cordial, but not close, relations with the couple.
“But he held a grudge against those who facilitated the marriage,” said Tahir Gauba, Director Public Affairs at the Islamic Centre of New Mexico (ICNM) where all four victims, as well as the suspect, prayed.
Gauba recalled that Ahmadi’s funeral, like those of others, was also held at ICNM. After the November 2021 funeral, someone slashed two tyres of his sister’s car. The incident was not probed.
It was Afzaal’s murder that persuaded the police, as well as the ICNM administration, to look into the matter. “So, we decided to check the video of Ahmadi’s funeral and we discovered that it’s Syed who slashed the tyres,” Gauba said.
Afzaal, although a Sunni and a Pakistani, was a senior official in the city government. The suspect believed Afzaal’s support enabled his daughter to marry against his will, “and that’s why he targeted him,” Gauba said.
“We never had Shia-Sunni conflict in our community, he said. “Afzaal was very involved in community works, very friendly to everybody.”
Police said as their detectives prepared to search Syed’s home in Southeast Albuquerque on Monday, he drove about 125 miles from the residence in the Volkswagen Jetta that detectives believe was used in one of the murders.
“Detectives detained Syed and searched his home and the vehicle. They discovered additional evidence that further ties Syed to the murders,” the police said.
“Detectives connected those homicides using bullet casings found at the scenes. The gun used in these shootings was discovered during the overnight search of [Syed’s] home,” police said.
In response to reporters’ questions, APD Hartsock said sectarian animus by the suspect towards his fellow Muslim victims may have played a role in the violence.
“But we’re not really clear if that was the actual motive, or if it was part of a motive, or if there is just a bigger picture that we’re missing,” he said.
Syed has a record of criminal misdemeanors in the United States, including a case of domestic violence, over the last three or four years, Hartsock said.

4,Protests against militants’ return echo in National Assembly,Defence Minister Khawaja Asif says anti-TTP sentiments growing in KP; expresses apprehensions about success of talks with TTP.,"ISLAMABAD: Expressing his apprehensions at the success of talks with the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday admitted on the floor of the National Assembly that anti-Taliban feelings were growing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) as people were holding protest demonstrations in various parts of the province against the Taliban presence in their area.
Responding to independent MNA from erstwhile Federally-Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) Mohsin Dawar who drew the attention of the house towards the rise in terrorism in KP after arrival of Taliban from Afghanistan, the defence minister admitted that the law and order situation was worsening in the province. He, however, termed it a “national issue”, instead of a provincial matter.
Editorial: TTP talks’ oversight
The minister regretted that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leadership, including former prime minister Imran Khan, had in the past welcomed the Taliban people in the province, but now the PTI’s provincial government was itself protesting against the presence of the Taliban in the province. He said there were reports of the protests from Dir, Swat and other places in the province against the Taliban.
He also expressed his apprehensions about the success of the talks with the TTP. “This assembly was given two briefings [on the issue of talks with the TTP]. May Allah keep the affairs [talks] on track as per the briefings,” said the minister, adding: “the danger is gradually increasing.”

Khawaja Asif says anti-TTP sentiments growing in KP; lawmakers assail ‘anti-army’ campaign; Soomro de-seated

Mr Asif expressed the hope that the Taliban would not force imposition of their “own system and implement their “intentions” which they showed from time to time”.
The minister said that a committee comprising political elders had been constituted to visit the Pakistan-Afghanistan entry point at Ghulam Khan area in North Waziristan to persuade the protesters to open the trade route which they had closed in protest for the past two weeks over the killing of some JUI-F members and tribal people. He hoped that the committee members would succeed in pacifying the protesters to resume the stalled trade activities with Afghanistan. He said the closure of roads had badly affected trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan, besides affecting economy of the area.
‘Terrorism across KP’
Speaking on a point of order, Mr Dawar earlier said the people of North Waziristan had been protesting for the past 26 days and they were only demanding “peace and protection”.
The lawmaker claimed terrorism had spread across KP and warned it would soon grip the whole country. Recently, he said, a PTI MPA was attacked and many of his companions were martyred. Similarly, he said, a police official and an army major were abducted from Swat.
Mr Dawar said the Taliban were telling the local people that their leadership had directed them to return to the area in the wake of the ongoing talks between Pakistani authorities and the TTP.
The MNA from Waziristan ridiculed the PTI leaders for protesting against Taliban, recalling that the previous PTI government had welcomed and celebrated the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. He criticised the “non-seriousness” of the authorities to tackle the issue, declaring that the people of KP would not accept “project-Taliban policy” and would resist it at all cost.
Anti-army campaign
Earlier, speaking on points of order, a number of lawmakers expressed their concerns over the ongoing campaign on social and main media against the army and blamed the PTI for it. The issue came up when Dr Fehmida Mirza of the Grand Democratic Alliance blasted the government over its action against ARY News channel.
She said if someone had maligned the national institution, then the whole channel should not be punished for it.
The most hard-hitting speech came from a PTI dissident Noor Alam Khan, who lashed out at the PTI leadership over the campaign and praised the army for its services for the country in the wake of the war against terrorism. At one point, he said army was the only institution that was “functioning properly” in the country.
Without naming PTI’s Shahbaz Gill, Mr Khan said those who did not like Pakistan and its army, should leave the country.
Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf declared that only anti-state people could run a campaign against the army. He said attacking the judiciary and the army was a violation of the constitution, stating that the parliament should take cognisance of such campaigns.
Soomro de-seated
Meanwhile, the National Assembly approved a motion tabled by PPP MNA Shahida Rehmani seeking to de-seat PTI MNA from Jacobabad Mohammadmian Soomro for being absent from the house without leave for 40 consecutive days.
The speaker put the motion for vote after rejecting the leave application which Mr Soomro had submitted after the PPP’s MNA had already been placed on the assembly agenda.
Mr Soomro, who had served as the privatisation minister during the previous PTI government, had not submitted his resignation with his other party colleagues, including Imran Khan, at the time of the election of Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister.
Legislation
The National Assembly also passed four bills and witnessed introduction of three bills.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Shahadat Awan introduced the Railways (Amendment) Bill 2022; the Control of Narcotics Substances (Amendment) Bill 2022 and the Qanun-e-Shahadat (Amendment) Bill 2022. Through the first two bills, the government has sought to substitute death penalty with life-imprisonment.
The Statements of Objects and Reasons attached to the bills state that the death penalty in the laws “is used in a disproportionate manner that violates the fundamental right to life which happens to be the most basic of all human rights.”
It state that the risk of executing innocent people exists and “the arbitrary application of the death penalty can never be ruled out” under the two laws.
The four bills passed by the assembly are the National Meteorology Institute of Pakistan Bill 2022; the Public Private Partnership Authority (Amendment) Bill 2022; the Iqbal Academy Pakistan Bill 2022 and the Pakistan Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2022.
The speaker then adjourned the sitting till 9pm on Saturday.
