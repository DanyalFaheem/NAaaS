3,PHC seeks govt response to petition against new police seniority list,Officers call for restoration of previous list.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday directed the attorney general for Pakistan and provincial advocate general to respond to a petition challenging the seniority list of police officers issued by the department last June.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal issued notices to the two law officers asking if the provincial government is competent to promote police officers of BPS-17 and above through the provincial selection board or it is the domain of the federal government.
It was hearing a petition jointly filed by superintendent of police (security) Salahuddin Khan and six other police officers requesting the court to declare the impugned seniority list issued on June 28, 2022, by the additional inspector general (AIG) (Establishment) as unconstitutional and against Articles 142, 240 and 260 of the Constitution.
The petitioners requested the court to direct the respondents, including the provincial government and provincial police officer, to restore an earlier seniority list of DSPs (BPS-17) issued on Feb 21, 2022, as it was based on the relevant laws and rules.

Officers call for restoration of previous list

The petitioners highlighted the Police Service of Pakistan (Composition, Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985, and said those rules declare that promotions to BPS-18 should be made on the basis of 40 per cent quota reserved for the provincial police cadre.
They prayed the court to direct the respondents to prepare joint seniority list of senior officers in BPS-17, including ASPs and DSPs, in light of those rules and then make promotion to BPS-18 on the basis of 40 per cent quota of provincial police officers.
The bench fixed Aug 10 for next hearing into the petition.
Advocates Anwarul Haq and Mohammad Ahmad Khan appeared for the petitioners and said their clients served as senior police officers (BPS-17) in the police department.
They sad the petitioners, who were promoted as DSPs, had successfully undertaken various obligations and missions
Mr Anwar said a seniority list meant for DSPs was issued on Feb 21, 2022, but violating different procedures and rules, the list was revised and instead, the impugned list was issued in June 2022 by the AIG (Establishment) without citing any cogent reason.
He said the petitioners had filed departmental appeals and representations with the competent authority, but to no avail.
The lawyer said under Police Service of Pakistan (Composition, Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985, 40 per cent quota was reserved for promotion and ‘encadrement’ for officers of the police cadre of the province for which joint seniority list had to be prepared.
He added that the respondents had never followed the criteria and rules.
Mr Anwar said an identical claim of promotion and ‘encadrement’ was raised before the Sindh High Court, which had decided the same in favour of petitioners in 2014, while the judgement was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2015.
He wondered whether the whole process of issuing the seniority list of duly sanctions from the provincial government and thereafter to convene a departmental promotion committee’s meeting for promoting police officers was not the domain of the federal government through the establishment secretary.

9,Traders reject new electricity surcharge,"Block road for hours, say won’t pay power bills...","MANSEHRA: Traders in Baffa and Oghi areas here on Thursday warned that they won’t pay power bills next month if the government didn’t withdraw new surcharge from them.

“We [US] enjoy 75 years long cooperation with Pakistan. Our country is assisting the host population in addressing their public health issues through disease surveillance initiatives and will continue with it,” the ambassador told the vehicles handing over ceremony here.
Mr Blome said the US was providing technical assistance to Pakistan for effective response to Covid-19 and had so far donated 62 million vaccine doses to it.
He said the US was cooperating with Pakistan at the federal level with priority being given to the violence-hit Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
“We [US] are assisting Pakistan to improve its maternal health and bring down child mortality through various initiatives,” he said.
The ambassador said the US had imparted training to 27,000 Pakistani doctors.
He said the USAID Integrated Health Systems Strengthening and Service Delivery activity was meant to improve public trust in the provincial government’s services, improve governance, enhance equitable delivery of basic services, including Covid-19 care and inoculation and strengthening health security.
“We [US] have refurbished and donated essential equipment to 180 primary healthcare facilities in addition to operationalisation of seven more hospitals to make maternal, newborn and child healthcare effective,” he said.

11,High court extends stay order against reopening of govt cases,"PAC had ordered fresh NAB probe into alleged corruption, anomalies in projects...","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday extended a stay order stopping the National Accountability Bureau from reopening four cases of alleged corruption and irregularities against the provincial government on the orders of the National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khursheed Iqbal adjourned until Oct 19 the hearing into a petition jointly filed by former BRT director (coordination) Alamzeb Khan, Bank of Khyber executive vice-president Sher Mohammad and former managing director of the Tourism Corporation of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mushtaq Khan.
The petitioners requested the court to declare illegal and without jurisdiction the PAC’s directives contained in the minutes of its July 7, 2022, meeting for the NAB chairman and its Peshawar regional headquarters for re-investigating cases regarding the launch of the BRT, Malam Jabba land lease, BOK appointments and Billion Tree Tsunami project.
They sought the court’s orders to strike down those PAC directions and permanently stop the NAB from ‘acting upon any such directions so issued by the PAC’.

PAC had ordered fresh NAB probe into alleged corruption, anomalies in projects

The PAC, in a meeting on July 7, had directed the acting NAB chairman to reopen the four cases and file a report to it within three months. It had also directed the NAB to file a reference in the Malam Jabba lease case within a month.
The counsel for petitioners, Qazi Jawad Ahsanullah, contended that the PAC’s mandate and jurisdiction had been specified in the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the National Assembly, 2007, whereby the committee had nothing to do with the ‘administration of criminal justice and offences related to corruption’.
He said under rules 203 and 205, the role and functions of the PAC appeared to be limited to the matters concerning public exchequer and report of the Auditor General of Pakistan on issues concerning public money.
The bench asked the counsel if it won’t have been appropriate for the NAB to approach the court against the reopening of the cases it had closed instead of the petitioners.
Qazi Jawad said as cases would be reopened against petitioners on the orders of the PAC, which had overstepped its powers, the petitioners were aggrieved people.
He insisted that the reopening of the cases closed in accordance with the law would create complications.
The lawyer said during the last few years, the NAB and its regional headquarters in Peshawar had been inquiring and investigating various cases regarding petitioners and their organisations, including the four cases in question.
He said the NAB investigation officers had seized all official records of the cases, while senior officials of the provincial government remained involved in the investigation.
The counsel said the NAB had conducted a thorough probe into the matters related to the Malam Jabba land lease for a skiing resort and didn’t find any corruption and corrupt practices, so the matter was placed before the NAB executive board for deliberation.
He added that as per the law’s requirement, a formal application was submitted to the accountability court by the NAB regional office and that the court examined records, including the report of the investigation officer, and allowed the closure of investigation on Nov 2, 2021.
The lawyer contended that PAC chairman Noor Alam Khan was proceeding to order re-investigation into the cases based on personal and political vendetta and without genuine grounds. He added that the PAC chairman was also an accused in a NAB case about his assets.
