Officials from world powers and Iran were meeting in the Austrian capital for the first time since March, when negotiations, which began in 2021 to reintegrate the United States into the agreement, stalled. 
In late June, Qatar hosted indirect talks between Tehran and Washington in the hope of getting the process back on track — but those talks failed to make a breakthrough. 
In a last-ditch effort, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell submitted a compromise proposal last month and called on the parties to accept it to avoid a  “dangerous nuclear crisis”. 
Borrell said the draft text includes “hard-won compromises by all sides” and “addresses, in precise detail, the sanctions lifting as well as the nuclear steps needed to restore” the 2015 pact. 
Bilateral talks began on Thursday at Vienna’s luxury Palais Coburg hotel under the auspices of the European Union’s representative Enrique Mora. 
The Iranian and Russian delegations, which have traditionally been close in the negotiations, held a separate meeting. 
Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran, Russia and the United States signed the JCPOA in July 2015. Delegations from all will partake in Thursday’s talks, but officials from the US and Iran are not expected to meet face to face. 
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action aims to guarantee the civilian nature of Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for a gradual lifting of sanctions. 
But following the unilateral withdrawal of the United States in 2018 under former president Donald Trump and the re-imposition of US sanctions, Tehran has backtracked on its obligations. 
Iran subsequently exceeded the JCPOA’s uranium enrichment rate of 3.67 per cent, rising to 20 percent in early 2021. 
It then crossed an unprecedented 60pc threshold, getting closer to the 90pc needed to make a bomb. 
The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, on Tuesday warned Iran’s programme was “moving ahead very, very fast” and “growing in ambition and capacity”. 
Cautious optimism 
Ahead of Thursday’s talks, officials expressed cautious optimism, all the while cautioning that the parties remained far apart on key issues. 
These include sanctions, Iranian demands for guarantees and the end of a probe by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
The head of the US delegation, Rob Malley, and the head of Tehran’s representatives, Ali Bagheri, said on Twitter ahead of the talks that they were coming in good faith but put the onus on each other. 
Analysts meanwhile said reviving the JCPOA remained the best option.
“The last thing the United States needs is a nuclear crisis with Iran that could easily escalate to a broader regional conflict,” Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in a statement. 
Ellie Geranmayeh, an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), said that “at the end of the day, Tehran and Washington know the alternatives to a JCPOA collapse are terrible”. 
“This is unlikely to be a meeting that resolves the outstanding issues” but “it could create the breakthrough necessary to push the talks towards a finishing line rather than a collapse,” she said.

1,‘Unprecedented’ fire rips thru munitions site in Berlin forest,"Berlin mayor Franziska Giffey interrupts her holiday to visit scene, calls events “unprecedented in post-war history of Berlin”.","BERLIN: An  “unprecedented” fire broke out on Thursday around a German police munitions storage site in a popular forest in western Berlin, sending plumes of smoke into the skies and setting off explosions.
Firefighters were unable to tackle the blaze directly due to the danger of further blasts, with emergency services setting up a 1,000-metre (3,280-foot) safety zone around the site.
Berlin fire brigade spokesman Thomas Kirstein said the situation was  “under control and there was no danger for Berliners” but that the fire was expected to last for some time. Around 250 emergency personnel were deployed to the site.
The army sent in a tank aimed at evacuating munitions at the affected storage site as well as remote-controlled de-mining robots, while drones circled the air to assess the emergency. Water cannons were also deployed around the safety zone to prevent the fire from spreading. Berlin mayor Franziska Giffey interrupted her holiday to visit the scene, calling the events  “unprecedented in the post-war history of Berlin”.
Giffey advised Berliners to close their windows but said the danger was minimal as there were no residential buildings within a two-kilometre radius and so no need to issue evacuation orders.
“It would be much more difficult if there were residential buildings nearby,” she said.
Firefighters called to the site in the middle of the night were confronted with intermittent blasts that sent debris flying and hindered their work. No one has been hurt by the fires, which came as a heatwave enveloped Germany.
Scientists say climate change is making heatwaves around the world more frequent and more intense, which increases the risk of fires. Police said they were investigating what set off the fire.

2,Four US cops charged over killing of Black woman,"""Breonna Taylor should be alive today,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland says.","WASHINGTON: The US Justice Department charged four police officers on Thursday over the death of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman killed in a botched 2020 raid on her home in Louisville, Kentucky.
Attorney General Merrick Garland said the officers face federal charges of civil rights offenses, unlawful conspiracy, making false statements unconstitutional use of force and obstruction.
“We allege that these offenses resulted in Miss Taylor’s death,” Garland said.  “Breonna Taylor should be alive today.”
The deaths of Taylor and George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who was murdered by a white police officer in Minneapolis in May 2020, became the focus of a wave of mass protests in the United States and beyond against racial injustice and police brutality.
The 26-year-old Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were sleeping in her apartment around midnight on March 13, 2020 when they heard a noise at the door.
Walker, believing it was a break-in, fired his gun, wounding one police officer.
Police, who had obtained a controversial no-knock warrant to make a drug arrest, fired more than 30 shots back, mortally wounding Taylor.
Garland said three of the Louisville police officers — Joshua Jaynes, 45, Kyle Meany, 35, and Kelly Goodlett — were involved in the falsification of a search warrant in a drug trafficking case against Taylor’s ex-boyfriend.
They are accused of violating Taylor’s rights by seeking a warrant to search her home when they knew they lacked probable cause.
“We allege that the defendants knew that the affidavit in support of that warrant contained false and misleading information and that it omitted material information,” Garland said. He added that the officers also allegedly  “took steps to cover up their unlawful conduct after Miss Taylor was killed.” 
The fourth police officer, Brett Hankison, was charged with using excessive force by opening fire wildly during the raid which left Taylor dead.
The 46-year-old Hankison had previously been found not guilty in March of this year of state charges of  “wanton endangerment” for his actions during the raid on Taylor’s home. Taylor’s boyfriend Walker said police battered down the door unannounced. The officers insisted they had identified themselves.
Two of the officers involved were fired but Hankison had been the only one to face state charges — which related not to the death of Taylor but to endangering residents of neighboring apartments.
Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney who represented Taylor’s family, welcomed the charges filed against the officers. “Today was a huge step toward justice,” Crump said in a statement.
He said he hopes it  “sends a message to all other involved officers that it is time to stop covering up and time to accept responsibility for their roles in causing the death of an innocent, beautiful young Black woman.”

3,"UN chief calls for windfall taxes on profits of oil, gas firms",Skyrocketing energy prices are compounding an existential cost-of-living crisis for hundreds of millions of people.,"ISLAMABAD: The Global Crisis Response Group (GCRG) on Food, Energy and Finance, formed by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, has asked governments to find the most effective way to fund energy solutions to protect vulnerable communities everywhere, including through windfall taxes on the largest oil and gas companies.
Launching the third report of the crisis group on Wednesday, the secretary general called the record profit from oil and gas amid global energy crisis “immoral” as the combined profits of the largest energy companies in the first quarter of this year are close to $100 billion.
As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, skyrocketing energy prices are compounding an existential cost-of-living crisis for hundreds of millions of people.  Despite this alarming situation, major oil and gas companies recently reported record profits, UN chief regrets.
The GCRG warns that rising energy prices may price out many developing countries, with a high level of impact on the most vulnerable citizens, from energy markets. Such a situation is already impacting hard-won gains in the provision of access to energy and the reduction of energy poverty, and progress had already been set back due to the pandemic.
The GCRG report stresses that any short-term policies and protection measures must help mitigate the crisis, including efforts to promote energy efficiency and demand reduction, and not exacerbate it, such as blanket subsidies for fossil fuels.
In the medium-to-long-term, the world needs to double down on renewables to meet net-zero goals, tackle energy poverty, and boost and diversify the global energy mix. To that end, the brief calls for the need to significantly increase global investment, it says.
“Renewable energy is often the cheapest, and most quick to deploy source of electricity for many countries. But this is only true if we ensure that supply chains work well and without bottlenecks; that the workforce has the right skills and that enough funds will be made available for the initial investments,” said the secretary general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Rebeca Grynspan.

4,Half of species not assessed for endangered list risk extinction: study,"The International Union for Conservation of Nature currently has nearly 150,000 entries on its Red List for threatened species.","PARIS: More than half of species whose endangered status cannot be assessed due to a lack of data are predicted to face the risk of extinction, according to a machine-learning analysis published on Thursday.
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently has nearly 150,000 entries on its Red List for threatened species, including some 41,000 species threatened with extinction.
These include 41 percent of amphibians, 38 percent of sharks and rays, 33 percent of reef building corals, 27 percent of mammals and 13 percent of birds.
But there are thousands of species that the IUCN has been unable to categorise as they are  “data insufficient” and are not on the Red List even though they live in the same regions and face similar threats to those species that have so far been assessed.
Researchers from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology used a machine learning technique to predict the likelihood of 7,699 data deficient species being at risk of extinction.
They trained the algorithm on a list of more than 26,000 species that the IUCN has been able to categorise, incorporating data on the regions where species live and other factors known to influence biodiversity to determine whether it predicted their extinction risk status.
“These could include climatic conditions, land use conditions or land use changes, pesticide use, threats from invasive species or really a range of different stressors,” lead author Jan Borgelt, from the university’s Industrial Ecology Programme, said.
After comparing the algorithm’s results with the IUCN’s lists, the team then applied it to predict the data deficient species’ extinction risk.
Writing in the journal Communications Biology, they found that 4,336 species — or 56 percent of those sampled — were likely threatened with extinction, including 85 percent of amphibians and 61 percent of mammals. This compares to the 28 percent of species assessed by the IUCN Red List.
“We see that across most land areas and coastal areas around the world that the average extinction risk would be higher if we included data deficient species,” said Borgelt.
A global United Nations biodiversity assessment in 2019 warned that as many as a million species were threatened with extinction due to a number of factors including habitat loss, invasive species and climate change.
Borgelt said the analysis revealed some hotspots for data-deficient species risk, including Madagascar and southern India.

5,Spectators flock to Iceland volcano,"More than 1,830 people visit site on the first day of the eruption.","FAGRADALSFJALL: Curious onlookers made their way on Thursday to the site of a volcano erupting near Iceland’s capital Reykjavik to marvel at the bubbling lava, a day after the fissure appeared in an uninhabited valley.
The eruption was around 40 kilometres from Reykjavik, near the site of the Mount Fagradalsfjall volcano in southwestern Iceland that spewed magma for six months between March and Sept 2021.
While last year’s eruption was easily accessible on foot and drew more than 435,000 tourists, the new eruption is trickier to access, requiring a strenuous 90-minute hilly hike from the closest car park.
Despite that, more than 1,830 people visited the site on the first day of the eruption, according to the Icelandic Tourist Board, and more visitors were seen trekking to the scene early on Thursday. Among them was American tourist Hather Hoff, 42, for whom seeing lava was  “a life goal”.
“I had to sit down and have a little cry because it is so beautiful, so emotional -- this is the raw power of our planet,” she said. Anita Sauckel, a 40-year-old German living in Iceland, visited last year’s eruption and could not resist witnessing the latest volcanic activity.
“This is special with the lava, huge fountains popping out in the middle, and I love that a lot,” she said.
The fissure was estimated to be around 360 metres (1,181 feet) long, the Icelandic Meteorological Office said, with lava fountains about 10-15 metres high.
Wednesday’s eruption was preceded by a period of intense seismic activity, with about 10,000 earthquakes detected since Saturday, including two with a magnitude of at least 5.0. The frequency of the earthquakes has slowed since the magma burst through the ground.

6,"Anger, anguish as Lebanon marks two years since Beirut mega-blast",The 2020 disaster killed more than 200 people and decimated vast areas of the capital.,"BEIRUT: Lebanon marked two years on Thursday since a massive explosion ripped through Beirut — a grim anniversary marked by angry protests and the dramatic collapse of blast-damaged grain silos in a cloud of dust.
The 2020 disaster, one of history’s biggest non-nuclear explosions, killed more than 200 people and decimated vast areas of the capital after a stockpile of haphazardly stored ammonium nitrate caught fire.
Thousands of protesters, many of them victims’ relatives, are furious that no state official has yet been held accountable over the tragedy and an investigation into the mega-blast has been stalled amid political interference.
At 6:07pm, the moment of the explosion, demonstrators held a moment of silence, before breaking into applause. Sirens rang out to remember the firefighters killed in the blast.
“When the explosion happened, we thought the truth would surface within five days,” said university student Aya Qassem, joining one of multiple protest marches that converged at the port. “But two years have passed, and we know nothing.” 
The huge explosion was a nightmarish moment in the chaotic history of Lebanon, which is mired in its worst-ever economic crisis marked by blackouts, runaway inflation and widespread despair.
Beirut’s heavily damaged harbourside grain silos have become a grim reminder of the explosion, and the collapse of part of the structure on Thursday dramatically brought back the trauma.
“I’m seeing the same sight, from almost the same place, after two years,” said Lama Hashem, a 30-year-old who took part in the protest march, holding back tears.
“It’s traumatic,” she added, as demonstrators around her raised red-stained Lebanese flags and mock coffins in a display of mourning.
Thousands marched towards the wreckage of the silos, where fermenting grain has been smouldering in the blistering summer heat issuing clouds of smoke, after partially collapsing last week.
“I hope that seeing the silos fall will give people the will to fight for justice,” said Tatiana Hasrouty, who lost her father in the blast.
“It is our right to know the truth,” Mirelle Khoury, whose son was killed in the explosion, said in a statement on behalf of the victims’ families.
The 2020 blast was felt as far away as Cyprus and sowed the kind of devastation normally caused by wars and natural disasters.
It further scarred the crisis-tested population and accelerated a massive exodus that recalls the flight from the 1975-1990 civil war.
Lebanon’s ruling class, accused of misrule, graft and gross negligence, has however clung firmly to power even as the people endure shortages of fuel, medicines and clean water. “This ruling class is killing us every day,” Hasrouty said.
“If we did not die in the blast, we are dying of hunger, from a lack of basic human rights.”
The government in April ordered the silos’ demolition, but this has been suspended, partly because of objections from victims’ relatives who want them preserved as a memorial.
Even though parts of the silos are collapsing, stable sections should be preserved, relatives of blast victims said in a statement on Thursday. “We will do everything in our power to preserve and protect... the silent witness,” the statement said.
