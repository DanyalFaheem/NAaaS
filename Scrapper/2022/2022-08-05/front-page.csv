• PDM moves ECP for Imran Khan’s disqualification
ISLAMABAD: The government on Thursday decided to throw the ball ‘to the Supreme Court’ and file a declaration against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in light of the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) verdict in the prohibited funding case against the party.
The decision was taken by the federal cabinet in its meeting presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The cabinet also directed the Interior Ministry and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to immediately conduct an independent and impartial inquiry into the matter in collaboration with the relevant financial and investigative departments under various aspects, including money laundering, fake accounts, misappropriation of funds and above all the utilisation of donations for political purposes.
“The federal cabinet decided to send a declaration against the PTI to the Supreme Court in light of the ECP verdict. The PTI has been declared a foreign-aided party by the ECP in its decision announced after eight years under the Political Parties Order (PPO) 2002 and the Elections Act 2017,” Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said at a post-cabinet meeting press conference here.
The government decided to proceed against the PTI two days after the ECP declared the party had “wilfully” and “knowingly” received prohibited funding, including from foreign donors.
Ms Aurangzeb said the action against PTI would be taken under the PPO 2002 and Elections Act 2017 and the inquiry report made public. Had the ECP decided a prohibited funding case against any other party during the Imran-led government, all members of that party would have landed in jail, she remarked.
She claimed the incumbent government did not believe in political victimisation, but the law would take its course.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar briefed the cabinet about legal aspects of the ECP verdict. The Law Ministry was given three days to prepare the declaration for its presentation before the cabinet in its next meeting after 10th of Muharram.
Referring to Section 3 of PPO 2002 about political parties receiving funds from foreign governments, political parties or nations, Ms Aurangzeb said the federal government was legally bound to take action against the PTI for “knowingly” and “willfully” receiving prohibited funds from a number of foreign firms and individuals.
She said other aspects of the decision that were very important were related to the “false affidavit” submitted by the PTI chairman and concealment of 16 bank accounts opened in the name of its senior leadership, including Mr Khan, and employees of the party’s secretariat.
Referring to the affidavit that stated no prohibited funds had been received, the minister said according to the PPO, all parties had to submit this document with the commission every year.
“It is for the first time in the history of Pakistan that a party has been declared foreign-aided,” she said, adding party accounts had been used by its leadership for personal purposes.
During the cabinet meeting, prayers were also offered for the military officials who recently embraced martyrdom in a helicopter crash, as well as for those killed in floods.
Meanwhile, a group of PDM lawmakers on Thursday moved the ECP, asking it to disqualify PTI chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan from holding public office for receiving prohibited funding and signing inaccurate certificates with the party’s annual statements of assets.
A petition submitted by MNA Barrister Mohsin Nawaz Ranjha to this effect also carries signatures of lawmakers Agha Hassan Baloch, Salahudeen Ayubi, Ali Gohar Khan, Syed Rafiullah Agha and Saad Waseem Sheikh.
The petition asks the ECP to disqualify Imran Khan under Sections 2 and 3 of Article 63 of the Constitution, read with Article 62(1)(f). Documentary evidence to substantiate the charges has also been annexed with the petition.
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution reads: “A person shall not be qualified to be elected or chosen as a member of Majlis-i-Shoora (parliament) unless [...] he is sagacious, righteous and non-profligate, honest and ameen, there being no declaration to the contrary by a court of law.”

• PTI chief claims ‘hidden hands’ using ECP to keep democracy in check
• Party holds protests outside ECP offices in major cities
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan on Thursday lashed out at the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for its verdict in the prohibited funding case as he termed the decision an attempt by the ruling coalition and the powers-that-be to knock him out on “technical” grounds.
The comments by the former premier came as the PTI held protests outside the offices of the election watchdog across Pakistan to register its protest against the verdict in the prohibited funding case against the erstwhile ruling party and the alleged collusion between the ECP chief and the ruling PML-N and PPP.
Speaking to his supporters who gathered at F-9 Park in Islamabad and the ECP office in Karachi through a video link, Mr Khan alleged that the election commission was “the biggest tool” to control democracy in Pakistan and through this institution ‘hidden hands’ manipulate elections.
According to Imran Khan, “They always use institutions. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was killed because they feared that it would be impossible to control if he took to the streets.”
Mr Khan said the ECP exceeded its domain in the decision against the PTI, adding these efforts were an attempt to “keep the nation enslaved”. “Election commission is also a means… to keep people enslaved… people vote for someone else but someone else gets elected in return.”
“The ECP has been made like such that it can be used to easily control the governments,” Mr Khan alleged. He added that through ECP decisions are made about which party will get how many seats. He said in order to end this opaqueness, he wanted to introduce electronic voting machines — a move opposed by the ECP and other parties. The EVMs would have deterred the ‘hidden hands’ from manipulating the election results, said Imran Khan. “Elections are controlled through this way,” Mr Khan said, adding that ECP was the biggest means to control democracy in Pakistan.
Imran Khan added the ‘corrupt’ political elite of the country tried to remove him from the political theatre through all means and now they had resorted to the use of the ECP.
Speaking further about the ECP ruling, the PTI chairman said there was a difference between an affidavit and a certificate. According to Mr Khan, he signed the certificate given to him by his accountants and auditors to the “best of his knowledge” because he could not possibly keep track of all the money. The affidavit is the one submitted by PM Shehbaz Sharif in the high court to let his elder brother go abroad for medical treatment, he added.
Imran Khan further that taking money from foreign companies wasn’t illegal in 2012 as the law which prohibited taking funds from foreign companies was introduced in 2017 whereas PTI’s case was from 2012.
The PTI chairman also talked about the Financial Times report. He said that the PTI had received the money in 2012 from two fundraising dinners that Arif Naqvi had organised. Naqvi would be charged with fraud six years later in 2018 how could have I known about that in 2012, he added.
Mr Khan said the PTI was the first party that used political fundraising in Pakistan and added that political parties could not survive without money. He added that his party had a donor base of 40,000 whereas the PPP and PML-N don’t have a single donor.
PTI leaders outside ECP
Earlier in the day, some of the PTI leaders managed to reach outside the ECP office in Red Zone to register their protest against the chief election commissioner (CEC). They dispersed after handing a memorandum to ECP officials.
The protesters included Fawad Chaudhry, Pervez Khattak, Asad Umar, Azam Swati, Shibli Faraz, Faisal Javed Khan, Kanwal Shauzab and others.
The leaders were stopped at the headquarters’ gate by a contingent of police and Rangers personnel. They handed over a memorandum against CEC for playing an “unconstitutional, undemocratic and biased” role as the CEC.
Talking to the media outside the ECP office, Asad Umar said that the electoral body and its chief have lost credibility and the nation’s trust; hence PTI submitted a memorandum against the CEC Sultan Sikandar Raja to ECP officials for “playing an unconstitutional, undemocratic and biased role” as the CEC.
He said that the ECP was no longer functioning as a state body, but as a subsidiary of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition. He urged the CEC to resign as two provincial assemblies have already passed resolutions against ECP and have cited a lack of confidence in the body.
Separately, PTI lawmakers also gathered outside ECP offices in Karachi and Lahore.
In Lahore, PTI central Punjab chapter staged a protest demonstration against the CEC in front of the Punjab Election Commission office. The protesters led by central Punjab president Dr Yasmin Rashid chanted slogans against the election commissioner and demanded his immediate removal from the office.
In Karachi, dozens of PTI workers and supporters congregated outside the ECP regional office in Saddar to join the countrywide demonstrations. Led by former federal minister and PTI Sindh president Ali Zaidi, the protesters chanted slogans against the ECP chief and danced to the party songs.

2,NAB bill passed amid PTI uproar,PTI senators term legislation an attempt to turn NAB into “toothless” body; govt maintains bill being moved in public interest.,"ISLAMABAD: The Nati­onal Accountability (Second Amendment) Act 2022 sailed through Senate on Thursday amid strong protests by the opposition parties, especially the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) senators who termed the legislation an attempt to turn the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) into a “toothless” organisation.
The opposition resorted to protests after Minister of State for Law and Justice Shahadat Awan moved a motion seeking suspension of rules to introduce the NAB amendment bill. Mr Awan’s request was opposed by the opposition on the grounds that the coalition government wanted to save its leadership by clipping NAB’s wings. The government, however, said the bill was being moved in the public interest.
PTI leader Syed Shibli Faraz said the intent of the bill was to make NAB a “toothless organisation”, adding that it was being done by a government facing serious corruption charges, with 60 per cent of its cabinet members on bail. He said the government had no moral justification to bring forth the legislation that will directly benefit its members. “We will oppose this tooth and nail,” he remarked. He said NAB will have no jurisdiction to proceed in corruption cases involving less than Rs500 million. “If this is the standard, release all prisoners who committed corruption less than that,” he quipped.
Senator Mushtaq Ahmed of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) said a criminal law cannot be given a retrospective effect. He said under an amendment NAB would not be able to act against those who whiten their black money through amnesty schemes. “This would provide a backdoor to mafias,” he added.
Editorial: Gutting NAB
Minister of State for Law Shahadat Awan claimed he could prove that these amend­ments were being bro­ught in the public interest.
But the protest continued and the opposition senators stood up in their seats after a voice vote that allowed the house to consider the bill. They chanted slogans, ripped up copies of the agenda, and gathered around the speaker’s podium to register their disapproval. Subsequently, the opposition members walked out of the house before the bill was passed.
Tiff over ECP verdict
The upper house also witnessed a debate over the recent ruling by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) that confirmed prohibited funds were received by the PTI.
Former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani said the ECP ruled that the PTI had received funding from prohibited sources. He said the party has been found to have “received funds from over 350 foreign companies besides hiding several accounts”.
On the question of whether or not the government will file a reference seeking a ban on the PTI under Article 17, he said it was the government’s decision to choose between legal and constitutional paths. He said in his personal view, the government should proceed against Imran Khan under Article 62 (1)(f) for signing “grossly inaccurate certificates” for five consecutive years. “You can make a mistake once or twice but not for five years in a row,” he remarked. He said there should also be criminal investigations against PTI leaders who “managed hidden and disowned accounts”.
PTI’s Ejaz Chaudhry criticised the ECP’s decision saying that many of the overseas Pakistanis had been shown as foreigners in it.
PPP’s Nisar Khoro chided PTI for its insistence that foreign funding cases against all political parties should have been clubbed together. Rejecting the criticism against the chief election commissioner, he recalled that he had been appointed by the PTI itself.

3,Taliban deny knowledge of Qaeda chief’s presence,WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD: Days after US President Joe Biden announced Ayman al Zawahiri’s killing by a drone strike in...,"WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD: Days after US President Joe Biden announced Ayman al Zawahiri’s killing by a drone strike in Kabul, the Taliban said on Thursday they had no knowledge of the Al Qaeda chief’s presence in Afghanistan,.
“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has no information about Ayman al Zawahiri’s arrival and stay in Kabul,” AFP quoted an official statement as saying — the Taliban’s first mention of his name since Biden’s announcement.
Zawahiri’s assassination is the biggest blow to Al Qaeda since US special forces killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, and calls into question the Taliban’s promise not to harbour militant groups.
Thursday’s carefully phrased Taliban statement neither confirmed his presence in Afghanistan nor acknowledged his death.
“The leadership of the Islamic Emirate of Afghani­stan has instructed the intelligence agencies to hold a comprehensive and serious investigation,” it said.
“The fact that America invaded our territory and violated all international principles, we strongly condemn the action once again. If such action is repeated, the responsibility of any consequences will be on the United States of America.”
The Taliban reiterated in their statement that there was “no threat” to any country from Afghanistan’s soil.
They called on Washington to adhere to the Doha pact signed in February 2020 that paved the way for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan, ending two decades of US-led military intervention in the country.
Taliban ‘bound’ by Doha deal
Meanwhile, Zalmay Khalilzad, the former US special representative who negotiated the Doha agreement with the Taliban, has said the deal binds Kabul’s present rulers to keep anti-American terrorist groups out of their country.
A day after the drone strike, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused the Taliban of “grossly violating the [Doha] agreement — and repeated assurances to the world that they would not harbor extremists” like Zawahiri.
Mr Khalilzad, however, told National Public Radio (NPR) that Mr Blinken was correct, and the Taliban’s claim was “obviously wrong”.
“The agreement is clear. That’s in black and white,” he said.
But Graeme Smith, a senior consultant with the International Crisis Group (ICG), told Voice of America that the Doha agreement was not very clear on certain points. “One of the many problems with the Doha Agreement was the lack of mechanisms for arbitration and enforcement. There is no referee, and no specific consequences for any violations,” he said.
“So, there is nobody who can say whether the agreement is broken, and the consequences would be unclear.”
No evidence Pakistani airspace used: FO
Also on Thursday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office Spokesperson Asim Iftikhar said there was no evidence that the country’s airspace had been used for the drone strike that killed Ayman al Zawahiri.
Responding to a volley of questions about media reports claiming that the strike was carried out through intelligence sharing between Pakistan and US, and that the drone used Pakistani air space, he remarked: “There is no evidence of this action having been undertaken using Pakistan’s airspace”.
He also referred to an earlier statement issued by the Foreign Office on the incident, which had said that “Pakistan stands by countering terrorism in accordance with international law and relevant UN resolutions”.
But when journalists recalled the prior statement, asking whether he was referring to UN resolutions that authorised action inside Afghanistan few years back, the spokesperson said “We are referring to various resolutions of the UN on countering terrorism, and they encompass different aspects of counter-terrorism”.
He said there were various international obligations under these resolutions.
“Regarding Al-Qaeda, I think it is clear that it is a terrorist entity, which is listed under the UN Security Council sanctions regime and states are under obligation to take actions that are prescribed by the UN Security Council”.
He recalled that Pakistan had, in the past, taken resolute action and supported the efforts of the international community in fighting terrorism and particularly, some of the notable success against Al Qaeda was possible because of Pakistan’s role and contribution.

4,SC questions plea over ‘anti-institution’ drive,Wonders which rights have been violated that necessitate plea for restraining PTI leaders from statements against institutions.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Thursday wondered which fundamental rights have been violated that necessitated the filing of a petition against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leadership for an alleged hate campaign targeting national institutions such as the armed forces, the Supreme Court as well as the Election Commission of Pakistan.
A two-judge Supreme Court bench comprising Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Yahya Afridi took up a petition moved by Advocate Qausain Faisal through his counsel Hassan Raza Pasha pleading that the private respondents, their official spokesmen and other members of the PTI be restrained from making any public or private statement against the institutions.
The court also asked the counsel to convince it how the present matter was an issue of public importance and it could intervene under Article 184(3) against the private persons on the grounds of public interest. The court observed that it could invoke Article 204 (contempt of court) whenever it deemed appropriate by initiating a notice and taking action.
Earlier on July 18, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah had in a chamber hearing ordered the fixing of the case before an SC bench after removing the objections raised by the registrar’s office while returning the petition.

Petitioner wants PTI leaders restrained from statements against judiciary, army, ECP

The respondents in the petition were the federation through the interior secretary, the PTI, party chairman Imran Khan, former information minister Fawad Chaudhry and former human rights minister Dr Shireen Mazari among others. It had sought a direction to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, Federal Investigation Agency and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to strictly control the publication of the allegedly organised hate campaign immediately and deal with the violators and contemnors.
The petition argued that it was in public knowledge that after his ouster as the prime minister, Imran Khan had been issuing unfounded, provocative, highly defamatory and derogatory statements in his interviews, political rallies, and in the print and electronic media, including social media.
This alleged campaign, the petition argued, was designed and calculated to tarnish the public image and severely harm the good reputation of institutions like the Supreme Court and high courts, the armed forces and the ECP.
Assisted by his political cohorts, the former prime minister was continuously running a malicious, derogatory and defamatory campaign against these national institutions in the media, especially social media, which was designed to bring the national institutions into public contempt and hatred.
This would destabilise and weaken these institutions and demoralise the individuals representing these institutions, the petition feared, adding these institutions were directly responsible for the vital task of national security, administration of justice, law and order and the protection of political rights of Pakistani people.
Mr Khan organised and planned the hate campaign with the alleged administrative and financial support of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and, therefore, the private and public elements involved in organisation, logistics and running of the impugned hate campaign were no more distinguishable.
The intended impact of the hate campaign was to destabilise, weaken the working of and demoralise the institutions and their personnel, which will lead to political, economic and security uncertainty, chaos, anarchy and degeneration.
This could result in political unrest and economic turmoil in the country, the petition feared, adding the respondents were allegedly recklessly and wantonly issuing statements that damaged and continue to damage and erode Pakistan’s good relations with the established security and economic partners in the international community.
This, in itself, was a cause of grave concern as destabilisation and imbalance in relations with the security and economic partners would lead to economic and security hazards and isolate Pakistan in the comity of nations.
