6,Hamza off to London to ‘explain away Punjab by-polls drubbing’,"He'll have to satisfy Nawaz over his poor performance being the CM, Shehbaz’s flawed strategy for by-polls, says party insider.","LAHORE: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s son Hamza Shehbaz reached London on Thursday reportedly to ‘give an explanation’  to PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif about party’s humiliating defeat in the crucial by-polls in Punjab at the hands of Imran Khan’s PTI.
The elder Sharif who is upset over losing Punjab to the PTI-PML-Q alliance is said to have summoned Hamza in London for his failure to retain the chief minister office. 
“Nawaz Sharif is upset over the party’s crushing defeat in the Punjab by-polls last month, which overthrew its government making it vulnerable in the province which otherwise was considered its stronghold. Hamza will have to satisfy his uncle for his poor performance being the CM and his father (Shehbaz’s) flawed strategy in the face of Khan’s aggressive campaign during the by-polls,” a PML-N insider told Dawn. 
He said although Nawaz Sharif had been told at a party meeting about ‘reasons’ of PML-N’s defeat, he wanted to have an ‘in-person explanation’ in this regard. “Hamza will also have to explain his poor coordination with his cousin Maryam Nawaz during his short stint as CM. Hamza had not obliged Maryam in taking her recommended lawmakers in his cabinet. Besides, he also did not promptly follow Nawaz’s instructions when he was the chief minister,” the insider said.  
Awarding tickets to the PTI turncoats which left PML-N workers disgruntled and uninterested in the election campaign, coalition government’s unpopular decisions of making huge increases in petroleum and electricity prices, rising inflation and related matters were the main reasons cited for the defeat on 15 of the 20 seats of Punjab Assembly in the July 17 by-polls.  
Maryam reportedly had refused to take the blame for the party’s defeat as she was of the view that she did whatever she could by leading an aggressive campaign. However, her critics in the party said she wasted at least a week in ‘thinking’ whether to campaign for the PTI turncoats or not whereas PTI chairman Imran Khan had launched the campaign much earlier. 
According to Hamza’s political secretary Imran Goraya, the former chief minister left for London by a flight of a private airline on Thursday. During his stay, he said, Hamza would meet Nawaz. However, Goraya did not say when the PM’s son would return to the country.  
Hamza managed to leave the country after his name was removed from the no-fly list by his party’s government in the Centre. Before the PML-N-led government took over in April last, Hamza was stopped at the airport from leaving for London by the PTI government.  
Last Saturday, Hamza’s lawyer Rao Aurangzeb told a Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) special court in the money-laundering case that his client had ‘severe backache’, therefore he could not appear before it. The special court summoned PM Shehbaz and Hamza on Sept 7 for indictment in the Rs16 billion money laundering case registered against them by the FIA.  
Both of them have already been granted pre-arrest bail in the case and skipped Saturday’s hearing as their counsel filed written requests for a one-time exemption from personal appearance.
Chief Minister Parvez Elahi mocked Hamza’s departure for London. “One guarantor (of Nawaz Sharif) fled to London and let’s see when the other (Shehbaz) leaves,” CM Elahi said.

8,Consumers shocked by high electricity bills,"LAHORE: Electricity bills for July have left consumers in a state of shock. Power consumers, especially the...","LAHORE: Electricity bills for July have left consumers in a state of shock. 
Power consumers, especially the domestic ones, have sought immediate withdrawal of increases in various taxes and per unit costs so that they get relief at a time when they are facing the highest inflation rate. 
“I consumed 16 percent less energy this month from that in last month. I received Rs12,100 for the month of July,” said a resident of Ichhra. “The total electricity as mentioned in the bill was Rs7,285 for using 437 units whereas the taxes were Rs2,817 as fuel cost adjustment (FCA) and its variance were of Rs4,815. In last July (2021), I used 519 units whereas my bill was Rs10,667.” 
He said the bill of my other connection was also inflated. Lesco people say that it was due to an increase in the approved power load, he said. 
Minister for Power Khurram Dastgir Khan and Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik, in a bid to secure a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, announced on July 26 an increase in three phases starting with Rs3.50 per unit with effect from July 26 under a uniform base power tariff to generate funds of Rs900 billion during the ongoing fiscal year. 
They, in a press conference, had said the ‘tariff rebasing’ was approved by the federal cabinet under which the second phase of Rs3.50 per unit will become effective from August with a one-month gap in September, and the remaining 91 paisa per unit increase would come into force in October. They also claimed that the tariff rebasing involving Rs7.91 per unit should have been enforced in February as the previous rebasing was implemented in February 2021. 
But the previous government, according to the ministers, delayed it for political reasons. With this increase of Rs7.91 per unit, besides over Rs150bn in additional sales tax, the base national average electricity tariff would go up from Rs16.91 per unit to Rs24.82 with a financial impact of Rs893bn in 2022-23. 
“While we are already under stress due to receipt of the massive increase in the bills for the month of July, we are now hearing that the government plans to increase tariff more with effect from this month. And the increase will continue till October,” said another consumer. 
He said he used 18 percent less electricity in July as compared to June. But despite all this, he received a Rs32,000 bill for 796 units including 700 (off-peak) and 96 (peak hours). “The total cost of electricity I used is around Rs15,000. And the remaining amount included Rs10,451 as FCA. Last month, I used 880 units and I received a bill of Rs24,174. The last July (2021) bill was of Rs21,896 for using 966 units. The government must look into this problem and give us relief with immediate effect,” he said. 
A resident of Township said his last month’s bill was nearly Rs37,000. But the July bill surged to over Rs46,500. He said bill payments in instalments have also been stopped by Lesco.  
“When I approached the local area office of Lesco for phased payment, the officials said that the instalments can only be made for the bills having arrears for the previous month,” he said.

The Indus swallowed their houses and crops of some people while there is no government plan for the safety of spurs by the irrigation officials while erosion is increasing on a daily basis.   
Malik Amjad, a resident of Gabbar Arain, Khairpur Sadaat, told this correspondent the families of his relatives had left their homes. 
He said the Indus water was rising and more than 400,000 cusecs water was flowing through it. Warnings had been issued by the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and the district administration but no repair of the dykes had started, Mr Amjad bemoaned and added that the locals complained against the cold attitude of irrigation officials who did not visit the area despite complaints. 
He quoted the officials as saying that they had no emergency funds.   
An irrigation official said since 2014, the department had not been having any funds.   
Deputy Commissioner Ali Annan Qamar said erosion was a natural disaster happening every year. He said the next two days would be crucial to the people living along the Indus because the water could affect some areas. He said the water was still entering the pond areas, he said and asked AC Kot Addu Muhammad Amir to ensure evacuation from dangerous areas. He said 11 relief camps were ready but nobody was willing to shift there. 
Last year, funds were released by former CM Usman Buzdar but, the sources said, not a single penny was spent.

The possession was taken by an official team being led by Gujrat assistant commissioner Khizar Hayat Bhatti whereas officials of local land revenue department, police and PSIC were also present.
Gujrat deputy commissioner Amer Shahzad Kang told Dawn here on Thursday that the 200 acres piece of land already identified by the stakeholders had now been mutated in the name of PSIC within the revenue record as a sum of Rs280 million had already been released to the account of the district administration.
He said the mutation and possession of the land had been an important development towards the execution of the project and now in the phase II the boundary wall would be constructed at the site.
Previously efforts by some political figures in the last PML-government of Hamza Shahbaz to shift the project’s existing proposed site near Upper Jhelum Canal in Saroki along Sargodha road to another location on Bhimbher road near Mehsam finally ended after the PSIC got the possession.
The phase-II had been approved by the previous Punjab government of Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf (PTI) on the proposal of PML-Q leadership in 2021 at the cost of Rs1.32 billion and a huge sum of Rs280m had initially been allocated for land acquisition last year.
The site was selected with the consent of the leadership of Gujrat Chamber of Commerce and Industry after a hectic discussion as the local business fraternity had been demanding the establishment of phase-II for the last more than three decades.
Hundreds of small and medium scale manufacturing units of electric fans, pottery and furniture have been operating from the residential localities of Gujrat city due to the non-availability of the specific area after the existing industrial area had been filled until 1990.
It is learnt that after the possession of land now the construction of boundary wall around the site will be done for which the tendering process is initiated by the concerned authorities and then road and other required infrastructures will be built as Punjab Small Industries Corporation (PSIC) is determined to complete the execution at the earliest.
The Punjab government had also established a new police station in the name of industrial area police station last year whereas several other road infrastructure projects are also under way around the site near Saroki.

In a press conference, he said the ‘Charter of Economy’ was imperative for the economic survival of Pakistan and all political parties must realise the gravity of the situation and sign it in the greater interest of the country. 
“The unprecedented appreciation of the dollar is the main cause to destabilise the economy which is directly influenced with the prevailing political uncertainty,” he said and added the value of their capital had recorded a steep decline and their assets had now been reduced to almost nil. 
He said the business community would suffer in the current situation by running their factories or shops and hence they had decided to close down their businesses. He said the government was playing the role of a silent spectator while dollar appreciation coupled with heavy taxation, hike in interest rate, tariffs of electricity, gas and petrol further increased their cost of production and they had been forced to close down their businesses to save them from further losses. 
He said that in this abysmal situation, the FBR was also harassing the business community by serving them notices. He said it was a pity that an industrial unit of Rs10 million had received a notice of Rs10.25m. He said political parties must play their role to eliminate prevailing uncertainty and if they failed to do so, we would be constrained to boycott them. 
He warned that 1.2m workers would be rendered jobless in Faisalabad alone if the industrial wheel came to a halt. He said political parties must sign the charter of the economy to save the dwindling economy.  
He criticised banks that were plundering businessmen in the wake of dollar appreciation. He demanded the government must conduct an impartial forensic audit of banks and those found guilty of unfair practices may be punished with heavy penalties or cancellation of their licences. 
He said political parties failing to sign the charter may face a boycott from the business community. He reiterated that the business community had no political motives and their effort was only to save the country from a default-like situation.

15,Two approach roads to Khalifa Bridge await completion,Officials say the project may take two more years to complete...,"RAHIM YAR KHAN: Despite the completion of His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bridge (HHSKB) over the River Indus seven years ago, the construction of its two approach roads is yet to complete.
However, the officials concerned expect that the roads would be completed in 2024.  
The bridge was completed in 2015 with the funds provided by the United Arab Emirates authorities mainly to facilitate movement of the UAE’s royals from Rahim Yar Khan district to the hunting areas in Rojhan tehsil near Arabi Tibba in Rajanpur district.
The 1,032 meters long bridge could not be approached by ordinary vehicles due to the rough terrain and poor road infrastructure in the area.  
Last week, South Punjab Communications and Works (C&W) Secretary Altaf Baloch visited the area, where he was briefed on the progress on construction work of two approach roads by officials of the Punjab Highway Department (PHD), Frontier Works Organization (FWO) and Nespak. 

Officials say the project may take two more years to complete

The secretary ordered the concerned departments to complete the roads construction work at the earliest.
Highways Executive Engineer Syed Husnain Zaidi told Dawn that one of the 32-foot-wide approach roads was being constructed from Minchan Spur to HHSKB, while the other having 11km length would link Rojhan city to the bridge.  
He said the main purpose of these roads was to connect the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M-5) with the Indus Highway (N-55), so that RY Khan district could not only be connected with Rajanpur district, but also with Dera Bugti and Sui areas of Balochistan.
He said that after the completion of these approach roads in June 2024, the existing 124km distance between RY Khan and Rojhan would be reduced to only 44km.  
He said that River Diversion Work (RDW) was in progress and the main creek of the River Indus would be narrowed through developing a new spur to complete the approach roads.  
He said that during the rainy season the construction work of the approach roads had to be suspended due to high flow in the river, adding that the departments concerned would resume the work after around six months.
