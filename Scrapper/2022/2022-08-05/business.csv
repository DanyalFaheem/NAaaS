0,Govt puts tighter fiscal controls in place,Bans additional funds for development or current expenditure.,"ISLAMABAD: For ensuring tight fiscal control, the government has put restrictions on technical supplementary grants (TSGs) in the first quarter and imposed a ban on supplementary expenditure, both for developmental and current expenditure, throughout the current fiscal year, except in extreme and exceptional cases.
“To remain within the approved budgetary allocation, no additional funds through a supplementary grant (SG) shall be considered by the Finance Division during the CFY,” said the Ministry of Finance on Thursday, adding that “only under extreme and exceptional circumstances, the cases may be considered” and that too under strict conditions.
In an office memorandum to all the government ministries, divisions and related departments, the Ministry of Finance also explained the extreme conditions to be fulfilled by the principal accounting officers (PAOs) of all ministries and divisions before seeking supplementary allocations.
Before seeking supplementary grants, it would have to be certified by the relevant federal secretaries or other principal accounting officers that no funds could be made available through re-appropriation and TSG and that all avenues had been exhausted. This would also have to be verified by the relevant accounting officers. The principal accounting officer would have to provide valid justification and cogent reasons for demanding the special grants.

Bans additional funds for development or current expenditure

This would be examined by the expenditure wing or concerned wing of the finance ministry and make a recommendation or otherwise to the budget wing.
Likewise, the cases of the TSGs shall not be considered during the first quarter of the current fiscal year. Unlike supplementary grants that involve additional funding requirements beyond the budget approved by the parliament, TSGs are the transfer of funds from one head to another within the budgetary allocations of a respective ministry or a division and do not entail additional funding.
Utilisation of budgetary allocations
However, the cases of TSG shall be processed after fulfillment of provisions of the Public Finance Management (PFM) Act 2019 and Financial Management and Powers of Principal Accounting Officers Regulations 2021.
Under the revised procedure, the request for the provision of funds through the TSG shall be submitted to the Expenditure Wing of the Ministry of Finance for examination after being duly approved and certified by the PAO. The PAO and the expenditure wing of the finance ministry would also provide an up-to-date budget utilisation report under the systems, applications & products (SAP) system report, availability of matching funds under other demands, or certificate regarding non-availability of saving in other demands under the control of PAO.
The expenditure wing shall examine the TSG cases in detail and submit recommendations, either in support or otherwise of the proposal, with valid grounds and justifications for consideration by the Budget Wing of the Finance Division that shall process the cases in the light of the SAP system report, recommendation of Expenditure Wing and availability of funds before submission to Finance Secretary for consideration.
The TSG cases relating to Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), after meeting the above requirements would be processed through the Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Division. On approval of funds through TSG from the Federal Cabinet, the PAO shall submit the schedule of TSG, duly endorsed by the Expenditure Wing of Finance Division, along with copies of the approved summary and decision of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, ratification of the Cabinet and surrender order Budget Wing of Finance Division for entry in SAP system. The memorandum said the funds approved through TSG shall be released by Finance Division keeping in view the fund availability in line with the release strategy. Likewise, no proposal for the TSG shall be processed in any case during the last month of the financial year.
Moreover, the finance ministry has also made it clear to all the ministries that re-appropriation of funds shall only be allowed, within an approved demand for grant and appropriation, from one “Head of Account” to another “Head of Account”, provided that no re-appropriation shall be made from Employees Related Expenses (ERE) to any other “Head of Account” (Non-ERE).

1,REITs see flurry of activity after regulatory changes,REITs operate like any other company but offer a higher degree of transparency to investors because trustees control all assets.,"KARACHI: Arif Habib Dolmen REIT Management Ltd is going to launch as many as four real estate investment trusts (REITs) within the next quarter, according to company CEO Muhammad Ejaz.
REITs are collective investment schemes that take money from investors and deploy it in real estate projects.
Speaking to Dawn on the sidelines of a corporate event on Thursday, Mr Ejaz said his company has already launched nine REITs, including two rental ones that aim to generate rental income.
REITs operate like any other company but offer a higher degree of transparency to investors because trustees — not developers — control all assets. The entity must list on a stock exchange within three years of inception — a feature that lets small investors take exposure to an otherwise capital-intensive and illiquid real estate market.
After the first REIT-based transaction that securitised and sold Dolmen Mall Clifton and the adjoining Harbor Front building for Rs22.2 billion in 2015, the REIT sector remained dormant for nearly six years. REIT managers blamed the absence of transactions on unfavourable changes in the tax and regulatory regimes that discouraged investors from taking part in REITs.
But the State Bank of Pakistan, Federal Board of Revenue and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan changed gear and made it attractive for investors, particularly banks, to put money in the real estate sector through REIT-based transactions.
The move yielded immediate results. TPL Properties Ltd, a subsidiary of TPL Corporation, recently achieved financial close of its first REIT fund.
Similarly, Arif Habib Dolmen REIT Management Ltd announced a few months back it is developing two housing projects in Surjani, a middle-income neighbourhood in Karachi. In addition, it has created three other REITs that’ll develop as many housing projects within Naya Nazimabad, a 1,300-acre gated colony set up on the northern outskirts of Karachi. The company has also come up with two rental and two developmental REITs in Lahore.
JS Group also announced last month the launch of its first REIT fund. Al Meezan Investment Management Ltd, the asset management subsidiary of Meezan Bank, has recently acquired a licence to run a REIT business.
“We have many new projects in the pipeline under the REIT structure,” said Ariful Islam, chairman of the asset management company, while speaking at the signing of a Musharaka agreement of Meezan Bank with Globe Residency REIT, the firm through which Arif Habib Dolmen REIT Management is building a multi-tower residential project in Naya Nazimabad with an indicative size of Rs18bn.
What changed?
The back-to-back rollout of REITs in a short span of time after years of no activity is reflective of the favourable changes to regulations. For instance, the SBP changed its capital adequacy benchmarks by “significantly lowering the applicable risk weight” from 200 per cent to 100pc on banks that invest in the units of REITs.
Similarly, banks can now invest up to 15pc of their equity into REITs as opposed to the earlier 10pc upper limit. Also, banks can now count their investments in REIT units towards their mandatory targets for housing and construction finance. In other words, investing in the shares of listed REITs for banks is now as good as loaning out money to home buyers.
“We’ll start listing our REITs as soon as the stock market situation improves,” said Mr Ejaz, noting that his company’s seven developmental REITs that have already been launched have a collective project cost of Rs450bn.

2,Limited options for car buyers,"Among Japanese brands, Honda is the only choice in view of booking closure of Toyota and Suzuki vehicles from May 18 and July 1.","KARACHI: If a consumer is afraid of further price increases and chooses to buy locally assembled vehicles, he/she has the option of Korean and Chinese-assembled vehicles. Among the Japanese brands, Honda is the only choice in view of the booking closure of Toyota and Suzuki vehicles from May 18 and July 1, respectively.
Booking is now open for Honda City, Civic, and BR-V models, but getting the keys to the Honda Civic by May 2023 will undoubtedly be a test of the buyer’s patience.
According to a dealer, the Honda Civic, Civic Oriel, and Turbo RS models will be delivered in May 2023, while the BR-V will be delivered in September or October if ordered today.
He also stated that the Honda City Aspire, City MT, and PT models will be delivered in October/November of this year.
In Kia vehicles, the Picanto Manual Transmission is ready for sale on a full payment option, while a consumer needs to pay full payment to get ready delivery of the Stonic EX and EX plus models. However, Picanto Automatic’s booking is on hold.
The Kia Sportage Alpha is being delivered in one month with full payment, while the delivery schedule of the Sportage FWD model is two months with partial payment. A buyer would get the Sportage AWD model in October after booking the vehicle on partial payment.
On full payment, the Sorento 2.4 FWD, 2.4 AWD, and 3.5 AWD will be ready for delivery in 10-15 days.
Dealers of Hyundai Nishat in Lahore and Karachi said that all the vehicles, including the most popular Tucson, are ready for delivery in the current month on full payment.
An official at Master Changan Motors said that barring Oshan vehicles, the company is taking orders for Alsvin and Karavan vehicles. The delivery time of Alsvin is approximately two months, followed by three months for Karavaan.
According to a Regal Automobile Industries Limited (RAIL) official, booking for Prince Pearl cars and DSFK Glory SUVs on partial payment is now open, and customers will receive the vehicles in 30-45 days.
Due to restrictions imposed by the State Bank of Pakistan on opening LCs for CKD imports, which resulted in parts shortages, Indus Motor Company (IMC) closed advance bookings on May 18, 2022, and Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited (PSMCL) followed suit on July 1, 2022.As a result, IMC has started observing non-production days from August 1–13, 2022, while Pak Suzuki has hinted at production shutting down due to problems in clearing parts from the port.
Pak Suzuki increased vehicle prices by Rs314,000-661,000 beginning August 1, 2022.
Master Changan Motors Limited has also surged the prices by 400,000 to Rs1.399m, while RAIL surged the rates of Prince Pearl cars 800cc to Rs 1.920m on August 1, 2022, from 1.586m. The new prices of the Glory Pro, Glory 1.5T and 1.8 models are Rs 6.550m, Rs6.105m and Rs6.256m as compared to Rs5.400m, Rs5.009m and Rs5.160m.
In July, Kia Lucky Motor Limited and Hyundai Nishat Motors pushed up prices by up to Rs1.1m on various models, followed by Rs590,000 to Rs3.12m by IMC and Rs785,000 to Rs1.450m by Honda Atlas Cars Limited.

3,Bank of England unveils biggest rate hike since 1995,Forecasts recession as inflation soars.,"LONDON: Britain will sink into a lengthy recession later this year as inflation rockets even higher, the Bank of England forecast on Thursday as it unveiled the biggest interest rate hike since 1995.
The move comes as Britons endure a cost-of-living crisis that has dominated the race to succeed Boris Johnson following his resignation as prime minister.
The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 to lift its key rate by 0.50 percentage points to 1.75 percent, it said in a statement.
Most policymakers felt that a  “more forceful policy action was justified” than in previous meetings to combat rampant inflation fuelled by rocketing domestic energy bills.

Forecasts recession as inflation soars

The BoE is the latest central bank to ramp up its rates as countries around the world battle decades-high consumer prices that have soared since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.
“I have huge sympathy for those who are struggling and are asking why we’re making it even harder,” bank governor Andrew Bailey said at a news conference.
“All I can say is the alternative is worse,” he said.
‘Winter is coming’ 
UK inflation was predicted to peak this year at just over 13 percent, reaching the highest level since 1980. The BoE’s chief task is to keep inflation close to a target of 2pc.
The bank said wholesale gas prices have nearly doubled since May due to Russia restricting supplies to Europe, warning that this will  “exacerbate” the fall in real incomes and further increase inflation in the near term.
The bank now anticipates the UK economy will enter a painful recession in the fourth quarter that will last until late 2023.
The UK economy is expected to shrink by up to 2.1pc in size from its highest point, according to the forecast.
“Winter is coming, and it’s shaping up to be an absolute horror show for the UK economy,” said Laith Khalaf, analyst at AJ Bell, an investment platform.

4,Rupee gains more weight against dollar,KARACHI: The rupee continued its recovery drive for the fifth consecutive session against the US dollar on Thursday...,"KARACHI: The rupee continued its recovery drive for the fifth consecutive session against the US dollar on Thursday as it gained another Rs2.65 in the interbank market.
The currency market dealers said the dollar closed further lower at Rs226.15 from Rs228.80 the previous day when the local currency appreciated by a record single-day gain of Rs9.58 or 4.19 per cent.
This major gain by the rupee has brought exchange rate stability as currency dealers feel that the fluctuations would not be as volatile as were witnessed in July when the greenback gained over 13 per cent in a single month against the local currency.
The dollar was losing in the wake of some major developments and statements from the government and the State Bank of Pakistan. The key development was the satisfactory reply from the IMF which said that Pakistan met the preconditions for approval of loans in the meeting scheduled to be held on Aug 24.
The low imports and sharp decline in trade deficit in July encouraged local currency to reclaim its lost space. 
However, the currency dealers were not sure how long the current appreciation of the rupee was sustainable as the inflows are still in pipeline in the form of promises.  The finance minister has again sought to reassure the market that dollar inflows are expected shortly while the State Bank says the rupee is undervalued.
Currency dealers said the market sentiments have changed during the last week which supports the local currency while discouraging the speculators who were taking undue advantage of the vulnerable exchange rate. 
The currency dealers maintained that the inflows of export proceeds continued for the last five days which was one of the main reasons for the higher availability of dollars in the market. The open market reported that the dollar lost another Rs3 to trade at Rs226.
SBP reserves fall 
The State Bank of Pakistan said its reserves decreased by $190m to $8.385 billion during the week ended on July 29 due to external debt and other payments.
The foreign reserves held by commercial banks were $5.823bn while the country’s total reserves were $14.208bn.
