0,Growers get official price of sugar cane; millers lose appeal against notification,"This time around, cane procurement process continued smoothly...","HYDERABAD: Most sugar mills have completed crushing of sugar cane and rest are nearing closure. 
Sugar millers have lately lost their case against Sindh government’s notification fixing cane procurement price at Rs250 per 40kg for the 2021-22 season.
Millers had filed a joint petition against the notification but Sindh High Court’s single judge bench rejected the petition, upholding the notification. 
Mostly mills continued the cane crushing process without any major issue over price controversy this year when compared with past seasons. Previously, they had suspended the process pleading that they were facing ‘no cane’ situation. 
The crushing season in lower Sindh begins by November and usually the Matiari Sugar Mills takes lead in commencement of crushing by lighting up their boilers first.

This time around, cane procurement process continued smoothly

Sugar cane producers claim that on an average Rs250 per kilo was paid by sugar mills this year although the rate over and above the notified one was also recorded in different areas. 
Around 32 out of 38 sugar mills had crushed cane in Sindh. At present, six or seven mills are busy crushing. Sugar cane rate of Rs202 was fixed by Sindh government for the 2020-21 season.
“Hardly 5pc cane may be available for crushing now as the season is drawing to a close,” says Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB) vice president Mehmood Nawaz Shah. He said mills this year did not suspend crushing although they did make an attempt to get the price notification revised downward. But they lost their case, he pointed out.
Crop production
Sugar cane crop is grown on around 280,000ha across Sindh. Cultivation of the crop had been witnessing ups and downs over the last few years. Millers delay crushing arguing that they could not start the process because the crop was not ready for harvesting. Grower dispute their claim, saying that the crop had always been ready for harvesting and crushing in October but millers intentionally wanted to cause panic among farmers so that they could exploit situation by paying less to farmers.
“Initially, a rate of Rs300 and even Rs360 per 40kg was paid by millers till Jan 10, 2022 this season against Sindh government’s notified rate of Rs250. But onwards the rate was decreased as millers paid only Rs250,” said Nabi Bux Sathio, the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture vice president. Nadeem Shah, a Matiari-based cane grower, also subscribed to Sathio’s claim and mentioned that he got an average price of Rs280 this year. He supplied cane to Matiari, Army, Abadgar and Shah Murad sugar mills.
Sathio, however, contended mills’ cartelisation policy that deprives growers a fair price of their crop. “Growers can’t hold their crop in the fields beyond mid-February due to temperature variation and factor of water flows availability and this enables millers to exploit farmers,” he observed. 
Sugar rate in Ramazan 
According to him, sweetener’s rate would increase in the holy month of Ramazan. “Sugar was available for Rs85 a kilo in retail market and I think this price will now hover around Rs90 a kilo in the days to come,” he said.
In retail market, sweetener’s price varied also. According to a trader, Sikandar Rajput, he got a 50kg bag of sugar (Ansari sugar mills) for Rs3,920 (wholesale rate) while another bag (of Matiari sugar mills) was purchased for Rs4,300. This takes wholesale price of sweetener to Rs78.40 and Rs86 a kilo in wholesale and retail market, respectively. “The price trend shows that retail market may show an increase in the sugar price in Ramazan,” he feared.
A Matiari sugar mills representative, Dost Mohammad Baloch, said that above-mentioned difference was surprising otherwise Re1 or Rs2 difference was understandable. “We, however, cherish quality of sweetener the most at our plant,” he said.
Premium issue 
SAB leader believed that millers perhaps intended to get some favour through court by filing this petition in order to tackle the quality premium issue of growers. “Had the Sindh High Court revised the price notification downward for this year, the millers would have adjusted the rate paid over and above the notified one towards past liabilities including those of quality premium,” Mr Mehmood asserted.
He said that there were cases in last crushing season where mills issued cane purchase receipt (CPR) with a note that price over and above notified rate would be adjusted towards past and present liabilities.
Sindh’s millers owe a whopping over Rs44bn — assessed for 1998-99 to 2018-19 periods two years back by Sindh cane commissioner’s office for submission before SHC — to sugarcane growers of Sindh after millers lost their appeal in apex court against judgement of Sindh High Court in favour of sugarcane growers, requiring millers to pay quality premium to growers.
Payment of quality premium gets due when sucrose recovery crosses benchmark in any mills of Sindh. Sindh’s benchmark for sucrose recovery is 8.7pc which is determined on overall sugar recovery basis of each mills. 
In Sindh, the premium is paid on each 0.1pc of sucrose above 8.7pc benchmark at the rate of 50 paisa per 40kg. The millers had challenged SHC’s verdict in Supreme Court in late 90s but eventually lost the appeal in March 2018. Since then quality premium’s dues have been accumulating.

3,"Coal miners to get health insurance, says minister","KARACHI: Over 16,000 mine workers’ lives remain at risk due to accidents that frequently happen during mining at...","KARACHI: Over 16,000 mine workers’ lives remain at risk due to accidents that frequently happen during mining at around 1,230 coal mines in Lakhra and Jhimpir. 
Sources told Dawn that there were around 12,000 such labourers engaged by more than 80 companies at 910 coal mines at the Lakhra coal fields and around 4,000 at 320 coal mines hired by 50 companies at Jhimpir mines.
Speaking to Dawn, Energy Minister Imtiaz Ahmed Sheikh said on Saturday that the provincial government had decided to introduce an insurance facility to provide complete coverage for the medical treatment of the miners who would suffer injuries in such incidents.
He said that an agreement had recently been signed with an insurance company for the health coverage of the Lakhra coal mines’ workers. “Such facility will also be provided to labourers of the Jhimpir mines,” he added.
The minister said the health insurance facility was being introduced as per the vision of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
He said the Sindh government was willing to extend health insurance coverage to the labourers associated with all conventional mining sites across the province.
“The leases granted to those companies’ owners would be cancelled who would fail to ensure safety and welfare of their workers,” he said.
Sindh Lakhra Coal Mining Company CEO Khadim Hussain Channa has, meanwhile, said that all necessary emergency relief and rescue services, including a dispensary and ambulance, are available at the mining site for the miners who get injured in accidents during the mining process.
He said that the insurance facility would also cover compensation for accidental deaths.

4,Mirpurkhas BISE employees’ record ‘missing’ amid NAB probe,"MIRPURKHAS: Several employees of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE), Mirpurkhas, whose ...","MIRPURKHAS: Several employees of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE), Mirpurkhas, whose personal files had reportedly gone missing over a year ago, fear someone may tamper with their official data to implicate them in fabricated cases. 
Ghulam Ahmed Arain, deputy secretary of the BISE’s establishment branch that is responsible for handling the employees’ record, said that the branch’s in-charge had informed BISE chairman Barkat Ali A. Haidery last year that many files, including those containing communication with the National Accountability Bureau, provincial ombudsman, details of the meetings of the board of governors, finance committee, proceedings of appointment and promotion committee and personal files of over 20 employees had gone missing since they were handed over to the board’s acting secretary Anisuddin Siddique. His office had not yet returned the files, Mr Arain said.
The chairman had then ordered an inquiry into the files’ disappearance but to no avail. Many affected employees complained to him that their official documents were still in the possession of the acting secretary, said Mr Arain. 
He alleged that the acting secretary had hatched a conspiracy to instigate employees against him by informing them that it was he who had passed on information about their appointment to NAB authorities, which were probing illegal appointments in the board. 
He, therefore, submitted a written complaint to the chairman, DIG of Mirpurkhas, and other authorities concerned and informed them that a NAB reference was filed in accountability court Hyderabad against several board officers with regard to illegal appointments and a judgement had been passed against them in the past. 
He said that NAB Karachi had obtained official record from the then secretaries, Barkat Qureshi and Rana Javed Yousuf, and the present acting secretary, Mohammad Siddique but the court never summoned him at any stage which proved that he was not custodian of the official record. Compliance of the judgement was in progress as per directives of the controlling authority, he said.
He said that all personal files of the employees, including the documents of NAB reference (No25/2016), were in the custody of the acting secretary, but the affected employees were holding him (Mr Arain) responsible, which was causing unbearable stress and mental torture to him. If anything happened to him, the acting secretary should be held responsible for it, he warned. 
The acting secretary Mr Siddique was unavailable for comments.

The issue of unauthorised demolition and construction work on Tahirbhoy Muhammadali Building was highlighted by Marvi Mazhar, an architect and researcher who also specialises in restoring historical buildings, on social media.
Sources said that the Meethadar police had registered a case against Saifuddin and Zakiuddin and their unknown associates under Section 18 of the Sindh Cultural Heritage (Preservation) Act on the complaint of an employee of the culture, tourism and antiquities department.
They said that the heritage building was owned by a woman whose employees had illegally started the demolition work on the protected site.

6,Mugging trauma leaves victims scarred for life,Citizens share harrowing experiences of street crimes.,"KARACHI: Hands trembling in fear and eyes seeking the life of her daughter, who was held at gunpoint, Ms Hashmi gave away all her belongings, including her beloved gold earrings and nose pin, to the robber.  
“My seven-year-old girl was on the other side of the gun. He threatened to shoot her,” shared Ms Hashmi as she recalled the robbery incident that happened with her back in 2007.  
“I was scared, but I did not exactly know what happened. I kept asking my mother when the uncle [suspect] would return her earrings, since I liked them,” Ms Hashmi’s daughter, who had been held at gunpoint, said.  
“My nani [maternal grandmother] was so traumatised that she did not let anyone in the family wear gold throughout her life after that incident,” she told Dawn.
“It has been 15 years; we still are not allowed to use mobile phones while in the car. We are not allowed to use public transport. I come home around 12am from the office, and she [mother] waits for me by the gate,” she added.  

Citizens share harrowing experiences of street crimes

It is more or less the story of every Karachiite who has gone through similar experiences in their lives. Karachi, in recent times, has seen a surge in street crimes and people who have been a victim to it are reliving their traumas.  
Helplessness
One of those includes Roshail, 20, who was looted inside an ATM (automated teller machine) room near Abul Hasan Ispahani road in August, 2020.  
“I went inside the ATM room, completed my transaction, and as soon as I pulled the gate, two armed men rushed in, hit me, turned me to the wall, pointed the gun on my back, and started emptying my pockets,” Roshail told Dawn.  
“I started getting scared of walking at night, and especially going to the ATMs. Even seeing some men on bikes would give me creeps. I stopped using mobile phone for a while and disconnected with the world a bit,” he added.  
Getting goosebumps with fear while recalling the incident, he said: “I still get anxious just thinking about it. I cross that exact spot every single day, and that has not changed anything about how it makes me feel.” 
Expressing helplessness, he said: “I could have been one of those [killed]. I would have died that day. It was entirely up to them to shoot me or not.” 
The street criminals in Karachi continue to rob citizens of their personal belongings and psychological peace.  
Motorcycle theft 
According to the data shared by Citizens-Police Liaison Committee, 4,486 bikes had been robbed in the month of February, with 2,199 citizens being deprived of their mobile phones. 
Muhammad Bilal, 21, is one of the victims who lost his motorcycle last month. The F. B Area resident was on his way back home from university when two motorcyclists intercepted him near Imtiaz Super Market, Gulshan-i-Iqbal around 9.40pm on Feb 28.  
He bought the bike two years ago, and being a bike lover, was obsessed with it. “I don’t exactly know how I feel. All I know is that I don’t want to buy another bike now,” he added, expressing his powerlessness.  
The powerlessness and vulnerability against the robbers was found common among all victims.  
The victims who encounter helplessness resort to the negative behaviour in life, former chairperson of Karachi University Department of Psychology, Prof Dr Anila Amber Malik told Dawn.  
“The victims modify their behaviour in a negative manner and develop a negative approach towards life,” she said.  
Commenting on the social impact of the victim, she said: “The victims often develop racism and avoid ethnic groups which they think robbed them of.”
“The victims feel emotions of fear, agony, anger and depression. They get flashbacks of the incident, awake at midnight, experience sweating, etc. The financial loss and psychological scar make them extra cautious which shows negative redefinition of their behaviours,” she added.  
Referring to the possible way out, she said: “There is no categorical solution for all the victims. It totally depends on the symptoms witnessed in them. However, behavioural therapy, behavioural modification and cognitive restructuring are a few ways that I can mention.”  
CPLC data suggests that 4,327 bikes were snatched in the month of January alone. 
In the last 12 months, from March 2021 to Feb 2022, 2,155 cars were stolen and snatched, 52,007 bikes were robbed off, and a total of 26,078 mobiles were snatched from citizens of the metropolis.

8,Bulls imported from Brazil die of lumpy skin disease at govt farm in Karachi's Korangi,Livestock chief denies report of disease outbreak in buffaloes.,"KARACHI: Several exotic bulls as well as local cows have died of lumpy skin disease at a government cattle farm in Korangi in recent weeks amid conflicting reports about the disease affecting buffaloes, it emerged on Saturday.
According to sources, out of the 17 bulls the government imported last year, only three to four animals now survive at the cattle farm.
“One animal was found dead in its cage on arrival at the airport. Later, three to four animals died due to mismanagement at the farm, while several others died of lumpy skin disease,” a senior veterinary official said.
Only one Brahman and three Friesian bulls had been left out of the animals imported last year for the semen production unit, he added.

Livestock chief denies report of disease outbreak in buffaloes

The lumpy skin disease, sources said, had also affected indigenous breeds, the Red Sindhi and Thari bulls, at the farm and killed at least four animals. Some of the infected cows were recovering.
Conflicting reports
Te sources said that there were few cases of disease outbreak in Sindh but the farmers fearing a steep fall in milk prices were not highlighting the issue.
A senior vet in Cattle Colony said he had not heard of any such case since the LSD outbreak. “In fact, LSD cases in cows have also reduced drastically here. I haven’t come across a single case today at the 10 farms I visited.”
Some vets in the interior parts of Sindh, on the condition of anonymity, however, said the disease had just started affecting buffaloes. They couldn’t provide specific information about the affected farms, though.
Rejecting these reports, director general-livestock Dr Nazeer Kalhoro said the disease could affect buffaloes but so far there was no such case in buffaloes in Sindh.
About the exotic cattle, he said 12 bulls and not 17 were imported last year from Brazil.
“Yes, one animal was found dead on arrival for which the supplier was responsible. We only paid for the animals that were received alive upon arrival,” he said, adding that each animal cost Rs7 million on import.
He admitted that a few animals died due to mismanagement on which two officials were suspended.
“Inquiries into the case are still continuing. There were only two deaths due to LSD while seven animals are recovering,” he said, explaining official mismanagement pertained to poor quality feed and water provided to the animals.

Some enchanting floral arrangements displayed in the exhibition.—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

 
KARACHI: In celebration of their golden jubilee, the Floral Art Society of Pakistan’s Gardenia and Jasmine Chapters presented a spectacular floral exhibition aptly titled Creativity Unfolds at a local hotel here on Saturday.  
It was interesting to reach the exhibition earlier than usual and quietly follow around the judges who were assessing the arrangements. Some arrangements were being given extra points for creative use of colour or textural diversity and others for the good use of foliage or if it was a new concept in creativity.  
Farhana Azim from the Magnolia Chapter in Islamabad had flown in just to attend the celebration and also do an arrangement, too. She had an arrangement using green peas and chrysanthemums on a copper pipe structure, which was catching much attention from the judges. “We play around with beauty and introduce it to others,” she told Dawn. “Plants have a soul, my grandmother used to say. My grandfather also liked flowers and my grandmother made sure that every room and table in the house has some kind of arrangement or a plant. And it has been going on in our family since then,” she smiled.  
Another big arrangement was done by Farida Kalim from the Jasmine Chapter. She had named it ‘Treasures of the sea’ and it was also being liked quite a bit by the judges.  
Naushaba Khalil, one of the judges, said that the Floral Art Society of Pakistan celebrates its anniversary every year by holding a fundraiser event such as this. “This year the occasion is extra special since it is our golden jubilee year. Earlier, we have directed the proceeds from our events for thalassemia patients or for organisations that fight blindness or work for the deaf and mute or any other illness or condition. This year our proceeds will go to the Shaukat Khanum Cancer Research Hospital,” she informed.  
Another judge had arrived from Singapore. Harijanto Setiawan said that he was glad to see such great flower arrangements and so many ladies here involved in the art. “It is encouraging to see people from Pakistan sharing their happiness through their creative flower arrangements. In Singapore, we call this friendship through flowers. Flowers are the best of companions and friends that one can have. They make everything beautiful and elate your mood,” he smiled.  
As the title of the exhibition suggested, ‘creativity’ really was ‘unfolded’ in the way the arrangements were done. Someone had used a long leaf to create a turban, someone else had created an entire female form leaning back with long hair made from putting leaves, grass, shrubs, flowers and tree bark to good use, and there were so many more. But there was also one arrangement done in mostly white that reminded of all the members of the Floral Art Society that have passed on over the years. It was a sweet arrangement that melted the heart.

This year the day is dedicated to the theme “Early Warning and Early Action”.
“The incident [Murree tragedy] reminded us how important it is to connect all stakeholders and translate early warning into early action,” noted chief meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz, highlighting the significance of improved multi-hazard early warning systems in preventing and minimising human loss and damage to infrastructure.
It might be recalled that early this year at least 22 people, including 10 children, were frozen to death in their vehicles when a snowstorm hit the hilly station on Jan 8, leaving thousand other tourists stranded on roads. The met office had issued an alert on Jan 5, about the extreme weather that, it said, might result in road closures in several areas.
“The role of local administration, disaster management and relief authorities, and the media is crucial when it comes to early action. And, this subject of concern has assumed greater significance in recent years due to climate change.”
He pointed out that Pakistan had ranked 8th in the list of most vulnerable countries to climate change, and the met department’s data showed that almost the entire country was experiencing a rise in temperature.
Sharing details of the met department’s recent initiatives, Dr Sarfaraz said two latest weather surveillance radars had been installed in Islamabad and Karachi, whereas preparations were underway to put in place two more in Sukkur and Multan.
“These four radars would effectively cover the eastern side of the country by providing timely information about extreme weather events such as storms and torrential rains.”
Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) Director General Sahibzad Khan said the department had also established a YouTube channel and a mobile App, where latest information was available in user-friendly local languages, especially for farmers and tourists.
“Frequency of occurrence of extreme weather events has increased five times [in the world]. As many as 11,000 disasters over the past five decades have been linked to weather, climate and water-related hazards,” he told the audience, while citing a WMO report.
Former PMD director Muhammad Musleh Uddin spoke about the improvement and advances that took place in weather and climate prediction over the years.
Part of the programme was an exhibition at the Institute of Meteorology & Geophysics (IMG), Met Complex, featuring several conventional and modern meteorological, seismological instruments, weather maps, and various astronomical, hydrological and climatological products.

12,Relationship blues,"KARACHI: Although the man-woman (romantic) relationship has always been a beautifully enigmatic one, in the 21st...","KARACHI: Although the man-woman (romantic) relationship has always been a beautifully enigmatic one, in the 21st century the subject is being discussed with renewed vigour and seen through a new prism — the TV series Modern Love on Amazon Prime is a fine example. Now only history will decide whether it’s to the detriment or benefit of the sexes.  
Na Mukammal, the fourth drama staged on Thursday evening at the ongoing Young Directors Festival organised by the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa), written and directed by Hasnain Raza, touches upon the same topic.  
As can be gauged from the title, Na Mukammal, the storyline hints at the ‘incomplete’ nature (and one is using the word nature with caution) of the above-mentioned relationship. Let’s state at the outset that the young Raza’s heart is in the right place. He appears to have learnt well during his training at the academy that it’s ‘conflict’ that makes the plot of a story interesting. The weaving of the tale, albeit a trifle old school, is also noteworthy.  
An old man (Moazzam Malik) overstays at a library and the young librarian Bilal (Shahrukh Arif) first tries to convince him to go away because the weather is inclement, and when that doesn’t happen they strike up a conversation which leads to flashback: Qasim (Hussain Abbas) and Noor (Ayesha Bakhtiar) are a couple who develop a deep mistrust because Noor has received letters from a boy from her past. As a result, they part ways. The return to the library scene suggests a connection between the boy and the old man. 
Na Mukammal is the second play that this writer has watched at the festival. While Raza should be commended for his love of theatre, it seems that the two things that Napa in the past was very particular about — Urdu diction and voice projection — are not deemed as important as they used to be. If the director had paid a tad more attention to these two aspects, his effort would have been worthier than it already is.  
And for all the young theatre practitioners out there, when it comes to creativity Aristotle’s golden words from his magnificent thesis Poetics can help: metaphor is the one thing that cannot be learnt from others.

PPP Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro said in a press statement issued here on Saturday that the key event at Bhuttos’ mausoleum had been put off out of respect for Ramazan. The day would now be observed in all district headquarters to pay homage to Z.A. Bhutto and eulogise his dynamic leadership at Iftar gatherings, he said.
He said the party’s elected representatives up to union council level would participate in the gatherings. PPP was still waiting for a verdict on the reference filed by Asif Ali Zardari requesting the apex court to declare Z.A. Bhutto’s execution ‘a judicial murder’, he said, adding the Supreme Court should correct history in the light of former judge Nasim Hassan Shah’s statement, he said.
He recalled that Z.A. Bhutto who had gathered all parties on a unanimous Constitution of the country was implicated in a false case and sent to the gallows. 
Mr Khuhro also criticised the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government for its “attempt to create disturbance” in the country. Imran Khan had only one card i.e. ‘resignation’, he said, and advised him to step down, otherwise he would be sent home in the wake of success of no-confidence motion. His days in power were numbered, claimed Khuhro.
