1,Pabbi facility using fun activities to treat psychiatric issues,"PESHAWAR: The Pabbi Intellectual Club, Nowshera, has come up with a novel way to treat the patients of psychiatric...","PESHAWAR: The Pabbi Intellectual Club, Nowshera, has come up with a novel way to treat the patients of psychiatric disorders and drug addicts.
Besides using pharmaceutical interventions, the club, which was established in September last year, is also hosting mushairas, seminars and musical events for the rehabilitation of patients.
“There is a significant improvement in the lives of drug addicts and mentally sick patients. Rehabilitation activities are held separately from other social activities at the club as we cannot expose their identities to others. Every Sunday, we take patients from Peshawar, where they are provided entertainment,” Pabbi Intellectual Club psychiatrist Dr Mian Iftikhar Hussain told Dawn.
According to him, drugs provide addicts with short-term ‘pleasurable and soothing’ feeling, which is very harmful and creates psychiatric disorders. Dr Iftikhar said some people struggled to manage stresses of life, so they adopted unhealthy ways including the use of drugs for temporary respite.
“We provide them with healthy, fun activities for recovery,” he said.
Dr Mian Iftikhar, a consultant psychiatrist, said he dedicated his farmhouse in the native Pabbi village, Nowshera, to the welfare of people with mental health issues and drug addiction, in the memory of his wife, who died of Covid-19 in 2020, and hosted mushairas, musical events and seminars on the premises.
“It is very important to provide such a platform to people in addition to pharmaceutical inventions to enable them to lead a normal life. We encourage them to ask questions and sing songs. Our weekly programmes are meant to address the issues, which lead to psychiatric issues,” he said.
Dr Iftikhar said the club with 28 members from different walks of life was home to activities to spread awareness and create positive thoughts for prosperous life.
He said the club held seminars on Pakhtun culture, violence and extremism, and organised musical programmes.
“Pashto mushaira, promotion of new books and events on positive and negative aspects of the use of social media are part of our programme. Recently, we celebrated the International Women Day with a Pashto mushaira attended by women,” he said.
Dr Iftikhar said the club was run as a resource center for promoting positive healthy trends and transforming community culture for the people’s better future.
“In near future, we will create vocational centres and drug addiction detoxification and rehabilitation centres for free services by involving the residents,” he said.

2,Bilawal accuses PM of trying to turn state institutions controversial,Claims Imran has lost majority in National Assembly...,"KURRAM: Chairman of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Saturday said Prime Minister Imran Khan wanted every state institution, including the Pakistan Army, to function like the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Tiger Force.
“[PM] Imran Khan keenly desires that state institutions from the Pakistan Army to Inter-Services Intelligence to police to others are run like the Tiger Force and are turned controversial but he will not be allowed to do so,” the PPP leader told a large public meeting in Parachinar, the headquarters of Kurram tribal district.
Mr Bilawal said the prime minister insisted that only an animal could act neutrally.
“He [Imran] is an animal himself, who wants the jungle’s rule in the country. The PPP won’t let him do it,” he said.
The PPP chairman flayed the prime minister for calling rival politicians ‘boot polishers’ and said Imran Khan was a ‘bootlicker’, who entered politics and moved on with the help of some army generals.

Claims Imran has lost majority in National Assembly

He said the prime minister would be held responsible for depriving poor women of the government’s financial assistance by discontinuing the Benazir Income Support Programme.
“Imran Khan will be held accountable for every crime he committed against the people,” he said.
Mr Bilawal said after the PTI’s government was removed and free and fair elections were held, the PPP would come to power and establish the Parachinar Medical College as promised by former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
He said his party would set up another degree college in the area.
“The Quaid-i-Awam Parachinar Medical College project was shelved by military ruler General Ziaul Haq. We will revive it. We will fulfil all promises made by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto,” he said.
The PPP leader said his was the party of martyrs.
“We are the heirs of shaheeds, who sacrificed lives for the country. We will never yield to terrorists,” he said.
Mr Bilawal accused PM Imran of secretly holding parleys with terrorists to bring them to table. “How could he talk to terrorists? We will not allow him to do this. These terrorists are the killers of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, the APS children, our brave soldiers, our valiant policemen, and thousands of innocent men, women and children,” he said.
The PPP chairman said the prime minister was a puppet and that he talked about Riasat-i-Madina but used foul language in the same breath.
He said the ‘Riasat-i-Madina card’ won’t work anymore.
Criticising the policies of the PTI government, he said poor people were working hard but didn’t get due payments for their labour.
“Imran told lies to the youth. All his promises, including those about 10 million jobs and five million houses, were false. He used to say that he will not approach the International Monetary Fund and will prefer committing suicide to doing so, but he struck a deal with the IMF to the misery of the poor,” he said.
Mr Bilawal said the people paid a heavy price for PM Imran’s inability and incapacity to rule the country and that his economic policies were for the country’s destruction and not for socio-economic change.
“Now, the time has come to get rid of this puppet prime minister, who gave relief to the rich and troubled the poor,” he said.
The PPP chairman said the PTI government’s economic policies caused record price hike, unemployment and abject poverty.
He said his party was a party of the common man, labourers, growers, youth, students, women and children and that it worked hard for them.
Mr Bilawal said the entire opposition was on one page against the PTI government. “The opposition tabled the no-confidence motion against PM Imran Khan, who is running away from voting on it,” he said.
The PPP chairman said the prime minister had already lost on the no-trust front, didn’t want the rule of law in the country, and was playing with democracy.
“After the opposition’s struggle, the selectors felt that they should have not imposed this puppet on the country. If they now think that it is not their job to select a prime minister, then this is a welcome decision,” he said.

Printer Mohammad Siraj told Dawn on Saturday thatthe coronavirus pandemic-induced restrictions had devastated printing industry in the region causing the layoff of over 2,000 workers, but the printers began receiving orders after the announcement of schedule for elections in seven of the eight districts of Hazara division.
He claimed that the ongoing electoral activities had generated over Rs300 million worth of business in Hazara division.
The printing press’s owner said he had booked orders for printing posters, panaflex banners, flags, buntings, and other canvassing material, while his clients included nominees of political parties as well as independents.
He said the candidates of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, Pakistan Peoples Party, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl and Jamaat-i-Islami were spending large sums of money on the printing of posters and banners.
Mr Siraj said election candidates in Mansehra and Abbottabad districts were depending on printed materials more than those running for local bodies in Torghar, Battagram, Kolai-Palas, and Lower and Upper Kohistan districts.
“There are around 100 panaflex and other printing machines and on average, each of them is generating Rs3 million business during this election season,” he said.
The printer said many people had sold printing machines over poor business when the coronavirus incidence peaked but they had rented those machines and re-hired employees to benefit from the election-related business.
Sajid Sadiq, a candidate for the general councillor’s seat, said the Election Commission of Pakistan had allowed the limited use of posters and panaflex banners but even then, the printers had received large orders from candidates and their supporters.
He said many orders were for the printing of small cards and invitation letters with the names, symbols and other details of election candidates and that that material would be distributed to voters.

11,Consumer court issues summons over delay in vehicles delivery,Fixes hearing for April 12...,"PESHAWAR: A consumer court here has summoned representatives and distributors of two automobile companies in different cases of ‘unfair trade practices’.
District and sessions judge Mohammad Asif Khan, who headed the court, fixed April 12 for next hearing directing respondents, including Al-Haj Automotive Limited, Khyber Motors and Hyundai Nishat Motors, to respond to the complaints on that date.
One of the complainants is Maria Rehman, who had reported a delay in the delivery of vehicle Proton Saga 1.3 to the Pakistan Citizen Portal.
She said she had booked the vehicle in June 2021 with delivery due in September 2021 but the vehicle was given to her in February 2022 when the prices were raised and revised on payment policy.
The complainant sought the recovery of extra amount she paid due to ‘deficiency in the service’ by respondents.

Fixes hearing for April 12

Her counsel, Zarak Arif Shah, argued that the acts of the respondents fell in the purview of Section 2’s sub-clauses (iv), (viii) and (ix) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Consumer Protection Act, 1997, which were regarding an unfair trade practice.
He said the court had jurisdiction under the law to look into the matter.
The lawyer submitted an application for including certain parties in the complaint as respondents for the just disposal of the complaint.
He said since Al-Haj Automotive Limited was an assembler and distributor of Proton Brand motors in Pakistan and had Khyber Motors as its authorised dealer in KP, both of them were necessary parties to the case.
The court decided to summon representatives of both companies on April 12.
In the other case complainant was Sardar Mohammad Ayub against Hyundai Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Hyundai Nishat Motors.
The complainant’s counsel, Zarak Arif, said despite full payment of Rs5.72 million by his client in Jan 2021, the respondents failed to deliver the vehicle, Hyundai Tuscon, in July 2021 as per their commitment.
He said a letter was sent to the complainant by the chief executive officer of Hyundai Nishat Motors on July 26, 2021, and that there would be slight delay in delivery due to ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the vehicle would be delivered ‘as soon as possible’.
The lawyer also said the respondents had charged the complainant an additional amount of Rs135,000 citing an increase in the vehicle price in Feb 2022, and the vehicle was delivered to him on March 5, 2022, after a delay of over seven months.
He sought orders for the refund of that amount along with interest on it to the complainant.
The counsel also requested the court to order the payment of Rs1 million as compensation to his client for the ‘agony, inconvenience and hardships’ caused by the respondents.
The court fixed April 12 for the next hearing into the case.
