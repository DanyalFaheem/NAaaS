0,"Nuclear deal with Iran ‘very close’, says EU","Lifting of sanctions on Revolutionary Guards among Tehran’s demands, says Iranian foreign minister.","DOHA: Top European Union diplomat Josep Borrell has said Iran and world powers are “very close” to agreement on reviving their 2015 nuclear deal, which would curb Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for lifting tough sanctions.
Then-US President Donald Trump abandoned the pact in 2018, prompting Tehran to start violating its nuclear limits about a year later, and 11 months of on-and-off talks to revive it paused in Vienna earlier this month after Russia presented a new obstacle.
Russia later said it had received written guarantees that it would be able to carry out its work as a party to the deal, suggesting Moscow could allow it to be resuscitated. 

Lifting of sanctions on Revolutionary Guards among Tehran’s demands: FM Amirabdollahian 

“Now we are very close to an agreement and I hope it will be possible,” the European Union’s Borrell said in an address to the Doha Forum international conference on Saturday.
Tehran has been seeking guarantees that the United States will not unilaterally withdraw from any agreement again.
Meeting with Iran’s chief negotiator 
Enrique Mora, the EU coordinator for the nuclear talks, has said he would travel to Tehran on Saturday to meet Iran’s chief negotiator. There are several issues pending including the lifting of US sanctions on its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Saturday that the lifting of US sanctions on the Revolutionary Guards was among Iran’s top demands in talks. “Certainly the issue of (lifting sanctions against) the Guards is part of the talks,” he told state TV.

1,"Japan’s PM, US envoy pray in Hiroshima amid Russia nuke fears","Russia’s invasion of Ukraine highlights the harsh road toward achieving a world without nuclear weapons, says Japan PM.","TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida escorted the US ambassador to his hometown Hiroshima on Saturday to pay respects to atomic bombing victims and warned that the world is again facing threats of nuclear attacks stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
""As we face a possibility of Russia’s use of nuclear weapons as a realistic concern, I felt strongly (as leader of ) the world’s only country to have suffered atomic attacks that we should never allow threats or use of nuclear weapons,"" Kishida told reporters after a tour of the peace park and the museum with Ambassador Rahm Emanuel.
""The tragedy should never be repeated,"" Kishida said.
Leaders from the Group of Seven countries on Thursday urged Russia not to use biological, chemical or nuclear weapons in its war on Ukraine. That prospects was raised when Russian President Vladimir Putin in February ordered his nations nuclear forces put on high alert over tensions with the West.
The Aug 6, 1945, atomic bombing by the United States killed about 140,000 people and nearly destroyed Hiroshima. Three days later, a second US atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki killed 70,000 more, before Japan surrendered six days later.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine highlights the harsh road toward achieving a world without nuclear weapons, Kishida said. ""As prime minister from Hiroshima, I must firmly send a message (of peace) to the rest of the world.""
Kishida, however, has been pushing to bolster Japan’s military budget and capability amid growing threats from China, North Korea and Russia. He says his realistic approach is to protect lives while seeking to achieve the ideal for the future.
Kishida and Emanuel visited the Peace Memorial Museum and laid flowers to the victims at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.
In 2016, Kishida accompanied then-President Barack Obama on his visit to Hiroshima, where he made a pledge to seek a world without nuclear weapons and met with several atomic bombing survivors.
A visit to Hiroshima by Emanuel, known for his close ties to President Joe Biden, is raising hopes for a similar presidential visit.
Emanuel said that he cannot speak for Biden but there is a possibility.
""I think as a friend I can say if he makes it here to Japan I know he’ll want to visit one of the two cities, but not both,"" he said.
The mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have requested that Biden make a similar trip to their cities during his visit to Japan to attend a summit of Quad nations, which also includes Australia and India, expected in late April. Quad, or the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, is an Indo-Pacific alliance established in 2007.

2,Russia signals less ambitious goals in Ukraine war,Ukraine’s president calls on the United Nations and world powers to come to his aid.,"KYIV: Russia has signalled it may dial back its war aims to focus on eastern Ukraine after failing to break the nation’s resistance in a month of fighting and attacks on civilians, including up to 300 feared killed in the bombing of a theatre.
Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the February invasion to destroy Ukraine’s military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky, bringing the country under Russia’s sway.
But Sergei Rudskoi, a senior general, suggested a considerably reduced  “main goal” of controlling Donbas, an eastern region already partly held by Russian proxies.
His surprise statement came as a Western official reported that a seventh Russian general, Lieutenant General Yakov Rezanstev, had died in Ukraine and that a colonel had been  “deliberately” killed by his own demoralised men.
Complicating Moscow’s challenges, invasion troops were facing a counteroffensive in Kherson, the only major Ukrainian city under Russian control.
Zelenskyy at Doha Forum
Ukraine’s president made a surprise video appearance on Saturday at Qatar’s Doha  Forum, calling on the energy-rich nation and others to boost their  production to counteract the loss of Russian energy supplies.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the United Nations and world powers to come to his  aid, as he has in a series of other addresses given around the world  since the start of the war Feb 24. He compared Russia’s destruction of  the port city of Mariupol to the Syrian and Russian destruction wrought  on the city of Aleppo in the Syrian war. Zelenskyy  called on countries to increase their exports of energy something  particularly important as Qatar is a world leader in the export of  natural gas. Western sanctions have deeply cut into Russian exports,  which are crucial for European nations.
Also on hand was Saudi  Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan, the top diplomat for the  world’s biggest oil exporter. Saudi Arabia so far has said it would  stick with an OPEC+ production schedule the cartel struck with Russia  and other producers. 
The kingdom also said it wouldn’t be responsible  for higher prices as it deals with attacks from Yemen’s Houthi rebels  amid its yearslong war in the Arab world’s poorest country.
Zelenskyy  criticised Russia for what he described as threatening the world with  its nuclear weapons, raising the possibility of tactical nuclear weapons  being used on the battlefield.
Russia occupies Chernobyl staff town
Russian  forces took control of a town where staff working at the Chernobyl  nuclear site live and briefly detained the mayor, sparking protests,  Ukrainian officials said on Saturday.
“I have been released.  Everything is fine, as far as it is possible under occupation,” Yuri  Fomichev, mayor of Slavutych, said, after officials in the  Ukraine capital Kyiv announced earlier he had been detained.
Earlier, Kyiv announced that Russian troops had entered Slavutych and occupied the municipal hospital.
Residents  took to the streets, carrying a large blue and yellow Ukrainian flag  and heading towards the hospital, the administration said, adding that  Russian forces fired into the air and threw stun grenades into the  crowd.

3,No new president for Iraq,"According to a parliamentary official, only 202 lawmakers showed up for the latest vote.","BAGHDAD: Iraqi lawmakers failed again on Saturday to elect a new president due to the lack of a quorum in parliament, keeping the country mired in political paralysis.
Parliament had issued a final list of 40 candidates for the post, a largely ceremonial role that by convention is reserved for a member of Iraq’s Kurdish minority.
The contest pits Barham Saleh, the incumbent and a member of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), against Rebar Ahmed of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), the PUK’s rival.
But the lack of a quorum — set at two-thirds of the house’s 329 members — held up the vote for the second time since February, deepening war-scarred Iraq’s political uncertainty.
Only 202 lawmakers showed up for the latest vote, a parliamentary official said and a new session had to be scheduled for Wednesday.
Following the session, parliament speaker Mohammed al-Halbusi said the  “lack of a quorum forces us to continue holding sessions until it is achieved”, the state-owned Iraqi News Agency reported.

4,Prince William hints at backing for Caribbean nations to become republics,"Belize, the Bahamas and Jamaica want to ditch the queen as their head of state.","NASSAU: Britain’s Prince William has said he supports and respects any decision Caribbean nations make about their future, as Belize, the Bahamas and Jamaica consider cutting their ties with the British monarchy.
At the end of a tour with his wife Kate that has been marked by protests about the legacy of the British Empire, William, Queen Elizabeth’s grandson, acknowledged the relationship between the three Caribbean states and the Crown was changing.
“Next year, I know you are all looking forward to celebrating 50 years of independence your Golden Anniversary,” he said in a speech in the Bahamas capital Nassau.
“And with Jamaica celebrating 60 years of independence this year, and Belize celebrating 40 years of independence last year, I want to say this: We support with pride and respect your decisions about your future. Relationships evolve. Friendship endures.” 

Belize, the Bahamas and Jamaica want to ditch the queen as their head of state

The visit follows increasing calls for Jamaica to follow Barbados and become a republic by ditching the queen as head of state.
His speech is the clearest indication the royal family would back the three nations ditching the queen as their head of state, echoing the decision taken by Barbados last November. Usually, Buckingham Palace says such matters are for the local people and politicians to decide.
During her 70 years on the throne — a landmark that the tour was to designed to mark — Elizabeth has watched as former British colonies have cut their ties, but she remains queen of 15 realms, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
However, the tour by William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, has thrown a spotlight on the waning support for the monarchy in the Caribbean. During the trip there have been protests and calls for reparations payments by Britain and an apology for slavery.
Meanwhile the Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness told William directly at a meeting on Wednesday that his country wanted to be  “independent”.
Some British media have also criticised public relations mistakes which have seen the royals shaking hands with Jamaican children through wire fences and other appearances, described as  “tone-deaf” blunders by the Daily Mirror tabloid because it said they appeared to be a throwback to colonial times.
The tribulations of the tour have reflected wider questions about the role and future of the royals back in Britain following the scandal of a US sex abuse lawsuit involving the queen’s second son Prince Andrew — settled last month — and criticism of the institution from William’s younger brother, Prince Harry.
The Bahamas, a former British colony,  gained independence in 1973, but it remains a member of the  Common­wealth of Nations and recognises the British monarch as head of  state.
William  during that trip expressed his  “profound sorrow” about the history of  slavery, calling the practice  “abhorrent.”  “It should never have  happened,” he said. But no formal apology has been made by the British royal family.
Britain  is increasingly confronting its colonial past, in particular its  memorials to historical figures with ties to the slave trade.

5,Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins dies aged 50,"BOGOTA: Drummer Taylor Hawkins of the multi-Grammy award-winning rock group Foo Fighters has died, his bandmates ...","BOGOTA: Drummer Taylor Hawkins of the multi-Grammy award-winning rock group Foo Fighters has died, his bandmates said in a statement on Friday. He was 50.
As part of one of the world’s most influential and critically lauded alternative rock bands, Hawkins was known for his on-stage charisma and classic rock-inspired beats, which he once said were influenced by legends like Phil Collins and Queen’s Roger Taylor.
He had played with Foo Fighters since 1997, when he was taken on by lead singer and former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, providing percussion on some of the group’s biggest hits including  “Learn to Fly” and  “Best of You”.
“The Foo Fighters family is devastated by the tragic and untimely loss of our beloved Taylor Hawkins,” the band said in a statement on Twitter.
“His musical spirit and infectious laughter will live on with all of us forever,” they added.
The statement did not reveal the cause of Hawkins’ death, news of which emerged the same day the band was due to play at the Festival Estereo Picnic in Bogota, Colombia.
A source in Colombia’s prosecutor’s office said that Hawkins’ body had been found in a hotel in eastern Bogota. The festival said in a statement that the show would not go ahead.
Prior to joining Foo Fighters, Hawkins drummed for Canadian indie songstress Alanis Morissette.
In an interview with 95.5 KLOS last year, Grohl described his first meeting with Hawkins and how he convinced him to join his band.
“I was like, ‘Wow, you’re either my twin or my spirit animal, or my best friend!’ In the first 10 seconds of meeting him,” he said.

6,Saudi Arabia ‘foils oil tanker attack’ after rebels disrupt F1,Overnight coalition air strikes on Sanaa and Hodeida leave eight people dead,"JEDDAH: Saudi forces destroyed explosives-laden boats and launched air strikes in Yemen on Saturday after Houthi rebel drones and missiles hit targets around the country, setting off an inferno at an oil plant within sight of Jeddah’s Formula One race.
Three people were killed in the operation against the booby-trapped boats, according to the Saudi-led coalition, which also carried out air raids on the Yemeni cities of Sanaa and Hodeida overnight.
It marked a violent seventh anniversary of the coalition’s military intervention in Saudi Arabia’s impoverished neighbour Yemen, after the Iran-backed Houthis had seized the capital Sanaa in 2014.
Thousands of people marched in Sanaa on Saturday to denounce a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands directly or indirectly, according to the UN, and left millions on the brink of famine.

Overnight coalition air strikes on Sanaa and Hodeida leave eight people dead

However, there were signs of diplomacy as a senior Saudi official said the rebels had offered a ceasefire and peace talks in exchange for opening up Sanaa’s airport and the lifeline port of Hodeida.
“The Houthis put forward an initiative through mediators that includes a truce, opening the airport (Sanaa) and the port (Hodeida) and Yemeni-Yemeni discussions,” said the official.
“We are waiting for it to be officially announced because they (Houthis) are constantly changing their words,” he added. No immediate comment was available from the rebels.
Four boats laden with explosives were destroyed at Salif, a Red Sea port north of Jeddah, a day after the Yemeni attacks on a televised F1 practice day spooked drivers and threw the race into doubt.
“We targeted four booby-trapped boats in Salif port, which is under preparation, and thwarted an imminent attack on oil tankers,” the coalition said, according to state television.
Formula One is one of a number of high-profile events brought to Saudi Arabia in recent years, drawing accusations of ‘sportswashing’ — using sports events to distract from criticism of the country’s human rights record.
It is not the first to witness violence. A French driver was seriously injured in a blast at the Dakar Rally hosted by Saudi Arabia in December. French investigators blamed an explosive device planted on his car.
The  Iran-backed rebels last week rejected an offer of talks in Riyadh —  capital of Saudi Arabia, which leads the pro-government military  coalition.
A  Riyadh-based diplomat said that Hans Grundberg, the UN’s special  envoy to Yemen, had led recent efforts to reach a truce during Ramazan, which begins in early April.
Last week, the Saudi-headquartered, six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council invited the rebels to talks in Riyadh later this month.
But the Houthis refused to hold talks with the government in  “enemy countries”.
A Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in  Yemen unleashed a barrage of airstrikes on the capital and a strategic  Red Sea city, officials said Saturday. At least eight people were  killed.
The overnight airstrikes on Sanaa and Hodeida both held by  the Houthis came a day after the rebels attacked an oil depot in the  Saudi city of Jeddah, their highest-profile assault yet on the kingdom.
Gen Turki al-Malki, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, said the  strikes targeted sources of threat to Saudi Arabia, according to the  state-run Saudi Press Agency or SPA.
He said the coalition  intercepted and destroyed two explosives-laden drones early Saturday.
