0,"With her Indian nightmare finally over, Sumaira returns to Pakistan",Indian authorities handed over Sumaira and her daughter to Pakistani authorities at the Wagah border.,"ISLAMABAD: Sumaira Rehman, a Pakistani woman who had been languishing in a detention centre at Bangalore in India for some four years, has finally returned to Pakistan along with her four-year-old daughter Sana Fatima. 
PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui, who had last week said Indian authorities have completed all formalities for Sumaira’s release, made the disclosure while talking to reporters here. 
Indian authorities handed over Sumaira and her daughter to Pakistani authorities at the Wagah border. Pakistani High Commission officials accompanied Sumaira from Bangalore to Wagah border.  
It will take another four days for Sumaira and her daughter to fulfill all the legal requirements and to complete immigration processes. “After [immigration process] she would be free to go wherever she wants to go” said Senator Siddiqui.  
The senator had raised the issue of Sumaira’s detention in India during a Senate session after the Ministry of Interior (MoI) failed to issue a certificate of nationality for her on the request of the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi. 
A woman of Pakistani origin, Sumaira was settled in Qatar. In 2017, she married an Indian Muslim man named Mohammad Shahab against the consent of her parents. Shahab took her to India where the couple settled down. 
However, after her visa expired she was sent to jail along with her husband. Later, the Indian authorities released her husband but kept her in jail, where she gave birth to a baby girl. 
In 2018, the Pakistani High Commission was given consular access to Sumaira. The high commission staff after meeting her wrote a letter to the MoI in Islamabad to confirm her nationality. However, the letter was ignored by the ministry.  
Sumaira spent four years in Indian jail. She also paid a fine of one million Indian rupees to the government of India, which she collected from donations. Later, the Indian authorities put her in a detention centre. 
A human rights lawyer, Suhana Biswa Patna, took up Sumaira’s case and struggled within the Indian legal system for her release from the custodial centre. 
On February 17 this year, Senator Siddiqui raised the issue of Sumaira’s detention in the Senate for the second time. Sumaira was finally issued a citizenship certificate by the MoI the same day.  
The senator remained in constant touch with the Foreign Office, Indian High Commission in Islamabad, the Indian human rights lawyer who were working on the case and the Asma Jehangir Legal Aid Centre in Lahore. 
“A week ago, the Indian High Commission in Islamabad informed me that Sumaira and her little daughter will be handed over to Pakistani authorities at Wagah on March 26,” said Senator Siddiqui. 
He said Pakistani authorities have confirmed that the woman and her child have been handed over to them.  
Senator Siddiqui said he had talked to the former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who assured him that all assistance would be provided to Sumaira in order to help her settle down in Pakistan. 
The senator then demanded that the interior ministry officials who ignored Sumaira’s case should be held accountable.

1,"Some PTI dissidents reply to notices, deny defection",Sources say that the party dissidents replied to the show-cause notices on the advice of their legal teams.,"ISLAMABAD: Some of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) dissidents on Saturday submitted their replies to the show-cause notices issued to them by the party, and denied the charge of defection, claiming they were still part of the parliamentary group of the ruling party.
Media reports claimed that all 13 MNAs, who had been issued the notices, had submitted their replies to PTI secretary general Asad Umar over the alleged violation of party discipline. Mr Umar could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.
However, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry confirmed that four to five MNAs submitted their replies and that they were still part of the party. “I don’t remember all of them, but Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani and Dr Muhammad Afzal Khan Dhandla submitted their replies,” he claimed.

Fawad says two dissidents had assured of adhering to party discipline 

The ruling PTI had given a week to 13 of its dissidents to explain their position to the party chief over the ‘defection’. Separate show-cause notices were issued with the signatures of Mr Umar, seeking an explanation by March 26 as to why they may not be declared defectors and disqualified as members of the National Assembly.
Those issued notices included Dr Dhandla (NA-98 Bhakkar-II), Nawab Sher Waseer (NA-102 Faisalabad-II), Raja Riaz Ahmad (NA-110 Faisalabad), Ahmed Hussain Deharr (NA-154 Multan), Rana Muhammad Qasim Noon (NA-159 Multan), Mohammad Abdul Ghaffar Wattoo (NA-166 Bahawalnagar), Makhdoom Zada Sayed Basit Ahmad Sultan (NA-185 Muzaffargarh), Aamir Talal Gopang (NA-186 Muzaffargarh), Sardar Riaz Mehmood Khan Mazari (NA-195 Rajanpur), Wajiha Qamar (reserved seat for women), Nuzhat Pathan (reserved seat for women), Dr Vankwani (reserved seat for non-Muslims) and Noor Alam Khan (NA-27 Peshawar).
On the other hand, sources told Dawn that the PTI dissidents had replied to the show-cause notices on the advice of their legal teams that the party may take action against them before voting on the no-trust move against the prime minister. They said the MNAs submitted the replies over the de-seating threat under Article 63(A) of the Constitution.
The notices were issued two days after the dissident lawmakers surfaced at Sindh House in Islamabad, bringing to the fore the cracks within the party, with the government accusing the opposition of purchasing loyalties of the MNAs.
The notices cited Article 63(A), stating that it bound the lawmakers to follow the directions issued by their parliamentary party, and referred to two letters, dated March 15 and March 18, in this regard. Under this provision, it added, a defecting lawmaker was to be given a chance to explain why he may not be declared a defector, hence they were being given an opportunity to have a hearing before PTI chief Imran Khan and show cause “as to why a declaration may not be issued against you for getting you de-seated from the membership of the National Assembly of Pakistan”.
The government maintains that the intent of Article 63(A) was to prevent floor-crossing by anyone who got elected in the name of a particular party, hence it permitted the disqualification of defecting lawmakers from the NA before they cast vote on the no-trust motion.
Talking to Dawn, PTI MNA from Peshawar Noor Alam Khan also confirmed that he had submitted his response to the party leadership.
APP adds: Answering a question during a media talk in Islamabad, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry claimed that two PTI MNAs had assured that they would not violate the party discipline. He said Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar had already met one of the two members.

3,Rashid proposes snap polls after budget,"ISLAMABAD: Noting that it was the right time for snap polls, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid on Saturday said he had...","ISLAMABAD: Noting that it was the right time for snap polls, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid on Saturday said he had advised Prime Minister Imran Khan to call elections after presenting the budget for the next fiscal year. 
A couple of days ago, the interior minister had made a similar reference during a press talk in Lahore, when he warned the ruling party dissidents that they would be spurned by voters at the polls if they switched loyalties.
Answering a question, the minister hinted at further delay in voting on no-trust motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, set to be tabled in the National Assembly tomorrow (Monday). He said that voting on the no-confidence motion was likely to take place on April 3 or 4. 
“It is a very important day in Pakistan’s democratic history which is why everybody should demonstrate responsibility. The interior ministry is open 24/7 and we will try [to ensure that] the law and order situation is maintained. God forbid, if the opposition makes a mistake, they will have to face the music,” he said.
On Saturday, the minister, in his usual talkative manner, said the time was right to capitalise on the opportunity afforded by the opposition’s no-trust move, insisting that that Prime Minister Khan’s popularity had increased manifold after political forces had tried to gang up against him. 
However, he made it clear that the idea of taking advantage of their rising popularity was purely his personal opinion. He recalled that his earlier proposals for imposition of governor’s rule in Sindh had already been turned down. 
Calling the opposition ‘mindless’, he said their move had taken the prime minister to the peak of popularity, and he would comfortably win the next general elections.

4,Pakistan sees trans-Afghan railway link as game changer,"During talks with Afghan and Uzbek officials, BoI chairman discusses cargo transportation availability ...","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has told a trilateral working meeting on a railway link with Afghanistan and Uzbekistan that the project would prove to be a game changer for the region’s future. 
Minister of State and Board of Investment (BoI) Chairman Mohammad Azfar Ahsan, who represented Pakistan at the meeting concluded in the Uzbek city of Termez, attached great importance to the 600km railway link and appreciated the Uzbek government for organising the talks. 
The railway track would link Termez, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kabul and Peshawar to promote trade in the region, especially for landlocked Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. 
During the meeting, the Pakistani side discussed the availability of cargo transportation in the country and put forward proposals to increase traffic volume between the three countries, the BOI said in a press release on Saturday.  

During talks with Afghan and Uzbek officials, BoI chairman discusses cargo transportation availability and ways to increase traffic volume

“This trans-Afghan railway project is the most economical and shortest route connecting Central Asia with the Pakistan’s Karachi, Gwadar and Qasim ports,” the BoI chairman said. 
This connectivity had become a defining feature of the modern economy, and Central Asia needed to develop southern trade links to complement existing routes to the north, east and west, he said.
Pakistan and Uzbekistan were poised to play a major role in the future political and economic disposition of the region, he said, and stressed that both countries “are fortunate to be led by leaders who have the vision, will and determination to work together to steer their countries and the region towards a brighter future”.
He underscored that Pakistan’s geography made it the shortest, most economical and easiest land route to the Arabian Sea for both Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.
He emphasised that Afghanistan was termed the “heart of Asia”, as it connected different regions, especially Central Asia via Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan; South Asia via Pakistan; and the Middle East via Iran.
Elaborating on the importance of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the BoI chairman said that its extension could potentially help Afghanistan become part of the Belt and Road Initiative.
Governor of the Surkhandarya region Bobolov To’ra Abdievich, Minister of Transport of Uzbekistan Ilkhom Makhkamov, Deputy Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation of Afghanistan Akbar Jan Polad, and Deputy Minister of Investments and Foreign Trade Choriyev Otabek Bobomuratovich also gave their input on the project during the trilateral talks.

5,Trapped Harnai miners’ 110-hour ordeal comes to an end,Six workers were trapped inside the coalmine in Zarghoon Ghar area on March 22.,"QUETTA: Three workers were rescued from a coal mine in Harnai on Saturday after a 110-hour-long rescue operation. 
Six workers were trapped inside the coalmine in the Zarghoon Ghar area on March 22 while working around 1,300 feet deep when a big portion of the mine collapsed due to the methane gas blast. Sources said the gas was accumulated in the mine because of the absence of safety measures.
Three miners were recovered 24 hours after the incident while the rescuers could not reach the other three as the debris had blocked the way. Amid fears that the miners might have lost their lives due to suffocation, rescuers continued their efforts to reach them.
“The rescue teams succeeded in rescuing three trapped miners from the mine. All the three are alive and healthy,” Harnai Deputy Commissioner Sardar Rafique Tareen said, adding that the workers had been shifted to civil hospital Quetta. “It is a miracle,” he said.
Officials of the Mines Department said the mine had been closed after the incident and an inquiry into the incident was under way. It may be recalled that after every such incident the department ordered a probe but it never released the inquiry report.

6,"Saudi firm to help Pakistan assess Reko Diq gold, copper quantity","The firm will set up a refinery in Gwadar, says Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo.","QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, while defending a recently signed agreement on the Reko Diq copper and gold mining project with a Canadian company, has disclosed that a Saudi Arabian firm would set up a refinery in Gwadar to assess the quantity of minerals extracted from the site.
“I have taken all political leaders, parties and public representatives into confidence before signing the Reko Diq project, which will prove a gateway for foreign investment in Balochistan as [Canadian firm] Barrick Gold Corporation will invest $10 billion,” he said during an interaction with senior journalists and newspapers editors at Chief Minister House on Friday night.
He said the agreement clearly mentioned it “would be cancelled if the [Canadian] company failed to start work within three years at the site allotted for exploration and mining.”
Mr Bizenjo said that despite various hurdles and difficulties, it was the best possible agreement. “Five months were crucial and very difficult in which there has been a fear of the governor’s rule in the province,” he said, adding that all political leaders have appreciated our efforts and said that we had made a big contribution to the province.
He said that under the new agreement, Balochistan’s share in the project would be 25 per cent without any investment by the province. Other financial benefits, including royalty taxes, were also part of the agreement.
He said that Barrick Gold would pay a royalty to Balochistan immediately while the company would spend Rs40 billion to develop the area under social responsibility.
He claimed that former chief minister Jamal Kamal Khan was dealing alone with the authorities concerned to restart the Reko Diq project without taking anyone on board, including even the chief secretary, finance secretary and other officials.
Mr Bizenjo said that under the Reko Diq project, an area of 100 square kilometres had been allotted for 100 years to Barrick Gold, while the government would be free to approach other companies for other areas.
He also talked at length about the political situation and on other issues, including a no-confidence motion against him. He said he was not worried about such rumours and added that if someone had the support of the members, he should file a motion in the assembly.
