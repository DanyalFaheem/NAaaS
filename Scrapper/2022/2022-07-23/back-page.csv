0,"Russia, Ukraine seal landmark grain deal in Turkiye","UN chief terms accord a beacon of hope, possibility and relief.","ISTANBUL: Kyiv and Moscow on Friday penned a landmark agreement with Turkiye and the United Nations Friday to unblock Ukraine’s Black Sea grain exports after a Russian blockade raised fears of a global food crisis.
In their first major deal after nearly five months of fighting, Russian and Ukrainian delegations signed individual agreements with Ankara and the UN in the wake of several rounds of laborious negotiations.
Ukraine had warned ahead of the signing that any Russian “provocations” around its encircled Black Sea ports would be met with a swift military response and refused to pen the same papers as Moscow.
“Today, there is a beacon on the Black Sea — a beacon of hope, a beacon of possibility, a beacon of relief,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said at the signing ceremony in the lavish Dolmabahce Palace on the Bosphorus Strait.

UN chief terms accord a beacon of hope, possibility and relief

The deal agreed through UN and Turkish mediation establishes safe corridors along which Ukrainian ships can come in and out of three designated Black Sea ports in and around Odessa.
And both sides also pledged not to attack ships on the way in or out.
“It will bring relief for developing countries on the edge of bankruptcy and the most vulnerable people on the edge of famine,” Guterres said.
Path to peace
The five-month war, which has displaced millions and left thousands dead, is being fought across one of Europe’s most fertile regions by two of the world’s biggest grain producers.
Up to 25 million tonnes of wheat and other grain have been blocked in Ukrainian ports by Russian warships and landmines Kyiv has laid to avert a feared amphibious assault.
“Today’s Istanbul agreement is a step in the right direction. We call for its swift implementation,” tweeted the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan — a key player in the negotiations who has good relations with both Moscow and Kyiv — said he hoped the deal would “hopefully revive the path to peace”. 
UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss congratulated Turkiye and UN for brokering the deal but cautioned “we will be watching to ensure Russia’s actions match its words”.
Earlier, Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak explained the two sides would sign “mirror” agreements.
“We sign an agreement with Turkiye and the UN and undertake obligations to them. Russia signs a mirror agreement with Turkiye and the UN,” he said on social media. He warned that Russian breaches of the deal and incursions around Ukraine’s ports would be met with “an immediate military response”.
Diplomats expect grain to start fully flowing for the first time since Russia’s invasion of its Western-backed neighbour by the middle of August.
Ukrainian farmers
Still, news of the deal earlier drew scepticism from Ukrainian farmers under pressure in the war-battered south where storage facilities are rapidly filling and local prices for grain tanking.
“It gives some hope but you can’t believe what the Russians say,” said Mykola Zaverukha, a farmer with some 13,000 tonnes of grain waiting for export.
“Russia is unreliable, they have shown themselves to be year after year,” he said in the southern Mykolaiv region.

1,Sri Lankan troops demolish protest camp,"US ambassador in Colombo ""deeply concerned"" about military action.","COLOMBO: Sri Lankan security forces demolished the main anti-government protest camp in the capital on Friday, evicting activists in a pre-dawn assault that raised international concern for dissent under the crisis-wracked country’s new pro-Western president. 
Troops and police Special Task Force commandos wielding batons and armed with automatic assault rifles charged on people blockading the sea-front Presid­ential Secretariat in Colombo. 
Hundreds of soldiers removed the demonstrators’ barricades and tents outside the colonial-era building, while the last remaining protesters on the premises — some were still on the steps — were baton charged away. 
The operation came hours before new president Ranil Wickrem­esinghe appointed an old friend as prime minister and the ousted head of state’s personal lawyer as foreign minister.

US ambassador in Colombo ‘deeply concerned’ about military action

Wickremesinghe was elected president by lawmakers on Wednesday to replace Gotabaya Raja­paksa, who fled to Singapore and resigned after demonstrators chased him from his palace.
The remaining protesters — far fewer than the thousands who overran several government buildings earlier this month — have been demanding Wickrem­esinghe also quit. They accuse him of protecting the Rajapaksa clan who have dominated politics for much of the last two decades. 
By sunrise, police commandos and soldiers barricaded the complex and the main roads leading to the area were cordoned off. Hundreds of activists demonstrated at a nearby designated protest site against the military action, demanding Wickrem­esinghe resign and dissolve parliament and allow fresh elections.
“Don’t attack peaceful protesters, instead listen to us,” said student Dimmithu, 26. 
The activists insisted they would continue their struggle, and Basantha Samara­singhe, 45, a businessman and trade union leader, said: “The peoples’ wish is system change, and parliament should be dissolved. It has no public mandate.”  
Police said in a statement that security forces acted to clear protesters who were “illegally occupying” the presidential compound, with nine people arrested, two of whom were injured. 
The US ambassador in Colombo, Julie Chung, said she was “deeply concerned” about the military action. “We urge restraint by authorities and immediate access to medical attention for those injured,” she said on Twitter. 

 





 
The European Union said freedom of expression was essential for Sri Lanka to transition from its chaos.
“Hard to see how restricting it severely can help in finding solutions to the current political and economic crises,” the EU delegation in Colombo said.
A foreign exchange crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic and exacerbated by mismanagement has left Sri Lanka suffering lengthy power blackouts and record-high inflation.
The country’s 22 million people have also endured months of food, fuel and medicine shortages.
On Friday, Wickrem­esinghe swore in his political rival Dinesh Gunawardena as the country’s new prime minister.
The two men have been schoolmates and friends since the age of three but lead political parties that are opposed ideologically.
Wickremesinghe is a free-market champion and a pro-West politician while Gunawardena is a staunch Sinhala nationalist who believes in socialism and wants greater state control over the economy.
“We have differences, but we have enough friendship to unite to deal with the main problem of the country, that is the economy,” Gunaw­ardena told reporters. 
Wickremesinghe also swore in a new cabinet, largely re-instating his predecessor’s ministers but retaining the finance portfolio for himself to continue bailout talks with the IMF.
He also replaced the foreign minister with Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s personal lawyer Ali Sabry.
Officials said it was an “interim cabinet” that could be replaced “within weeks”.

2,"Iran’s N-programme is ‘galloping ahead’, says IAEA chief",MADRID: Iran’s nuclear programme is “galloping ahead” and the International Atomic Energy Agency has very...,"MADRID: Iran’s nuclear programme is “galloping ahead” and the International Atomic Energy Agency has very limited visibility on what is happening, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told Spain’s El Pais newspaper in an interview published on Friday. 
In June, Iran began removing essentially all the agency’s monitoring equipment, installed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. 
Grossi said at the time this could deal a “fatal blow” to chances of reviving the deal following 2018’s pullout by the United States.
“The bottom line is that for almost five weeks I have had very limited visibility, with a nuclear programme that is galloping ahead and, therefore, if there is an agreement, it is going to be very difficult for me to reconstruct the puzzle of this whole period of forced blindness,” he told El Pais.
“It is not impossible, but it is going to require a very complex task and perhaps some specific agreements,” said Grossi, who was visiting Madrid.
Grossi said in June there was a window of just three to four weeks to restore at least some of the monitoring that was being scrapped before the IAEA lost the ability to piece together Iran’s most important nuclear activities.
Iran has breached many of the deal’s limits on its nuclear activities since then-US President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the agreement and re-imposed sanctions on Tehran in 2018. 
Indirect talks between Iran and the United States on reviving the 2015 deal have been stalled since March.
Western powers warn Iran is getting closer to being able to sprint towards making a nuclear bomb. Iran denies wanting to.
Indirect talks between Iran and the United States on reviving the 2015 deal have been stalled since March.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian was quoted on Friday as saying his country and the United States were very close to a deal to revive the 2015 accord, but that Tehran needed US guarantees to avoid getting “bitten twice”.
“We have a ready text in front of us and we agree on more than 95 to 96 per cent of its content, but there’s still an important flaw in this text: we need to get the full economic benefits of the agreement. We don’t want to be bitten twice,” Iranian media quoted Amirabdollahian as saying.
Grossi said he was concerned and worried about the weeks with no visibility.
“The agency needed to reconstruct a database, without which any agreement will rest on a very fragile basis, because if we don’t know what’s there, how can we determine how much material to export, how many centrifuges to leave unused?,” he said.
Asked about a report that Iran was escalating its uranium enrichment further with the use of advanced machines at its underground Fordow plant, Grossi said “the technical progress of the Iranian programme is steady”.

3,13th polio case from KP puts question mark on vaccination,US reports first case in nearly a decade.,"ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan strives to become polio-free, the region of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa threatens to upend the progress, with this year’s 13th case reported on Friday. 
An 18-month-old child was paralysed by wild poliovirus (WPV) in Lakki Marwat, the National Institute of Health confirmed. 
The 12 other cases were also reported from southern KP, North Waziristan. With Pakistan nearly achieving the status of a polio-free country, health authorities have expressed concern over the high number of cases from the tribal districts. 
“We have successfully managed to prevent the virus from spreading elsewhere despite the frequent movement of people between KP and other parts of the country. If we can contain and eliminate the virus from this area, we can win the fight against polio,” federal Health Secretary Dr Fakhre Alam Irfan told Dawn. 

US reports first case in nearly a decade

In a statement, Minister for National Health Services Abdul Qadir Patel said the government decided to use injectable vaccines during vaccination drives in southern KP.  “We have started providing injectable vaccines to interrupt the transmission of the virus due to higher acceptance of this form of immunisation, as well as offering hygiene products such as soap to prevent the spread of all kinds of germs,” he said. 
National Emergency Operations Coordinator Dr Shahzad Baig told Dawn that the government was continuously reassessing its immunisation strategies to reach more children. “Vaccine acceptance has increased in KP since we initiated emergency measures for the highest-risk districts,” said Dr Baig. 
The next polio campaign in southern KP will begin on August 15.  Pakistan has seen a steady decline in the number of polio cases since reporting 147 cases in 2019. The number dropped to 84 next year and further to only one in 2021.
Polio case in US 
Meanwhile, the United Stated reported its first-ever polio case in nearly a decade on Thursday when a person from New York’s Rockland County was diagnosed with the virus, CNN reported. The case was identified as a revertant polio Sabin type 2 virus, indicating that the person received oral polio vaccines before travelling to the country. 
Since Pakistan is one of the two countries in the world where passengers receive oral polio vaccines before traveling, health authorities fear that the virus might have been transported by a person of Pakistani-origin. 
The US health officials also fear that more cases might emerge as people who catch the virus can spread it for about two weeks. In this case, the individual was not expected to be contagious anymore as they have passed that window of time. However, according to the officials, other people might have got the virus before the case was diagnosed. 
Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus mainly affecting children under the age of five years. It enters the nervous system and cause paralysis, even death. While there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this crippling disease.

4,Tories ‘celebrate’ diversity in race for next UK prime minister,Boris Johnson’s successor will represent a historic change.,"LONDON: A political party whose membership skews white and male will decide in the coming weeks between an ethnic Indian and a woman to be its new leader, and hence Britain’s next prime minister. 
The Conservative runoff between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss means that Boris Johnson’s successor in 10 Downing Street will represent a visible, and possibly historic, change. 
“Thirteen out of 15 prime ministers since the war have been white men, but it’s no longer the inevitable norm,” Sunder Katwala, director of the research group British Future, said. “It’s not even that much of a surprise that the next leader will be different.” 
Foreign Secretary Truss, 46, would be only the third woman prime minister, after Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May, who were both also Conservative. 

Boris Johnson’s successor will represent a historic change

Ex-finance minister Sunak, an observant Hindu, would be truly breaking new ground as the first prime minister of colour, ruling a country that itself once ruled a quarter of the world’s population, including India. 
But for ethnic minorities, Katwala argued, “they’re going to be voting just like everyone else on tax, the economy, Brexit”. 
“They remain sceptical of the Conservative agenda, despite the new diversity at the top,” he added, noting the Tories’ treatment under May of legal “Windrush” migrants from the Caribbean.
Words hurt 
Superficially at least, the ascent of Sunak and other frontbench Tories of colour suggests a country more at ease with its multicultural identity today, following post-war immigration from Britain’s old empire.
Sunak, 42, has commented previously on the racist insults he and his younger siblings suffered growing up in the southern English city of Southampton.
“It stings in a way that very few other things have,” he told Sky News in June 2020.
“But that’s not something that has happened to me for a long time,” Sunak added, saying that Britain had made “enormous progress” since then.
However, as Tory members prepare to elect their new leader by September 5, racially charged attacks have circulated on social media after controversy over his family’s wealth and tax affairs.
And some Truss supporters say it is sexist to comment on her appearance, with one widely shared meme showing a photo montage of various occasions on which she has posed in similar clothes or settings to Thatcher.
Truss on Thursday called the comparisons “frustrating”, insisting: “I am my own person.”  
Rivers of blood
In 1968, Tory MP Enoch Powell predicted racial civil war in an inflammatory address that came to be known as the “rivers of blood” speech.
Polling at the time suggested a large majority of white Britons supported him.
The centre-left Labour party continues to enjoy a hold over most minority voters.
However, it is an “embarrassment” that Labour, alone among the UK’s major political parties, has yet to elect a permanent woman leader, Katwala said.
And compared to other communities, British-Indians have proven more receptive to the Conservatives’ message of aspiration and self-reliance.
The roughly 200,000 Conservative members tend to be richer than the national average, and live in well-to-do areas.
The party refuses to release a breakdown of its membership.
But according to research by academics Tim Bale, Monica Poletti and Paul Webb last year, the members are less diverse ethnically, are relatively old, and 63 per cent of them are male.
Nevertheless, the Tories have come a long way since Powell’s bloodthirsty predictions.
There were eight candidates at the start of the party’s leadership race this month: half were women, and half were from ethnic minorities.
Oxford still rules 
Writing in last weekend’s Sunday Times, former prime minister David Cameron noted that when he won the Conservative leadership in 2005, all seven candidates were white men.
Cameron encouraged a new generation of Tories of colour, and women, to stand for parliament and take the electoral fight to Labour.
“Some dismiss (social) cohesion as a soft concept and a second-order policy,” he said. 
“It isn’t. Look at (Donald) Trump’s America — now more divided and discontented than the vision of a melting pot I’ve always admired.” But while the next prime minister will look different, some things never change in UK politics.
Out of Britain’s 15 post-war leaders to date, 11 studied at Oxford University, including Johnson, May, Cameron, Tony Blair and Thatcher.
So did Sunak and Truss.
“The elite is more open, provided you have the educational and professional credentials,” Katwala said.
“It’s yet to find a way of doing the same for working-class, less-educated people,” he said. “But it’s still progress.”
