0,Reaction to PTI’s allegations: IGP transferred on his own request just before CM’s re-election,Official says his IGP's transfer was being associated with the recent campaign launched by the PTI leadership.,"LAHORE: A few hours before the much-hyped re-election of the Punjab chief minister, the federal government transferred the provincial police chief Rao Sardar Ali Khan and appointed Faisal Shahkar (BPS-22) as the new inspector general of police (IGP). 
The government changed the Punjab police commander after Mr Khan requested it to transfer him to any suitable place as he was not willing to serve anymore in the province under the present circumstances. He was serving as the managing director of the Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA) when he was posted as the IGP last September by the then PTI government. 
A senior official told Dawn Rao Sardar Ali Khan was the most favourite police officer of Imran Khan who, as the prime minister, had shortlisted him from amongst four other senior police officers in the race to command the Punjab Police. He said Rao Sardar had replaced Inam Ghani who was removed from the post when the then Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar complained to his PM that Mr Ghani had bypassed him and was in close contact with Azam Khan, the then secretary to the PM. 
The official said Mr Khan’s transfer was being associated with the recent campaign launched by the PTI leadership, which ‘targeted’ him and Punjab Chief Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal. 
The PTI leaders had warned the officers that they would initiate legal and departmental actions against them on coming to power again. 
On some occasions, Imran Khan had ‘called’ names of both the top government officers of Punjab in his public meetings and announced making them an example, accusing them of taking side of the ruling PML-N. 
He said Rao Sardar felt insulted when former federal minister Shahbaz Gill on Friday passed humiliating remarks against him before commencement of much-anticipated session of the Punjab Assembly to elect the chief minister. 
Rao Sardar Ali Khan wanted his ‘respectful exit’ and on Friday he deemed it right to quit the slot instead of bringing more embarrassment for the PML-N ruling in Punjab and centre. 
According to some media reports, Rao Sardar Ali Khan and Kamran Ali Afzal had requested the government to transfer them out of Punjab a few days back, fearing punitive action after the change of government in the province in the wake of the re-election of the CM.   
Respecting Mr Khan’s request sent through the Punjab government, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif transferred and posted him as new IG Pakistan Railways Police vice Faisal Shahkar. 
“With the approval of the Federal Government, Mr Rao Sardar Ali Khan, a BS-22 police officer, presently posted as Provincial Police Officer of the Punjab government, is hereby transferred and posted as Inspector General of Pakistan Railways Police with immediate effect and until further order,” reads a notification issued by the Establishment Division, Islamabad. 
In another separate notification, the division has appointed Faisal Shahkar as the new IGP Punjab.  
About the newly appointed IGP, the senior official said, Faisal Shahkar belongs to 16th Common and has previously served on various important field positions in Punjab. He has worked as additional IG special branch Punjab for three years and remained posted as the regional police officer of Sahiwal and Gujranwala besides rendering services in other districts of the province.  
Mr Shahkar has also performed duties in other countries like Bosnia and Liberia under the UN missions.

1,Travellers anguished by delay in train operations,PR says recent rains have aggravated the situation,"LAHORE: The arrival and departure of several passenger and express trains continue to face delays disrupting the overall operations.  
The Pakistan Railways (PR) says erosion of the rail track at various spots due to torrential rains in parts of the country and other technical reasons are the major causes for the state of affairs. The department has also sought an apology from the public at large for inconvenience caused to them due to disruption in the trains’ schedule. 
“In fact, it is due to torrential rains in various parts of Sindh and Balochistan for the last three weeks. This natural disaster caused destruction to our system including various portions of the track,” PR Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Farrakh Taimur Alazai said in a statement on Friday.  
He said the floodwater caused by the heavy rains eroded the portion of the railways line between Jhampir and Meting station (Thattha district). Similarly, the rains also affected the rail track between Kharian and Rawalpindi, he added. 

PR says recent rains have aggravated the situation  

He said despite facing such a tough situation, the PR field officials not only restored the tracks but also rail traffic. “I do apologise to people for the situation. I assure you that the situation would improve within next few days,” the CEO said, adding that despite facing such a bad situation, none of the trains was cancelled. 
Meanwhile, the schedule of various trains remained disrupted. On Friday too, several trains arrived at the Lahore Railway Station from Karachi very late.  
According to a spokesman for the PR, Pak Business Express, Khyber Mail Express, Shah Hussain Express, Rehman Baba Express, Karakoram Express, Fareed Express, Millat Express, Tezgam Express, Green Line Express, Allama Iqbal Express, Awam Express, Pakistan Express, Karachi Express-2 and Sir Syed Express arrived hours late. Similarly, Jafar Express arrived four hours late in Lahore from Quetta. The departure of the aforementioned trains from Lahore to other cities also got delayed for hours. 
Meanwhile, the PR authorities have allowed one-minute stoppage of Ghauri Express at Farooqabad and Bahalekay stations. The authorities have also allowed two-minute stoppage of Subak Raftar Express at Kharian Cantt station. 
The rail authorities have also started implementing the notification allowing 10 per cent decrease in the economy class fares of all passenger trains due to recent reduction in the prices of the petroleum products.

2,Getting certificates from MC an uphill task,"4,000 cases pending for last six months in Rahim Yar Khan","RAHIM YAR KHAN: People of the city are facing hardships in getting their computerised birth certificates, death certificates, marriage registration certificates and effective divorce certificates for the last six months. 
There are more than 4,000 cases pending with the municipal corporation (MC) of the categories mentioned above due to unavailability of security paper and lack of coordination between the corporation and the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra). 
Dozens of people visit the MC office to get certificates of various categories and the staff, without informing them about the issue, receives their applications after getting fees, asking them to remain in contact with the office for further correspondence.  
One Muhammad Ashraf told this correspondent that he had applied for birth certificates of his three children three months ago but he was still waiting for issuance of certificates.  

4,000 cases pending for last six months in Rahim Yar Khan

Another person, Muhammad Munir, said when he applied for the death certificate of his mother, he was told that there was a shortage of security paper.  
The non-issuance of death certificates creates difficulties in mutation of land while divorce certificates are necessary for women who want to contract another marriage.  
Many other applicants said they could not get B form from Nadra, which was a big hurdle to admission of their children to schools.  
Jam Irfan, who is in charge of the birth and death certificates branch at the municipal corporation, told Dawn there were 4,000 pending applications of different cases with his office since January 2022. 
He said the shortage of security paper was a problem until the last month after which rules were changed and now the certificates would be issued on simple white paper like e-stamp papers. 
He said the actual problem was the upgrade of the municipal committee computers by Nadra as Nadra staff had taken all 10 computers of his office to upgrade them on June 6, 2022 but returned only three of them.  
This correspondent tried to contact the Nadra office but there was no authorised person for comments on the issue.

A good number of people attended the festival at the Hall 2 where the inaugural play was “Book of Love” by the Maas Foundation. 
“Book of Love” -- a nonverbal musical play -- is one-of-its-kind production because in Pakistan, normally theatre companies didn’t try a nonverbal production. Concept of this play is created by Hassan Raza while it is directed by Maas Foundation President Aamir Nawaz.  
“Book of Love” is a story about a five-year-old kid who suddenly finds himself in front of a book having the sketches of a teenage boy and a girl. He starts to portrait the vision of that book in which different scenes build up and lead to a loving relationship between the girl and the boy. The boy proposes the girl and finally they get married. But time is not always a honeymoon period and soon they find themselves misfit for each other.  
This musical, yet emotional love story is specially designed for teenagers and young audience. 
Director Aamir Nawaz told Dawn that the Maas Foundation had performed the play at the 8th Colombo International Theatre Festival 2019 in Sri Lanka and also at the 2nd International Tamasha Festival 2019 in Lahore by Assitej Pakistan. This play always had the audience emotional, yet they also lost in the love story which is knit in a best musical way.  
He said it was the only theatre company in Pakistan, which had performed in English, Urdu, Punjabi and nonverbal productions.  
The set of the play was designed by Aamir Ali, music was composed by Imran Nawaz and choreography by Gulshan Majeed. The cast included Eshah Shakeel, Hassan Raza and Gulshan Majeed.

However, it has not allowed the operators to increase the price of roti from Rs10 to 15, according to Mutahidda Nanbai Association President Aftab Gill. 
“Actually, we staged a protest demonstration outside the Lahore Press Club before Eid in a bid to press the government to accept our demands keeping in view the skyrocketing prices of fine atta (maida), flour and other items. But the administration didn’t bother about our protest that forced us to observe a shutter-down strike in Lahore on Wednesday,” Gill told this reporter on Friday. 
He said the administration held dialogues with the association’s office-bearers. And finally the administration agreed to allow the tandoor operators to sell naan at Rs20 keeping in view the non-regulation of the maida prices under the law. 
“Under the law, it is not the mandate of the government to regulate maida prices,” he said, adding that when the 84kg maida bag was being sold at Rs4,900 in the past, naan was also being sold at Rs15. But when the 80kg price increased to Rs7,700, the administration continued forcing the operators to sell it at the same price, which was not justified. 
He said the administration also sought a 10-day time for provision of flour to the operators at subsidised prices so as to ensure provision of roti at Rs10.  
“But if we are not provided the flour under subsidised prices, we will have no option but to increase price of roti from Rs10 to 15,” Gill added. 
He said the administration also pledged to not make arrests of the operators by registering FIRs. 
According to Gill, Lahore has over 10,000 tandoors providing jobs to nearly 40,000 workers. He said besides increase in the flour and maida prices, the operators have also been facing impact of the increased gas and electricity rates. Moreover, due to gas loadshedding, they are using the raw wood and LPG cylinders to keep tandoors operational.

Later, he said, an accountability court approved the closing of the inquiries against the family at the request of the NAB.
The investigating officer of the FIA stated that custody of the suspects was required to complete the investigation.
Presiding Judge Aslam Gondal directed the IO to conclude his arguments by July 23 and also extended the bail of Moonis and others.
The FIA registered the FIR under sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of a common intention), 109 (punishment for abatement), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using a genuine forged document) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and section 4 of the Anti Money Laundering Act, 2010.
The FIR says in the light of the Sugar Commission`s report that the FIA was mandated by the federal government to probe financial and corporate frauds committed by various sugar mills, including Rahim Yar Khan/Alliance Sugar Mills.
