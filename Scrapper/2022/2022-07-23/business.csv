0,Electricity base tariff increased by Rs7.91 a unit,"Tariff for those consuming 101-200 units per month increased by Rs7.21, rate for consumers using 201-300 units goes up by Rs8.31.","ISLAMABAD: Moving swiftly to meet a pre-condition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic bailout, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Friday approved for notification Rs7.91 per unit increase in ‘uniform national tariff’ and its application in three phases.
The Nepra had conducted the public hearing on the government request on July 20 and within 48 hours approved it without any change. “The authority [Nepra] has approved the request of the federal government,” an announcement said. The Power Division would now send the notification to the Discos for implementation with immediate effect.
“As per the request, the consumer-end tariff will be increased in three phases i.e. July, Aug-Sept and October onward,” said a Nepra announcement. No increase has been proposed for lifeline (up to 100 units) and protected category of consumers (101-200 units per month), it added.
The Nepra announcement said the decision would be applicable with the government notification. As such, the average tariff increase would become effective at the rate of Rs3.50 per unit during the current month, followed by another Rs3.50 per unit in August-September billing and the remaining 91 paise per unit in October. The rates would be equally applied across the country, including K-Electric.
The Nepra said it had already determined different consumer-end for each power distribution company (ex-Wapda Discos) on June 2 for this fiscal year under which “national average tariff is now Rs24.82 per kWh, higher by Rs7.91per kWh than the earlier determined national average tariff of Rs16.91/kWh”. Based on this determination, the government requested approval of a uniform consumer-end tariff after incorporating subsidies and surcharges for all the ex-Wapda Discos and K-Electric.
The tariff for certain high-consumption residential consumers has been increased by Rs11 per unit to cover the additional burden of consumers with lower consumption. The approved rate under the ‘tariff rebasing 2022-23” for consumers with a monthly consumption slab of 101-200 units and above is significantly higher than Rs7.91 per unit increase in the uniform national average.
Besides the massive cross-subsidisation among various consumer slabs, the government would still be providing Rs234bn subsidy, Rs220bn for distribution companies of ex-Wapda and Rs14bn for K-Electric finance the tariff rebasing cost of poor consumers.
The consumers using fewer than 100 units and falling in the non-protected category shall now be charged Rs13.48/unit instead of Rs19.56/unit suggested by  Nepra and the consequential revenue differential shall be adjusted in various categories.
The increase in power rates for consumers of the ‘unprotected category’ using up to 100 units per month would be higher by about Rs4.06 per unit instead of Rs7.91 worked out by Nepra and hence this burden has to be passed on to the higher consumption categories.
The base tariff for those consuming 101-200 has increased by Rs7.21 per unit in phases to Rs18.95 while the rate for 201-300 per month has gone up by Rs8.31 to Rs22.14 per unit. The rate for 301-400 units has been increased by Rs4.30 per unit to Rs25.53, while the rate for 401-500 units has gone up by Rs6.51 per unit to Rs27.74.
Likewise, the base rate for 501-600 units is now increased to Rs29.16 per unit, up by Rs7.93 and that of 601-700 unit rate is fixed at Rs30.30 per unit, showing an increase of Rs8.97 per unit.
The base tariff for consumption above 700 units per month has gone up to Rs35.22 per unit, with an increase of Rs11 per unit. The base rate for the time of use (TOU) meters would go up by Rs10.06 to Rs34.39 for peak consumption hours and Rs28.07 per unit for off-peak hours.
The base tariff increase is on top of monthly fuel price adjustments that have ranged between Rs6-8 per unit in recent months. The government has already withdrawn with effect from June 8 a subsidy of about Rs5 per unit introduced by former premier Imran Khan on Feb 28.
The tariff increase would generate additional revenue of Rs893 billion in 2022-23 to meet the annual revenue requirement of about Rs2.52 trillion to power companies, excluding KE besides providing a general sales tax of more than Rs425bn to the government.

1,Tight spot market comes as blessing after Qatar LNG deals save the day,Average LNG cost drops by more than 15pc for July owing to long-term supply contracts with Qatar.,"ISLAMABAD: Amid an influx of inflationary events, the unavailability of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in an expensive international spot market has come as a blessing in disguise for Pakistani consumers as the average LNG cost has dropped by more than 15pc for July owing to long-term supply contracts with Qatar.
According to a notification issued by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Friday, the average basket price for the supply of imported Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) to two gas companies — SNGPL and SSGCL — has dropped by 15-16pc to $16.19 and $15.78 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), respectively at transmission stage for July when compared to $19.07 and $18.8 per mmBtu in June.
The RLNG price at the distribution stage has dropped to $17.46 and $17.96 per mmBtu for SNGPL and SSGCL, respectively, down by 15.93pc and 20.57pc. The price notification showed that five cargoes were brought in at 13.37pc of Brent or $13.65 per mmBtu while three cargoes came in at the rate of 10.2pc of Brent or $11.38 per mmBtu.
As such, the RLNG consumer price at the distribution stage is down by $3.31 per mmBtu for SNGPL and $4.65 per mmBtu for SSGCL in July when compared to June. It may be noted that LNG’s basket price in May had touched a record $22-24 per mmBtu owing to a string of spot cargoes procured by the new coalition government in the first month in office to meet energy shortages.

Imported price of RLNG drops over 15pc in July

Since then, repeated efforts to import more gas through spot tenders have remained futile owing to tight supply conditions and record prices in the international market following the Russia-Ukraine war. As such, all the eight cargoes in July available to Pakistan were under long-term contracts with Qatar and not a single cargo could be arranged from the spot market.
Mainly because of expensive spot imports in June, the average LNG-based power generation cost amounted to Rs28.4 per kWh (unit) — the second most expensive source of power generation after Rs36.2 per unit on furnace oil. 
As a consequence, the fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for electricity would increase by almost Rs10 per unit in August. With lower LNG cost, the FCA for power generation in July is expected to be cheaper than that of June.
The average sale price for Lahore-based SNGPL had stood at $21.83 per mmBtu in May, up 40pc from $15.616 per mmBtu in April. Likewise, the average RLNG sale price for Karachi-based SSGCL had stood at $23.79 per mmBtu in May against $16.91 per mmBtu in April, showing an increase of about 41pc.
Pakistan has two long-term contracts with Qatar, one involving six cargoes at 13.37pc of Brent signed by the previous PML-N government and two to three cargoes contracted by the PTI government at 10.2pc of Brent.
The average cost of six long-term contract cargoes of PSO-Qatar stood at $5.78 per mmBtu in December 2020.

2,"Traders protest against KE for charging Rs6,000 sales tax",Power suppliers in other cities have yet not started charging this tax.,"KARACHI: The government has imposed a sales tax of Rs6,000 per month on commercial electricity meters across the country effective from July 1, but only K-Electric has implemented the Finance Bill 2022 decision causing unrest among the traders in the country’s economic and commercial hub. 
As a result, the traders’ associations have been up in the arms for the last two days against K-Electric for sending inflated bills after charging the sales tax. 
All Karachi Tajir Ittehad (AKTI) chairman Atiq Mir said traders would start sit-in in front of the KE head office till the removal of Rs6,000 from the bill. “It is highly unjustified to implement the decision only on traders of Karachi.” 
Meanwhile, Markaz-i-Anjuman Tajiran Pakistan President Kashif Chaudhry said: “We strongly condemn the imposition of Rs6,000 sales tax in power bills and urge the government to take back the decision.”

Power suppliers in other cities have yet not started charging this tax 

When asked about any protests being held in Punjab cities, he said “traders have so far not received the power bills in the big province but we will protest it in case it is implemented.” 
All City Tajir Ittehad Association General Secretary Muhammad Ahmed Shamsi said the association held two protests — one at Karim Centre Saddar on Thursday and the second at Jama Clothe M.A. Jinnah Road on Friday. “While the third has been planned at Zoological Garden Chowk on Saturday,” he announced. 
Protesting traders at the main arteries of the city have resolved not to pay the inflated bills to K-Electric at any cost, he said. 
He said it is unjustified to impose this tax on small traders and shopkeepers since they are not registered in the sales tax. For many, it would be hard to bear an extra Rs72,000 per year. 
In case a shop has four meters, then it would be unjustified for the owner to pay Rs6,000 sales tax separately on each bill, Mr Atiq said.
Mr Shamsi said the sales tax of Rs6,000 was implemented on all commercial meters even on godowns or closed shops. 
He also expressed surprise as to how a private utility company has been authorised to collect the sales tax, which looks like sheer blackmailing with the traders.

Mr Bhayo said Sindh is already in the process of negotiation with Power Division for the acquisition of Sepco and Hesco, and expressed his confidence in the ability of the provinces to be successful in the power distribution business also, as Sindh province is already in power generation and transmission.
Last year, CCoP approved the concession contracts for eight of the ten Discos.
