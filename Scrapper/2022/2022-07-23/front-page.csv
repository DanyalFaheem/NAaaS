LAHORE: The ruling coalition in Punjab sprang its own ‘surprise’ on Friday when, against all odds, Hamza Shehbaz was re-elected chief minister of Punjab by three votes after Deputy Speaker Dost Muha­m­mad Mazari rejected all 10 votes cast by the PML-Q on the pretext that they had violated the orders of their party chief.
The run-off election for the post of Punjab chief minister was held in the Punjab Assembly on Friday, in line with the instructions of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. 
After counting the polled votes, the deputy speaker announced that Parvez Elahi bagged 186 votes, while Hamza Shehbaz could get 179 votes. However, he refrained from declaring Elahi the chief minister.
Instead, he indicated that as party chief, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain’s instruction to PML-Q members to vote for Hamza Shehbaz instead of Parvez Elahi held greater sway. 
Drawing the attention of the house to a letter he received from the Chaudhry clan’s patriarch, said to contain directions for all 10 party MPAs (including the candidate himself) to vote for PML-N candidate Hamza Shehbaz, he said he had personally phoned Mr Shujaat to verify the contents of the message. “I called Shujaat Hussain myself and asked whether he had written the letter regarding instructions to party MPAs, and he confirmed it thrice,” Mazari said.
In light of this conversation, he declared: “I disregard all 10 votes polled by PML-Q MPAs as they violated the party president’s instructions, in line with the ruling of the Supreme Court”.   
The deputy speaker then announced that Hamza Shehbaz had won the election of chief minister, since the 10 deducted votes reduced Elahi’s tally to 176, while Hamza remained on top with 179.
An outraged Elahi asked how the deputy speaker could reject the vote of the candidate himself, while former law minister Basharat Raja tried to mount a legal defence, arguing that it was not the party chief’s prerogative, rather that of the parliamentary party leader, to issue the party line. 
When Mr Raja told the deputy speaker that he was “doing everything wrong”, Mazari asked him to challenge his decision. 
To substantiate this claim, former federal minister Moonis Elahi, who is Parvez Elahi’s son, shared on Twitter a letter issued by parliamentary leader Sajid Ahmad Khan to all 10 MPAs directing them to vote for his father.
“Yesterday, PML-Q parliamentary party chaired by parliamentary party leader Sajid Ahmad Khan in Punjab Assembly held its meeting and it was unanimously decided that Parvez Elahi is the CM candidate,” Moonis Elahi tweeted.

 





 
The face of this most crucial election immediately changed following PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari’s two back-to-back meetings with Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain at the latter’s residence, which continued well after midnight. When he did finally leave, Mr Zardari left Shujaat Hussain’s residence while waving the victory sign.
The PML-Q sensed a debacle brewing, as Geo News’ Hamid Mir quoted Moonis Elahi as saying that Chaudhry Shujaat had confirmed to him that he had written a letter to the deputy speaker and that he could not support Parvez Elahi as “Imran Khan’s candidate”.
Editorial: If democracy is to move forward, PML-N and allies must refrain from unethical moves to retain Punjab
All the MPAs in the house and the media in the gallery had sensed something brewing when a heavy contingent of security personnel, led by the sergeant-at-arms and consisting of some two dozens plainclothes men, formed a security wall around the deputy speaker before he announced the election results.
As Mazari prorogued the 40th session, PML-N MPAs broke into celebration and lifted Hamza on their shoulders, chanting slogans glorifying the ‘sher’ and, of course, Mr Zardari.
After the final results were announced, PTI and PML-Q descended upon Chaudhry Shujaat’s residence, throwing ‘lotas’ and chanting slogans.
Later, MNA Hussain Elahi tweeted: “If Zardari and Ch Shujaat want a fight, it is a fight we will give! We stood with Imran Khan and Pakistan, In Sha Allah will keep standing strong!”.

 





 
Later, Parvez Elahi chaired another joint meeting of the parliamentary parties of the PTI and PML-Q, where he said that their numbers were complete, but the deputy speaker showed partiality by undermining the Constitution and the law. 
PTI leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that Mr Elahi had won constitutionally, morally and politically, adding that all 186 MPAs would approach the Supreme Court to get an over-arching decision.
Dr Babar Awan was more confident about Mr Elahi’s chances, saying that while he could not take oath on Friday, he would do so in the next two to four days.

1,PML-N will ‘fight fire with fire’,Retaining Punjab ‘at all costs’ may come at a heavy political price for Sharifs.,"Lahore: The Sharifs proved on Friday that they are in no mood to lose the all-important throne of Punjab, given its political importance. However, retaining it ‘at all costs’ may come at a heavy political price.
The controversial victory of Hamza Shehbaz, the son of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who retained the chief minister’s office against his opponent, the joint PTI and Q-League candidate Parvez Elahi, will only add to the already chaotic political environment and prevailing instability which Pakistan has been desperately looking to get out of. 
The move also shows how desperate the ruling coalition is to not slip Punjab from its hands, where they are counting on being in control so as to put their political stratagems into action in the days to come. 
The Sharifs on Friday did almost exactly what PTI did in April at the centre. And as was the case when the no-confidence motion against former prime minister Imran Khan was turned down by then-deputy speaker Qasim Khan Suri, the matter of the Punjab Assembly deputy speaker’s ruling may also have to be settled by the apex court.
After being subjected to a humiliating defeat at the hands of the PTI in last Sunday’s by-polls, the PML-N seems to have decided that there is no room for morality in their politics, going forward. The Sharifs apparently took a leaf out of the political playbook on the ’80s and ’90s in a bid to outsmart their relatively-new political rival — Imran Khan.
Mr Khan, who spearheaded the by-election campaign against his rivals on the back of name-calling; using ‘thieves’ and ‘dacoits’ liberally to describe Sharif, Zardari and co, the latest machination by the PML-N and PPP seems to be provided him more with ammunition.
Although there was a section in the party that advised caution, opposing the idea of indulging in this brand of politics, the hawks among their ranks favoured a ‘befitting reply’ to Mr Khan, believing that fighting fire with fire was the only way to deal with the ‘fitna’ (mischief) he hath wrought forth. 
Even the PML-N supreme leader’s own daughter, Maryam Nawaz, who had gracefully accepted her party’s defeat last weekend, changed tact on Friday when she tweeted that they were going to give as good as they got. 
“PMLN has NOT forgotten the treatment meted out to them. Now the rules of the game will be the same for everyone, else PMLN knows how to play it better,” she said on Twitter. 

 





 
For observers, this was a hint that the party leadership is determined to draw out the PML-N led coalition government’s tenure until next August, when general elections are supposed to be held.
Talking to Dawn, a PML-N senior leader tried to justify the deputy speaker’s ruling by saying that the coalition could not afford to lose Punjab. 
“Losing Punjab means allowing the PTI-PMLQ alliance to send us home from the centre, which we forestalled. We carried the baggage left behind by the Imran Khan government, took harsh economic decisions and paid the price in the by-polls. We cannot tolerate being made to pay the price for the previous government’s poor economic decisions while Mr Khan comes out unscathed,” he said.
The ruling coalition also wants the establishment to fully back it up to fix the economy and, for this purpose, it needs a ‘green signal’ to lay hands on Imran Khan. 
Federal ministers such as Rana Sanaullah, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Saad Rafique and Javed Latif had already started voicing this demand openly after the losing by-polls. They have also been urging the ECP to announce its verdict in the long-drawn prohibited funding case against Imran Khan and his party. “Putting Imran Khan behind bars will help us fix the economy in a congenial environment,” the leader said.
The Zardari factor
The PPP leader has once again proved what his son Bilawal said about him; ‘Aik Zardari Sab Pe Bhaari’ (one Zardari outweighs them all).
The maxim seems to hold true; his role in ensuring the success of the no-confidence motion against Mr Khan in April cannot be denied. This time around, however, he managed to pull off a trick even his allies could not have imagined — making PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain go against his own cousin.
It also appears that the Sharifs are heavily depending on Mr Zardari to make the impossible, possible. Although, there is a feeling within the PML-N ranks that the Sharifs are damaging their politics by blindly following Zardari, but in the face of Mr Khan’s onslaught, it seems the Sharifs have no other choice.
Trouble in Chaudhry’s paradise
Shujaat turning against Elahi at a very crucial point was, in fact, seen by many as the ‘official announcement’ of a breakup among the Chaudhry brothers of Gujrat.
It is believed that Shujaat’s sons — Salik and Shafay — made their father take the decision to go against Elahi in the CM poll. Shujaat’s brother Wajahat Hussain recently alleged that his (Shujaat)’s sons had accepted dollars from Mr Zardari to join the PML-N led coalition. For his part, Shujaat had been insisting that his brother take back the allegation and apologise, which he did not.

2,SC opens at midnight to entertain PML-Q challenge,Parvez Elahi files petition; Fawad Chaudhry says PTI may also move the apex court against Hamza's election.,"LAHORE / ISLAMABAD: Following the unexpected turn of events at Friday’s session of the Punjab Assembly, the Lahore registry of the Supreme Court was opened at midnight on the directions of Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Atta Bandial, who was present in the city, to entertain a petition filed by the PML-Q.
Lahore Registry Deputy Registrar Ejaz Goraya and other staff reached the registry around midnight, and the petition was filed by PML-Q lawyer Amir Saeed Rawn.
Earlier, both PTI and PML-Q had announced their intention to challenge the contentious ruling of Deputy Speaker Dost Muhammad Mazari, declaring Hamza Shehbaz as the elected chief minister of Punjab.
“We will challenge the controversial ruling of the deputy speaker because we believe it is against the spirit of Article 63A of the Constitution, as well as the ruling of the Supreme Court in the presidential reference seeking interpretation of Article 63A,” senior Advocate Faisal Fareed told Dawn on Friday night. 
A few days ago, Faisal Fareed had moved a contempt of the court petition against Hamza Shehbaz and Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan — on behalf of Speaker Punjab Assembly Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi — before the apex court for violating the July 1 apex court directions.
Hamza had given an undertaking before the court not to take any measure that could be construed as harassment of the political opponents. 
However Faisal Fareed said PTI’s legal team would decide whether they will invoke Article 199 or Article 184(3) of the Constitution, adding that the challenge would be laid before the courts in a day or two. 
He said that in case the party decided to invoke Article 199, then they would definitely approach the Lahore High Court, otherwise a challenge under Article 184(3) would be laid before the Supreme Court as the deputy speaker’s ruling went against the decision of the apex court.
But PTI leader and former minister Fawad Chaudhry, who was in the middle of a huddle with party leaders when he spoke to Dawn, said PTI may file a petition before the Supreme Court as soon as possible.
Following the assembly session on Friday night, Parvez Elahi and PML-Q and PTI MPAs also gathered outside the SC registry, where workers of both parties chanted slogans in favour of Mr Elahi.
The charged workers even tried to enter the registry building by climbing over its wall.

3,"‘Shocked’ Imran says all eyes on SC, calls for protests","LAHORE: After losing the Punjab chief minister’s office to PML-N’s Hamza Shehbaz, PTI chairman Imran Khan said...","LAHORE: After losing the Punjab chief minister’s office to PML-N’s Hamza Shehbaz, PTI chairman Imran Khan said all eyes were again on the Supreme Court as the party planned to challenge the Punjab Assembly deputy speaker’s rejection of votes of PML-Q lawmakers. 
“I expect the Supreme Court to play its role in light of Hamza Shehbaz’s shock win over Parvez Elahi in the Punjab CM election,” Mr Khan said in a virtual address to the nation. 
He also urged his workers and supporters, particularly the youth, to take to the streets to register their protest on Friday night. He said the masses should carry out peaceful protests all over the country to tell the world they were not goats and sheep, but humans. “Register your protest today so they know the Pakistani nation is alive. Tell them that you will not let these dacoits steal the mandate of the public,” he stressed. 
“I am in shock at what happened in the Punjab Assembly over the defeat of PTI-backed Mr Elahi,” he declared, adding that parliament did not have an army, but moral authority. 
Mr Khan further said: “A mandi (market) was set up. Our children were watching it. Every child has social media these days. There was a market set up where the price of the conscience of public leaders and parliamentarians was determined,” he said. “Even there, the biggest culprit was the biggest dacoit Asif Zardari. He has gone to jail for corruption and still rules over Sindh. He became part of the imported conspiracy.” 
The former prime minister said he went to the people’s court after being removed from the PM office and his peaceful protest was tear-gassed and homes were raided. The people responded to his call to reject “US slavery” and subsequently his party swept the recent by-elections. 
“We got to know two days ago that Asif Ali Zardari was playing a game,” he remarked.
Talking about PML-Q president Chaudhry Shujaat’s letter sent to the deputy speaker, Imran Khan said the document had no significance because a parliamentary party head had to direct lawmakers to vote for a certain candidate. “Shujaat wrote a letter directing his party’s MPAs to vote for a certain candidate but that was rejected and the parliamentary leader wrote a letter instead.” 
He also said Chaudhry Shujaat was not PML-Q’s parliamentary party head but the chief of his party. 
Mr Khan said if petty thieves were jailed and the big looters not caught then the nation would not progress. 
“We will deal with them again and again; they will never let the country progress. As the rupee depreciates, their wealth will increase; their wealth is lying in accounts abroad in dollars. We will not allow the robbers to steal our mandate with stolen money,” the PTI chairman vowed. 
He said the current political turmoil would further create economic uncertainty in the country.

4,Who decides party line: Parliamentary party or PML-Q chief?,Rejection of all 10 votes of PML-Q by Punjab Assembly deputy speaker in contest for CM election has ignited fresh controversy.,"The rejection of all 10 votes of the PML-Q by the Punjab Assembly’s deputy speaker in the contest for the chief minister’s slot, which paved the way for Hamza Shehbaz’s victory, has ignited a fresh controversy. 
During Friday’s session, the deputy speaker said he had spoken to Shujaat Hussain over the phone to verify the letter he had written, and citied the apex court’s verdict on the interpretation of Article 63-A — which led to the de-seating of 25 PTI MPAs — as the basis for his decision to reject all 10 PML-Q votes for “violating the party head’s direction”.
This step, which is reminiscent of what the PTI tried to do during proceedings for a no-confidence vote against Imran Khan through Qasim Suri’s ruling, has triggered a fresh political crisis and given birth to yet another constitutional controversy over the interpretation of Article 63-A in the light of recent Supreme Court orders.
The article in question states: “If a member of a Parliamentary Party composed of a single political party in a House — (a) resigns from membership of his political party or joins another Parliamentary party; or (b) votes or abstains from voting in the House contrary to any direction issued by the Parliamentary Party to which he belongs, in relation to — (i) election of the Prime Minister or the Chief Minister; or (ii) a vote of confidence or a vote of no-confidence; or (iii) a Money Bill or a Constitution (Amendment) Bill; he may be declared in writing by the Party Head to have defected from the political party…”
Former attorney general Irfan Qadir was of the opinion that Mr Mazari relied on the apex court’s decision in a similar matter, adding that the deputy speaker only had two options — count the votes or reject them. In both cases, the affected party would have objected to his decision, he said.
Responding to a query about the discussion on who gets to set the party line — the parliamentary party or the party head — Mr Qadir said there were two aspects to this question: a legal one and a practical one. 
In legal terms, he said, the stance of the parliamentary party is brought forward through the stance of the party head, as was seen in the case of the defection of 25 PTI MPAs.
There may be a situation in which a party head is giving one policy and the parliamentary party is going against it, as was seen in the CM election on Friday, he said. He questioned how a party at odds with its own head could keep a province united.
PTI Senator and former Supreme Court Bar Association president Ali Zafar said if the parliamentary party took one decision and the party head another, then it was a political issue and had nothing to do with the constitutional or legal crisis.
Supreme Court Bar Association President Ahsan Bhoon told Dawn the deputy speaker acted in the light of the apex court’s verdict on 63-A. He claimed that there was an inherent flaw in the SC verdict that led to even the candidate himself – i.e. Parvez Elahi – being barred from voting for himself. 
Constitutional expert Hamid Khan, who has also been associated with the PTI and contested an election on the party ticket in the past, believed that the deputy speaker didn’t take the right decision. 
He argued that the verdict Mr Mazari cited as the basis of his ruling was of a different nature. “Directions [on adopting a policy] can be given by the parliamentary party and not the party head, who can though initiate action on violation of the party’s direction in voting for CM’s election, no-confidence or a money bill,” he said. 
As the losing party was going to move a court of law, Mr Khan said it would be a long legal battle for the PML-Q president, who will now surely use his actual powers to get those Q-Leaguers disqualified who went against his directions in the runoff poll.
Known lawyer Salman Akram Raja asserted that Chaudhry Shujaat could not bar MPAs from voting as per their parliamentary party’s decision. 
“Article 63-A is clear. Some manipulations of the Constitution are sad, this one is just silly,” he tweeted, while referring to Mr Mazari’s decision.

 





 
“Travesty by the Deputy Speaker. All sides have tried to make a mockery of the Constitutional process when it has suited them to do so. The Constitution functions meaningfully only when all entrusted with implementing it follow its text & its spirit regardless of partisan politics,” he said, in another tweet.

 





 
Barrister Haider Zaman Qureshi, however, argued that the deputy speaker’s ruling is in line with the judgement of the Lahore High Court and Supreme Court. In case votes were cast against a party head’s directives, they were liable to be excluded from the count. 
“Today’s ruling is not contrary to the interpretation of Article 63-A as laid down by the superior courts of Pakistan. The question whether such MPAs will lose their membership will be determined once the party head writes to the Election Commission about their disqualification in terms of Article 63-A,” he said.

The members will serve pro bono or on an honorary basis, according to the notification.
Previously, the 40-member special committee notified by the PTI government in December last year was headed by the then Parliamentary Secretary for Law, Barrister Maleeka Ali Bukhari, as its chairperson.
According to the new notification, former Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq will chair the committee, which will also include Mehnaz Akbar Aziz, chief secretaries of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, Balochistan, and Sindh, representatives of the National Database and Registra­tion Authority (Nadra), Pakis­tan Elec­tro­nic Media Regulatory Auth­o­rity (Pemra), and the law ministry, ex-prosecutor general Punjab Ehti­sham Qadir, ex additional inspectors general Kamal­uddin Tipu, Taimoor Ali Khan, advocate Ismat Mehdi, Khalid Parveen, Amb­reen Qureshi, Ghazala Yasmeen, Nida Ali and Sharafat Ali, development consultant Valerie Khan, Mohammad Ali Nekokara, Zainab Mustafa, anchor Maria Memon, Police surgeon Sumayya Syed and forensic expert Ayesha Sarwar.
The Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act 2021, recently passed by parliament, seeks to establish special courts and use modern devices during the investigation and trial of rape cases. The special committee can also issue appropriate directives from time to time to Nadra to prepare a register of sex offenders, the details of which will only be provided to a court of law or a law enforcement agency.
Under the law, special courts have been established throughout the country in consultation with the chief justice of Pakistan and may appoint any person as judge of the special court who is or has been a session judge or additional sessions judge, or an advocate for a period of not less than 10 years and is not more than 70 years of age at the time of appointment.
The special court’s judge has the same powers and jurisdiction as the sessions court and will be appointed for a period of three years, but could be transferred to another special court within the same province.
Anti-rape crisis cells were established throughout the country. The cells are headed by the commissioner or deputy commissioner of the area concerned as deemed fit by the prime minister and will also comprise the medical superintendent of a public hospital and the district police officer or a police officer heading a division.

6,Records smashed as over 100 leave a mark on K2 summit,"Samina Baig becomes first Pakistani woman to summit K2; women from Iran, Saudi Arabia and Oman break glass ceiling.","GILGIT: For the first time, more than 100 climbers summited the world’s second highest peak in a single day, with female mountaineers from Pakis­tan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Oman creating history by becoming the first-ever woman of their respective country to reach the top of 8,611-metre K2.
Pakistani climber Samina Baig, who had summited Mt. Everest in 2013, summited K2 along with her team, three hours before ‘mountaineer mom’ Naila Kiani, who had scaled Gasherbrum-II only last year, summited it. In all, 18 Pakistanis, including many from Gilgit-Baltistan, scaled the country’s highest peak on the same day.
Also, 29-year-old Grace Tseng has become the world’s youngest female climber to summit K2 without supplemental oxygen and the first Taiwanese ever to have stood on top of the Savage Mountain.
Read: Around 100 embark for K2 summit, six scale Broad Peak
While 170 climbers from various continents had started their summit push from the base camp recently, more than 100 mountaineers from the US, Canada, the UK, Russia, China, Germany, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Andorra, Poland, South Africa, Japan, Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Nepal and Malaysia started reaching the top of K2 from the early hours of Friday morning till afternoon.

Samina Baig creates history, again; 29-year-old makes it to summit without supplemental oxygen; women from Iran, Saudi Arabia and Oman break glass ceiling 

The astonishing feat by several expedition teams was made possible as the forecast of stable weather at Karakoram Range Mountains encouraged five people from Nepal to fix ropes to the top of the peak, opening the route for other climbers on late Thursday evening.
Besides the two Pakistani women, Sirbaz Khan, Fida Ali, Eid Mohammad, Sohail Sakhi, Bulbul Karim, Ahmed Baig, Rizwan Dad, Waqar Ali, Shah Doulat, Shah Shimshali, Wajidullah Nagri, Akber Hussain Sadpara, Abid Hussain Sadpara, Zakir Sadpara, Ashraf Sadpara and Mr Inayat from different parts of Pakistan with various expedition teams summited the peak on Friday.
“We are extremely proud to announce that Samina Baig with her strong Pakistani team, successfully summit the world’s most fascinating and dangerous mountain known as Savage Mountain, the world’s second and Pakistan’s tallest mountain, this morning at 7:42am,” said Karakoram expedition through a press release. 
Samina Baig who comes from the remote village Shimshal not only has the honour of being the first Pakistani woman to summit K2 and Mt Everest, but also holds the unique record of being the first Pakistani amongst men and women to climb seven summits in seven continents. 
From Iran, Afsaneh Hesamifard is the first woman to summit K2. She has already summited Mt Everest and Manaslu. Similarly, Lebanese-Saudi fitness expert Nelly Attar set a new record by becoming the first-ever Arab woman to summit the world’s second highest peak. Also, Nadhira Alharthy is the first woman from Oman to have graced her country with the honour. 
As part of her campaign to beat the time record of ascending all the 14 eight-thuosanders across the world within six months, a 36-year-old woman from Norway, Kristin Harila, also summited K2. For this purpose, she had started her attempt to climb five 8,000-metre high peaks in Pakistan, including K2 and Nanga Parbat, in two months.  
Tseng Ko-Erh, aka Gr Stefi Trouget, a woman from Andorra, who summited K-2 without any supplemental oxygen, dedicated her summit to late Sergi Mingote, Ali Sadpara, Antonio Atanas — all fallen heroes of K2 Winter 2021 expedition. 
Also, Ms Jing from China, who earlier climbed Mt. Everest and Lhotse in spring season without supplemental oxygen, summited K2 without additional oxygen. 
French trekker rescued
Meanwhile, female French trekker, Nadia Sarah Baloul, who had been stranded at Concordia near K2 base camp since Wednesday, due to high altitude sickness was airlifted to Skardu by Pakistan Army helicopters on Friday. 
The foreign trakker was awaiting rescue at Concordia near K2 base camp after she came down with high-altitude sickness. She is under treatment in Combined Military Hospital, Skardu, where her health condition is improving, said Apricot Tours managing director Wajahat Khan while speaking to Dawn. 
He said the French trekker was part of a 13-member team of foreign trekkers who had started their base camp trek from Skardu about 10 days ago. He said Ms Sarah complained about breathing problems and nausea when she reached Concordia. 
First summer push 
This was the first K2 summer push of the season, as climbers are expected to summit the peak till July 25 before the next weather window on July 28 allows them to make an attempt, Mohammad Ali Nagri from Adventure Pakistan told Dawn.
He said over 100 climbers started their final summit push after the Nepalese team opened the route from camp to the top on Thursday night. The climbers started reaching the top of K2 at 2am on Friday and continued to do so till afternoon. 
Karar Haidri from Alpine Club of Pakistan said K2 summiters descended to camp 4 or camp 3 after the summit. According to him, the fresh teams of climbers would start to move towards the summit on Saturday (today).
