0,Arshad Nadeem soars into javelin final at World Athletics Cham­pionships,He was ninth overall among 27 competitors.,"EUGENE: Less than a year after making history for Pakistan at the Olympics, Arshad Nadeem was at it again on Thursday. 
With a huge roar at the Hayward Field, the 25-year-old let his javelin fly and as it soared past the 80-metre mark Arshad raised his arms and puffed his cheeks knowing he’d done just enough. 
With his season-best throw of 81.71m in Eugene, Arshad became the first athlete from the country to reach a final at the World Athletics Cham­pionships. 
“Thanks to your [nation’s] prayers, have qualified for the final,” Arshad said on his Instagram, sharing the video of the throw that took him through to Saturday’s final. “Need more prayers.” 
Thursday’s feat comes after Arshad became the first athlete from his country to reach the final of any track and field events in the history of Olympics when he advanced to the medal decider at the Tokyo Games in August last year where he finished fifth with a throw of 84.62m. 
With the automatic qualification mark set at 83.50m, Arshad — nursing an elbow injury — made a slow start. His first throw only reached 76.15m with the second falling even shorter at 74.38m. 
However, his third throw was enough to see him finish among the 12 top qualifiers for the final. He was ninth overall among 27 competitors, who were split into two qualifying groups. 
Joining him in the final are a host of heavyweights including Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra of India, Czech Jakub Vadlejch, Grenada’s world leader Anderson Peters and Germany’s Julian Weber but former Olympic champion Keshorn Walcott of Trinidad and Tobago failed to advance. 
Chopra, who became the first Olympic track and field gold medallist from India when he won at last year’s Tokyo Games and earn superstardom, bettered his own Olympic gold-winning effort to advance. 
Chopra went straight through in Eugene with an opening effort of 88.39m, exceeding the 87.58m he produced in Tokyo, and will be joined by compatriot Rohit Yadav (80.42) in the final. 
Reigning world champion Anderson Peters had the best throw of the day with 89.91m. Vadlejch (85.23m) and Weber (87.28m) were the only others to throw beyond the automatic qualification mark. 
Egypt’s Ihab Abdelrahman narrowly missed the qualification mark as his best throw was 83.41m, but made the cut for the final. 
There will also be two Finns in the final after Oliver Helander and Lassi Etelätalo cleared the qualification. Helander’s throw of 82.41m saw him finish in sixth place while Etelätalo (80.03m) took the final qualification spot behind Yadav. 
The final will feature four Asians with Japan’s Roderick Genki Dean (82.34) qualifying in seventh place, ahead of American Cutris Thompson (81.73) and Arshad. 
Walcott, who won in London and picked up bronze in Rio, could only reach 78.87 metres, finishing eighth in his group while Germany’s Andreas Hofman, an 87.32m thrower this year, recorded three fouls and was eliminated.

1,Khawaja wants BBL to privatise for survival,MELBOURNE: Australia batsman Usman Khawaja says the nation’s Big Bash League (BBL) needs to open up to private...,"MELBOURNE: Australia batsman Usman Khawaja says the nation’s Big Bash League (BBL) needs to open up to private ownership if it is to survive in an increasingly crowded market for T20 cricket content.
The BBL, which runs from December to early-February 2023, will clash with South Africa’s new six-team T20 tournament starting in January.
Indian Premier League (IPL) team owners bought all six franchises in the South African league but the BBL’s eight teams are owned by governing body Cricket Australia and run by state associations.
A new league in the United Arab Emirates, also backed by IPL money, is scheduled to start in January, setting the stage for intense battles for the world’s top players.
Khawaja said the BBL faced a  “fork in the road” over the next year or two as competition heats up.
“There’s a lot of cogs that make the decisions but personally you shouldn’t be afraid of moving the game forward even if that means that you let go a little bit on the reins,” Khawaja told reporters on Friday.
“There are other tournaments starting up that are privatised.
“If you don’t keep up with that, and there’s a small window for the Big Bash to privatise in the next few years, and I’m afraid if we don’t do that we’ll fall behind.”
A number of top players have nominated for the BBL’s inaugural draft, including star Afghan spinner Rashid Khan and West Indian T20 stalwarts Kieron Pollard and Dwayne Bravo.
But Khawaja said others were steering clear.
“I’ve talked to a couple and they’ve not listed for the draft because they want to spend Christmas at home and then will go and play in the UAE,” he said. 
“That’s a red flag for me already.”

2,Uncertainty gives way to hope as Mahoor gears up for CWG,She is the first badminton player from Pakistan to reach the Olympics.,"KARACHI: Mahoor Shahzad had made history for Pakistan but was soon flooded with thoughts over why she’d gone through the rigours to achieve that. 
Having become the first badminton player from the country to reach the Olympics, she was put through the wringer — first being accused of favouritism upon getting the tripartite invitation, then seeing her every move at last year’s Tokyo Games coming under intense scrutiny before being harshly, unduly criticised for failing to win either of her pool matches. 
The joy of making it to the Olympics quickly dissipated. Mahoor was contemplating whether the journey was worth it. 
“It was tough for me … really tough,” Mahoor told Dawn during a telephone interview on Thursday night ahead of her participation at the Commonwealth Games, which begin later this month in Birmingham. “I was left questioning myself. You end up losing your motivation.” 
Rather than succumb to the noises, Mahoor became resilient. That trait has helped her in a country where athletes are used to expecting the unexpected. 
Just this month, having completed a 12-day training camp for the Commonwealth Games, Mahoor received news that the Pakistan Sports Board had slashed the originally proposed contingent with the country’s sports regulators body saying it will only bear the expenses of those athletes which had medal-winning chances. 
It meant the four-member badminton team was on its way out only for the Pakistan Olympic Association to intervene and pick up the cost of those athletes who were cut. 
“First there were trials in Lahore to select the team and then the camp and just like that we were slashed from the plans,” Mahoor said. “For a week we were faced with uncertainty before thankfully the POA decided it will support us. It was a big relief for us.” 
The POA reasoned that athletes benefit from international events and Mahoor fully agrees with that notion. 
“It’s a learning curve for us,” Mahoor said, referring to her singles match against then-Indian number one Saina Nehwal at the last edition of the Commonwealth Games in Australia during Pakistan’s clash with their arch-rivals in the mixed team event. 
“India blanked us [5-0] in that encounter but the opportunity to play against the very top players gives you more exposure and you learn a lot of new things and try to improve.” 
At last year’s Tokyo Olympics, Mahoor was up against current world number one Akane Yamaguchi of Japan and Great Britain’s Kristy Gilmour. 
“I don’t think I’d have a chance to face Yamaguchi if I wasn’t at the Olympics,” the 25-year-old said. “It’s that big-game experience that helps you and motivates you to do better.” 
Getting better, however, is tough for athletes in Pakistan. “We train by ourselves, we have to find courts [to play] on our own,” she said. 
Ranked 175th in the world, Mahoor however isn’t giving up. 
“The aim is to break in the top 100 in the world … that’s what I’m focusing on,” she disclosed. “I just have to keep playing in international tournaments and try to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics.” 
Ensuring regular participation in international ranking tournaments is the hard part. The Pakistan Badminton Federation, like other sports federations in Pakistan apart from cricket, isn’t cash-rich and struggles to find sponsors. 
Thankfully for Mahoor, she’s one of 12 athletes from Pakistan who receive a monthly stipend of US$650 from the International Olympic Committee’s Olympic Solidarity programme for the Paris Games. 
“It helps me fund my trips to the tournaments,” informed Mahoor. “I’m also on Badminton Asia Olympic Project which also helps.” 
For the last several years, Mahoor has been the most dominant player in the country and has been winning tournaments despite nursing a hamstring injury she suffered at the end of last year. 
However, mindful of the challenge she will face, she’s keeping her goals low for the Commonwealth Games. 
“The draws for the Commonwealths are still to be announced but I’m aiming to at least get to the quarter-finals of the singles event,” Mahoor said, “and then we’ll see from there how far I can go.”

Khalid Sajjad Khokhar has been named as one of the four members of a committee formed to run the federation’s affairs for the next 30 days.
The committee, formed by the Pakistan Sports Board, has been given the primary mandate to conduct the PHF’s elections which were due by May 14.
Earlier, the PSB had de-notified Khokhar and PHF secretary Asif Bajwa for their failure to meet the deadline which was given following a delay in the federation’s polls. Despite PSB’s action against the officials, no step has yet been taken towards the election process. 
After receiving the de-notification letter, Khokhar had expressed his rejection toward’s PSB’s move and also met the Inter-provincial Coordi­nation minister Ehsan-ur-Rehman Mazari to apprise him about his stance. The incumbent PHF president was confident that the matters had been solved amicably before the PSB announced the formation of the committee.
According to sources, the top officials of the PHF believe PSB’s letters are interference in the affairs of the federation. However, none of them was ready to comment on the PSB’s latest move.
While Khokhar has been included in the four-member committee as a former PHF president, Nasir Ali — who also held the post once — along with ex Pakistan international Rehan Butt and senior coach Arshad Mehmood were named as the committee’s members.

The decision was announced after the BCB chiefs held a meeting with Mahmudullah at its headquarters in Dhaka.
Mahmudullah had been under fire for failing to inspire the team, which lost 11 of their last 13 T20 Internationals.
“We have been discussing his captaincy for the last few days,” BCB cricket operations chief Jalal Yunus told reporters.  “After discussing with him, we have decided about sending a new team to Zimbabwe.
“We have informed him that we have selected Nurul Hasan to lead this team,” he added. Mahmudullah led Bangla­desh to 16 wins and 26 defeats in T20Is since assuming the role in 2018.
New captain Nurul Hasan has played 33 T20Is for Bangladesh, scoring 271 runs at an average of 12.90.
He will lead Bangladesh in three T20Is against Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club on July 30, July 31 and Aug 2.

5,Laporte breaks French jinx with stage 19 victory,"Belgian Jasper Philipsen took second place and Italy’s Alberto Dainese finished third, both one second behind Laporte.","CAHORS: Frenchman Christophe Laporte ended a lengthy home drought at the Tour de France, claiming the 19th stage with a perfectly timed effort on Friday to give the local fans something to celebrate for the first time in more than a year.
Laporte, a domestique within the mighty Jumbo-Visma team of yellow jersey holder Jonas Vingegaard and points classification leader Wout van Aert, bridged a small gap with a leading trio in a nail-biting finale before moving clear 300 metres from the line.
Belgian Jasper Philipsen took second place and Italy’s Alberto Dainese finished third, both one second behind Laporte.
Dane Vingegaard was on the wrong side of a late split but the race jury gave the chasing bunch the same time as Philipsen and Dainese, although they crossed the line five seconds off the pace.
Vingegaard still holds a comfortable lead of 3:26 going into Saturday’s final time trial, a 40.7-km effort between Lacapelle-Marival and Rocamadour.
Laporte, a decent sprinter who had not had an opportunity for a stage victory this year, was given the green light by his sporting directors to go for it on Friday and he duly delivered, after French riders had gone 38 stages without a Tour win.
They had not won a stage since world champion Julian Alaphilippe, who is not in this year’s race as he recovers from injury, prevailed on the opening day last year.
After Quinn Simmons, the last survivor of the first breakaway group, was reined in by the peloton with 34 kilometres to go, France’s Alexis Gougeard jumped away from the pack.
Pogacar, in yet another attempt to catch Vingegaard off guard, attacked in the descent from the Cote de Daunes but he was brought back by Van Aert.
Gougeard was joined by Fred Wright and Jasper Stuyven and the trio opened a 30-second gap but the sprinters’ teams had slashed it down to a handful of seconds with two kilometres to go.
Van Aert sacrificed his own chances to further reduce the deficit, allowing Laporte to make the jump to catch Wright and Stuyven.
He stayed on Stuyven’s wheel for a short while before launching his sprint at the right moment, holding his head in disbelief as he crossed the line.

Close on the heels of Fred Kerley leading a 1-2-3 for Team USA in the men’s 100m, Lyles made no mistake over the longer sprint, racing home in 19.31 seconds to become the third-fastest athlete of all time over the distance and break four-time Olympic champion Michael Johnson’s national record. 
It was the fourth fastest 200m ever run: only Jamaicans Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake have run faster. 
Lyles’s team-mates Kenny Bednarek and teenager Erriyon Knighton took silver and bronze in 19.77 and 19.80sec respectively, to repeated chants of “U-S-A” from home fans at Hayward Field. 
It is the first time a country has swept both men’s sprint events in the same year at the World Championships. 
“It’s like being a rock star!” Lyles said of performing in front of a packed crowd in Eugene, as opposed to the empty stands in the Tokyo Olympics where he finished third and admitted to having mental health issues. 
“Today is my day - I finally got to do what I dreamed of. I felt I got the best start I could possibly ask for. It’s an immaculate feeling to be on the podium with two fellow Americans. 
“I was true in form for a world record, but I am okay with the American record. To be honest, every step was purposeful, going out with intent to win.” 
Lyles’ victory came moments after Jackson gave the Jamaican women another sprint gold on a balmy, clear night with perfect conditions for sprinting. 
Jackson set a championship record of 21.45sec, the second fastest time ever run over the distance, for the first individual world title of her career. 
Only the late Florence Griffith-Joyner, whose 1988 world record of 21.34sec still stands, has run faster. 
“I am feeling great once I came out and put on the show,” said 28-year-old Jackson. “The fastest woman alive, the national and championships record, I cannot complain!” 
Newly crowned 100m gold medallist Fraser-Pryce missed out on a second sprint double after finishing second in 21.81, claiming her 13th world medal overall. 
But there was no Jamaican cleansweep, as there had been in the blue riband event, as defending champion Dina Asher-Smith of Britain claimed bronze in 22.02sec. 
Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah, the third part of Jamaica’s 100m sweep, eventually came in seventh in 22.39sec. 
Fraser-Pryce hinted that any retirement plans, initially mulled over in 2020/21, were definitely on hold. 
“I really think I owe it to myself to see how far I can go as a sprinter and just continue to transcend what I thought was possible,” she said. “For women, especially after having a baby and after turning 30, you hear ... it’s time to pack it up. 
“But you know I’m 35, going on 36, and to be here still competing at that level it’s just a blessing. I’m really looking forward to 2023 and the worlds in Budapest. And then after that we take it to 2024 for Paris!” 
Another podium sweep could be on the cards for the United States after Olympic champion Athing Mu along with Raevyn Rogers and Ajee Wilson advanced to the women’s 800m semi-finals. 
The line up for Saturday’s men’s 800m final was decided after three tight semi-finals. 
The Kenyan trio of Olympic champion Emmanuel Korir, Wyclife Kinyamal Kisasy and Emmanuel Wanyonyi will take on the dangerous Algerian pair of Slimane Moula and Djamel Sedjati, with Canada’s Marco Arop, France’s Gabriel Tual and Australian Peter Bol completing the eight-man field. 
Portugal’s Pedro Pichardo had no problems in the men’s triple jump. But there was no place for four-time champion Christian Taylor of the US, who won the triple jump in Rio in 2016 but had to sit out Tokyo with injury. 
Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen, after the shock disappointment of losing the 1500m to Briton Jake Wightman, gave himself the chance of a second medal by advancing to Sunday’s 5000m final. 
Also progressing were Olympic champion Joshua Cheptegei of Uganda, and reigning world gold medallist Muktar Edris and Ethi­opian teammate Selemon Barega.

7,"Djokovic joins Nadal, Federer, Murray at Laver Cup",The three-day team event pits six of Europe’s top players against six from the rest of the world.,"LONDON: Tennis fans are used to seeing Rafa Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray fight tooth and nail to beat each other at the Grand Slams but the ‘Big Four’ are set to play together in the same team for the first time at the Laver Cup in London.
Wimbledon champion Djo­k­ovic on Friday was named as the fourth member of the six-man Team Europe, the 35-year-old Serb joining his long-time rivals at the fifth edition of the ATP-sanctioned event from Sept 23-25.
Named after Australian great Rod Laver, the three-day team event pits six of Europe’s top players against six from the rest of the world.
“It’s the only competition where you can play in a team environment with guys that you’re normally competing against and to be joining Rafa, Roger and Andy three of my biggest all-time rivals it’s going to be a truly unique mo­m­ent in the history of our sport,” Djokovic said.
Nadal, Djokovic, Federer and Murray have dominated men’s tennis over the last two decades, winning 66 Grand Slam titles between them.
Nadal holds a men’s record 22 Grand Slam titles with Djokovic, who played in the second edition of the Laver Cup in 2018, one behind.
London’s O2 Arena, which hosted the men’s season-ending ATP Finals from 2009 to 2020, will stage the Cup with Team Europe, captained by Bjorn Borg, having won all the previous editions. Team World captain John McEnroe has named Felix Auger-Alias­sime, Taylor Fritz and Diego Schwartzman as three members of his team.

8,Mane named African Footballer of the Year again,RABAT: Sadio Mane was named African Footballer of Year on Thursday after a season in which he kicked the winning...,"RABAT: Sadio Mane was named African Footballer of Year on Thursday after a season in which he kicked the winning penalty for Senegal as they claimed their first Africa Cup of Nations title and repeated the feat when they secured World Cup qualification. 
The forward first won the honour in 2019 while he was at Liverpool. The 30-year-old left the Premier League club last month after signing a three-year deal with Bayern Munich. 
“I am really honoured and highly delighted to receive this award again,” Mane said. “Thanks to my coaches, my club and national team colleagues and those friends who stood by me during difficult times.” 
Mane was in the Moroccan capital to receive the award after a dash across the Atlantic having converted a penalty for his new club in a 6-2 pre-season friendly win over DC United in Washington on Wednesday. 
It was the second successive continental player of the year award for Mane after the Confederation of African Football did not hold it over of the last two years due to the coronavirus pandemic and has now changed to recognising accomplishments over the season rather than the calendar year. 
He won ahead of former Liverpool team-mate Mohamed Salah from Egypt and fellow Senegal international and Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. 
Mane and Salah played pivotal roles last season with Liverpool, who lifted the FA Cup and English League Cup and finished runners-up in the Premier League and Champions League. 
Salah has since signed a new contract at Anfield while Mane opted for a move, with Bayern reportedly paying an initial 32 million euros ($32.5 million) that could rise to 41 million euros. 
The transfer fee was a far cry from the four million euros Red Bull Salzburg paid Metz in 2012 when Mane made his first move in Europe. 
Mane converted the winning penalty in February as Senegal beat Egypt in the Cup of Nations final in Yaounde, proving the talisman as his country took a first ever African title. 
Six weeks later, he struck the decisive spot-kick as Senegal again edged Egypt in a penalty shootout to win a place at the World Cup finals in Qatar. 
Salah did not get a chance to take a penalty in the Cup of Nations decider while he blazed the first Egyptian kick wide in the play-off that secured a World Cup place in Qatar this November for Senegal. 
Mane also finished ahead of Salah in the 2019 voting. Salah, 30, won the award in 2017 and 2018 with Mane second on both occasions. 
“I dedicate this award to the youth of Senegal. I’m very emotional and don’t have the words to express how I’m feeling,” Mane told the audience. 
Mendy, who plays for Chelsea, was named the best goalkeeper in the world at FIFAs 2021 award, held in January. 
Nigerian Asisat Oshoala won the Women’s Player of the Year a record fifth time, overtaking compatriot Perpetua Nkwocha. 
The 27-year-old Barcelona forward was forced to miss the ongoing Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco due to an injury.

Indian Olympic Associa­tion elections were due last December but have been held up by a court case seeking to change its constitution in line with rules stipulated by the national sports code.
In a letter sent to the IOA’s executive council, the IOC and Olympic Council of Asia said they were following developments  “with great concern”.
The letter urged the IOA to resolve the situation and confirm the election date  “without any further delay”.
The letter added that if the IOA failed to organise the elections in the coming weeks the IOC would have other option but to consider protective measures,  “including a suspension”.
A suspension would cut off IOC funding, block Indian officials from attending Olympic meetings and leave the country’s athletes unable to compete under the India flag at the Olympics.
The IOA was previously banned at the end of 2012 after elections saw a corruption-tainted official voted in as secretary general.
The South Asian nation returned to the Olympic fold two years later during the 2014 Sochi Winter Games after voting in a new set of officials.

The Ferrari pair swapped fastest laps in a closely-contested session in bright sunshine, Sainz making light of the prospect of a 10-place grid penalty for Sunday’s race after taking new power-train components.
The Spaniard, who scored his maiden victory at the British Grand Prix earlier this month, clocked a best lap in one minute and 32.527 seconds to beat his Monegasque team-mate by 0.101seconds.
Verstappen was a competitive third ahead of George Russell and Lewis Hamilton in the two freshly-updated Mercedes and Lando Norris who was sixth for McLaren.
Kevin Magnussen was seventh for Haas ahead of Pierre Gasly of AlphaTauri, Daniel Ricciardo in the second McLaren and Sergio Perez, in the second Red Bull.
The session was uninterrupted and largely uneventful as the teams adapted to the heat - the track temperature was 50 degrees and the air 34 degrees - in front of a big holiday crowd.
The circuit is sold out for both Saturday and Sunday, according to the organisers at the Paul Ricard circuit, where the two Alpine drivers set the initial early pace with Fernando Alonso topping Esteban Ocon before Magnussen and then Russell took over until Leclerc arrived.
The reinvigorated Leclerc, who won the last race in Austria, had been quickest in the first session and was swift to pick up where he left off in the earlier action.
As expected, it was a tight contest and four minutes later Verstappen edged ahead by 0.010 seconds only for Sainz, facing a grid penalty on Sunday, to sweep clear at the top by 0.850 in 1:33.322.
The heat appeared to have a soporific effect on everyone for a short period before Leclerc returned to beat his Ferrari team-mate’s time by 0.186 only for the Spaniard to respond and jump six-tenths clear.
It was clear that Ferrari had found a sweet spot in their car set-up, but Verstappen was close to matching them on soft tyres, the Dutchman moving up to second briefly before Leclerc replaced him.

Sixth Street have now purchased 25% of Barcelona’s income from La Liga TV rights, having bought 10% for 207.5 million euros on June 30.
Barcelona signed Brazil winger Raphinha from Leeds United and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich following the first investment from Sixth Street.
“We continue to move forward on our strategy and are pleased to have completed this additional agreement with Sixth Street providing us with a meaningful increase in capital strength,” said Barcelona president Joan Laporta.
Laporta, who presided over one of Barca’s most successful periods between 2003 and 2010, said in August 2021 that the club’s debts totalled 1.35 billion euros, 673 million of which was owed to banks.
Last month, Barcelona approved the sale of a minority share of their licensing and merchandising division and the cession of up to 25% of their income from their La Liga TV rights.

Hough, who is the Adelaide Oval’s chief curator, also interacted with the stadium’s curator and ground staff. Karachi was the third venue Hough visited after Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium and Rawalpindi’s Pindi Cricket Stadium.  
During his stay in Karachi, Hough will also assess the pitches of the two grounds of the Hanif Mohammad High Performance Centre — the training facility within the premises of the National Stadium.
“Like Lahore and Rawalpindi, Hough will also deliver lectures on pitch and outfield preparation for all formats of the game,” said a Pakistan Cricket Board press release. 
“In addition to the NSK and the high performance centre ground staff and curator, the lectures will be attended by Sindh Cricket Association coaches as part of Pakistan Cricket Board’s plan of improving the knowledge and skillset of its coaches at different tiers across the country.”
Hough meanwhile expressed his excitement about interacting with the venue’s groundsmen, adding the tour was about “collaboration, learning and sharing of ideas”. 
“A good wicket is one that provides opportunities to both batters and bowlers,” he said. “Back home we have an indicator of sorts of 300 runs and 10 wickets in a day for a long format pitch.”
Australian soil is set to reach Karachi next week as part of the PCB’s experiment of using it to create playing surfaces in Pakistan. The soil will be used in the construction of a pitch each at the National Stadium and the Naya Nazimabad Cricket Ground in Karachi and the Gaddafi Stadium and National High Performance Centre in Lahore. 
“I believe it is an exciting initiative and an experiment that is worth having a close look at,” said Hough. 
“The pitches prepared with the Australian soil will provide a great opportunity to Pakistan players before a tour of Australia in terms of their preparations for the pitches there.”
