0,US to help Pakistan set up Centre for Disease Control,"Pakistan, US to discuss the matter in their first-ever health dialogue in Washington today.","WASHINGTON: The United States and Pakistan will discuss setting up a Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in Pakistan when they hold their first-ever health dialogue in Washington on Monday. 
A four-member Pakistani delegation, led by federal Minister for Health Abdul Qadir Patel, reached Washington on Saturday for the talks. Earlier this week, Pakistan also sought US support for its efforts to stabilise the economy. 
Last week, Director of the Pakistan Desk at the US State Department Neil W. Hop said at a gathering of Pakistani physicians that the July 25 dialogue would be the largest-ever health talks between the two countries.
Although the Pakistani delegation has only four members, a large number of Pakistani health officials and experts will participate in the talks virtually. Ambassador Masood Khan and other officials of the Pakistan Embassy will also join the delegation.
Experts from the US Center of Disease Control (CDC) will also participate in these talks at the State Department. Other participants would include officials from the State and Health departments.
The US CDC is a federal agency, under the Department of Health and Human Services, which played a key role in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic and in making antiviral vaccines to bring it under control.
The agency’s main goal is the protection of public health and safety through the control and prevention of disease, injury, and disability in the US and worldwide. The CDC focuses on curbing infectious disease, environmental health, occupational safety, and educational activities designed to improve the health of US citizens. The CDC also conducts research and provides information on non-infectious diseases, such as obesity and diabetes.
Both sides have prepared a comprehensive agenda for the July 25 talks, aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation in the health sector.
The dialogue will have seven sessions on: establishing a CDC in Pakistan, global health security, childhood immunisations, Covid-19 engagement, regulatory engagements, maternal and child health, and non-communicable diseases.  “The health dialogue is an example of the close ties between the United States and Pakistan and a befitting way to celebrate the important milestone of the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic relations,” said a statement issued by the Pakistan Embassy. “Solid progress is expected.”
On Thursday, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi met US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman in Washington and told her that Pakistan views the United States as an “important partner in its efforts to revive” the country’s ailing economy.  Later State Department spokesperson Ned Price told journalists that Deputy Secretary Sherman “reaffirmed our shared goals for enhancing the US-Pakistan relationship by advancing our economic and commercial ties and health cooperation”.  A Pakistan Embassy press release said Mr Fatemi told the US official that “Pakistan seeks close and cordial relations with the US on the basis of equality, mutual cooperation and mutual benefit”.
Mr Fatemi also said that Islamabad viewed Washington as “an important partner in its efforts to revive Pakistan’s economy.”

2,Import of inexpensive cancer medicines from Russia resumes,Importers confident that Russian products will be available in market by first week of August.,"KARACHI: The import of inexpensive medicines for cancer treatment from Russia, which came to a halt in February after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, resumed after more than five months as the banks have started opening Letters of Credit (LCs) for the trade.
With the new development, importers sound confident that Russian products would be available in the local market by the first week of August 2022, bringing an end to the misery of hundreds of cancer patients and their families.
“We have formally received a nod from banks [for opening the LCs] recently and that formality has already been met by several importers,” said an importer.
“I think another week or so would take to fix different other formalities and restoration of shipments from Russia. By the end of the first week of August, I hope, the medicines will be available in the market. After the rupee depreciation over the past few months, the prices would not be the same but it would be still much less than the expensive, next-generation medicines being marketed by multinational pharmaceutical companies.”
It was in March 2022 when the Russia-Ukraine war put Pakistan’s healthcare system under a test of another kind, as the import of inexpensive medicines for cancer treatment from Russia came to a halt since the conflict began in February 2022 after banks stopped opening LCs for traders. This situation heaped misery on thousands of patients and their families, mostly belonging to the middle and lower-middle classes.
“The packages include monoclonal antibodies (MABs), a targeted drug therapy to treat different cancers,” said a local medicines supplier. “The MABs like Trastuzumab, Rituximab and Bevacizumab — all from Russia — are sold at half the price set by Drap [Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan] under its MRP [maximum retail price] mechanism. Unavailability of Russian or inexpensive medicines forced patients to either buy expensive chemotherapy drugs offered by multinational companies or switch to smuggled or unregistered medicines. But better late than never, it’s good that the imports are resuming.”
The situation during the last few months raised concerns and created a kind of uncertainty about the supplies of key medicines among the patients. For long-term and durable solutions, healthcare professionals seek permanent and long-term arrangements from the government.
“Due to the high cost of next-generation cancer medicines and equipment produced by American and European pharmaceutical companies, Pakistani authorities should collaborate with countries like Russia, Belarus, Cuba and Iran. These countries are fairly advanced in the field of biotechnology and produce inexpensive medicines and therapies,” said a senior Karachi oncologist.

4,SCBA asks SC to take up its review plea on defectors’ votes,Ex-SC judge Maqbool Baqar says hearing on Punjab Assembly deputy speaker's ruling by full court will enhance judiciary’s image.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has urged the apex court to take up urgently its petition seeking review of the court’s opinion on the interpretation of Article 63A of the Constitution, given through a short order on May 17.
In a statement issued on Sunday, SCBA president Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon said hearing of the review petition had now become important in view of the raging debate over the interpretation of Article 63A(1b) — a matter related strictly to an understanding of the Constitution.
Ahsan Bhoon advised all political parties to refrain from making orders of the apex court and its judges controversial and let the court interpret constitutional matters.
By a majority of three to two, the SC held on May 17 in a presidential reference that since Article 63A ensures fundamental rights of a parliamentary party rather than its members, a vote cast contrary to the party line should not be counted.

Ex-SC judge Maqbool Baqar says a hearing by full court would enhance judiciary’s image

The short order had further held that political parties were an integral part of the bedrock on which democracy rests and attempts to weaken them would put democracy itself in peril.
The SCBA then moved a review petition on June 23 with a plea that the apex court’s opinion was not in accord with the norms of parliamentary democracy and that the interpretation of Article 63A adopted by the Supreme Court amounted to reincarnating the proviso to Article 96(5). The clause had been made subject to a sunset clause by the framers and had never been reintroduced by parliament, Ahsan Bhoon observed.
Defectors’ votes
The review petition emphasised that the framers of the Constitution had intended to disregard votes by defectors as a stop-gap arrangement to ensure stability during the first decade after promulgation of the statute,  Mr. Bhoon argued. 
Had it been the architects’ intent or subsequently, of parliament, to make a provision for disregarding defectors’ votes, a clause similar to the proviso of erstwhile Article 96(5) could have been inserted.
Had the review petition been taken up by the court before the recent vote for election of the Punjab chief minister,   Ahsan Bhoon said, no controversy over the interpretation of Article 63A(1)(b) would have arisen.
Referring to the apex court’s short order of May 17, he said it was a split decision and proved that certain questions needed to be addressed.
Mr Bhoon said a full court should hear the matter to ensure a “conclusive interpretation” and to restore the nation’s confidence in political parties.
He said the SCBA believed the interpretation of Article 63A, pertaining to treatment of dissidents, was against the norms of natural justice. “Hence it requires a thorough debate.”
Hamza’s statement
Reliable sources told Dawn that Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz is likely to file a concise statement before the Supreme Court on Monday when it resumes hearing on the petition filed by Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi against the deputy speaker’s ruling.
Mansoor Usman Awan, Mr Shehbaz’s counsel, is expected to request the three-member bench to constitute a full court to hear the matter.
Retired judge’s plea
Justice Maqbool Baqar, a reti­red judge of the Supreme Court, has added his weight to pleas for the constitution of a full court, consisting of all available judges, to hear the petition against the deputy speaker’s ruling. 
Justice Baqar, who had expressed his reservations in his farewell speech about the composition of benches in the Supreme Court, said a hearing by the full court would enhance the judiciary’s image.
The judge said all important cases should be heard by benches consisting of the most senior judges and that there was no harm if a full court was formed. 
Hafizur Rehman Chaudhry, the Pakistan Bar Council’s vice chairman, also requested the apex court to conduct an urgent hearing of the SCBA’s review petition on Article 63A.

7,Pakistan not as vulnerable as people think: SBP head,Country’s debt levels not too high; only 20pc borrowings on commercial terms; says Islamabad can afford to slow economy si...,"KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Acting Governor Dr Murtaza Syed has dispelled the perception that the country is headed towards an economic catastrophe, saying “Pakistan is not vulnerable as was being assumed” despite burgeoning global inflation.
As the world was still overcoming the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the next 12 months will be challenging for the global economy, Dr Syed said, adding that Pakistan’s economy was recovering well, achieving 6pc growth last year and hopefully this year as well.
“We can afford to slow down our economy a little bit, so we have started working on adjusting our policies according to this strategy,” he said.
Dr Syed made this observation during a podcast conducted by the SBP on Saturday discussing the overall economic situation. SBP’s deputy governors Dr Inayat Hussain and Sima Kamil were also among the participants.
This was the second time within a span of 24 hours that the SBP acting governor addressed the 
economic situation.

Country’s debt levels not too high; only 20pc borrowings on commercial terms; says Islamabad can afford to slow economy since growth rate doing well

Fears have risen about Pakistan’s stuttering economy as the rupee fell nearly eight per cent against the dollar in the last trading week, while forex reserves stood below $10bn with inflation at the highest in more than a decade.
On Saturday, Dr Syed told Reuters that Pakistan’s $33.5bn external financing needs were fully met for the ongoing fiscal year and that “unwarranted” market concerns about its financial position will dissipate in weeks.
In the podcast, the SBP governor underlined that Pakistan was not vulnerable “because it has the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cover” and “its citizens do not need to panic”.
Highlighting the factors behind his optimism, he said Pakistan had a reasonable debt level of 70pc of its GDP. Therefore, it’s unfair to categorise the country with Ghana (with 80pc ratio), Egypt (90pc), Zambia (100pc) and Sri Lanka (120pc).
Moreover, Pakistan’s external debt is 40pc of GDP compared to Tunisia’s 90pc, Angola’s 120pc and Zambia’s over 150pc.
Dr Syed said Pakistan was relying more on its domestic debts, “which are payable in our own currency and are easier to manage compared to external loans, which are payable in foreign currencies”.
He noted that only 7pc of Pakistan’s external debts are for the short term, whereas other countries had taken much higher short-term external loans; for instance, the figure is 30pc in the case of Turkiye.
Besides, Pakistan has taken only 20pc of its borrowings on commercial terms, while the rest are concessional loans mostly taken from the IMF, World Bank or friendly countries and thus easier to return. “So, it is easier for us to return these loans and all the debt indicators of Pakistan are much better than the countries who have done more commercial borrowings,” he said.
Countries having no IMF cover will suffer badly over the next 12 months due to rising global inflation, he said and insisted that Pakistan’s IMF programme was on track.
In response to a question, he said the acting governor has all authorities as that of a governor, except “signing currency notes”.
‘Sufficient reserves’ 
Talking about the country’s foreign exchange reserves, SBP Deputy Governor Dr Inayat Hussain said the country’s reserves at around $9.3bn were sufficient enough to carry it through the next few months. 
While he conceded that the level was not ideal and “we would like to increase it to equalise three months of Pakistan’s import bill”, the reserves are not too low and should not be a cause of concern for the nation. 
He also informed the host that the country had gold reserves worth $3.8bn, which were in addition to the overall forex reserves and not pledged.
On the rupee’s slide, Dr Inayat said the local currency had depreciated sharply, around 18pc, since December. However, 12pc of this depreciation was caused as the US Fed Reserve increased its interest rates aggressively while domestic factors include Pakistan’s rising imports and low supply of dollars.
Mera Ghar scheme 
Discussing the ‘Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar’, Ms Kamil said the affordable financing scheme was designed to facilitate the lower-income segment in buying their own house.
However, it had been temporarily halted, as the economic pressures were mounting and the present government needed to make some alterations in the financial model of this large-scale initiative, she said.
She said the finance minister has now decided that the beneficiaries who have completed all the formalities would be granted these house loans soon.

8,Literary notes: Balochi lexicography and new dictionary in four languages,"MANSEL Longworth Dames (1850-1922) was a strange fellow: he learnt several eastern languages, such as Balochi and...","


 
MANSEL Longworth Dames (1850-1922) was a strange fellow: he learnt several eastern languages, such as Balochi and Pashto; wrote books on Baloch race, Baloch history, Balochi language and folklore; took part in Second Anglo-Afghan War; studied Buddhist art; collected Buddhist relics (though he finally took those relics to the UK).
Dames was a scholar of Portuguese but as an officer of the Indian Civil Service during the Raj, he was posted in Punjab. At Dera Ghazi Khan, he met some Balochi-speaking people who fascinated him much and he began learning the language. Later on, he wrote on Baloch people and the language they spoke. 
After his retirement, Dames contributed several articles to Encyclopaedia of Islam. He became active member of several organisations and societies in the UK, including Royal Asiatic Society, that were researching history, relics, folklores, religions and languages of the East. Dames was instrumental in reorganising Buddhist enclosures at the British Museum.
His contributions to several fields were remarkable, but what Dames did for Balochi language and literature can never be forgotten: he penned at least six books on Balochi language and literature in an era when Balochi literature consisted mostly of oral tradition and written specimens of the language were hard to come by.
The books that Dames penned are considered among the earliest works on Balochi language and literature.
In his book A Sketch of the Northern Balochi Language (1881), he included grammar, vocabulary and specimens of the language as well. In 1891, Dames published A Textbook of Balochi Language and it included some Balochi stories, poems and legends. More importantly it carried a ‘Balochi-English Vocabulary’. 
Another important work by Dames is Popular Poetry of Baloches [sic]. Published in 1907, it preserved some valuable samples of Balochi poetry.
Dr Riazat Burro, a scholar form Larkana, has mentioned in one of his articles that despite these pioneering efforts in Balochi dictionary-writing by Dames, Balochi lexicography could not make much progress for several reasons and except for a couple of small Balochi dictionaries no major Balochi dictionary was compiled in the next several decades.
On the basis of Balochi-English vocabulary included in Dames’ two books, a new book titled Vocabulary of the Balochi Language was published by Government of Punjab Printing Press in 1922, that is, the year Dames died. 
According to Dr Burro, this 216-page book has a Balochi vocabulary spreading over 100 pages. Some believe this 1922 book was the first Balochi-English dictionary, but the fact is Dames’ vocabulary included in his 1881 book was, sort of, the first-ever Balochi-English dictionary.
Some scholars of Balochi have criticised The Vocabulary of the Balochi Language (1922) for its limited scope as it largely covers vocabulary of the Eastern dialect of Balochi and the words from the other dialects of Balochi were generally left out. But Dr Burro defends Dames, saying that Dames has mentioned in the intro that the “Balochi language belongs to the Iranian branch of the Aryan family [of languages]. It is found in two distinct forms: the Northern dialect which is here treated of; and the Southern or Makrani dialect which has been lately dealt with in Major Mockler’s Grammar”.
But Balochi lexicography has not received as much attention as it deserved. Some efforts have been made to capture the Balochi vocabulary, but a few Balochi dictionary projects were either shelved or the manuscripts remained unpublished. 
In 1978, Haft Zabani Lughat (dictionary in seven languages) was published by Urdu Science Board, Lahore, and it included Balochi vocabulary. Now that book has been revised and has appeared in the shape of No Zabani Lughat (dictionary in nine languages).
But the need for a more comprehensive Balochi dictionary was always felt. Luckily, a new dictionary in four languages — Balochi, Sindhi, Brahvi and Urdu — has just been published and since it is a 1300-page tome, it may rank among the most comprehensive of Balochi vocabularies. 
Compiled by Panah Baloch, the dictionary is named Lavz Ganj, or, literally, the treasure of words.
It has four columns and the first column lists Balochi words with their pronunciation given in Urdu script, enabling the readers to pronounce the Balochi words properly. The second column gives the Sindhi equivalent in Sindhi script. The pronunciation of Sindhi words is also given in Urdu script. The third column gives the Brahvi equivalents and the last column lists the Urdu synonyms of the three languages.
One must acknowledge that it is a labour of love and lot of back-breaking effort must have gone into it. Quetta’s Balochi Academy, working since 1961 for the promotion of Balochi language and literature, must be congratulated for publishing such a remarkable work.

11,PDM chief Fazl to become party in Mazari ruling case,"Says will move a petition in SC; warns that coalition won't ""accept any interference, be it soft or hard, in national affairs”.","ISLAMABAD: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rahman on Sunday announced that he will become a party in the petition filed by PML-Q leader Parvez Elahi against the ruling of Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Dost Muhammad Mazari.
Addressing a press conference, the JUI-F chief said he would move a petition with the Supreme Court to become a party in the case. 
Echoing the demand of two major parties in the PDM, the PPP and the PML-N, he also asked for the constitution of a full court of the Supreme Court to hear the petition. 
Flanked by party leaders, including Akram Khan Durrani and Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, he said the party’s chief has the final authority to decide the party policy and all others office bearers (lawmakers) have to follow it. 
“A party leader directs their parliamentary party even if they are not a member [of the house],” he said, adding that after the fiasco in the Punjab Assembly, a new discussion has started that only parliamentary leader has the authority to lead the party in the assembly.—APP
Our Correspondent adds: Separately, talking to reporters at his native village Abdul Khel in Dera Ismail Khan on Sunday, Maulana Fazl, who also heads Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), warned that the ruling coalition “will never accept any interference, be it soft or hard, in national affairs”. 
His remarks came a day after some news channels reported that the establishment has offered “soft intervention” to resolve the current political crisis which has been brewing since former prime minister Imran Khan was ousted through a no confidence motion in April.
The PDM chief said that all State institutions should stay within limits and not exceed their constitutional jurisdiction. 
He warned that if the institutions transgress their domain, it will create a crisis that the same institutions would be unable to control. Maulana Fazl said that parliament will take all decisions as per the Constitution “without being blackmailed or pressurised”. He also claimed that the courts and the “authorities” gave full and unconditional support to Mr Khan’s government but since the PDM came to the power, interference in parliamentary and administrative affairs has started. 
While claiming that Imran Khan almost bankrupted the country, the PDM chief demanded that the government investigate the allegations of corruption during the PTI-led government and hold everyone accountable.
