0,HRCP concerned at increasing mob violence,Urges federal and provincial govts to take special measures to ensure these incidents do not occur again.,"LAHORE: Expressing its concern at the growing mob violence in the country, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Sunday urged the federal as well as provincial governments to take special measures and ensure these that incidents do not occur again.   
In a post on its Twitter account, the human rights watchdog said: “HRCP is perturbed by the seeming rise in mob-led violence, with a suspected robber recently beaten by a crowd in Karachi and then shot dead.  
“While this is symptomatic of the increasing brutalisation of society and easy availability of firearms, it is also underpinned by spiraling poverty and people’s disillusionment with the rule of law.”  

 





 
The HRCP statement added that the federal and provincial governments and police should take special measures, including strategic deployment of trained personnel, to control such incidents in the future.  
It may be mentioned that a suspected robber had been caught by the public while snatching mobile phones from a family at Karachi’s Jauhar Chowk in Orangi Town on June 28. The suspect was tortured by the public and he succumbed to his injuries during treatment at hospital. 
Similarly, a suspect was tortured and lynched by a mob at the Qasba Colony while another man was injured.  
Commenting on the HRCP post, a Twitterati said “when there is no rule of law, the rule of the mob takes over. Concern should be directed to authorities for not properly executing writ of the state. “It’s not about the availability of firearms – it’s the lack of state providing basic services,” he added.

1,Lahore hospitals face acute shortage of anaesthetics,Hundreds of surgeries postponed.,"LAHORE: A critical shortage of anaesthetics has hit the public as well as private hospitals of Lahore hard allegedly due to the gross incompetence and negligence of the health authorities concerned.
Because of the shortage, the doctors are postponing hundreds of surgeries at these hospitals, putting the lives of the critical patients, especially in emergency wards, at risk.A senior official says the health secretary is misstating the facts by declaring that only the Services Hospital Lahore is facing an acute shortage of anaesthetics.
However, he says, all major government sector hospitals are trying hard to procure the drug from the market after the vendors stopped official supplies citing historic rise in the US dollar’s rate against the local currency.

Hundreds of surgeries postponed

The suppliers have refused to provide more drug consignments at the price decided while signing of the contracts with the government, the official says, adding that taking notice of the situation health secretary Ali Jan has directed the heads of these institutes to try and arrange the drug on their own instead of making the issue public.
Consequently, he says, the crisis that started two weeks back has deepened due to the critical shortage of the Isoflurane drug in the government hospitals of Lahore. Isoflurane is approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the inducing and maintenance of general anesthesia.
The official says the Services Hospital Lahore had to purchase some 20 vials of the drug from a private hospital to perform surgeries of critical patients at the A&E, orthopedic, neurology, paediatric and other units of the institute. The hospital had submitted a request for 1,000 drug vials (units) to the private hospital, but it refused to provide the medicine in such a large quantity, he adds.
Quoting administration of the private health facility, he says the medicine is also in short supply in the market and they have stocks only to meet its own needs.
He says the situation was not much different in the Mayo Hospital, Punjab Institute of Cardiology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, and Shaikh Zayed Hospital in Lahore.A spokesperson for the health department say the authorities concerned have taken notice of the anesthesia drug shortage in the government hospitals and managed to provide it to a teaching hospital, while efforts are underway to address the issue.

3,‘Full court bench better to resolve CM election issue’,Federal law minister defends deputy speaker’s ruling...,"LAHORE: Federal Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar says there can be no two laws on a similar issue, and demanded that the chief justice of Pakistan form a full court bench for adjudicating the controversy involving the election of the Punjab chief minister.
He told a press conference here on Sunday that the chief minister election issue would be resolved for good if the full bench heard the case and in a reference to apparently two different approaches of the apex court on defection law, he added there could not be two different laws on as many cases of similar nature.
In a reference to the likely ouster from power of Hamza by the apex court, the law minister said that if a representative of the people is to be sent home through a legal decision then the justice, transparency and independence demand a full court bench to hear the matter.
“There is no solution to the issue other than the formation of the full court bench.”

Federal law minister defends deputy speaker’s ruling

Flanked by Punjab Home Minister Ataullah Tarar, the law minister regretted that the Supreme Court did not take notice of PTI MPAs and workers scaling walls of its Lahore Registry following Parvez Elahi’s defeat in the runoff poll for Punjab chief minister.
He defended Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Dost Mazari’s ruling of rejecting 10 PML-Q votes for Mr Elahi under Article 63-A, and called the step “legal” and “constitutional”.
Apparently, to further highlight the alleged soft corner of the Supreme Court towards the PTI, the minister said that the doors of the Lahore Registry were opened even before the petition was filed by Mr Elahi hours after losing the run-off poll.
He repeated the coalition government’s demand that a full court bench is formed to hear the plea filed by Mr Elahi on the chief minister’s elections.
“A full court bench should be formed considering the importance of the case. Every section of society is demanding a full court bench. Even five former presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association have made the same demand.”
The federal minister hoped that Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial would keep the demand in mind when he resumes the hearing in Islamabad on Monday.
He said that a five-member bench of the apex court gave a 3-2 decision on a presidential reference on interpretation of Article 63-A. Three judges said that votes of the dissident members would be cast but not counted but the dissident member would be unseated. The minister said he would not comment on the unseating of the PML-Q members as it was between Chaudhry Shujaat and his MPAs.
Quoting National Food Security and Research Minister Tariq Bashir Cheema, who is from the PML-Q, Mr Tarar said that the Q-League MPAs had been verbally informed of party president Ch Shujaat’s decision and a letter was also dispatched to them through TCS, an urgent mail service.
About the claims that PML-Q’s parliamentary party meeting had held on July 21 to decide the party line for the vote, he said there is no video or [news] clipping of that meeting, while Ch Shujaat gave clear instructions to his MPAs, verbally and through the letter, to vote for Hamza.

5,Punjab notes: More or less: can you solve the riddle?,Debate on the philosophic question of whether we should have more or less has been going on since ages. It in fact...,"Debate on the philosophic question of whether we should have more or less has been going on since ages. It in fact seems to be unending.  
History of social evolution clearly tells us that human have always been struggling to have more of everything that provides security and comfort. We broke loose from the animal kingdom way back in time but we carry with us the psychological make-up formed during that unimaginably long period underpinned by primal fear and visceral sense of insecurity.  
Our primordial impulses work on us in a surreptitious manner which we are not aware of all the times. So our legacy of fear and sense of insecurity weighs on our mind in multiple ways. To get better of it we try to find ways that we think can make us less vulnerable in a universe which still remains largely unknown and unexplored. Since basic needs are to have food and shelter that create conditions wherein the continuity of our existence is ensured through a process of procreation. Such a fundamental instinctual drive has led to our social organisation which upholds the notion of more. More is generally believed to be a panacea; more of everything; concrete and abstract, tangible and intangible. Such an attitude is largely driven by what we call in social and moral terms greed or profit.  
Greed has worked wonders as it has made us what we are at this point in time. Can you imagine that lack of greed or pure altruism would have created what we see all around us on our earth? Can one imagine for example tall buildings, towers, palaces, gardens, hospitals, ships, railways, airplanes, spaceships, telephone and telegraph, and computer in the absence of greed or profit?  
Greed has a positive dimension too which is not usually highlighted in the face of ever-present moral outrage against it.  
Baba Guru Nanak has forcefully expressed both sides of the situation; what greed created and moral attitude towards it: “Kings, subjects, royal officers, none will remain at all / shops, towns, bazars, by Order will fall / Stylish, strong doors, fools consider their own / Storehouses filled with treasures, in a moment will be empty / Arabian, chariots, chargers, elephant in armoury / Diamonds, households, orchards, where will they be known /Pavilions, tape-laced beds, little inns desirable /Nanak truth is the giver, recognition natural (Trans: Muzaffar A. Ghaffaar).”
Look at the beauty of the things he has describes but it doesn’t display the ugliness of the process that creates it. His stress is on moral compass. Sages and saints disdain such possessions because their appropriation by a few gives them power over many. They are not meant for all as they are enjoyed by an exclusive club of a select few. They are not shared with those who produce them in a skewed politico-economic structure that has been prevalent since ages. Two, gloss and glitter don’t show the extractive nature of labour (in the widest sense) that gone into making of these products. Three, too may resources, natural and human, are exploited for the comfort and leisure of a few resulting in inequality that breeds social resentment and political unrest. 
Examples of outlandish wastage of diminishing resources are galore. An Indian businessman builds the world’s most expensive house for his small family in a city has the the largest shanty town. An American entrepreneur travels in a private jet while old people die of cold as they cannot afford heating. Sages’ scathing critique of notion of more has proved valid in our times in the face of unfettered exploitation of natural resources premised on their being unlimited. Increased scientific knowledge reveals that the very concept of infinite world is a grievous fallacy. The world we live surrounded by is finite. How can we afford infinite exploitation of the resources it has? Consequently, unlimited consumption in a limited world will lead to a calamitous situation we never faced before. Even today the disastrous consequences of this philosophy of more are there for all to see in the shape of air pollution, environmental degradation and climate change.  
Rich societies like rich persons fond of more are mainly responsible for the destruction of what they love to flaunt as their grand achievements. Apocalyptic scenes of future are not an abstract possibility. Portents are scary if we keep our eyes open. As to the notion of less, it is also not tenable to a large extent. If this idea was practiced, we would have been still in the bush warding off hungry predators ready to eat us alive. Most of traditional societies trapped in the vicious cycle of superstition are tied to by the spiritual claptrap of less. This opiate also helps to keep the masses calmed down. History shows us that no single idea can sustain human society and ensure its forward movement. Our world, a mélange of different cultures, has to find a compromise between these two opposing ideas. More is dangerous in the sense that it causes destruction of the planet we live on. Less is also dangerous as it discourages us from creating and producing what is needed for developing fully safe and rounded human beings who are at peace with themselves and the natural world that sustains them. If we fully stick to less we shall end up having more and more clones of Diogenes of Anatolia. So it means neither more nor less. But the question is what could be this neither more nor less? The answer would be as difficult as the one given by a Zen master to a Japanese emperor who summoned him and asked what he had learnt about Zen in China during his studies. The master had a flute under his arm. He took it out, played a few notes and left the court without uttering a word. Finding answer to our conundrum could be that difficult. — soofi01@hotmail.com

7,Sutlej breach floods 20km area in Bahawalnagar,BAHAWALNAGAR: A 50-foot wide breach caused by heavy torrential rains in the protection dyke of Sutlej river near the...,"BAHAWALNAGAR: A 50-foot wide breach caused by heavy torrential rains in the protection dyke of Sutlej river near the Shamska village has flooded the nearby area, destroying crops on about 10,000 acre land in the last four days and more damage is feared in the coming days. 
The residents of the area fear the floodwater could destroy the only bridge (Baba Fareed Bridge) over the Sutlej near Mari Chakoka between Minchinabad and Pakpattan and affect residential localities if steps to control the situation are not taken at the earliest. 
Hundreds of villagers, residing on the riverbed, have been stranded along with thousands of cattle whereas paddy and fodder crops have also been ruined by the floodwater, the revenue department sources said. 
The villagers said the breach occurred on July 21 but the administration started paying visits to the area a day after the incident when a huge protest was held by the locals. While terming their visits mere photo sessions, the locals alleged that the administration had done nothing to plug the breach yet. They feared that if the rain started again, which was expected to continue till Aug 3, it could cause massive losses of life and property. They said thousands of affected people needed several flood relief camps from Shamska village to the Mari Chakoka area; however, the administration had set up only one relief camp of Rescue 1122. 
An official of Rescue 1122 told Dawn thousands of acres of land spread over a 20km area had been affected. He said hundreds of people had been stranded and most of them had refused to leave their area and they were waiting for the administration to plug the breach in the protection dyke. He said that the rescuers were helping those who wanted to be evacuated, adding that boats were also ready to rescue people in case of any emergency. 
Assistant Commissioner Ahmad Javed Cheema confirmed that about 10,000 acre land had been inundated by the river water, adding that the breach could not be plugged because of the high water flow. He said that the work to plug the breach could be started from today (Sunday) because the irrigation officials had visited the site and the water flow in the river was gradually decreasing.

9,Senior Punjab police officer ‘penalised for standing up to political juggernaut’,"LAHORE: In what appears to be height of political victimisation, the Punjab government has not only twice removed...","LAHORE: In what appears to be height of political victimisation, the Punjab government has not only twice removed BS-18 police officer Maaz Zafar within a short span but also surrendered his services and the very next day relieved him of his duties, directing him to report to the Establishment Division till further orders.  
The ‘swift’ action against the police officer reveals a bitter background as he was first prematurely removed from his two positions and then surrendered from Punjab on the directions issued by none other than the Prime Minister Office. The move is a classic example of chronic political interference in the police operational matters, undermining the autonomy of the force.  
It is also evident from fact that some provincial political figures engaged the two top offices - the PM office and the Punjab CM office -- for repatriation of Maaz Zafar to the federal government. Many other appointments in regions and districts have been made by the PML-N against the consent of recently transfererd IGP Rao Sardar Ali Khan, which is said to be one of the reasons which prompted Khan to refuse to serve as the police chief. 
An official said the action against Maaz Zafar had been criticised by a group of retired inspector generals of police (IGPs) who declare that ‘the police officers are being ruled by a lot of masters’. In February 2021, he said, several serving and retired IGPs had prepared a draft of reforms while pointing out a set of problems including the political interference in police’s operational matters. They had joined heads under the “Police Awam Saath Saath Programme” launched jointly by the Punjab police and the United States Institute of Peace (USIP).  
He said Rao Sardar Ali Khan transferred Maaz Zafar from Okara district and posted him SSP operations in Gujranwala in May last, elevating him in the light of his performance reports. As he assumed charge in Gujranwala, some political elites in the Punjab government showed serious concerns over his appointment and pressurised the CM Secretariat to remove him from the field assignment.  
The official said the former IGP resisted the move when the CM Secretariat directed him to take action against the officer, conveying that Zafar had registered cases against some parliamentarians during his posting in Lahore back in 2018 and that he enjoyed a good reputation. The issue remained a matter of discussion between the IGP and the CM office for a couple weeks as the local politicians vigorously pursued the matter, said the official. 
Eventually, he said, the provincial police chief succumbed to the pressure and removed Maaz Zafar from his post just 35 days after his appointment in Gujranwala and made him officer on special duty. However, to avoid embarrassment in his community, the IGP transferred and posted him in the Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA) a few days later as the officer in question felt disturbed.  
As the officer assumed charge of his new assignment, some MPs again knocked on the CM Secretariat door and then took up the matter with the prime minister also, said the official. And this time round the action was so much swift that the officer was not only removed from his new position but also surrendered from Punjab, he said. 
The Punjab government also relieved him of his duties from the province on July 21 -- the next day of his transfer order -- and directed him to report to the Establishment Division.  
The official source said the police officer had been penalised as the Lahore police had lodged a case against Khokhar brothers under anti-terrorism and nine other sections of the Pakistan Penal Code back in 2018. In the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the Nawab Town police had nominated PML-N stalwarts including Malik Saiful Malook Khokhar, Malik Shafi Kokhar, Malik Afzal Khokhar, Malik Irfan Kokhar, Malik Faisal Ashraf Kokhar, Malik Azam Jehangir and nearly 400 other party leaders and workers.  
Police officer Maaz Zafar was serving as the SP Saddar at that time. Meanwhile, he said, the Supreme Court also took action on complaints of local residents about illegal land grabbing against Khokhar brothers. The SC ordered the then Anti-Corruption Punjab director-general, Hussain Asghar, to probe the allegation levelled against the politicians.  
Therefore, the DG formed a committee comprising members of the Anti-Corruption Department, the district administration and police. Maaz Zafar was made a member of the committee which submitted an inquiry report in the SC which later ordered demolition of a certain area of the Khokhar Palace located in Johar Town.  
The issue hit the headlines in the national media, the official said, adding that the police officer had been a target of these political elites since then and was eventually penalised by the PML-N government.

The breach occurred due to heavy rains, while the canal was flowing with the full capacity of 12,000 cusec at that time.

A good number of people turned up at the cultural venue to enjoy the holiday. Alhamra’s Hall 2 was jam-packed and even stairs were filled with the audience. Earlier, two theatre groups staged their performances -- the Mass Foundation staged ‘Book of Love’ and Salamat Productions ‘Rahay Koie Naghma Gar Salamat’.  
Sunday’s play ‘Zindagi Khahniyan’ was an adaptation of short stories by an Indian writer. It was an experimental play having no set. There were mime and dance performances and the audience thoroughly enjoyed the production. The play was reflective of life and issues related to people, their emotions, feelings, the social fabric of society.  
Afzaal Nabi, the director who is the moving spirit behind Akas Theater, told Dawn that in the current festival he had broken the shackles of a traditional play and staged an experimental production. He said in theatre, there’s hardly any practice of staging experimental plays. The play had no set -- real or suggestive. On Monday (today), Creator Production will stage the play ‘Ooper Wali Manzil’. 
Students of colleges and universities are attending the festival and enjoying parallel theatre productions. That the event is open to all and being advertised on social media are the main reasons for good public response.

18,Malaysian acting HC visits mango farms,RAHIM YAR KHAN: Chargé d’affaires of the Malaysian High Commission in Islamabad Dedddy Faisal Ahmed Saleh visited...,"RAHIM YAR KHAN: Chargé d’affaires of the Malaysian High Commission in Islamabad Dedddy Faisal Ahmed Saleh visited an 105 years old mango orchard at Adamwali along national highway, some 15 kms from here. 
Having liking for the fruit, Saleh noted that mangoes of Rahim Yar Khan were the best in the world due to their taste.  
He showed his concern over the impact of climate change which has decreased mango production by almost 50 per cent. 
According to an announcement by the orchard management, Saleh visited Rahim Yar Khan along with his father and other family members on their invitation extended to him last year when he visited a mango exhibition arranged by the RYK chamber of commerce in the President House in Islamabad.  
“Saleh was much impressed last year after visiting the mango exhibition,” Malik Abdul Waheed, the director of the orchard, said.  
He said Mr Saleh spent whole the day in the orchard and collected information about different mango varieties. He had a detailed session with gardeners and other staff to learn about packing and grading facilities for the export of mango.
He was told that there were more than 100 mango varieties in the country but Chaunsa was the most sought after which was exported to several countries.
Waheed said mango orchards on 71,000 acres in Rahim Yar Khan district produced 35 per cent of total production of Punjab. But, he regretted, RYK could not get the status of mango zone like the citrus zone of Sargodha.
He said a cold store worth millions was inaugurated for mango exports by former CM Shahbaz Sharif near the Sheikh Zayed International Airport but it could not be completed, he told.
