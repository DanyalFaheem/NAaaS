0,150-foot breach in Hub Canal,The news of the breach caused panic among the people living in Surjani Town and Manghopir.,"KARACHI: A portion of the Hub canal developed 150-foot breach near Mang­hopir following heavy rains, area people and officials said on Sunday. 
The news of the breach caused panic and scare among the people living in Surjani Town and Manghopir.
Senior Pakistan Peoples Party leader and chief minister’s focal person for district West Waqar Mehdi confirmed the breach and said that district administration, police and irrigation officials were present there.
Officials said that Hub dam, located 56 kilometres from Karachi, had last week reached capacity and overflowed when the water level was recorded at nearly 340 feet leading to opening of spillway of the reservoir. Since then, further flow to the Hub dam had been stop­ped to prevent the situation from deteriorating further.
A senior official, who wished not to be named, said that the flow of water from the breach was still far away from human settlements. 
He said that at present there was no threat to two nearby villages — Khamiso Goth and Pathan Goth — since the two settlements situated on height. Due to this, the authorities had so far not decided to shift the people to at any other location, he added.
Mr Mehdi said since the rain continued till late in the evening, the work to plug the breach had not started yet. If any threat emerged to the villages in Manghopir, the residents would be shifted to nearby educational institutions, he added.
The deputy commissioner-West, senior police officers and irrigation department staff had got the flow towards the Hub dam stopped.
Last week, the Water and Power Development Autho­rity (Wapda) had issued an alert to the residents of nearby areas warning them to take extra precautions.

1,Three die from electrocution as day-long deluge swamps Karachi,Underpasses closed after over five inches of rain...,"KARACHI: Three people died from electrocution as the fresh spell of heavy downpour paralysed life across Karachi on Sunday dealing a blow to the fragile infrastructure of the metropolis, which was already under severe strain.  
The heavy rains led to flooding in all low-lying areas inundating key roads and playing havoc with the city’s ill-maintained sewerage system.  
Just minutes after the rainfall, which started early in the morning, the city infrastructure started to collapse in coping with the emerging situation.  
Heavy rains inundated three city underpasses, according to officials.  
A traffic police spokesperson said that rainwater had entered underpasses and therefore, KPT, Submarine and Mehran hotel underpasses had been closed to traffic.  

Underpasses closed after over five inches of rain

With a severely damaged drainage system, the city administration started efforts to drain out rainwater through alternative sources by deploying more human resources for manual cleaning of roads and thoroughfares and at some points mobile pumping stations were set up to drain out water.  
However, the efforts fell short due to non-stop rains which continued for more than 12 hours with a few breaks.  
Under severe conditions, a part of a dilapidated bridge over Malir River, connecting the city road with the National Highway, caved in which led to suspension of traffic on one track of the key link.  
Electrocutions 
Three people were killed in rain-related incident in the city, according to police and hospital officials.  
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the body of a man identified as Shan Husain, 40, was brought from Lea Market near Memon Masjid at Civil Hospital Karachi at 1pm.  
The cause of the death was electrocution, said Dr Syed and added that he suffered an electric shock at his home.  
Surjani Town SHO Haji Sana­ullah 
said that three friends tried to charge mobile phone in Taiser Town, when one of them aged arou­nd 35, got an electric shock and died. The body was taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital (ASH). 
In another incident, 17-year-old Zia Saqib received an electric shock near Sheesh Mahal in Liaquatabad-5 and died, said Dr Summaiya Syed.  
The body was brought at the ASH to fulfil medico-legal formalities. 
Four hurt in roof collapse 
A couple and their two children were injured when a roof of their house collapsed in Baldia Town on Sunday night. 
An Edhi Foundation spokesperson said the four family members came under debris of a roof that fell down in Daud Goth near Pakistan Chowk.  
The couple namely Mr Nadeem, 35 and Ms Pathani, 25, and their two children, Seema, five, and Krishna, two, were injured and taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi for treatment.  
Police said continued rains also caused a breach in a river in Rozi Goth of Surjani Town where the police authorities and the administration were present to control the situation.  
KU, BIEK cancel exams 
The situation turned worrisome and announcements started to pour in from different institutions about suspension of their planned activities and events on Monday [today].  
The University of Karachi was the first to announce postponement of all exams scheduled for July 25, followed by a statement from Board of Intermediate Education Karachi (BIEK) informing students about cancelling the practical exams scheduled for July 25 due to the heavy rains. 
Rain to continue today
The fresh moves from the government and educational institutions were in sync with the advice of the meteorological department which warned in its advisory that the trend of heavy rains was likely to continue for the next couple of days in Karachi and other parts of Sindh.  
The strong monsoon currents that penetrated in Sindh on Saturday night would prevail till July 26-27, said the Met office.  
“Under the influence of this weather system, widespread rain-wind/thunderstorms with scattered heavy/very heavy falls (extremely heavy at times) are likely in Tharparkar, Umarkot, Mirpurkhas, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal, Tando M Khan, Tando Allayar, Hyderabad, Matiari, Sanghar, Nawabshah, Khairpur, Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad, Dadu, Jamshoro, Shikarpur, Qambar Shahdadkot, Ghotki and Kashmore districts and Karachi division from today to July 26-27.” 
By 8pm, Quaidabad received the highest amount of rainfall ie 96 millimetres, followed by Surjani Town (82mm), Keamari (79mm), Gulshan-i-Hadeed (78mm), DHA Phase II (70.5mm), PAF Masroor Base (77mm), Saddar (62mm), North Karachi (60mm), Orangi Town (57.5mm), PAF Base Faisal (51mm), Nazimabad (50mm), Gadap Town (49.6mm) Saadi Town (39.6mm), Gulshan-i-Maymar (36.9mm), Met office University Road (36.8mm), Old Airport (33mm) and Jinnah Terminal (32mm). 
Power outages 
Amid continued downpour and flooding, the city faced another challenge of a severed power supply system.  
A number of citizens in different localities complained to Dawn about power outages.  
The city’s sole power utility, K-Electric, cited ‘safety reasons’ for power outages in many areas.  
“Moderate to heavy rainfall continues across various parts of Karachi under the current monsoon spell,” said the K-Electric spokesperson.  
“Power supply to the city continues to remain stable, and at this time, approximately 100 feeders out of 1,900 have been powered down mostly for safety reasons. Areas affected are majorly those where risk of water logging or high prevalence of kundas makes use of safety protocols unavoidable.” 
The power utility also “requested” the people to maintain a safe distance from electricity infrastructure.

Officials at the Child Protection Bureau confirmed her arrival and said that foolproof security measures had been taken for her.
A Lahore court on Saturday ordered shifting of teenage Dua back to Karachi. She was earlier sent to a shelter home in Lahore. Judicial Magistrate Rizwan Ahmed had directed the authorities to shift her to Karachi and produce her before a Karachi judicial magistrate.
He also ordered the authorities to provide security to Dua and no one should be allowed to meet her before her appearance in the court in Karachi.
The investigating officer of the Dua Zehra abduction case is set to produce the teenage girl before Judicial Magistrate Aftab Ahmed Bughio on Aug 1.
Last week, the Sindh High Court (SHC) had ruled since Dua Zehra was still a minor and a key witness in the case pertaining to her abduction, she cannot be permitted to stay on her own in Lahore till attaining maturity and disposal of the case.
On April 16, Dua’s parents filed an FIR alleging that their daughter had been kidnapped from Karachi. On April 26, she was recovered from Okara. Later, she told the Sindh High Court that she had not been kidnapped but left her home on her own and married Zaheer Ahmed of her own free will. She also claimed that she was 18 years old, but later a medical board found out his age between 15 and 16 years.

5,Confident Murad says rain spell will not cause any serious issue,Assures citizens he is making all-out efforts to drain rainwater.,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Sunday said he was sure that the current system of rain would not cause any serious issue as ‘almost all the nullahs, small and big ones, including those constructed along the main arteries of the city, have been cleaned’. 
Talking to the media during his visit to the metropolis, the chief minister assured the people of the city that he was making all-out efforts to drain out rainwater in minimum possible time. 
“It has been raining since 5am, but our concerned officials and top bureaucracy, along with ministers, are on the roads to ensure proper disposal of rainwater,” he said.
The CM said that the people of this city had witnessed the performance, sincerity and commitment to serve them that’s why the previous spell of heavy downpour did not submerge the city, otherwise the city used to turn into a river, but now all the roads were motorable and water was draining either through its gravity or with the machines.
The chief minister along with his cabinet members and chief secretary inspected flow of the storm waters drains and installation of cesspool machines in the low-lying and old city areas, and directed administrator Karachi to install heavy pumping machines in the areas where water has accumulated.
CM Murad, accompanied by Information Minister Sharjeel Memon, Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah, Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab, Chief Secretary Sohail Rajput, Karachi Commissioner Iqbal Memon and LG Secretary Najam Shah, visited various nullahs of the metropolis.
At the start of the visit, the chief minister reached at the nullah at Shaheen Complex and inspected its smooth flow right towards Clifton where he also got a cesspool installed at the road to dispose of accumulating water in the low-lying areas of the Ziauddin Road.
He then visited nullah at City station on I.I. Chundrigar road and then at Habib Bank Plaza, where the flow of nullah was slow, therefore, he directed to install a mobile pumping system to speed up the flow of the rain water.
Mr Shah directed the water boards to install two suction systems — one at the low-lying area of Tower and the other at the backside of the KPT warehouses — to keep disposing of the accumulating water in the sea towards Native Jetty as it was submerged due to the choked storm water drains running along the stock exchange building and KPT godowns. 
He also visited different localities such as Imambargah Hussainian Iranian in Kharadar, Mithadar Lee Market and their adjoining areas and got sewerage pumping station installed and inspected proper disposal of the rainwater and smooth flow of the nullahs in Lyari. 
Upon his return from Lyari, he reached Garden East and West areas and went to inspect underpasses at KPT and Submarine Chowrangi and inspected their dewatering system.
He also visited different nullahs passing through Sharea Faisal where the water board and other concerned staff was on duty.
Mr Shah visited Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), Sindh, office where he was received by his Advisor on Relief Rasool Bux Chandio. 
At the PDMA office, the chief minister was briefed about the rain monitoring system and rain gauge system installed there. 
He was told that 41mm of rain was recorded at 18 different stations of the Met office. He was told that if the average rain in the North area of the city was calculated it would come to 68mm by 5:50pm.
He visited different areas of DHA and witnessed that rainwater had accumulated on different roads and streets, therefore, he directed administrator KMC to move cesspool and suction machines to DHA and get the accumulated water disposed of.

6,"Ice on sale grossly contaminated with toxic metals, finds KU study","According to the findings, all the ice samples were grossly contaminated with arsenic and lead.","KARACHI: A study recently conducted by a team of Karachi University (KU) researchers showed that the ice being used to make different food items is heavily contaminated, particularly with some toxic, cancer-causing metals, and not fit for human consumption. The research was carried out at the KU’s Institute Environmental Studies (IES). 
The team collected 42 samples from all the six districts of Karachi and conducted analysis of different physicochemical parameters and heavy metals to check their quality. 
According to the findings, all the ice samples were grossly contaminated with arsenic and lead and crossed the 0.01 mg/L limit set by the WHO. The maximum lead content (5.71 mg/L) was observed in the sample collected from Jamia Milia, Malir. 
All samples failed to meet the 2011 WHO guidelines on nickel. The highest nickel level (2.55 mg/L) was observed in Muslimabad, Landhi. As many as 21.4 per cent samples had values greater than 1mg/L. The maximum allowable WHO limit set for nickel is 0.07mg/L. 
<‘Long term exposure to toxic metals poses serious health risks’
The value of chromium fluctuated between 0.055mg/L and 0.93mg/L against the WHO value of 0.050.93mg/L. 
A total of 28.57 per cent samples had sulphate levels above the WHO guidelines of 250 mg/L. The maximum sulphate concentration of 432mg/L was observed at Anda Mor in North Karachi. 
The mean chloride value was found to be 96.271 mg/L.
Two ice samples collected from Gadap town and Shadman Town crossed the WHO guidelines (250 mg/L). 
The minimum and maximum TDS (total dissolved solids) value was 512mg/L and 2451mg/L, which was found in the sample collected from Shadman Town. The WHO 2011 guidelines say that water TDS should be less than 1000 mg/L.
Chloride in water, according to the study, is considered to be safe at low concentration, but it could alter water taste at a concentration of above 250 mg/L. 
Only two ice samples collected from Gadap Town and Shadman crossed the guidelines (250 mg/L). 
A number of samples had hardness greater than 500mg/L set by the WHO. These samples were collected from Madras Chowk, Orangi Town 13, Gadap, Shadman Town and North Karachi. 
Water hardness greater than 500 mg/L, the study says, would have adverse health effects on human health and may cause kidney stone formation and cardiovascular diseases. 
The maximum hardness level was observed in Gadap town with a concentration of 1040mg/L.
All ice samples, however, had nitrate levels within the maximum allowable limit of 50 mg/L set by the WHO.
The team led by Dr Aamir Alamgir, assistant professor at IES, included Noor Fatima and Qamar Ali.
Contaminated water
According to Dr Alamgir, it’s the first detailed study on the quality of ice being commonly used in cold drinks, juices, milkshakes, ice-creams and ice lollies, among other food items. 
The study’s findings, he pointed out, endorsed findings of past studies that had reported higher levels of toxic metals in both piped and tanker water in the city. 
“Higher levels of toxic metals, such as lead, arsenic and chromium, in samples clearly indicate that the water being used for making ice is contaminated with untreated industrial effluents,” he said, adding that chromium was widely used in industries such as glass manufacturing, electroplating, dyes and paint, tannery, chemicals and steel alloy. 
Call for action
A change in water taste, he said, was an indication of high TDS level in water. 
“Studies show that the long term use/exposure to toxic metals poses serious health risks. For instance, the use of arsenic contaminated water even in low levels might cause diabetes, lung and heart diseases, cancer and disruption in cell communication. High levels of sulphate are responsible for gastrointestinal impatience and dehydration.”
Expressing concern on the study’s findings, Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, a senior general physician associated with Pakistan Medical Association, said international studies had revealed that 60pc of the diseases were caused by polluted water, but this risk increased multiple times if the water was contaminated with toxic metals. 
“We have been seeing a constant rise in several diseases, such as cancer, over the years. This situation seems to be linked with environmental factors, including the use of contaminated water and polluted air, as the provincial government has failed miserably to deliver and there are no regulatory quality checks on the food being sold in the market.”
The study, he said, should serve as a wake-up call for the government, which could effectively reduce spending on the primary healthcare services only if it provided clean and safe drinking water to the masses. 
“We know where all the allocated health funds go. It’s time that the government take up its basic responsibility and that is to provide clean drinking water and sanitation services to the general public,” he said.

The task of...,"THE language riots in the city had caused many families to leave their homes and shift to safer places. The task of the authorities was two-fold: not to let unruliness to take place anymore and to make sure that the affected households get necessary assistance. On July 27, 1972 the Karachi Relief Committee constituted four sub-committees to ascertain the damage in various parts of the city during the recent disturbances. They were to also recommend relief measures for speedy rehabilitation of the uprooted persons. 
The meeting, presided over by the city deputy commissioner, was attended by local MPAs, philanthropists, social workers and volunteers. They appealed to the affected citizens to register their claims with the respective sub-committees by July 31.
It was not just Karachi that bore the brunt of the political turmoil — the entire province of Sindh was engulfed in it. On July 26, it was reported that about 500 families dislocated during the disturbances in different parts of Sindh had come to Karachi and had been temporarily lodged in four transit camps set up by ‘public-spirited’ people. 
Out of them, over 200 families were from Larkana. They were kept in camps at Saudabad, Drigh Colony, Azizabad and Godhra Camp (new Karachi). Most of them, earning a living through various professions and trades, had no relations in Karachi. 
The Sindh government, in the meantime, was keeping an eye on another important matter as well. 
On July 28, the Provincial Finance Minister, Kamal Azfar, said the government had formulated a comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of hut dwellers and the shelter-less in Karachi. He told the workers of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) during his visit to the PPP Jacob Lines branch office that under the scheme multi-storey buildings would be constructed in the city, and the flats of the buildings would be leased out to the shelter-less on a concessional basis.
The minister was in the news next day, too, when he visited the KMC Market Liaquatabad, which had collapsed during the riots. Addressing the residents, Mr Azfar said President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was greatly shocked at the sad incidents that resulted due to the linguistic clashes and had ordered the provincial government to assess the losses so that the victims could be compensated as soon as possible.
What was the role of the media all this while? Did it try and placate the situation or sensationalise it? 
On July 26, this newspaper carried a story according to which, an emergency meeting of the Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) said that the journalist community had nothing to do with the violence in Karachi in which damage had been caused to private and public property. 
In a resolution, it stressed that the KUJ and the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) and its affiliated unions believed in peaceful methods to achieve the noble objective of press freedom and appealed to the people to support their cause. The session, presided over by KUJ President Hassan Abidi, asked Karachiites to remain vigilant against those anti-national and reactionary elements who liked to achieve their nefarious political ends by unleashing anarchic conditions in the country.

In a meeting called by the joint action committee for human rights, the participants said that the postponement of the LG elections was harmful for Karachi and other cities.  
While discussing the Hyderabad incident they emphasised communal harmony and said that the influx of population in Karachi should be regulated and there should be a check-and-balance system to monitor it. “We should follow the procedures adopted by developed countries in this regard.”
The report of the fact finding team of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan was also shared, which stated that the Hyderabad incident was an outcome of a personal feud and did not happen because of the hatred between two ethnic groups.
As for immigrants from Afghanistan, the participants said that they should be registered as refugees and should be sent back to their country. 
“The Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement and local Sindhi population should not be targeted nor should be held responsible for Hyderabad and Sohrab Goth incidents... only the persons involved in these incidents should be punished according to law,” they demanded. 
The participants agreed to issue a statement to condemn retired Justice Javed Iqbal for allegedly harassing women and victims of enforced disappearance.
Speakers included Karamat Ali, Asad Iqbal Butt, Saeed Baluch, Sheema Kermani, Farhat Perween, Shahnaz Ahad, Noorullah Tareen, Khaliq Junejo, Amanullah Shaikh, Mahnaz Rahman and others.

The directives were given by the senior adviser of the Federal Ombudsman Secretariat, Syed Anwar Hyder, during a recent visit to the regional centre of the HEC in the metropolis. 
According to a press release, he urged the HEC to play more effective role to uplift standard of universities so that Pakistani students could avail education and employment opportunities around the world without facing difficulties.
He said that there were several complaints that some private sector universities had opened campuses without getting HEC approval and fulfilling quality standards that resulted into difficulties and complications for over 10,000 students, who had moved courts in the regard.
He said that the ombudsman secretariat had also received several complaints against universities and it was looking into these complaints and appropriate actions would be taken to provide relief to the complainants.
Mr Hyder appreciated the role of HEC in providing verification, attestation and other important facilities and services to a wide range of students from undergraduate to post-doctoral level.
He stressed the need of establishment of statuary institutions to regulate primary and secondary level education in the country so that entire educational system from basic to higher level could be uplifted and standardised at par with developed nations of the world.
“Developed and emerging nations around the globe allocate funds amounting to five to six per cent of their GDP for education and Pakistan should also increase its budgetary allocation for education to ensure provision of sufficient resources to education sector,” he observed.
He said that the federal ombudsman secretariat had offices in all the major cities of the country and its Karachi office alone received and disposed of over 15,000 complaints each year.
Javed Ali Memon, the director of HEC’s regional centre Karachi, said that the HEC was working with a vision of raising standards of higher education in Pakistan and certain measures were taken in this regard including Pakistan Education and Research Network (PERN), online Learning Management System and digitisation of data.
He said that HEC was providing grants and funds to universities for promotion of higher education and research besides setting quality standards and provision of state-of-the-art facilities and guidance to universities as well as to students. 
The commission was focused on adoption of 21st century requirements by universities to elevate them to world standards, he said and added that Pakistani universities were performing well that was demonstrated by improvement of their world rankings.
Although the government was providing funds, universities needed to generate their own resources to attain self sustainability, he said, adding that the HEC provided Rs30 million to each university during Covid-19 situation.
Later, the senior adviser visited the data centre, IT lab, attestation centre and other facilities at HEC regional centre. He also met students and parents present at the centre and inquired about facilities and issues.

The opposition lawmaker was booked for spraying ‘graffiti allegedly defaming security institutions and abetting mutiny, and attempting to seduce soldiers from their duty” inside a cricket ground in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on May 20.
Judicial Magistrate (East) Sibghatullah noted that the investigating officer had filed a charge sheet, recommending the trial of MNA Khan for allegedly committing offences punishable under Sections 131(abetting mutiny, or attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from his duty), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups, etc), 500-A (punishment for defamation), 505(i)-A (statements conducing to public mischief), 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or for a shorter terms) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), “but the essential elements for filing of complaint as required under Section 196 [Prosecution for offences against the State] Criminal Procedure Code is missing”.
“Section 196 imposes an embargo upon the court from taking cognizance of any offence punishable under the Chapter VI or IX-A of the PPC (except Section 127), or punishable under Section 108-A, or 153-A, or 295-A, or 505 of the same Code, unless upon complaint made by order of, or under authority from the Federal Government, or the Provincial Government concerned, or some officer empowered on behalf of either of the two governments,” the magistrate wrote in the two-page order.
“In view of the above quoted legal provision, since no complaint was registered by the officer, who was authorised/empowered by Government, whereas the present FIR, is registered by SHO himself without complaint from concerned authority. Thus, the Investigating Officer has wrongly challaned the case,” he added.
“I do not agree with the recommendations of the Investigating Officer thereby I hereby decline to take cognizance and dispose of the final challan under ‘C’ class, thereby the case stands cancelled, the nominated accused Muhammad Alamgir Khan is hereby discharged from the charge of this case,” the judge ruled.
MNA Khan was booked under Sections 131, 153-A, 500, 505(i)-A, 511 and 34 of the PPC on behalf of the state at the Gulshan-i-Iqbal police station.

15,"Rains increase flows in barrages, improve water shortage situation","HYDERABAD: The province of Sindh, which has been deprived of water, has finally got adequate water flows due to...","HYDERABAD: The province of Sindh, which has been deprived of water, has finally got adequate water flows due to recent spells of monsoon rains in the province and upper reaches, forcing irrigation authorities to either close water flows or reduce them in different main canals of the barrages, said the officials of different barrages. 
Guddu Barrage would shortly attain ‘low level floods’ level status in next 48-72 hours, and even Kotri Barrage downstream — that were only seen in flood season - have increased also when compared with water situation experienced in April-May period this year.
A look at current water flows indicated that Guddu Barrage was having 216,294 cusecs flows upstream and downstream flows of 196,984 cusecs at 6pm on Sunday. A flow of 200,000 cusecs is considered low flood level at any barrage. 
“Guddu Barrage will attain low flood level soon,” said Sukkur Barrage official Aziz Soomro.
Likewise, Sukkur Barrage was having 148,200 cusecs upstream and 125,050 cusecs downstream this evening. Kotri Barrage was having a flow of 99,375 cusecs and 88,550 cusecs downstream. Farmlands fed by Kotri Barrage were brought under paddy cultivation. Water shortage had been a problem for growers here, but rains have rescued paddy growers and water situation had also improved in the system.
Flows at Punjab’s Taunsa Barrage downstream head for Sindh’s Guddu Barrage  after joining downstream flows at Panjnad Barrage — had reported 322,517 cusecs upstream and 315,217 cusecs downstream flows. 
“Given present river flows conditions, we anticipate that Guddu Barrage will have a discharge of 275,000 cusecs in next 48-72 hours,” said Soomro.
Panjnad Barrage downstream flows of 32,288 cusecs would join flows at Taunsa Barrage. These flows would then reach Guddu, he said and added that Taunsa was getting water flows triggered by rainfall in Koh-i-Suleman range.
Only a couple of months back, Guddu Barrage had reported 90pc shortage in April-May as well due to highly inadequate poor flows of water in Indus river system, leading to acrimony between Sindh and Punjab over interprovincial water distribution and missing flows at Taunsa downstream. One of the right side canals of Guddu Barrage, Pat Feeder, also supplies water to Balochistan. Balochistan had also been complaining about non-availability of flows from Sindh as per their share under Water Accord.
In view of improved water flows in the system, the flows at Kotri Barrage now would also increase. The barrage might get around 150,000 cusecs upstream in next few days. 
“Flows are also being released downstream Kotri Barrage,” said Haji Khan Jamali, Kotri Barrage chief engineer. Downstream flows at Kotri Barrage were only seen during flood season.
The barrage had been experiencing 70pc to 75pc irrigation water shortage until mid-May. The recent monsoon rains that had been reported almost across Sindh had forced irrigation authorities to close water flows or reduce levels in major canals. Sukkur Barrage’s canals, including Khairpur Feeder East and West, were closed. Rohri canal of was also closed.
Flows in Nara canal of Sukkur Barrage had been cut and likewise Rice’s water levels have been lowered. Right bank Rice canal was having 7,400 cusecs of flows on Sunday against 10,000 plus flows on Saturday. Canals like Nara and Rohri — considered longest in Sindh — feed left bank areas for cultivation of sugarcane, cotton, banana, mango orchards and wheat.
Similarly, Kirthar Canal (a second name of North Western Canal of Sukkur Barrage on right side of the barrage) was having reduced water flows now. It was having 6,500 cusecs flows on July 24 against 8,800 cusecs on July 23. Water storage in Tarbela Dam was improving as well. The storage level in the dam that serves as major source of water supply in Indus River stood at 1,507.19ft against its maximum storage of 1,550ft.
“Other than few specific areas, rains have been beneficial,” reacted Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB) vice president Mahmood Nawaz Shah. 
According to his assessment in the wake of recent rainfall in Sindh, of major Kharif crops, cotton was most vulnerable. “Current picking will be effected if rains stay around 70mm to 80mm,” he said.
He added that if weather improves, cotton will survive. He also discussed cotton crop’s price offered to growers who had been blaming cotton ginning factory owners for intentionally offering lower cotton crop rates to farmers. 
“Price of cotton has been artificially brought down to Rs4,500 from Rs9,600 even though recent massive devaluation should have resulted in increase in price,” he said.
The ongoing water flows availability, he explained, would facilitate paddy sowing although these were belated flows. He said that onion sowing season was severely affected in Tando Allahyar, Matiari, Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas districts. 
“Current rise in availability of water flows to 300,000 cusecs plus post Taunsa would help in sustaining delta, refresh aquifer and improve environment,” he said.
Even Balochistan irrigation department has asked Sukkur Barrage authorities to reduce its flows in North Western Canal from currently 1,860 cusecs to 1,000 cusecs due to on-going spell of monsoon rains there. In addition to Pat Feeder, Balochistan gets water flows from North Western (Kirthar Canal) RD-102 through Garang regulator.

In a statement, SUP chairman and Sindh Action Committee convener Syed Jalal Mahmood Shah said that after the “blackmailing” of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan in the federal government, the implementation of an agreement between MQM-P and Pakistan Peoples Party had started.
“In the first phase, the local government elections have been postponed and in the second phase, on the request of the MQM-P, Muhammad Waseem has been appointed as the SPSC chairperson,” he said.
He said that the Supreme Court had questioned transparency in the SPSC affairs, while the National Accountability Bureau had also inquired into several matters. 
“The merit of Sindh was killed by changing the Sindh Public Service Commission to the Peoples Party Service Commission and by giving hundreds of jobs against merit,” he lamented.
Mr Shah said that Mr Waseem had been appointed to share jobs between MQM-P and PPP. “There is no prejudice between Urdu and Sindhi speakers, but the jobs in Sindh should be given on merit and not on political grounds,” he demanded.
He warned that his party would lodge a strong protest if the jobs were given on political grounds.
