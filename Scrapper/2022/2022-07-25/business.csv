0,Spoiling the gig economy party,Recurring fuel rate shocks not only disproportionately burden riders but also put in question the future of logistics companies.,"Tough political decisions or not, the steep upwards adjustment in fuel prices over the last few months has made life difficult for everyone, as the hike has further passed on to other goods and services and made everything more expensive. But it has especially hit gig workers whose entire livelihoods revolve around it.
Over the past few years, a flurry of transport and logistics startups — from mobility to delivery — have sprung up in Pakistan. Including the now-shut Airlift’s and currently operational Krave Mart’s investments, these players have raised a cumulative $208.5 million since 2019. Usually, the model is to leverage a fleet of ‘independent contractors’ who help move goods and people.
In mobility, the companies take a certain commission of around 20 per cent while delivery players often pay their riders on a per-order basis, which depends on a host of factors. Whatever it is, the recent fuel hikes have made it difficult for gig workers to get by.
“I need to fill the tank with petrol plus basic maintenance costs. Meanwhile, the company is giving me a fuel allowance of just Rs4,700 for the whole month after a recent revision. That not only fails to cover my petrol costs but also ignores the overall increase in inflation of other items that we have to bear now,” says a Foodpanda rider. “My income, all included, is about Rs16,000 weekly if I work 12 hours a day on average,” he adds.

Recurring fuel rate shocks not only disproportionately burden riders but also put in question the future of companies operating in the logistics space

This is despite the fact that the company has consistently raised its delivery charges, which are usually in excess of Rs100 now. While that could be the phasing out of discounted prices and not necessarily fuel cost adjustment, the impact has not entirely passed on to the riders even as customers are paying more.
“In these difficult economic circumstances, we have tried to support our rider communities through increasing payouts and fuel cost pass-through to cover the increase in operational costs. We continue to monitor the situation proactively and regularly engage with our riders to ensure we support them effectively and continue to provide a seamless platform experience to our customers and vendors,” said Farhan Khan, Director of Operations, Foodpanda Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Bykea has revised its pricing upwards in view of the changes in petrol rates. Since the company operates on a commission model, the per-order charges don’t really apply and the higher fares mean its riders’ gross income has been increased at least, in addition to bonuses.
But the startup is faced with its own troubles: higher fares have hit demand. According to a well-placed source, the overall industry volumes for mobility and deliveries are down around 15pc though a more accurate picture will be known from August when the effect of monsoon and Eid is not a factor. This is on top of the underlying shift that’s currently taking place in the mobility market, where incumbents are being given a run for their money by a new entrant, InDriver. Estimates from an industry insider suggest the latter has grabbed up to 70pc of the market share in the car category.
Data from Appfigures also shows a dismal picture for Uber and Careem, whose cumulative downloads across platforms in June were less than 60pc of what InDriver managed. The Russian-born, and now California headquartered, mobility company has been aggressively grabbing the market in Pakistan since March 2021, right after raising its $150m Series C.
For over a year, it charged the supply-side absolutely no commission and deals only in cash, making it a lucrative offer for drivers. Now it has entered the bike category, creating another headache for Bykea.
On the other side of the spectrum, e-commerce fulfilment players are also in a tough spot due to higher fuel prices. They have been able to pass only a fraction of the impact to their customers, meaning the already thin margins are being squeezed further. Reports of a slowdown in online shopping have been doing the rounds and it’s not just anecdotal.
In fact, data shows a slowdown even before the spike in petrol price. As per State Bank’s Payments Systems Review, the total e-commerce transactions fell to 9.1 million in Q3FY22, down 33pc compared to 13.1m in Q2FY22 — making it the first time in six quarters that volumes declined. These are just the card-based numbers and the impact could be even higher for cash orders.
All of this brings us back to how fundamental macro problems can spoil the party for everyone. Recurring fuel rate shocks have not only disproportionately burdened the gig workers who struggle to make ends meet with the compensation paid out to them, but also put in question the future of companies operating in the space as the economics of logistics continuously worsens. Someone has to pay the price from the pocket, whether it’s a customer, rider, investor or taxpayer.

"
1,Return of the Zambad,Many families are supported by the tacitly allowed increase in fuel smuggling from Iran into Balochistan.,"It is a common sight in Balochistan’s Panjgur district: a convoy of distinctively blue, medium-sized pickup trucks snaking through the desolate terrain, carrying a deadly cargo of contraband petrol and diesel. They rumble through Damag pass, cutting through the mountain ranges in tehsil Pharom near the Pakistan-Iran border, to make their way home with what is the only means of sustenance for entire communities. These blue trucks are known locally as ‘Zambad’ — a reference to their capacity to carry outsized loads. They are the unlikely symbols of an entire grey economy — the transport of choice for smugglers operating fuel routes between Iran and Pakistan.
Over the years, the fencing of the Pakistan-Iran border and checkpoints raised by over-zealous Frontier Corps (FC) personnel had made it increasingly difficult for Zambad drivers to make a living. On paper, the restrictions on ‘importing’ Irani fuel are still very much in place. However, most on-ground hurdles have quietly been removed. In background interviews, officials in the Makran division explained that the local administration had come to realise that fuel smuggling was the only way of putting bread on the table for a major chunk of the population residing in five towns bordering the province.
And so, the Zambads were allowed back on the highways. You’ll see them zipping around, carrying stacks of 60-litre jerry cans full of highly combustible petroleum tied down willy-nilly with nylon rope.
One Zambad driver — Nasir Baloch, father of three — transports smuggled fuel from Damag in Panjgur to Surab, a town that serves as a key hub for the distribution of Iranian petrol to the rest of the province.

Many families are supported by the tacitly allowed increase in fuel smuggling from Iran into Balochistan

“Unlike in the past, we no longer face many difficulties in the transportation of oil,” Mr Baloch recently told Dawn over the phone. He sounded jubilant, even ecstatic. His happiness was due to Pakistani petrol prices sky-rocketing to around Rs250 a litre at the time, while Iranian petrol was still retailing for Rs200 a litre.
“We are being paid handsomely these days. Demand for our petrol has increased manifold,” he explained.
“I have been transporting oil for several years now,” Mr Baloch continued. “When I started, I did not own a vehicle. Today, I have my own. It [the work] is more than enough for me to support my family. In fact, I support my siblings in Panjgur too.”
The Zambad he drives was manufactured by the Zamyad Company in Tehran. As are all other Zambads. They are, in fact, a licensed version of the Nissan Junior — but that name never stuck. Since they are all non-custom paid vehicles — there is, after all, little point in registering a smuggling aide — there has been no official count of their numbers. It has been estimated that it may run in the thousands. Each costs several hundred thousand rupees.
Turning a blind eye
On a trip to the Makran division, which comprises the districts of Panjgur, Kech and Gwadar, it became clear to this correspondent that there is little objection, official or unofficial, to the illicit petroleum flowing in freely from Iran.
“We know their [smugglers’] stoves are burning because of this business. It is impossible to stop oil and diesel smuggling from Iran,” a senior official in Kech told Dawn. He requested anonymity as he is expected not to comment on the illicit trade happening right under his nose.
“Every day, to our knowledge, about 1,500 vehicles bring oil and diesel from Iran to the Makran division. It engages the youth in economic activity, and it has the potential to keep them from taking up arms in this already volatile region.”
Security analysts agree. They argue that this is a far better occupation for youth than the insurgency raging on for over two decades in the province.
A necessary evil
Ever since the US imposed sanctions on Iran in 2013 to choke its oil exports, the smuggling of petroleum products has become almost an industry in Balochistan’s small economy.
During a recent visit to Quetta, economist Dr Kaiser Bengali shared his thoughts on the matter. Sitting behind a laptop, he stopped typing when posed with the question of what should be done about the oil being smuggled in from Iran.
“It should be allowed,” he started. “And not just the oil: many things of comparatively better quality make their way to Balochistan because they’re coming in from Iran. Instead of banning or preventing trade in these goods, they should be taxed, especially the oil and edible items.”
Though both Pakistani and Iranian authorities agree — they had finalised a draft for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two countries back in 2017 — US sanctions have pushed the Pakistani side to put the matter on the backburner.
Mr Bengali is of the opinion that, despite sanctions, trade, including in oil, remains possible between the two countries and ought to be legalised as well. As for the FTA, he asserts: “There should be an FTA not only with Iran but Afghanistan as well. The three countries should secure an FTA in the greater interest of the region.”
When such a trade agreement will be officialised is the least of Nasir Baloch’s concerns. He’s presently over the moon over his own booming oil trade with Iran. “I wonder why the officials ever wanted to restrict it. It supports tens of thousands of people in Balochistan,” he said. He addressed a final request to higher authorities before hanging up.
“Let us do this so that we can continue to feed our families.”

2,Defeating the qabza mafia,The real estate market can be built by removing the outdated FBR and DC rates.,"Real estate has become everybody’s favourite whipping boy, regarded as a parking place for black money and a playground for the qabza mafia with little or no knowledge on the subject. It is seen as a Ponzi scheme that markets have created. Yet when you begin to understand the problem, we see it is a mess created by flawed government policy made in a fragmented fashion by various layers of bureaucracy.
The government has done everything possible to ensure that the real estate market does not develop. And it continues to do so.
Why do we have a broken pricing system? Decades ago, unable to track prices, the District Collector (DC) announced a price that obviously was difficult to adjust as rapidly as the market moved. When the static DC rate is outstripped by the market rate by a huge margin and becomes obsolete, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) jumps into announcing prices which it tries to adjust unsuccessfully. Both rates are different from the market rate at which transactions take place.
Why we persist with these prices at a time when market rates are easy to reveal with some technology is astonishing, to say the least! With these rates, the government has clearly announced that all properties will be registered at the lower DC rate as it is a recognised government rate.

The real estate market can be built by removing the outdated FBR and DC rates

It is the government-announced rate, and it is accepted for property transactions. Since taxes are charged at the (lower) registration rate why would a buyer not register at the DC rate? Therefore, the announcement of the DC rate or FBR rate readily develops “black market” flows.
Why do the rates persist? Real estate transactions are subjected to four types of taxes: the provincial government collects “stamp duty” and “capital value tax”, while the federal government collects “capital gain tax” and “withholding or advance tax”. Therefore, provincial governments use the DC rate to calculate the tax liabilities and the federal government uses FBR valuation rates for taxes falling under its jurisdiction. Amazing and confusing!
So why not abolish the DC and the FBR rates? Pure inertia.
Why not just allow the rate at which the transaction takes place to be announced? They say it is because people will under-report the transaction. These days very simple mechanisms will allow
information to be fully revealed allowing us to abolish both the DC rate and the FBR rate and bring some sanity to the real estate market.
Miftah Ismail the current finance minister, in his last tenure, did develop one such method. He announced that if the government found some transactions to be under-reported, it would step in and buy the property at that price. Simple deterrent to underreporting.
Why do we have no information on real estate availability and sales anywhere in the country? The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) has found that information is limited to brokers and brokers only know of a limited amount of inventory in their area. Both the buyer and the seller are at a disadvantage, leaving critical information in the hands of the broker and his insiders. But the government does not allow the data at which property is transacted to be revealed.
Twentieth-century experiments with price controls and socialism showed that market rates fluctuate substantially, and administrators are incapable of setting such prices with any level of accuracy. A large amount of evidence is available on this issue. Sadly, we continue to set prices for real estate to confuse both policy and the market.
A report published by PIDE shows that the real estate market, the investors’ favourite market, has been destroyed because of poorly conceived government interventions such as the DC rate and the FBR rate and the government’s penchant for secret transactions. Instead of solving the problem, we are building a Real Estate Regulatory authority to collect a further 0.5 per cent tax from real estate transactions! And why not? More government jobs for the boys!
A PIDE study also proposes a solution to this problem which is the introduction of listing all transactions on a national internet portal and developing an auction market for revealing prices. The suggested approach is:

Abolish the DC and FBR rates
All properties for sale to be sold must be advertised on a portal for all to see
Once the contract has been settled, it must be listed on the exchange for at least 2 weeks — called the contract period — before the transfer can take place,
The contract period will allow an auction market to happen
All registered buyers on the portal can now outbid the contract with better terms on price maturity and deposit
Deposits must be held in escrow and forfeited in the case of noncompliance
Legal transfer by the local authorities will only happen at the price determined by auction on the exchange and after the listing period has been certified to be completed.

This simple approach will solve the problems of the real estate market and satisfy all except the qabza mafia and the few who benefit from the current government-created mess. Where and who will look at such simple solutions in a hyperpolitical and uber-VIP approach to policy?

3,Is the rupee too weak to recover?,"The currency’s value will continue to be determined essentially based on forex demand and supply, which the SBP can influence.","


 
In the absence of enough forex reserves, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) may only continue watching from the sidelines as the rupee falls from one all-time low to another over the past few months, and most recently during the week that ended on July 22.
Meanwhile, growing political instability becomes the springboard of all kinds of speculations against the rupee’s health as well as Pakistan’s prospects of dodging what to some sceptics appears to be an “imminent” threat of defaulting on sovereign loans.
In addition to political instability, structural weaknesses of the external sector, higher global prices of fuel and food commodities, the rise of the US dollar against major currencies, geopolitical challenges facing Pakistan and the delay in the revival of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) lending, all played their part in making the rupee weak and vulnerable to speculation-driven attacks.
The rupee lost 8.25 per cent of its value against the US dollar within a week: it closed to an all-time low of 228.36 per dollar on 22nd July from 210.95 per dollar on 15th July. This massive decline in the rupee’s value within a week, in line with the ongoing trend, is bound to fuel inflation further and upset all earning/spending projections of households and businesses alike. Prominent business lobbies, including the Pakistan Business Council, urge politicians to agree upon a five-year economic reforms agenda to ensure and defend the economic sovereignty of the country.

The currency’s value will continue to be determined essentially based on forex demand and supply, which the SBP can influence only with support from the IMF or friendly countries

But the high drama played in the elections of the chief minister of Punjab on July 22 indicates politics in Pakistan may remain oblivious to the gravity of multiple economic challenges facing the country.
Between April 7 (when the then Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted from power) and July 22, the rupee lost 21.3pc value against the US dollar both due to yawning trade deficit and the growing political instability and uncertainty.
Now, the key question is how long will the rupee continue to decline?
Nobody can answer this question. Not even the government of Pakistan, nor the SBP. Things will become a bit clear when the IMF’s board will hopefully approve the revival of its lending programme and release about $1.17 billion for Pakistan, sometime in the first half of August. Even before that China, Saudi Arabia or the UAE may consider placing a few billion dollars funds in the SBP account as Pakistan has already reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF and only its formal approval from the IMF’s board is awaited.
If that happens and our forex reserves are augmented substantially that may create room for the central bank to lend “limited” support to the rupee. (SBP’s forex reserves gradually fell to $9.328bn on 15th July (or equal to one-and-a-half month of goods imports) from $11.425bn at the end of March 2022).
In a market-driven exchange rate regime that Pakistan is currently pursuing and that is being “watched” closely by the IMF, the SBP cannot keep the rupee’s value artificially high. All it can do is to “smoothen out extreme volatilities”. This means that the SBP can sell dollars into the market when the high demand for the greenback causes the rupee to lose too much value in a single trading session or a couple of consecutive sessions. This also means that the amount of the dollars thus pumped into the market will have to be bought back by the SBP at the end of the month or the end of a quarter in exceptional cases.
This means that the rupee’s value will continue to be determined essentially based on forex demand and supply, even if it keeps licking one all-time low after another during a certain period of high political instability, and eventually, it can regain its lost value if and whenever forex supplies in the market improve substantially.
That takes us back to the structural causes of our Balance of Payments (BoP) weaknesses. In our balance of payments, the two main non-debt-creating sources of forex inflows are (1) remittances and (2) exports of goods and services. And our two main sources of outflows of foreign exchange are (1) imports of goods and services and (2) external debt servicing.
It doesn’t take a genius to understand that if our total import bill of goods and services continues to eat up more than 90pc of the forex earnings through remittances, total exports and foreign investment then what will be left to service external debt? Almost nothing. That means the government will continue to borrow through foreign debt in any form —sovereign funds, international commercial loans and most importantly BoP support fund from the IMF just to avoid external loan default and to keep the central bank’s forex reserves at a comfortable level ie equal to three months’ imports of goods.
Between July 2021 and May 2022, Pakistan’s total import bill of goods and services stood at ($65.462bn + $10.284) $75.746bn, according to the SBP. Against this, our forex earnings from remittances and exports of goods and services totalled ($28.410bn+$29.333bn+$6.318bn) $64.061bn. Now, do we need any other evidence of what is the actual problem with Pakistan’s external sector?
For a long time to come, the country may have to continue external borrowings, just to retire or service old external debts and to keep bare minimum forex reserves with the SBP. Sadly, a sharp — and sustainable— rupee recovery may remain elusive in near future.

4,Punjab's wheat worries,The Punjab wheat worries have a bad habit of not only renewing themselves periodically but getting complex as well.,"

A worker carries a sack of wheat flour outside a store in Sheikhupura.

 
The Punjab wheat worries have a bad habit of not only renewing themselves periodically but getting complex as well. With the early release of official wheat eating up to 20 per cent of stock even when the historical start time of release season is still more than a month away, it is time for the government to recalculate its earlier calculated risks and also assess emerging ones. The Food Department is doing exactly that.
Its earlier calculations were: Punjab had procured 4.5 million tonnes of wheat this year, with a carry-over of 700,000 tonnes — thus arriving at a total of 5.2m tonnes. It added 1m tonnes to its earlier target of 3.5m tonnes as additional security for the year at a time when imports are expected to be costly, as well as with procedural hiccups because of the war in the Black Sea region that meets 80pc of Pakistan’s requirements. So, a million tonnes addition was made as insurance for the year.
Its yearly calculations concluded that it needs 6m tonnes to safely sail through the season, thus facing a deficit of 0.8m tonnes for which it placed a demand for a million-tonne share of imported wheat.
Before that, Punjab tried to convince the Pakistan Agriculture Services and Storage Corporation (Passco) to sell one million tonnes of its local stocks: it thought that the local supply would not have quality issues like the imported commodity and would also be time- and cost-effective. The latest agreement, as revealed by the Food Department officials, is that Passco will provide half a million tonnes of imported and half local wheat.

The complexity of sufficient procurement continues with the early release of the staple in Punjab and the four different prices at which it can be bought

However, these calculations went askew when the new Punjab government, which took over on April 30, ordered the immediate and subsidised release of wheat. The millers normally grind private purchases for the first four months before knocking on official doors in September.
With official releases starting in mid-May this year at a rate of 16,000 tonnes a day (or roughly 425,000 a month), the first three months have so far cost the Food Department around 1.2m tonnes — denuding it of the advantage it secured with one million tonnes of additional purchase. The department is now holding 4m tonnes and has nine full months to go before the next crop hits the market.
These nine months would also be increasingly drier ones, pushing daily releases beyond 25,000 tonnes a day, or around 600,000 tonnes a month. Punjab now thinks that its stocks may last till January, leaving the last three months of the season uncovered for the national staple.
These calculations were made on paper which did not cover contingencies like an earlier release, routine slippages through provincial and national borders and hoarders’ behaviour and capacity in a scarcity situation. These enervating possibilities, even probabilities, are adding to uncertainties.
Stakeholders are nervous especially since Pakistan’s wheat is relatively cheaper compared to the international price and hence the risk of it finding its way to neighbouring countries, especially Afghanistan, is very high — stretching to the extent of certainty. If Pakistan, or any of its federating units like Punjab, keeps releases high, the chances of slippages will only increase and add volatility to the market.
Another layer of explosive instability is going to be the price factor. At present, three different prices are operating in the market, which are going to be four shortly. Punjab is releasing wheat at a rate of Rs1,665 per maund, under a subsidy package. It purchased this wheat at Rs2,200 per maund — subsidising each maund by Rs535 and burdening the provincial exchequer every day.
Beyond this officially-subsidised regime, wheat is trading at Rs3,000 per maund in the open market, and, if the millers are to be trusted, increasing by the week. On the third plank is imported wheat, which will cost anything between Rs3,500 to Rs4,000 per maund. According to market calculations, imported wheat would entail a Rs50-60 billion subsidy for every million tonnes if it has to be brought down to the level of local wheat price (without subsidy). If any government wants to subsidise it, an additional amount would be required.
At what rate would Punjab make normal releases in the next month or so, introducing a fourth price in the market? How to equalise them all? No one knows exactly or has the financial capacity to do so. This situation will continue dogging the market for the rest of the season because the gap between the three prices is beyond the financial capacity of any player — be it federal or provincial or both joining hands.
The gap in prices also reflects confusion at the policy level or incorrect preferences that add to the unpredictability of the market. Take the example of Punjab’s policy on wheat where the preference for releasing wheat below the purchase price has not been limited to any one government: everyone has done it and left the department holding and servicing a Rs621bn baby — the current food circular debt that Punjab owes.
Despite this staggering cost, the policy continues: “Since the Food Department loan comes from a consortium of banks, not the provincial exchequer, every new government finds it easy to enjoy this free and popular lunch and leave the bill on the table. If it was financed through the provincial kitty, the government would have to pay or divert its resources to finance wheat purchase or release.
“The present rate of Rs1,665 per maund has been approved by the Punjab cabinet. It approved this below the purchase price exactly at a time when it was assailing the previous federal government for selling petrol at lower than the purchase price — terming it an economic landmine for its government,” an official of the Punjab Food Department points out.
In final words, one can say that though it is a combination of local and international factors, which are essentially beyond the control of the government, affect supply and price, Pakistan makes matters worst through policy failure and governance crisis — and hapless Pakistanis pay the price.

7,Findex 2021 — where does Pakistan stand?,"Despite notable progress, gaps persist for financial inclusion relative to peer countries.","


 
The fourth wave of the global Findex survey was released last week by the World Bank to much anticipation and suspense. Unlike previous rounds which were released every third year, this fourth dataset has been unveiled after a gap of four years; an unusual delay caused by the onset of the global pandemic in 2020.
For those who may not be aware, the Findex provides the single largest comparable dataset measuring progress on key financial inclusion metrics across 124 countries. Its wide-ranging acceptability was demonstrated at the launch of this latest edition with a high-profile panel discussion moderated by David Malpass, President of the World Bank and a keynote address by HM Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, who is the UN Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development.
Headline findings show significant global progress on financial inclusion: Worldwide account ownership increased to 76 per cent from 51pc since 2011. Significantly, the survey also reports a narrowing gender gap (from 9 percentage points to 6) in account ownership.
Survey findings reveal an increase in the proportion of adults opting to place their savings with a formal financial institution, averaging 58pc of all adults in high-income economies and 25pc in developing economies. In addition to these top-line numbers, survey findings show significant momentum in the uptake of digital financial services, driven during these last four years largely by the pandemic.

Despite notable progress, gaps persist for financial inclusion relative to peer countries

Individuals in developing countries receiving digital payments directly into their accounts increased from 35pc in 2014 to 57pc in 2021. For developing countries (excluding China), 40pc of adults who made digital merchant payments did so for the first time after the start of the pandemic.
The survey also provides insights on quick wins and persisting gaps. This wave estimates that 39pc of adults opened their first account specifically to receive a wage payment or receive money from the government. Digitising government payments, especially, have yielded wide-ranging benefits: the report states that a 47pc reduction in internal fraud and leakage from pension payments was observed in India after these payments were disbursed via biometric smart cards instead of in cash.
While recipients benefited by receiving more money because of reduced fraud, the government saved millions of dollars annually in administrative costs.
The Findex report also discloses that 11pc of surveyed adults received payments for the sale of agricultural products but only one-fourth of this respondent group received payment into an account. In South Asia, only 2pc of adults selling agri produce received such payment into an account.
In contrast, several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa saw a much higher share of recipients receiving agricultural payments into accounts, including 63pc in Kenya, 39pc in Mali and 35pc in Uganda ie, more than 10pc of all adults in each of these three countries (most often into a mobile money account).
The survey also reveals that two-thirds of unbanked adults said that if they opened an account (excluding mobile money) at a financial institution, they could not use it without help. Women are 7 percentage points more likely than men to need help using their mobile money account.
Thus, as substantial progress has been achieved against topline metrics, several countries have succeeded in establishing a bedrock from which additional benefits (simultaneous use of multiple financial services, more people opting to place savings in formal financial institutions, improved cash management, etc) are already emerging.
With these achievements, the recommendations accompanying this edition indicate a heightened focus on consumer education, awareness raising and protection to ensure that the momentum is not only sustained but remains intact with a focus on building customer wellbeing via a more nuanced approach to financial inclusion.
Delving deeper into the report, numerous Pakistan-specific findings are also available, a number of which are rather humbling. Although an increase of 10 percentage points has occurred over the last decade in account ownership (up to 21pc from 11pc in 2011), the number signals a still-faraway-goalpost, when benchmarked to the average of 71pc for developing countries.
Improvement is also evident in the financial inclusion of women, which has increased to 13pc from 6pc in 2017, but when viewed against the estimates for our neighbours (Bangladesh at 43pc, India at 78pc, Sri Lanka at 89pc and Nepal at 50pc, the progress again seems lacklustre.
A double-digit gender gap in account ownership still persists in Pakistan, with no difference in the proportion of male and female account ownership reported for both India and Sri Lanka.
To enable deeper insight into the issues that continue to plague financial inclusion in Pakistan, Karandaaz is in the process of developing a multidimensional index on Financial Inclusion and will also be undertaking in 2022 the seventh edition of a survey on the subject which will provide additional statistics on provincial level gaps.
There is no doubt about the persisting gaps in financial inclusion in Pakistan. Not only is Pakistan lagging behind global and regional averages, but also against self-selected targets specified under the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS).
The updated NFIS targets the achievement of 50pc financial inclusion by 2023 driven by the enhanced use of digital payments, digitisation of all government-to-person payments and receipts, an enhanced GDP-to-deposit ratio of 55pc and extending enhanced financing to small and medium enterprises (700,000) and farmers (6 million farmers).
The NFIS also estimated that achievement of these targets would yield benefits in the form of 3m additional jobs and $5.5 billion in export earnings via SMEs — both of which constitute a dire need in the current economic scenario.
The Findex serves as a powerful reminder of the persisting gaps against these targets and the need to keep financial inclusion front and centre in public policy. It also provides a wealth of information on regions and countries that can be studied more carefully to see how progress was achieved.
It is hoped all relevant stakeholders will take note of these statistics and pour their energies into fixing the issues, rather than contesting numbers we do not like.

8,Wasting waste and recycling potential,"One of the world’s largest dumping grounds, Pakistan lacks the capacity to safely process hazardous garbage","


 
Pakistan, like other developing countries, lacks a waste management infrastructure, which is increasingly creating serious environmental and public health problems. Not only does the country generate an unmanageable amount of solid waste every day but worryingly, has become the world’s foremost dumping ground of hazardous waste materials. Against this backdrop, the approval of the National Waste Management Policy 2022 by the Ministry of Climate Change is a creditable development, however, it needs some realistic considerations.
Pakistan is already incapable to manage its own waste, generated locally. The country annually produces 30 million tonnes of solid waste and much of it doesn’t reach final disposal sites. This generated waste should wind up in landfills, incinerators or recycling centres, but it is collected mostly by scavengers who segregate it according to their own interests before bringing it to disposal points.
Besides, only a handful of cities have established landfill sites to dispose of waste collection, while all semi-urban, rural and northern regions lack facilities to optimise waste collection and treat it properly.
Clearly, we are unable to manage locally generated waste, but more disturbingly have been made a dumping ground for global hazardous waste. According to Volza’s global import data of material waste, “Pakistan is the largest importer of material waste, which accounts for 58 shipments followed by Ireland with 47 and Sweden with 42 shipments till June 26, 2022.”

One of the world’s largest dumping grounds, Pakistan lacks the capacity to safely process hazardous garbage

Recently the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change has been briefed that the United Kingdom alone dumped nearly 40,000 tonnes of waste in Pakistan last year, a country which lacks the capacity to separate regular and hazardous waste, resulting in serious environmental and health concerns. Other than that, 25,000 tonnes came from Iran and nearly 20,000 tonnes from the UAE.
Despite being a signatory to the Basel Convention, Pakistan is being used by developed nations as a dumping ground for over 80,000 tons of electronic and plastic waste, which creates environmental and health hazards. Since recycling e-waste requires higher costs, developed countries tend to dump their waste in underdeveloped countries.
American, European and even Asian countries are using Pakistan to dump used computers and old electronics. And, due to improper disposal in the country, metals like lead, mercury and copper find their way into ground water and soil by leaching through the landfills.
Hazardous wastes are dangerous materials that could be toxic, ignitable, corrosive and reactive. They can take the form of solids, liquids, sludge and contained gasses, generated primarily by chemical production, manufacturing and other industrial activities. Examples include asbestos, hospital waste, electronics including computers, TVs, cell phone batteries, mercury-containing wastes such as thermometers, fluorescent lighting, switches, pesticides, cleaning and polishing chemicals, motor oils, kerosene, petrol, aerosols, propane cylinders, solvent-based paints.
No doubt there is a big untapped potential in our recycling industry to turn waste into profitable products. However, waste collection is an informal and unregulated sector in Pakistan. Factories here lack formal facilities, technology and technical knowledge of recyclability, that’s why are mostly incapable of producing sustainable recycled products.
Most of the waste, especially electronic, is used by the recycling industries in Karachi, Lahore, Sialkot, Gujranwala and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. These recycling industries extract metals such as gold, copper, and aluminium from the imported waste and then let the rest be dumped anywhere untreated.
Pakistan is also importing plastic waste which even includes contaminated and hazardous hospital waste, sewage pipes, hazardous PVC scrap along with a plethora of other toxic waste without conducting any laboratory tests. While almost most countries are banning the import of plastic scrap, Pakistan is one of the few still allowing it.
Prioritising the trapping of imported hazardous waste materials, the Minister of Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman points out “our country has been importing all kinds of bundled waste from different parts of the world with an average annual tonnage of 80,000. To tackle this, we have devised a long-overdue policy.”
Since the federal cabinet approved the National Hazardous Waste Management Policy 2022 with consensus, it will be passed on to the provinces and implemented at the federal level for international compliance. The policy hasn’t been made public so far. However, a specialised directorate for managing hazardous waste is said to be established in the ministry to implement all the relevant provisions of the policy.
The primary and significant task of the National Hazardous Waste Management Policy is to reduce the negative impact of waste mismanagement on the environment, economy and society. But it isn’t achievable without synergy among local, provincial and national efforts, plans and programmes in implementing waste management policies.
The collection, treatment and disposal of waste material have been causing significant harm to human health and the environment. And, we need to get serious about managing this waste, tracking, separating and then treating it sustainably, instead of the unscientific and unregulated manner it has been handled over the years.

9,The palm oil trifecta,Environmental sustainability is not an active part of the narrative for emerging markets. In developing countries...,"


 
Environmental sustainability is not an active part of the narrative for emerging markets. In developing countries where human rights atrocities are swept under the rug, taking care of the environment is not high up the totem pole.
While in Pakistan, all trees are good trees, palm oil plantations have been accused of deforestation which endangers habitats of flora, fauna and animals. The charge of pollution has also been laid at its door since palm oil diesel releases up to three times as many emissions compared to traditional petroleum-based fuel.
The EU is a major importer of palm oil, and as a bloc made of developed nations, cares about sustainability a whole lot. Since it is making efforts to source fuel sustainably, palm oil by-products are not acceptable, a case that is being duelled out in the World Trade Organisation.
Though Indonesia is the biggest palm oil exporter, the forces behind it are Malaysian and Singaporean private investors with connections with Indonesian authorities. According to one estimate, Malaysian and Singaporean investors control two-thirds of Indonesia’s crude oil production.
While palm trees are grown in Malaysia and Indonesia, Singapore’s financial institutions are among the biggest lenders and investors in the palm oil industry. Singapore is also home to numerous palm oil companies including some of the largest in the world, making it a centre for oil refining globally. This is represented in Pakistan’s FY22 palm oil imports of which 48pc stem from Indonesia, 17pc from Malaysia and 34pc from Singapore.
Simple demand and supply dynamics indicate that if the EU imports less palm oil, its price will spiral down. Given the current $3bn plus bill, it is good news for Pakistan regardless of which country it imports from.

10,Unease about supply-side inflation,Prominent economists criticise measures that increase interest rates rather than address real causes of core issues,"If a problem is not properly diagnosed, the remedy to the ailment cannot be correctly identified. For example, if runaway inflation is to be tackled effectively, the first thing to do is to determine its real cause. It would be in the fitness of things to look at what certain prominent international and Pakistani economists have to say on the issue.
Inflation is on the supply side and the policymakers should look there for solutions, says Nobel Laureate Economist Joseph E. Stiglitz. He argues that the US economy needs supply-side interventions rather than interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve which, he adds, would fail to bring inflation under control.
Mr Stiglitz is convinced that interest rate hikes by central banks are not going to solve the problem of inflation as it is not going to create more food. Instead, it is going to make it more difficult because you aren’t going to make investments. He insists that food production should be a priority for the US and globally.
At least try to do everything we can globally to increase supply; supply is going to do more in dealing with the problem that causes depression. We should pursue policies that tax the rich and benefit working people who are the worst affected in any economic downturn.

Prominent economists criticise measures that increase interest rates rather than address real causes of core issues

While some supply side shortages were anticipated in the global economy after Covid-19 lockdowns, Mr Stiglitz points out that they have proved more pervasive and less transitory than had been hoped. A World Bank study predicts that inflation will persist globally for the next three years due to high fuel, food and fertiliser prices.
Though looking at things from a different perspective, another Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman fears “the US Federal Reserve would itself be bullied into hiking rates too much and produce a gratuitous recession.”
And Project Syndicate quotes Professor of History and International Relations at Princeton University Harold James saying how the episodes of price instability can both reflect and accelerate systematic breakdown.
Certain Pakistani economists also hold similar views. A leading country analyst notes that the country is facing two types of inflationary pressures. One, ‘imported inflation’ owing to the rise in prices of global energy and palm oil. Two, ‘cartel pricing’ in the domestic market. He notes the government has no control over ‘imported inflation’ but hasn’t done a thing to break the ‘pricing power’ of domestic cartels,
And Dr Omer Javed argues that inflation as a supply-side phenomenon is a more dominant determinant in developing countries due to their relative lack of financialisation traditionally. Their greater reliance on imports of essential commodities like oil, food, machinery, etc means a greater role of imported/cost-push channel inflation in the wake of the global supply chain crisis.
Annual food inflation in Pakistan in June at 25.92 per cent was much higher than recorded for the same month in China (2.9pc), India (7.75pc) and Bangladesh (8.3 pc). The number one concern of the common citizen is food inflation and food insecurity.
On July 18, Moody’s Investors Service said the ‘elevated inflation and a higher cost of living are adding to social and political risks’ in Pakistan.
The modernisation, mechanisation and commercialisation of agriculture and rural industrialisation are moving at a snail’s pace, resulting in low farm productivity and food insecurity. To quote a Chinese diplomat, the overall level of mechanisation in ploughing, sowing and harvesting in his country has exceeded 72pc and wheat production has exceeded 97pc, indicating mechanisation in almost the entire wheat production process. And rural industries have been experiencing a boom.
Pakistan’s correspondent for the New York Times Salman Masood says the vote for PTI in Punjab by-elections was a “repudiation of the establishment and a reaction to the high fuel prices, inflation and grinding power outages”.
The situation has led to an intensive national debate on the proposed solar policy the government intends to announce on August 1. President Council of Social Sciences, Dr Pervez Tahir says banning new fossil fuel plants will demonstrate government commitment to the solar policy.
Moving away from fossil fuels is critical to laying down the infrastructural foundations of food security and planetary protection, says Tabinda Ashraf Shahid, editor of Scientific Investigations and Global Network of Scientists.
Simultaneously, Mr Tahir wrote, that a research and development unit along the lines of the Kahuta (nuclear) project should be set up for the low-cost and competitive manufacture of the entire range of solar equipment locally. This is essential as technological changes in this field are extremely rapid. He suggests that the work done at Lahore’s engineering university may guide this process. And this learning by doing should be supplemented by imitation through joint ventures with firms from China and other countries
Energy expert Syed Akhtar Ali hopes that the proposed solar policy would encourage both consumer-level and producer/supplier-level infrastructure. There is already a provision of 6,000MW in the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan 2021-30, which may be expanded. With special focus, Mr Ali estimates that 1,000MW can be added in the next 12 months; some capacity may come even earlier. He says solar costs less than Rs8-10 per kWh, adding that the average cost of supply will go down and the marginal cost will be further reduced.
Pakistan’s solar capacity is reportedly a mere 1.04pc of the total national capacity at 0.4GW compared with that of India’s solar capacity of 50GW which is 116 times more than Pakistan’s.

Stop self-sabotaging yourself
Have you ever had the feeling that you need to get out of your own way? Here are three self-sabotaging behaviours many people experience early in their careers and how to avoid them: 1) Crowing at the crack of dawn. Being confident is great, but being confident without being humble is a recipe for disaster. Learning to balance your confidence with modesty will make you stand out from your peers as “emotionally intelligent”. 2) Focusing on “the way it was” at a former job. Be mindful of your tone when pitching new solutions to old problems, particularly among more senior colleagues. Start by acknowledging that you’re new but that you have some ideas about the problem, and want to discuss them with someone more experienced. 3) Being overly agreeable. It’s natural to want to fit in with your new work culture. One way we fit in is to agree even when we don’t — and, this ultimately lead to groupthink and problems.

Billions of collectables
In 2019, Grant LaFontaine left his job at Facebook to start Whatnot with Head, hoping to offer collectors the chance to buy and sell baseball cards, rare toys, comic books and other coveted items in a live, interactive online setting where they could chat with each other and score new items for their collections. The three-year-old company has been growing quickly, and just raised another $260m in a Series D round. That brings its valuation to $3.7bn, more than double the $1.5bn it was valued at last year. The round took just seven days to come together, despite the market downtown and a pullback in venture capital funding. “We had this hypothesis that a new generation of collectors were entering the market,” said Mr LaFontaine, Whatnot’s CEO. “And we thought this generation, which grew up on an iPhone, was not going to be happy with the existing players because a lot of them hadn’t evolved.”

Afghanistan’s media blackout
Afghanistan’s media industry was one of the flagship achievements of the 20 years of US-led intervention in the country. Now, less than a year since the Taliban replaced the Western-backed government, there is little of it left, and even reporting on small, peaceful gatherings of women has become risky. Around 40pc of the country’s radio and television outlets and almost all newspapers have shut down, according to Nai, an Afghan nonprofit organization that trains journalists and supports media freedom. Thousands of journalists fled after the Taliban takeover. Some outlets are still willing to push the envelope. Tolo, the country’s leading broadcaster, in particular stands out, especially when it comes to covering women’s rights — one of the most sensitive issues in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.The risks range from phones or cameras being confiscated to being beaten or detained. When the Taliban took over Kabul last August, many expected Tolo’s days to be numbered. Fearing reprisal, some 90pc of it news staff was evacuated to the US and elsewhere.

ESG — three letters that won’t save the planet
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing is one of the hottest trends in finance. Companies are eager to tout their ESG credentials; investors who want to save the world buy ESG funds; asset managers charge higher fees for them. Yet the measure is incoherent, lumping together a dizzying array of objectives and offering no guide to trade-offs. Elon Musk is a corporate-governance nightmare, yet by popularising electric cars he helps fight climate change. Closing a coal mine is good for the environment, but awful for workers who are laid off. The measure needs to be simplified. Drop the S and the G, we argue, and shift the E from “environment” to “emissions”. If the measurement of firms’ carbon footprints were standardised, they would be easier to shrink.

12,The cost of political polarisation,"Without a national consensus on major economic decisions, Pakistan will continue spiralling down.","


 
Unnerved by the endless political chaos the traders, manufacturers and service providers decided to go public with their stance on the current economic meltdown. Mindful of the political sensitivities, many tempered their tones but recorded their disappointment with the government over the economic management, particularly the currency market.
Disregarding the political polarisation an elite business platform repeated its earlier call to all political parties for collective efforts to pull the economy out of the current abys and put it back on track.
Before the market could fully absorb the news of the International Monetary Fund agreement (IMF) on the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) that paved way for the disbursal of $1.17 billion, the rout of PML-N in the by-elections in Punjab and the re-election of Hamza Sharif as chief minister on technical grounds, drowned the hopes of political stability in the foreseeable future.
The by-election results last week kicked in a fresh spell of currency devaluation and another cycle of depression in the capital market. Playing on fears, manipulators drove the rupee to stoop to Rs228 to a dollar in the open market and the pushed capital market closed the week little above 40,000 points.

Without a national consensus on major economic decisions, Pakistan will continue spiralling down

Of the $6bn EFF ending in September 2022, Pakistan has so far received $3.1bn. To match the higher financing needs of Pakistan in 2022-23, the IMF has consented to consider an extension of the programme to June 2023 and increase the size of the package to $7bn. The forex reserves meanwhile depleted to a dangerously low level of $9.1bn.
The policy rate now at 15 per cent has yet to tame the galloping inflation currently at a record high level of over 20pc month-on-month as prices of transport and food soared by 60 and 40pc respectively over the last three months.
Some business leaders sounded alarmist but the majority were cautious in their choice of words. They advised the government to appoint the governor of the state bank (SBP) without loss of time for effective management of the currency market that they thought was at the mercy of rogue traders. Over the past three months, the rupee tumbled under the watch of the seemingly helpless SBP.
“No, governor State Bank has no magic wand to fix all the problems but letting manipulators enjoy a free hand in the currency market in the middle of an external front crisis is absurd. Everyone knows that the current exchange rate is unjustifiably low but can a government that fails to appoint an SBP governor in this grave situation inspire trust?” a business leader from Lahore shared his disgust.
Several leaders highlighted risks to different sectors and its snowball effects on employment and inflation. Irfan Iqbal, the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) president, sounded aggressive when he warned of a Sri Lanka-type outcome if rulers fail to put their act together and focus on the economy.
“No, I do not see Pakistan going the Sri Lanka way. Yes, the crisis is deep and the situation complex but it can still be redeemed. The government must do its part but I don’t think it can do it alone. The powerful business elite should trust Pakistan’s potential and lend a helping hand. Instead of fixating on margins and obsessing on ways to capitalise on the system’s weaknesses, it’s time for retrospection. Did we do our part — care for improving productivity or investing in the future?
“Please stop playing the market. The situation is precarious. The big businesses made fortunes in cement, steel, auto, pharma, fertiliser, sugar, banking, etc. A cement tycoon in a recent meeting at Karachi chamber mentioned a 60pc drop in sales but did not care to explain the increase in the price of his produce. To me, there is no justification for such a steep price hike. Such reckless moves further aggravate problems,” Majyd Aziz, former president of the Employers Federation and Karachi Chambers said lamenting the narrow-mindedness of the big and mighty in his community.
Responding to a question regarding what the Pakistan Business Council sees ahead, CEO Ehsan Malik wrote: “Speculating about where exactly the economy might be in a month’s time is alarmist and irresponsible.
It’s clear that the economy is not headed in the right direction.”
“Debating how we got here is less important. We have to arrest the free fall first and then strategise to revive the economy. If there is ever a time when all political parties need to unite, it is now. The country’s solvency and sovereignty are at stake. Our economic
survival calls for entering the IMF’s ‘Intensive Care Unit’. There are now no alternatives.
“The IMF’s help will help us survive, but not thrive. For growth, we need cross-party consensus on at least a 5-year programme of fundamental reforms: taxes, National Finance Commission, energy, state-owned enterprises, agriculture, water and exports. That leaves many areas where parties can differ.
“Starved of essential imports, the industry stands today on the verge of closures and layoffs. Unless all parties unite on a National Economic Agenda, the economy will not come out of a free fall spiral. Those at the bottom of the pyramid will suffer the most. Wake up and act.”
Ehsan Malik thinks that the real effective exchange rate is in the range of Rs95-105.

13,The ongoing pharma MNC exodus,"As the economic crisis worsens along with regulatory challenges, multinationals find it expedient to close shop","


 
A pharmacist sticks a piece of white tape on a medicine box. Coolly, he pens the price at which he will be selling the drugs.
The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) fixes the maximum retail price at which a medicine is allowed to sell officially. But there is nothing much stopping retailers from charging a higher price if market forces allow it, which they do.
Less compliant than their foreign counterparts, local companies find it easier to survive in Pakistan’s pharmaceutical sector while the multinational exodus has accelerated in recent years. Sanofi Aventis Pakistan limited has exited, selling its plant to local companies and Bayer is closing up shop as well, confirms Pharma Bureau Executive Director Ayesha Tammy Haq of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce & Industry.
Regime changes and the spiralling economic crisis have not been kind to the sector.

As the economic crisis worsens along with regulatory challenges, multinationals find it expedient to close shop

Sales tax saga
“Sales tax has not been reduced, sales tax has been imposed,” says Ms Haq, clearing up a misconception. “Previously, the pharmaceutical industry was exempted from sales tax. In January this year, PTI imposed 17 per cent sales tax solely for documentation purposes that was to be refunded in its entirety.” Hitherto, pharma did not pay sales tax on active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) or other raw materials, only on packaging materials.
As expected, the money has not been refunded causing cash flow problems. The current government reduced the 17pc (refundable tax) to 1pc non-refundable tax, imposed at different stages. So the ‘reduction’ in sales tax was leading to an increase of 6-9pc in cost which could not be passed on to the final consumer because of Drap’s restrictions.
This, along with the 4x increase in shipping charges and the continual devaluation of the rupee skyrocketed the price of APIs and other materials, jacking up costs for an industry that cannot officially pass the increase on to the consumer.
Hence, the friendly neighbourhood pharmacist and his handy white tape to increase the price because his margins are being squeezed by the companies.
The government has agreed that the situation is untenable for companies to operate in and has made the usual promises to fix the situation that had not been implemented till the writing of this article. If implemented, the 1pc sales tax on APIs will be scrapped. There is a refundable (for pharma companies only) 17pc tax on consumed excipients (binding agents, coating agents etc) because it is used for industries other than pharma as well. The tax on packaging continues as before.
At the cost of life-saving medicines
“The situation is really dire. There is no money in the economy and the amount of LCs [letter of credit] is restricted to $100,000 per day. So how do you import life-saving cancer drugs which are really expensive? There is no governor of State Bank,” says Ms Haq in exasperation, pointing out the need for monetary management of the economy.
“For god sake, we are bringing in medicines not luxury items like a car! You have to remove these restrictions,” she laments adding that the government is fabulous about hearing out their complaints but decidedly less so about implementing agreed-upon changes.
Not commenting on hoarding practices, Ms Haq said the MNCs were continuing to manufacture medicines without shortages, other than the usual quota issues.
“There was a dearth of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, stimulants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilisers) because it took so long for the government to release the quota that the industry did not have ingredients to make them; we go through this every single year. People weep and cry about shortages but nothing changes.”
Imported finished medicines face their own set of challenges since C&F [cost and freight] is 90pc of its cost. The pricing formula for finished medicines is C&F plus 40pc which gives the MRP of a drug, explains a local manufacturer.
That MRP includes the discount to retailers, transportation costs, warehousing, staff roll, etc. In the end, the margin is a measly 5pc which is eroded by currency fluctuations. Thus retailers increase the price at their discretion.
Created compliance challenges
“The bottlenecks for LCs have increased. Previously, what took two days is now taking over two weeks in the name of compliance,” says a local source requesting anonymity.
“Our supplier is in Dubai and our bank asked us to get passport copies of the owners,” he says. “The supplier thought we were crazy.” Allegedly, this is under the direction of State Bank which has requested banks to squeeze dollars going out.
