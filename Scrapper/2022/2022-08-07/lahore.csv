0,Kamran Afzal requests Centre to relieve him of Punjab CS post,"LAHORE: Finding it hard to come up to the expectations of the PTI-PML-Q coalition government, Punjab Chief Secretary...","LAHORE: Finding it hard to come up to the expectations of the PTI-PML-Q coalition government, Punjab Chief Secretary (CS) Kamran Ali Afzal on Saturday requested the federal government to withdraw his services from the province, citing ‘personal reasons’.  
In his letter to Secretary Establishment Inamullah Khan, the chief secretary said: “I am writing to convey that owing to personal reasons, it is not possible for me to continue on my current assignment.”  
It is reliably learnt that the Shehbaz Sharif-led federal government has instructed the chief secretary to continue working in Punjab and look after law and order during Ashura (first 10 days of Muharram) as his request would be considered soon afterwards.
As per sources in bureaucracy, following Mr Afzal’s transfer, most probably after 10th of Muharram, senior bureaucrats in the race for the top administrative slot may include Babar Hayat Tarar, currently an OSD in federal government, P&D Board chairman Abdullah Sumbal, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Asadullah Khan and Punjab irrigation secretary Shehryar Sultan.  
The federal government, the sources claim, won’t be willing to oblige Chief Minister Parvez Elahi by appointing his nominee against the chief secretary’s slot.
Despite being appointed by Imran Khan’s federal government, Mr Afzal as head of Punjab’s civil bureaucracy was retained by the PML-N government and showed a tilt towards it when it had gained support of 25 Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf members and was hoping to form the government in Punjab.
Then Punjab police inspector general Rao Sardar Ali Khan had made a quiet exit as he had himself requested the federal government for his transfer from the province soon after the PTI had won 15 seats in the July by-election. He was transferred on July 22.
In order to facilitate the PML-N leadership, the top civil bureaucrats, including the CS, IGP, ACS (Home), Lahore commissioner and deputy commissioner had got the Punjab Assembly cordoned off on April 16 and even sent the police on the floor of the provincial house, in an unprecedented move. Both PTI and PML-Q had boycotted the voting for the election of the chief minister.
The very next day (on April 17), the Governor House was cordoned off and even then governor Umer Sarfraz Cheema was not allowed to enter the premises, to facilitate the administration of oath to Hamza Shehbaz as chief minister by National Assembly Speaker Raja Parvez Ashraf.
This turned Chief Minister Parvez Elahi against CS Afzal and IGP Rao Sardar to the extent that he wanted both officers to appear in the Punjab Assembly and face the wrath of PTI and PML-Q legislators for their actions. However, the officers, backed by Hamza, refused to obey.
The PTI Chairman Imran Khan was so annoyed with these officers that he openly warned them that their “names had been noted” and they would be taken to task.
Sources says Parvez Elahi, after become CM, had started bypassing the chief secretary as he got appointed Punjab Assembly  secretary Muhammad Khan Bhatti as principal secretary to chief minister,  despite the fact that he did not belong to the civil service.
Similarly, when the chief secretary transferred Layyah DC, against whom PTI chairman Imran Khan had spoken in the  public meetings, and posted a deputy secretary and his staff officer Wasim Hamed there, the chief minister got the orders  cancelled and got Muhammad Yasir posted as deputy commissioner. Mr Yasir  was serving as director-general of Sargodha PHA.
Mr Afzal, being chief secretary was also conspicuous by his absence from the oath-taking ceremony of Punjab’s new 21-members cabinet held at the Governor House, Lahore, where he was supposed to read the notification and request the governor to administer the oath. 
As per sources, because of absence of Mr Afzal, the government asked ACS Syed Ali Murtaza to conduct the ceremony, but he too excused himself. Eventually, Implementation and Coordination (I&C) Secretary Zaid Bin Maqsood conducted the oath-taking ceremony.
Later, the Punjab government made ACS Murtaza an OSD. He was transferred and directed to report to the S&GAD department for further orders. Mr Murtaza was ACS (Home) when PTI’s leaders and workers were stopped from marching on Islamabad by firing teargas shells, rubber bullets and baton charge.
Mr Murtaza did not respond to the messages seeking the reasons for his ouster from the ACS office.
ACS (Home) Asadullah Khan has been given the additional charge of the chief secretary till further orders.
The Punjab government also transferred youth affairs and sports department secretary Asadullah Faiz and posted him as mines and minerals secretary against a vacant post.
Punjab local government and community development (LG&CD) secretary Imran Sikandar has been transferred and posted as youth affairs and sports secretary.
Member (Judicial-I) Board of Revenue Syed Mubasher Hussain (ex-PCS cadre BS-20) has been transferred and posted as LG&CD secretary.

3,PML-Q sees no issue with Khan calling shots in Punjab from Banigala,Punjab PML-Q Information Secretary Mian Imran Masood says since his party is  keen to win PTI chairman’s confidence.,"GUJRAT:  As the Pakistan Tehreek-i- Insaaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan practically  wants to run the Punjab government led by Parvez Elahi from Islamabad,  the PML-Q does not have any issue with the  senior coalition partner’s  strategy of issuing directions  in important matters.
Well places sources told Dawn  that the  lists carrying names of officers mainly in administration,  police and  other important posts for transfer and posting are being  sent to  the Punjab CM office from Banigala residence of the former  prime  minister who reportedly wants to repeat the Usman Buzdar model.
Punjab  PML-Q Information Secretary Mian Imran Masood says since his party is  keen to win PTI chairman’s confidence, it will follow Khan Sahib’s  direction on governance matters.     
“The PML-Q is determined not  to embarrass the PTI in any case as the party has not sought  any  ministerial slot for its lawmakers in the first phase of  the cabinet  formation,” he said.
Asked if this model would succeed as it  failed in the Usman Buzdar and Arif Nakai cases, Mr Masood said two  politicians were rather novices in politics but CM Elahi had a  successful experience  of working with  former president Parvez  Musharraf during 2002-07.  
The PTI chief virtually  controlled Buzdar and KP CM Mahmood Khan from the PM House but his plan  failed as both the provincial governments performed poorly. Similarly,  former PM Benazir Bhutto could not tame Manzoor Wattoo and Arif Nakai  during the PPP government in 1993-96.
Adding, Masood said Parvez  Elahi would be in a totally different role as chief minister with the  PTI compared to his tactics of putting pressure on  the PTI while being  the Punjab Assembly speaker.  
“The Q leadership does  not  have any personal agenda. Their only focus is to work as per the   guidance of Mr Khan, aiming at coalition’s victory in the next  elections,” he said. 
He  reiterated his party’s stance of  being committed to dissolving the Punjab  Assembly whenever Mr Khan  would ask it to do so “as the PML-Q did not have any  other option but  to strengthen its bond with the PTI”.

4,Kamil seeks stay against ECP verdict halting ‘Q’ intra-polls,LAHORE: Pakistan Muslim League Quaid-i-Azam (PML-Q) leader Kamil Ali Agha on Saturday filed a petition with the...,"LAHORE: Pakistan Muslim League Quaid-i-Azam (PML-Q) leader Kamil Ali Agha on Saturday filed a petition with the Lahore High Court (LHC), seeking a stay to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) decision to halt intra-party polls for the slots of president and secretary general.
Advocate Safdar Shaheen, representing Mr Agha, filed the petition, stating the party head Chaudhry Shujaat wrote a letter carrying illegal directives to the Punjab Assembly deputy speaker ahead of the election for Punjab chief minister’s office.
He said the party’s working committee had termed Mr Shujaat’s directives an undemocratic act and decided to remove him from the president’s slot.
He said the party workers had also staged a protest demo outside the house of Chaudhry Shujaat and condemned the letter.
He said the party chief was removed from the post and the central working committee announced election for the president’s office to be held on Aug 10.
The petitioner stated that the ECP suspended the decision to hold intra-party polls without citing the meeting of the central executive committee.  
He maintained that the ECP’s decision to bar intra-party election was illegal and therefore its execution should be halted immediately.
The ECP on Friday retained Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain as PML-Q chief, who filed an application seeking bar on intra-party elections.
Barrister Umar Aslam, representing Chaudhry Shujaat, submitted before the ECP that Mr Agha, who is PML-Q Punjab secretary-general, chaired the party’s meeting illegally and later announced intra-party elections.
He said the provincial office-bearers of any political party could not announce intra-party polls bypassing the party head and central secretary-general according to the rules.
He stated that the intra-party elections were scheduled for Aug 10 without the permission of the party president and secretary general.

6,PR team to inspect prototypes of Chinese coaches,Officials will visit China for training as a part of technology transfer.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Railways (PR), in near future, is all set to inspect prototype models of the state-of-the-art passenger coaches and high-capacity freight wagons it wants to procure from a leading Chinese company.
Several junior and senior officials will also travel to China soon where some of them will inspect the models (as per specifications, designs etc) and some will take part in training being organised by the Chinese firm as a part of two different contracts to transfer technology of manufacturing modern coaches in Pakistan, Dawn has learnt. 
“Under $140 million contract (Rs31 billion approximately) awarded by Pakistan Railways, a Chinese company is liable to manufacture 230 state-of-the-art passenger coaches, out of which 46 will be provided to us in the form of completely built unit (CBU) and the remaining 184 will be manufactured here in Pakistan by our engineers and technical staff under supervision of the Chinese,” PR’s Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) Abdul Haseeb explained while talking to Dawn on Saturday.
“The contract of procuring 800 wagons and 20 brake wagons is separate to this contract,” he added.

Officials will visit China for training as a part of technology transfer

The manufacturing of 184 coaches in Pakistan, according to him, is a part of the contract called “Transfer of Technology” after which the PR would not require any help from China for manufacturing of such rolling stock.
To a question, Mr Haseeb said, for the coaches planned to be manufactured in Pakistan (The PR Carriage Factory, Islamabad), the Chinese firm would be responsible to provide spare parts and raw material.  
He said the officials proceeding to China included 18 for design inspection, 20 for other sorts of inspections and the rest for participating in the training related to transfer of technology.
To another question, he said the expense to be incurred on travelling, TA/DA, lodging, boarding would be borne by the firm since it is a part of the contract.
According to another contract, the PR is set to procure as many as 800 high capacity wagons and 20 brake vans and a letter of credit has already been opened in March, this year.
Under the contract agreement clause No. 9.3.1 and 14,1.2 and 24, inspectors for a period of 21 days each will visit manufacturers’ premises for inspection and training purposes. 
“The officers nominated are due to the reason that the design/prototype approval/inspection is carried out by the senior officials being complicated in nature and the officers selected are from the available pool,” reads a letter issued recently. 
Meanwhile, the names of the officials proceeding to China soon to inspect the models and get training have been announced by the PR. 
The officials (from grade 5 and above) included Shahid Aziz (AGM-mechanical), Salman Sadiq Sheikh (GM, maintenance & service), Adnan Shafai ( PR, rehabilitation), Rahat Mirza (divisional superintendent), Abdul Malik (DG planning), Aqeel Yousaf (MD, Risalpur Loco factory), Iftikhar Hussain (PD), Muhammad Yousaf Leghari (PD), Abdul Haseeb Bhurgri (chief mechanical engineer), Kashif Rasheed Yousfani (DS), Kashif Farooq (Deputy CME), Muhammad Farooq (deputy chief engineer), Hamdan Nazir (deputy chief goods operation), Zulfiqar Sheikh (deputy CM Loco), Imitiaz Hussain Farooqi (director operations), Fahad Masood Janjua (deputy director), Muhammad Fasahatullah (DME), Muhammad Ishtiaq Abbasi (workshop manager), Sarmad Ibrahim (DME), Muhammad Amir (EFO), Rehan Ahmad (train examiner, washing line), Hafiz Muhammad Javed (train examiner), Attaullah Ansari (carriage inspector) and Amanullah Ansari (head train examiner).

7,Harking back: The romance of four northern Lahore gateways,"Of the 12 gates and a ‘mori’ of the old Walled City of Lahore, the one gate and the ‘hole in the wall’ on ...","Of the 12 gates and a ‘mori’ of the old Walled City of Lahore, the one gate and the ‘hole in the wall’ on the south are most written about. But then the four on the north are probably more ancient, and have more history attached to them.
There is a reason for this, and that being that the importance of the ancient city was derived, primarily, from its connection to the outside world through, the river and the ancient highway that touched it, and still does. In this piece we will dwell on them briefly, though a narration on each separately is much needed. The four gateways are Roshnai Gate, Kashmiri Gate, Khizri Gate (now known as Sheranwala), and Yakki Gate.
The Roshnai Gate led to the old mud-walled fort, and was at the landing port of the river to the Lahore fort. The road to the ancient city led onward from there, where a small garden existed. This gateway had, so a source claims, 101 oil-lamps which were lit by guards at sunset and extinguished at sunrise. This made sure the entire surroundings of the fort were visible to guards on the fort’s walls. Pre-Islamic period versions describe these lamps and their number as being dictated by Hindu priest superstition. One cannot vouch for such reasons.
Once Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb decided to build Badshahi Mosque, he first got the front garden prepared and named it ‘Abdar Khana’. The central structure then did not exist. That ‘Abdar Khana’ was renamed as Hazuri Bagh once Maharajah Ranjit Singh had erected the Baradari with marble ‘removed’ from Jahangir’s Tomb in Shahdara, and walled off the mosque and lawn to the city. This was an exclusive enclave as the mosque had been converted into a horse stable.
The entrance to the Samadhi of Ranjit Singh and the structure surrounding the Well where Guru Arjan dived into the River Ravi and disappeared, was given a gateway by the maharajah’s grandson Kanwar Naunehal Singh using bricks removed from the shrine of Hazrat Sakhi Syed Shah Ghaus Qadri outside Akbari Gate. When those bricks fell on him killing him, the popular rumour was that it was punishment for the blasphemy committed. We know that he was injured, taken inside the fort and silently murdered by the then chief minister Raja Dhian Singh at least that is the version written by Dr Johann Honigberger.
Now to the next gateway next to the south-eastern edge of the fort, that being Kashmiri Gate. The name is derived from its direction to Kashmir and was used by Royal staff to quickly reach the bazaars of Lahore. It was also the route taken by ‘secret’ visitors to the rulers. On the lawn outside the amazing wife of Mughal Emperor Akbar, Begum Mariam Zamani built an exquisite mosque.
In the opinion of artisans and architects this is Lahore’s most beautiful mosque. Its location makes sense in that in her lifetime she started off a shipbuilding enterprise, and built huge ships for pilgrims to go to Mecca, and later for gunships as British pirates kept attacking her ships.
This brings us to the third, and Lahore’s most-important gateway, that being Khizri Darwaza. This was the original port of Lahore on the River Ravi, and served for trade over thousands of years. One account described in C. Rajagopalachari’s English translation of the epic ‘Mahabharata’ clearly states that the real battle between the nine rajas of western India and the Lahore ruler Bharata - known as Battle of the Ten Kings (Desanrajan) - was over possession of Khizri Gate river port. The battle site is currently known as Mehmood Booti.
But why the name Khizri? This brings forth the ancient Lahore where the name was given after Hazrat Khawaja Khizr, known in ancient texts as ‘al-Khadir’, or in local tradition as ‘Zinda Pir’. In the Quran’s surah ‘Al-Kahf’ or ‘The Cave’, we see a description of Khawaja Khizr informing the Prophet Musa (Moses) of mystical truths. It seems from various sources that most eastern river ports had used the name Khizr, who in the Bible is described as Elijeh, the prophet of miracle workers, and harbinger of the ‘End’. In the Jewish faith the ‘Book of Malachi’ states that all religions that will follow will see Khizr as the guardian of water and river folk.
So it was that Lahore’s river port gateway was named Khizri Gate, and a road ran from the port to the ancient mud walled city. On the way people built houses specialising in the river trades, names that still exist for example ‘Mohallah Kishteranan’, or ‘Mohallah Chappugaran’. Of recent pious names of Islamic persons have replaced those ancient names - a sort of insult in my books to the magnificence of Hazrat Khawaja Khizr. But then such are times. I would like to add here that in archaeological digs inside the fort 4,500-year old fragments of pottery made in faraway lands must surely have reached Lahore via Khizri Gate. A religious scholar describes these as “with the blessings of Khawaja Khizr.”
Then comes the Ranjit Singh era and after the maharajah had conquered Multan, with the Zamzama Cannon being shipped up the river from this very gateway, he described it was a tribute to the saint and renamed it Sheranwala by tying two live lions there. Typical young Lahore lads frequently stoned the poor animals, slowly killing them in the process. The maharajah installed two stone ones, which were removed by Lahori traders recently. One just cannot comment on their dare.
The fourth gateway is called Yakki Darwaza (Gateway). This is a distortion of the name Zaki, or the ‘Pure’. In the year 1241 AD the forces of Genghis Khan under his General Munggeto surrounded the ancient city and pledged to eliminate every living person. Against him a saint named Pir Zaki fought and once his head had been removed by a strike, his body kept fighting on. One source claims he killed another seven persons. Hence inside Yakki Gate there are two tombs to the martyr Pir Zaki, both of them at different places.
If this location is correct, then the battle surely must have taken place outside the then mud-walled city. Another source claims that as outside the gateway was a horse stand, hence the name Yakki came about, though this was in a much later time period. The original name was Zaki Darwaza, and in a later time period after the bazaars outside Akbari Gate came up, this horse stand for carts came up. In the British period it served the nearby railway station.
Many a question arises out of this brief description of the four northern gateways. Should not ‘Sheranwala’ have its original name restored, much that one admires Ranjit Singh? Should not a 101-lamp gateway be constructed between the fort and the ‘samadhi’ to reflect our ancient river heritage? Should Yakki Gate be renamed Zaki Gate? These are far-fetched suggestions, but surely they will add to the romance of our ancient city.

10,Emerson University without key functionaries,LAHORE: The Emerson College after transformation into a full-fledged university is having a bumpy road for the past...,"LAHORE: The Emerson College after transformation into a full-fledged university is having a bumpy road for the past one and-a-half year as it is functioning without key administrative officers.  
The university has been working without registrar, treasurer and controller of examination and under an ‘irregular’ vice chancellor.  
The Punjab Assembly passed the Emerson University Multan Bill 2021 on May 4 and Bahauddin Zakariya University’s Prof Dr Naveed Ahmad was given an interim charge of the vice chancellor to run the affairs of the institution. It has been facing academic, administrative and governance issues ever since.  
The Higher Education Department (HED) advertised the post of VC but later cancelled the interviews without mentioning any reason. The university administration has failed to take necessary academic and administrative measures including making statutory bodies such as Syndicate and Academic Council, and appointing registrar, treasurer and controller of examination during the first interim period of VC Mr Ahmad.  
The university also could not appoint any faculty member and continued working with the college teachers who are alleged to be running their academies and tuition centres rather than regularly delivering lectures in the university.  
The administration also failed to work on preserving university’s old buildings  including academic and administrative blocks and hostels which were in a sate of disrepair.  
According to documents, Rs120 million allocated for repairing the buildings during the previous budget were not used and lapsed on June 30. 
The university also failed to form an academic calendar and continued running the affairs haphazardly.  
Meanwhile, BZU Faculty of Commerce, Law & Business Administration Dean Prof Dr Shaukat Malik was given the additional charge of the VC of the EUM on July 15, 2022, who convened the first Academic Council meeting and established six faculties and 35 departments and also appointed the heads of these departments.  
Mr Malik told Dawn that he was facing difficulties owing to the shortage of administrative and academic staff. He said the previous administration did not take any measures to address the issue of the new universities.  
“I have requested the HED to appoint registrar, controller and treasurer as per the Emerson University Multan Act 2021,” he said. The VC further said these principal officers would have some statutory powers and a VC could not exercise these powers under the University Act. “The vice chancellor did not have authority to spend a single rupee without approval of the treasurer,” he said.  
He said the situation was aggravating because they could not pay salaries to the staff, officers and teachers for July and it was creating unrest among the employees.  
Mr Malik said administrative, governance, academic and financial affairs of the university could not be addressed with the interim charge of the VC. He said the university was without its own staff and all the staff and teachers belonged to the Higher Education Department.  
He said the meetings of the Finance and Planning Committee (F&PC), Selection Board and Syndicate for 2021-22 and 2022-23 were not convened owing to the absence of the principal officers. He demanded that the government appoint registrar, controller of examination and treasurer without further delay.  
HED Secretary Najaf Iqbal told Dawn that the department had  forwarded the summaries to the governor/ chancellor and the CM office to appoint the registrar, controller and treasurer on an ad hoc/ interim basis. He said they had also sent a summary for the appointment of the regular vice chancellor  to the CM office and were awaiting a reply.  
The posts of the registrar, controller  and treasurer would be advertised soon to fix administrative and academic issues, he said.

TANKER ACCIDENT: The Rescue 1122 Ahmedpur East claimed to have averted a major accident of an overturned tanker laden with over 37 tonnes of bleach chemical and saved the civilian population around Channi Goth. 
Abid Raheem of the Rescue 1122 told Dawn by mobile phone that a tanker laden with 37 tonnes bleach chemical overturned due to drowsy driving as the tanker was passing through highway overhead bridge. The chemical started leaking from the tanker that was on its way to Karachi from Faisalabad.  
On receiving the emergency call, the rescuers along with fire engine and ambulance rushed to the site of the accident and shifted the overturned tanker from the main highway to the nearby fields. The rescuers cordoned off the area while the entire chemical was spilled away into the open fields away from the busy road. This saved the civilian population and there was blockade of vehicular traffic on the Karachi-Lahore national highway. However, the tanker-driver was injured but he was out of danger. The rescuers later washed the main road. 
FLOOD RELIEF: The Pakistan Seraiki Party (PSP) has set up a relief camp at the Fowara Chowk to collect articles for the help of flood-affected people. 
According PSP chairperson Dr Nukhbah Taj Langah, PSP vice president Iqbal Waseem, Yasir Ahmed and other office-bearers supervised the camp, which would continue in the coming days.

LAHORE: The National College of Arts (NCA) will soon launch a website of its archives, a repository of non-current records of the college dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, set up in 1998. 
The collections include many treasures from the past including accounts of the Franco-British Exhibition held in 1908, correspondence related to Lord Curzon’s commission for brass lamps for the Taj Mahal in 1905, Bhai Ram Singh’s conference paper on woodcarving for the Indian Industrial Conference of 1909, governmental pamphlets and instructions circulated in connection with the First and Second World Wars and other such archival documents. 
The collections contain both secondary and primary sources, including rare books and portfolios once part of the institution’s libraries, and primary sources from the early 20th century onwards consisting of correspondence, accounts, and other documents related to the administration and development of the institution and of art education in the region.   
“The NCA has invested in mobile shelving for its archives, which has considerably increased storage capacity and capacity for the consolidation of our archival storage into one dedicated space. This has significantly decreased document retrieval time and made it possible to design more efficient environmental control solutions to the safekeeping of our collections,” says NCA Vice Chancellor Professor Dr Murtaza Jafri while talking to Dawn.
According to Mr Jaffri, the collections chronicle the illustrious history of the institution, once an integral part of the British Raj’s colonial apparatus and now a pioneer in Pakistan’s contemporary art scene. Archival evidence is from the pre-1947 times when the NCA was the Mayo School of Arts embroiled in the colonial politics and ideologies of the period, helping further the colonial project through its participation in imperial exhibitions and commissioned projects but at the same time providing a space for local artists and artisans to develop and hone their skills and ideas, he adds.   
The VC says the primary sources include documents related to the day-to-day running of the Mayo School of Arts, correspondence and papers discussing South Asian arts and crafts, accounts of exhibitions and commissioned projects, as well as communications received by the institution and its staff members as part of a larger network of colonial institutions of the British Raj. From 1958 onwards, archival records indicate a more ‘modern’ outlook towards art and art education.   
Since the spring of 2021, Mr Jafri says the NCA has initiated a redevelopment of the NCA archives, including a major overhaul of our storage facility and the full documentation and development of the college policies and guidelines. There is a plan for a dedicated website to be launched later this year along with a major publication documenting the NCA history.   
“While providing improved stewardship and preservation to our collection, this project also aims to make our resources more accessible in order to enhance their use in research,” he adds.  
According to Doa Sarmad Khan, in-charge NCA Archives Department, says parallel to the physical development of the archive, the major portion of archival collection have been digitized in line with international data preservation and metadata standards.  
“Digitizing our collections was essential to keep the archives open for researchers during the Covid-19 by allowing digital access when physical access was impossible,” she adds.  
Ms Khan says a major publication planned for later this year compiles a history of the NCA through a collection of thematic essays ranging from the institution’s earliest history to the evolution of pedagogies, physical spaces and experiences in more contemporary times.  
This publication will be based primarily on archival research conducted at the NCA archives and it will provide a multifaceted account of the NCA’s role in the development of the arts in the country.

A local -- Asif Kathia -- told this correspondent on Saturday that the bridge had reduced at least 50-km distance between Bhussi Kathia and Kassowal.
He said: “Traffic moves to Bhussi Kathia from Adda Waroana, located some 20 kilometers on Kamalia-Chichawatni road, and after crossing the Ravi through the boat bridge, at least 20-km travel distance shortens as Kassowal is just 10-km away from the bridge.”
An area farmer -- Mian Asad Hafiz -- said wooden pieces laid on the boat bridge had been removed and kept by the irrigation department staff so that after the end of flood season, the bridge could again be made functional after reassembling it.
