“Through a donation of $130 million from American people, the US government has completed Gomal Zam Dam, which increased Pakistan’s energy capacity by 17 megawatts, which is enough to power over 20,000 houses,” the US envoy told Dawn in an interview.
According to Mr Blome, the project helped farmers in Dera Ismail Khan and Tank districts to cultivate more than 191,000 acres barren land through the region’s first reliable water supply system that doubled agricultural production thereby creating economic opportunities for 30,000 households.
The ambassador said the money donated by people of the US is being spent through the USAID Mission in Pakistan through which 1,300km roads, including 652km highways, 35 bridges and two tunnels along the border region in addition to 1,240km roads in newly-merged tribal districts, had been constructed.

He said the US constructed 229 schools and rehabilitated more than 1,000 damaged due to militancy and natural disasters and thus, benefiting more than one million students.
The ambassador said over 3,000 women farmers received poultry packages and greenhouses in the province to facilitate their economic stability.
He said the role of private investors in development of the province was vital as the US-based companies had signed a contract worth $600,000 with the provincial government to provide nano-degree skills training to graduates.
Mr Blome said the US government had supported six Ambassadors Fund for projects of cultural heritage preservation by investing more than $800,000 since 2002 and the money included $600,000 for the conservation of a Buddhist monastery in Takht Bhai aea.
“Until now, 2,800 people from this province visited the US as part of educational programmes. In the last six years, our government has incurred $1.3 million in lieu of public diplomacy grants to build capacity and train journalists, youth, entrepreneurs and people with disabilities,” he said.
The ambassador said $5.5 million was given away for the promotion of English language apart financing 21 universities partnerships with US-based varsities on various research projects and collaboration.
“We are delivering life-saving services for more than 340,000 women and children through multiple interventions in the region and have also trained more than 10,000 healthcare providers,” he said.
Mr Blome also said equipment were given to 48 health units, including six teaching hospitals, in addition to financial assistance for the completion of 120-bed Burns and Plastic Surgery Centre in Peshawar.
He also said allocation of $127m to establish centres for advanced learning in the areas of water, energy, and food security, has become leading institutions across Pakistan and globally.

The ambassador said since 2008, the US government had supported more than 2.2 million displaced persons by providing more than $338 million in humanitarian assistance and facilitating 1.9 million to rebuild destroyed homes and resume their livelihoods.

The historic Qissa Khwani Bazaar is no different as the people doing business there have joined the August 14 celebrations, which begin at the start of the month.
Most shop, restaurant and kiosk owners and their workers are putting on green clothes, while bookshops have decorated shelves with Independence Day items.
People, especially youngsters, are seen purchasing national flags and buntings, while children, including students, buy green dresses, hats, bangles and green items to display on their houses ahead of the Independence Day.
The green colour is all over the Qissa Khwani Bazaar.
Shopkeeper Zareen Gul told Dawn that high inflation rate didn’t dampen the spirits of the people, who were celebrating the upcoming Independence Day as allowed by their financial position.
He said his grandfather had set up that shop before the Partition and since then, his family had been dealing in the Independence Day-related stuff.
“We sell 75 items with the prices ranging between Rs75 and Rs7,500 apiece. We have customers from all age brackets who show up to get the goods best suited to their taste,” he said.
Historian Mohammad Ibrahim, who is the author of Peshawar Maaze Ke Dareechu Se, said Qissa Khwani Bazaar was witness to a number of tragedies, including the 1930 massacre and the Sept 2013 car bombing, while it also marked the 1948 Independence Day in style.
Most stationery and garment shops have replaced their routine stuff with green items as customers are more interested in them ahead of August 14.
Zakria Momand, another storekeeper in the bazaar, said his great grandfather’s four relatives were seriously injured in the 1930 Qissa Khwani massacre, while four of his own cousins were killed in the 2013 car blast.

12,Breastfeeding gives babies the best start of life: experts,"Seminars in Peshawar, Khyber highlight importance of mother’s milk...","PESHAWAR/KHYBER: Health experts at a seminar on Saturday called upon the people to promote breastfeeding in order to reduce infant mortality rate and protect babies against infections and diseases like diarrhoea. 
“Through breastfeeding alone we can scale up immunity and prevent deaths of newborn babies and children. It is the single most cost-effective public health intervention that can give babies the best start to a healthy life,” secretary health Amer Sultan Tareen told the participants of the seminar held in Peshawar. 
He said that it was a matter of grave concern that almost 50pc of babies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained deprived of the mother’s milk and exclusive breastfeeding for up to six months. 
“We must do everything that we can to turn around these numbers and ensure a healthy start for every child,” he said. 

Seminars in Peshawar, Khyber highlight importance of mother’s milk

Director general health services Shaheen Afridi said that in order to promote and support breastfeeding the World Breastfeeding Week (WBW) was started in 1992 to mark the importance of breastfeeding. He asked the parents to protect health of their babies by giving them the mother’s milk. 
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the entire month of August was usually dedicated to advocacy for generating support for breastfeeding, she said. 
Director nutrition Dr Fazal Majeed said that in 2018 the World Health Assembly endorsed the celebration of WBW as an opportunity to communicate the importance of breastfeeding everywhere. 
He said the breastfeeding protection law existed, but it needed stricter implementation to curb the violations and unnecessary use of breast milk substitutes. 
Abdullah Mohammad Yousaf of the Unicef was of the view that since 2015 the global breastfeeding week focused on the contribution of mother’s milk to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Breastfeeding provides food security and reduces inequality, he said. 
In Khyber district, health experts have said that the mother’s milk is a complete food for infants as it contains nutrients and vitamins that are greatly helpful in digestion and ensuring physical growth of the newborn babies. 
They were speaking at a seminar organised by the health authorities in Jamrud to create awareness of the importance of breastfeeding. 
District health officer Dr Zafar Ali, manager nutrition Anam Afridi, Dr Usman and Dr Neelam spoke on the occasion. 
They said the mother’s milk also contained natural antibodies which protected minors from various diseases. They insisted that mothers who avoided breastfeeding their infants were in fact putting their own health in danger. 
The participants of the seminar also held a walk up to Bab-i-Khyber to create awareness of the importance of breastfeeding for infants’ health.

Former president of the Haripur Subject Specialists Association Moazzam Khan told reporters here on Saturday that the provision of free education and facilities in public sector schools was a welcome move of the government as it increased enrolments but the failure to fill top vacancies was hampering their affairs.
He said 250 principal seats in boys schools were vacant across the province, while those vacancies in girls schools totalled 150.
Mr Moazzam said around 200 heads of boys higher secondary schools and 100 of girls higher secondary schools would retire in the next academic year taking the number of those vacancies to around 700 and thus, causing problems for those educational institutions.
He said educational emergency declared by the provincial government had improved the quality of education to a great extent as burden of parents for their children’s education, uniform and books had eased but any delay in the teachers’ promotion and filling of school posts can hamper the plans for higher enrollments.
