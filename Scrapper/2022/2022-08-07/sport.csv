0,Last-gasp Hanan earns Pakistan seventh place at CWG,The match at the University of Birmingham hockey stadium was representative of how far Pakistan have fallen behind.,"BIRMINGHAM: Once again, Pakistan took on Canada in a seventh-place playoff at the Commonwealth Games. Just like four years ago in Australia, Pakistan came out as winners. This time thanks to a last-minute strike by Abdul Hanan Shahid that sealed a nerve-wracking 4-3 win on Saturday.
The match at the University of Birmingham hockey stadium was representative of how far Pakistan have fallen behind. Once the giants of world hockey, they have now become the also-rans in the sport. They’re still seventh in the Commonwealth nations.
Had it not been for Shahid’s goal, they would’ve finished even worse as Canada twice came back to level the match, first from 2-0 down and then from 3-2.


BIRMINGHAM: Kenya’s Abraham Kibiwot (R) competes to win the men’s 3,000m steeplechase final ahead of India’s Avinash Mukund Sable at the Alexander Stadium on Saturday. Kibiwot beat Sable for the gold by a wafer-thin 0.05 seconds. However, Sable broke the stranglehold of the Kenyans in the event — they had swept the medals from the 1998 Games onwards. —AFP

 
Having finished fourth in Pool ‘A’, Pakistan scored twice in the space of a minute to make it 2-0 by the 25th. First Rana Abdul Waheed’s spectacular shot found the net and Ghazanfar Ali added another field goal to put Siegfried’s Aikman’s men in control.
That lead, though, didn’t last long as Canada were on level terms by halftime. First Matt Sarmento converted a penalty corner in the 26th and Canada’s relentless pressure paid off when they were awarded a penalty stroke just before the half-time whistle and Keegan Pereira made no mistake.
Pakistan dominated possession in the third quarter but it didn’t reflect on the scoreboard until seven minutes into the fourth when captain Umar Bhutta buried a field attempt.
That set up a dramatic finale as Canada pushed for a leveller and found it with two minutes go when Sarmento converted his second penalty corner of the match. But Shahid broke their hearts when he gave Pakistan the decisive lead with just seconds left to play.

1,PHF-PSB tussle set to intensify as Khokhar decides to hold elections,"According to sources, the fresh step taken by Brig Khokhar would increase  differences between the PHF and the PSB.","LAHORE: The ongoing gulf between the Pakistan Hockey Federation and the Pakistan Sports Board over holding fresh elections of the federation has increased further as it seems PHF president retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar has decided to conduct the elections himself instead of giving this role to the committee already appointed by the PSB.
In a latest development, Nasir Ali, a member of the PSB-appointed committee, while ignoring the latest PSB  instructions, which had directed the committee a couple of days ago not  to hold the elections till  a reply of a summary sent to Prime Minister  Shahbaz Sharif was received, has continued to work on holding the  elections.
Chaudhry Riaz,  an advisor of the Azad Jammur and Kashmir government, who was announced as PHF election commissioner by Nasir last week,  held a meeting with acting PHF secretary Haider Hussain at the PHF offices on Saturday and discussed  the programme of the elections, according to a press release issued by the  PHF on Saturday.
Interestingly, two other members of the PSB committee — Rehan Butt and Arshad — did not feature in Riaz’s meeting with Haider who was appointed by Brig Khokhar in place of Asif Bajwa late last month.
According to sources, the fresh step taken by Brig Khokhar would increase  differences between the PHF and the PSB.
The PSB on July 21 appointed a four-member committee for holding the elections within 30 days after the incumbent federation did not hold elections as the tenure of its office-bearers ended in May 2022.
The committee also included Brig Khokhar as a member.
According to the PHF constitution, the PSB has no authority to conduct the elections of the federation. If the PSB did so, the move could be termed interference by the PSB in PHF affairs which could lead to the International Hockey Federation (FIH) suspending Pakistan’s membership.

2,"Liverpool stumble, Spurs shine on Premier League’s opening weekend",The Reds were held 2-2 at newly-promoted Fulham.,"LONDON: Liverpool’s Premier League title challenge got off to a sluggish start as the Reds were held 2-2 at newly-promoted Fulham, while Tottenham Hotspur delivered on their pre-season hype by thrashing Southampton 4-1 on Saturday. 
Jurgen Klopp admitted the best part of Liverpool’s day was the result as the Champions League finalists twice had to come from behind at Craven Cottage. 
Aleksandar Mitrovic maintained his stunning form from last season in the Championship as the Serb outmuscled Trent Alexander-Arnold to head Fulham into a deserved half-time lead. 
The introduction of Darwin Nunez in the second half brought Liverpool to life and the Uruguayan flicked home his first Premier League goal since a 75-million-euro ($77 million) move from Benfica to level. 
Mitrovic restored Fulham’s lead from the penalty spot after he was tripped by Virgil van Dijk inside the area. 
But Mohamed Salah ensured Liverpool at least did not start the season with a defeat by slotting into an empty net from Nunez’s pass. 
“We started actually exactly the opposite way that we wanted,” said Klopp. “We are used to more dominance and we never could get that because we just played not good enough, not quick enough, not precise enough.” 
By contrast, Tottenham had a dream start to the campaign to raise hopes they could compete for a first league title in 61 years. 
Spurs also fell behind to James Ward-Prowse’s strike from the edge of the box after just 12 minutes, but the response from Antonio Conte’s men was emphatic. 
The goals to turn the game around before half-time came from unlikely sources as Ryan Sessegnon and Eric Dier headed home. 
Mohammed Salisu then passed the ball into his own net for a comical own goal on the hour mark. 
Dejan Kulusevski rounded off the scoring with a cool and precise finish into the far corner to take Spurs above Arsenal at the top of the table. 
Newcastle United may not have delivered the big-name signings many expected in the transfer market, but the Magpies did the business on the pitch to spoil Nottingham Forest’s return to the English top flight with a 2-0 win. 
Forest have even outspent Newcastle in the window on 12 new signings so far, but were given a lesson in the step up in quality to the Premier League at St James’ Park. 
Fabian Schar’s sensational strike opened the scoring before Callum Wilson’s predatory finish sealed the three points. 
Bournemouth were also 2-0 winners over Aston Villa, dispelling their pre-season gloom after a lack of transfer activity. 
Jefferson Lerma got the Cherries off to a great start after just three minutes and Kieffer Moore added a second 10 minutes from time. 
Leeds United shrugged off the loss of Kalvin Phillips and Raphinha over the summer as they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 at Elland Road. 
Daniel Podence had fired Wolves into an early lead, but Jesse Marsch’s men fought back impressively. 
Rodrigo blasted in from a narrow angle to level before Rayan Ait-Nouri’s own goal decided the game 16 minutes from time. 
Arsenal battled to beat Crystal Palace 2-0 to get the new season underway on Friday, with Gabriel Martinelli scoring the first goal before home defender Marc Guehi turned the ball into his own net late on at Selhurst Park. 
“The win is the most important thing. To win the first match it builds confidence, momentum and then we can discuss the things we have to improve,” said Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta, who guided his side to a fifth-place finish last term. “To win here you need to suffer. We’ve done it and that is part of the mentality we want to build.”

Jamaican Jackson became the fastest woman alive over the distance at last month’s World Championships in Eugene, Oregon with a time of 21.45 seconds but she finished a little outside that with an effort of 21.84 on the day.
Shaunae Miller-Uibo of the Bahamas was second in 22.35 and American Jenna Prandini was third with 22.39.
Bromell had settled for bronze behind Bracy at Eugene but he made no mistake running against a slight headwind in Chorzow, as he crossed the finish line in 9.95 seconds for a second Diamond League victory of the season over 100m. Jamaica’s Ackeem Blake was third ahead of Christian Coleman and Yohan Blake.
Brazilian Alison Dos Santos secured his fifth men’s 400m hurdles Diamond League win of 2022 to add to his world title, as he cruised to victory in 47.8 seconds, beating Khallifah Rosser and Wilfried Happio.
Michael Norman went up against Kirani James in the latest chapter of their rivalry in the men’s 400m, with the duo finishing first and second, respectively — as they did at the worlds.
Sweden’s world record-holder Armand Duplantis comfortably won the men’s pole vault with an effort of 6.1m, though he was not competing for Diamond League points.
The 22-year-old, who broke his own world record with a jump of 6.21m at the worlds, has already qualified for the final in September where he will be looking to defend his title.

New Zealand shot putter Tom Walsh also held on to his title while 18-year-old Kenyan Jackline Chepkoech won the 3000 metres steeplechase in a Games record of 9min 15.68sec.
Jamaican triple jumper Shanieka Ricketts shed her bridesmaid’s tag — having been silver medallist in the 2018 Games and last month’s world championships — to post a Games record of 14.94 metres.
But it was the decathlon that provided the edge-of-the-seat drama at Alexander Stadium.
Victor held on by the skin of his teeth as Australia’s Daniel Golubovic won the 1500m comfortably, threatening to snatch the title away from him.
The Grenadan fell to the ground as he awaited the final tally and to his relief he had done just enough to deny Golubovic, winning by just 36 points with a total of 8,233.
“Ahead of the 1500m I just thought, ‘Don’t relinquish the lead. Run as hard as you need to win’, and that’s exactly what I did,” said 29-year-old Victor.
Walsh, the 2017 world champion, won the shot put with a mark of 22.26 metres as New Zealand compatriot Jacko Gill took silver with a personal best of 21.90m.
“I don’t want to lose to him [Gill], that’s for sure,” said Walsh. “But having Jacko alongside me [on the podium] will be a pretty special occasion. Jacko and I have been going head-to-head for 12 years now.
“We are different people, and I wouldn’t say we’re mates, but we get on really well still — just two different characters.” 
English diver Jack Laugher won his second gold of the Games, in the men’s synchronised 3m springboard with Anthony Harding, despite an interrupted night’s sleep, after taking the 1m springboard title.
“To say that I had a couple of hours’ sleep and then to go out there and perform some of the hardest dives in the world alongside a great syncro partner was obviously pretty good,” he said.
England’s Matty Lee — who won gold alongside Tom Daley at the Tokyo Olympics — and Noah Williams triumphed in the men’s synchronised 10m platform event.
India won triple gold in the wrestling competition, with Bajrang Punia defending his men’s 65kg title and Sakshi Malik taking the women’s 62kg crown.
In the men’s 86kg category, Deepak Punia beat Pakistan’s Muhammad Inam, who called for more sporting ties despite political tensions between the South Asian nations.
“There is no hate,” he said.  “The more sporting competition that we can have between us, the better the relations between the people.”
England’s women reached the hockey final with a shootout win against defending champions New Zealand while Australia also needed a shootout to beat India.
England’s Marfa Ekimova, who was born in St Petersburg, claimed the individual all-around title in rhythmic gymnastics.
“I hope to inspire the kids in the crowd,” the 17-year-old told the BBC.  “I want them to be rhythmic gymnasts and this sport to carry on through the generations.”
George Miller, 75, became the oldest Common­wealth gold medallist when Scotland beat Wales in the para mixed pairs bowls.
Australia still lead the way in the overall medals table, which includes para events, with 50 gold, but England are now just three behind.

7,Santner stars as NZ whitewash Dutch in T20 series,VOORBURG (Nether­lands): New Zealand’s Mitchell Santner played a captain’s innings with a career-best Twenty20...,"VOORBURG (Nether­lands): New Zealand’s Mitchell Santner played a captain’s innings with a career-best Twenty20 score of 77 not out to steer the Black Caps to a comfortable eight-wicket victory over the Netherlands here at the Sportpark Westvliet on Friday.
The win in the final match of New Zealand’s European tour allowed Santner’s men to claim a clean sweep over Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands before heading to the West Indies for the first T20 match in Jamaica, scheduled for next Wednesday.
Santner was devastating with the bat against a spirited Dutch bowling attack, which saw him smash four sixes and nine fours.
Daryl Mitchell (51 not out) and Santner put on a partnership of 123 runs with the skipper sealing victory in the 14th over with a boundary.
The Dutch had their chances though and their fielding let them down.
This included four dropped catches — two off Santner when Tim Pringle lost the ball on 43 off his own bowling and again on 56.
Despite losing opener Martin Guptill, bowled by Pringle for two, New Zealand never really looked troubled.
“We played a lot better today,” Santner said after the match.
“The pitch also played a lot better and the intent we showed throughout the innings was outstanding.”
On the Dutch side, the standout performance again came from rising star Bas de Leede following in the footsteps of his father Tim, another Dutch international cricketer.
De Leede smacked an unbeaten 53 off 48 balls as the Netherlands posted a respectable 147-4.
In another solid batting performance on a sluggish wicket, De Leede, who made 66 in Thursday’s first T20I, clubbed two sixes and three fours in his 53.
Spinner Michael Bracewell posted the best bowling figures for New Zealand with 2-20 in four overs.
The Kiwi bowling attack was less threatening than it had been in Thursday’s 16-run victory over the men in orange but still proved difficult to get away.

South Africa were sent in to bat and recovered from a slow start to post 182 for six in their innings, before restricting Ireland to 138 all out in 18.5 overs.
Left-armer Parnell had Ireland on the back foot in the second over of their chase as he bagged two wickets before returning to remove top scorer Harry Tector (34 from 31 balls), ending any hopes Ireland had of victory.
South Africa found scoring difficult in the early part of their innings but finished with a flourish to post a challenging total.
They scored 128 runs from their final 10 overs as Heinrich Klaasen plundered 39 from 16 deliveries and David Miller ended with 32 not out from 20 balls.
Those two scores added to a more sedate 42 from 40 balls by innings top-scorer Reeza Hendricks, who was denied a fifth successive half-century in 20-over Internationals.
South Africa have now won 16 of their last 20 matches in the shortest format — some good form heading into the T20 World Cup in Australia starting in October.

9,Rampant Bayern rout Frankfurt in Bundesliga opener,FRANKFURT: Bayern Munich coach Julian Nagelsmann said he didn’t mind if it was beginning to feel “normal” for...,"FRANKFURT: Bayern Munich coach Julian Nagelsmann said he didn’t mind if it was beginning to feel “normal” for his team to win the title, after the champions fired five goals past woeful Eintracht Frankfurt in the first half on the way to an electric 6-1 victory in the Bundesliga season opener on Friday. 
The Bavarians put down a marker at the start of the campaign as they look to land an 11th consecutive league crown, and outclassed the Europa League winners, who face Real Madrid in the Super Cup next week, with new signing Sadio Mane on target and teenage forward Jamal Musiala  scoring two at Deutsche Bank Park. 
Mane, who netted in last week’s German Super Cup win over RB Leipzig, was among five different scorers in a scorching first half with all Bayern’s goals coming in a span of 38 minutes. 
Asked after the match if Bayern winning the Bundesliga was begnning to feel like “normality”, Nagelsmann unsurprisingly said he was happy with the status quo. 
“When you win ten in a row, yes it starts to feel normal,” he told broadcaster DAZN. “But I don’t really care if it feels normal or not - but yes, it can stay ‘normal’. The first half was outstanding I must say. I don’t think it will always be like that but after two matches we can be satisfied. The energy we have in our game is really good.” 
Joshua Kimmich opened their account with an audacious free kick that went in off the post and Benjamin Pavard drilled in their second six minutes later just before Eintracht hit the woodwork through Tuta. 
Thomas Mueller had what could become one of the misses of the season when he hit the post from close range and then also failed to score on the rebound. 
But Mane did much better in the 29th, heading home a Serge Gnabry cross to make it 3-0. He then sent Mueller through to set up Musiala for their fourth in the 35th with a simple tap-in and the Eintracht defence in tatters. 
Gnabry also got onto the scoresheet two minutes before the break, burying any thoughts that Bayern may struggle in attack after the departure of striker Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona. 
Eintracht, who will play in the Champions League this season, were livelier after the break as Bayern eased off and they pounced on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer’s error outside the box to score through Randal Kolo Muani in the 64th. 
Musiala, however, wrapped up the scoring when he latched onto Leroy Sane’s assist to slot in his second goal of the evening seven minutes from time to complete the rout. 
Kimmich lauded the variety of his side’s new attack. “The four up front, they had fun,” he said. 
Frankfurt coach Oliver Glasner praised his team’s effort but said they had no answer for the Bavarians. 
“The whole time, the boys tried everything, but Bayern were just two good for us. Today we didn’t have a chance,” said the coach.

Liton suffered the injury during Friday’s five-wicket loss in the first game of the three-match series and will be sidelined for at least three weeks, said the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).
Liton made 81 before he retired hurt with the injury and underwent a scan which revealed a muscle strain.
“We did a scan of the injured right hamstring and the report has confirmed a grade two muscle strain,” a BCB statement quoted Bangladesh physio Muzadded Alpha as saying.
“Recovery from such injuries usually requires about three to four weeks. He will be assessed further in the coming days and will be put on a rehab plan.”
Bangladesh made 303-2 batting first in the game but Zimbabwe reached the target courtesy of an unbeaten 135 from Sikandar Raza and 110 from Innocent Kaia.
It was Bangladesh’s first ODI defeat against Zimbabwe after 19 consecutive wins in nearly eight years.
Liton is the second Bangladeshi player to be ruled out with injury during the ongoing Zimbabwe tour.
Wicket-keeper/batsman Nurul Hasan returned home with a finger injury sustained during the second T20 International at Harare on July 31.
Bangladesh will play the remaining two ODIs against Zimbabwe in Harare on Aug 7 (today) and 10.

Zarco set the fastest time of 1:57.767 seconds to pip Maverick Vinales of Aprilia by 0.098 seconds and claim his second pole of the season, while Ducati’s Jack Miller finished third.
Vinales’ team-mate Espargaro was stretchered away from the track after crashing in the final practice session earlier on Saturday and taken for medical checks.
Espargaro was soon declared fit to ride despite suffering some bruising to his right foot and returned for Q2, producing the first new lap record of the day with 1:57.966 to take provisional pole.
He found himself shuffled back to sixth, however, as title rival and Yamaha’s reigning world champion Fabio Quartararo briefly went pole before Miller snatched it away, with Zarco eventually steering clear after a late surge from Vinales.
Quartararo was pushed back to the second row and will start in fourth place, with Miller’s Ducati team-mate Francesco Bagnaia in fifth.

Lyon, hoping for a major improvement after a disappointing eighth-place finish last season, got off to a bright start with a 12th minute goal from Tete, set up by Lacazette who is back in Lyon colours after signing from Arsenal. 
Former Shakhtar Donetsk striker Tete, who joined Lyon after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, then won the penalty from a Cedric Avinel foul. 
That allowed Lacazette to make it 2-0 for his 101st goal with Lyon ten minutes later. 
But the hosts side were down to 10 men before the half-hour mark when goalkeeper Anthony Lopes was dismissed for a dangerous tackle and Thomas Mangani pulled one back for the Corsican club from the resultant spot kick. 
However, Ajaccio’s one-man advantage lasted only until just before halftime when Romain Hamouma was sent off for a second cautionable offence.  
“We had to win the first game at home,” said Lyon coach Peter Bosz. “We could see the importance of Alexandre Lacazette, the respect of the opponent for him, the support of the fans are a good thing, but he can do better. We were leading 2-0 after twenty minutes playing well. The sending off after thirty minutes changed a lot of things. Luckily they also got a red card which helped us.”

World number eight Rublev defeated 32nd-ranked Cressy 6-4, 7-6 (10-8) in one hour and 42 minutes then eliminated 99th-ranked wildcard Wolf 6-2, 6-3 in 78 minutes.Rain on Thursday night forced double duty upon Rublev and several others but Friday storms provided everyone a timely rest break between matches.
Rublev, whose only other two-win day was at Washington in 2018, rolled through the first set against Wolf in 28 minutes, then broke to lead 2-1 and cruised from there.
Next in Rublev’s path is Japan’s 96th-ranked Yoshihito Nishioka, who outlasted British 16th seed Daniel Evans 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 7-5 after three hours and 35 minutes.
Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios fired 35 aces on his way to beating hometown hero Frances Tiafoe 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (14-12), 6-2 and reaching the other semi-final against Sweden’s 115th-ranked Mikael Ymer.
Australia’s 63rd-ranked Kyrgios needed only 14 minutes to complete an early win over US fourth seed Reilly Opelka 7-6 (7-1), 6-2.
Kyrgios then outlasted 27th-ranked Tiafoe after two and a half hours.
Tiafoe won the last five points of the first-set tiebreaker, the last on his sixth ace, and had four match points in the second-set tiebreaker.
But Kyrgios answered with an ace, backhand winner, forehand volley winner and service return winner and forced a third set when Tiafor sent a forehand long.
Tiafoe, who won a third set earlier to defeat Dutch eighth seed Botic van de Zandschulp, hit a crosscourt forehand wide to hand Kyrgios a break to open the third set and missed a backhand to drop a break in the seventh before Kyrgios held to advance.
The Aussie hit 60 winners and saved five match points in all.
Ymer beat 54th-ranked American Sebastian Korda 6-2, 5-7, 6-3 after two hours and 27 minutes.
In the women’s section, Estonia’s Kaia Kanepi defeated Anna Kalinskaya 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-3 to reach a semi-final against Aussie Daria Saville, who beat Canadian qualifier Rebecca Marino 6-1, 7-5.
It’s Saville’s first semi-final since 2018 at Acapulco while Kanepi, her age and world rank at 37, seeks her fifth career WTA title but first since the 2013 Brussels Open.
World number 20 Victoria Azarenka, a two-time Australian Open champion, won her first match over Czech Tereza Martincova 7-6 (9-7), 6-2, but her double bid was spoiled by 21-year-old Chinese lucky loser Wang Xiyu.
Wang, seeking her first WTA title, rolled over 33-year-old Azarenka 6-1, 6-3. The 95th-ranked lefthander reached her first WTA semi-final in June at Valencia.
Wang next plays 60th-ranked Liudmila Samsonova, who upset 10th-ranked reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu 7-6 (8-6), 6-1. The 19-year-old British second seed was seeking her first semi-final since her Grand Slam triumph.
