In its filing, the Department of Motor Vehicles said Tesla advertised its Autopilot and Self-Driving technologies as more capable than they actually are, according to the Los Angeles Times. The company  “made or disseminated statements that are untrue or misleading, and not based on facts,” the DMV reportedly said in its complaints, filed with the quasi-judicial tribunal the Office of Administrative Hearings on July 28.
Tesla cars could never  “and cannot now, operate as autonomous vehicles,” the DMV said, according to the California newspaper. The DMV did not immediately return AFP’s request for comment.

1,Buyers demand price relief as dollar weakens,"Auto sector, commodity dealers say consumers anticipate a reduction in rates.","KARACHI: As the rupee gained strength against the dollar, prospective automobile buyers are inquiring about a downward revision in the prices of cars and motorcycles at local dealerships. However, auto sector stakeholders do not anticipate any immediate price reduction.
Talking to Dawn, commodity dealers also reiterated the same expectation from hard-pressed consumers who are looking for price relief amid rising inflation.
Despite claims of enhanced localisation, car, jeep, and SUV prices have risen by over Rs300,000 in the last month, depending on engine power, while motorcycle prices increased by Rs5,000–25,000 in the same period.
“Customers are expecting a price revision in vehicles and they have been inquiring about it since the rupee has started appreciating against the greenback,” a Japanese car dealer told Dawn.

Auto sector, commodity dealers say consumers anticipate a reduction in rates

He said it seemed that many buyers had been holding up their plans to purchase cars in anticipation of a downward price revision by assemblers.
Another Japanese car dealer said people were looking for a price cut. “We don’t have any answers for them.”
Talking to Dawn, Association of Pakistan Motorcycle Assemblers (APMA) Chairman Mohammad Sabir Sheikh said, “Consumers are now arguing with the dealers as to why are bike prices not coming down after the rupee appreciation.”
He said assemblers are in a fix as they have imported raw materials after opening LCs at higher rates.
Mr Sabir said one dollar now sells at Rs226 in the interbank market after hitting around Rs240.
If one dollar came to Rs200, it would make a strong case for the bike assemblers to reduce prices.
A Korean vehicle assembler said, “Let the rupee settle down a bit. A lot of uncertainty looms over the economic and political fronts. Auto assemblers will review pricing once things settle down.”
A Chinese vehicle assembler believed that the increase in prices by car assemblers was based on one dollar equalling Rs235.
“We need to see the exchange rate in the coming two weeks to decide the future vehicle price indicators,” he said. 
Some Japanese car assemblers did not answer the queries regarding prices amid a strengthening rupee.
The assembly lines of the auto industry, however, came under severe pressure after the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) strict restrictions on clearing completely knocked down (CKD) kits. After repeated requests, the SBP has started issuing some limited quotas for the assemblers to import CKD units. 
However, the central bank’s decision forced the Indus Motor Company (IMC) to observe non-production days (NPDs) from Aug 1 to 13 on a parts shortage issue. 
Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited has also hinted at following suit in case the parts shortage intensifies. Some assemblers are running their operations as they still have old stocks of parts and accessories on hand.
Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association (KWGA) Chairman Anis Majeed said commercial banks had ruined the import trade as they retired the import documents at Rs245-266 to a dollar instead of Rs239-240 in an unregulated environment.
He said no regulatory authority came out to rescue the importers as banks were making a humongous amount of money on foreign exchange transactions. 
As a result, the difference between the interbank and the bank’s negotiated price had crossed five to seven rupees to a dollar.
Mr Majeed said the business community was facing cost uncertainty, especially on the goods that the importers were bringing in on 90-120 days of credit.
“In the given circumstances, any price relief for the people on imported commodities seems a remote possibility,” the KWGA chairman said while analysing the impact of Rs20 per kg on imported commodities when one dollar had reached Rs240 from Rs195-200 in the interbank market.
He said a chance of a price cut had emerged after the rupee’s soaring value, but commercial banks had played havoc with the importers by charging extra money on retiring import documents.
“Any price relief would depend on the future exchange rate stability and world market rates. The business community has lost confidence in the current government which has failed to manage economic and trade issues,” he added.

2,"SBP, govt did not directly intervene to bring dollar down, says finance minister",Urges Pakistanis to ‘live within their means’ instead of asking for loans...,"KARACHI: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail clarified on Saturday that neither the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) nor had he “directly intervened” to bring the dollar’s value down, stating that it was influenced by market factors, Dawn.com reported.
Addressing the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), he said he disagreed with the chamber member’s stance that he had something to do with the dollar’s declining value. “Neither the SBP nor have I directly intervened (to bring the dollar down). It falls on supply and demand,” he stated.
The rupee has been on the rise against the dollar in the interbank market, gaining Rs16.26 since July 29.
During his address, the finance minister also doubled down on the government’s decision to curtail imports for the next three months, stating that it was a necessity.

Urges Pakistanis to ‘live within their means’ instead of asking for loans

“We have imposed a ban on CBU (completely built up) cars, mobile phones, and home appliances, which we will not remove till September. The restrictions on [import of items with HS codes starting with] 84 and 85 are with reason,” he said. However, the minister said authorities were working on identifying items used by exporters for manufacturing products and their import would not be stopped.
He assured them that the government had not stopped payments on any letters of credit that had been opened in the past and would not do so in the future either.
The minister noted that the country’s imports last year stood at $80 billion while its exports were a mere $31bn. The country’s current account deficit was $17.5bn while the trade deficit, after subtracting the remittances, stood at $18bn, he said.
“If you create such a wide deficit, there will be pressure on your rupee. Today, Bangladesh has increased the price of petrol to 308 (per litre). They are also under pressure. There is a very challenging environment globally.”
The finance minister said that Pakistanis should live within their means and in a dignified manner instead of asking for loans. “If we have exports of just $30bn, we should not import as much. If we do not have products to sell to the world, we should not buy things from it either,” he said. 
He said he felt ashamed when he had to meet the ministers of other countries and ask them for loans. 
“We were giving subsidies worth $500bn on petrol and [had imports worth] $7.5bn and were not exporting at all. We have to go to Saudi Arabia and the UAE and ask them to deal with the IMF (International Monetary Fund).
“We were selling petrol cheaper than the UAE. We were selling it cheaper than the country from which we buy refined oil,” he added.
He acknowledged that mistakes would be made and exporters might face problems in importing the materials they needed to manufacture products.
Mr Ismail said when he had been advised to remove the fixed tax on traders using fewer than 300 units of electricity, he had responded, “What can I do then but close the ministry? It amounts to removing tax on 96pc of shopkeepers. Why bother with the other 4pc? We should just go home.”
This is not a government versus business thing, the minister said, adding that curtailing imports was a necessity.
“Give me three months. We are all in this together. Let me save this country from problems. Pakistanis will start importing again.”

The CDNS has established an Islamic window named Rafa National Savings (RNS) whose role is to provide different Shariah-compliant inve­s­tment accounts under Sarwa Islamic Savings Account Rules 2019.  These rules have already been approved by the federal cabinet, and the operation of this scheme will be allowed from all national savings centres.

While SISA will have no tenor, SITA will comprise four different tenors — one, three, five and 10 years.  Initially, three and five-year SITA will be offered.
A notification issued by the Ministry of Finance on Friday said the expected rate of profit payable on the deposits made in SISA would be 13.50pc, and returns on the SITA deposits will be 12.60pc and 13.28pc for five and three-year tenors, respectively. 
A senior official of CDNS explained that the SISA will be opened for an unlimited period and will remain valid for principal payment and profit payment thereof, till such time it is linked to the SITA or investment is encashed or withdrawn by the registered holder.

4,Banks to issue e-PRC,KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Saturday said that a customer will receive an electronic Proceeds...,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Saturday said that a customer will receive an electronic Proceeds Realisation Certificate (e-PRC) instantly as soon as funds are credited to the account.
When a customer receives funds from abroad in his/her account in rupees, banks issue them a proof of funds received called a PRC. 
On the instructions of the SBP, banks have automated the issuance of such certificates and their verification.
The banks will also issue a statement of PRC (S-PRC) electronically to their customers, mentioning all remittances received by them from abroad during the year.
The PRC acts as proof that the funds such as workers’ remittances, export proceeds, equity investment, borrowing from abroad, etc. have been received and realised in rupees.
The beneficiary of funds can obtain this certificate upon receipt of funds in their bank account in Pakistan, or as cash over the counter from the bank.
The SBP said the S-PRC and e-PRC would be digitally issued in a standard format with a system-generated unique identification number.
With the introduction of this mechanism, the PRC verifying agencies like Pakistan Customs, Federal Board of Revenue and the SBP will be able to access the online verification portal of banks to verify e-PRCs and S-PRCs.
The central bank said that in recent years, it had taken many steps to digitise the processes related to interaction among customers, ban­ks, SBP and other agencies.

5,Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry asks PM to replace Miftah,LCCI president says the economy needs the right man for the right job.,"LAHORE: The business community on Saturday urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to replace Finance Minister Miftah Ismail to improve the deteriorating economic situation.
“The PM will have to take revolutionary measures by revisiting his economic team as the economy needs the right man for the right job,” Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) president Mian Nauman Kabir sought in a statement.
“We are of the view that economic scenario demands revolutionary measures. Therefore, a change in the economic team can bring the economy back on track,” he said. 
He said the change in the economic team would help improve the socio-economic structure of the country as there is a dire need to set a direction in the larger interests of the country. 
“There is an almost catastrophic deterioration in the macroeconomic situation that has had a profound adverse impact on growth rates, poverty incidence, unprecedented increase in inflation, especially food price inflation and confidence in Pakistan’s ability to manage crises and its future economic outlook that calls for wholesome measures to tackle the situation,” he added.
The LCCI chief said since interim reliefs might be necessary right now to continue, “this is the right time to start thinking of a long-term solution to our ills.”
“Like any successful corporate body, we must define our objectives clearly and should adopt long-term strategic plans to meet these objectives. The plan must be linked to the population growth for us to deduce how much food we require, the land needed to produce it, the schools needed to educate them, the jobs required to be created, their transportation and communication needs, hospitals to be built and so on,” he explained.

6,Commerce ministry yet to issue notification lifting import ban,"Major trading partners, especially the United States, have raised serious concerns about the imposition of the ban.","ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Commerce has yet to denotify the ban on the import of 33 classes/categories of goods despite a lapse of 10 days when the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet announced this decision.
The ECC decisions are normally endorsed in the Federal Cabinet meeting as a routine matter for legal coverage. The last cabinet meeting was held on Aug 4 chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif but the issue was not considered for approval. The ECC decided to withdraw the ban on these items on July 28.
An official source in the commerce ministry told Dawn that the cabinet has yet to endorse the decision of the ECC on the withdrawal of the ban on these items. The cabinet even did not reject the decision of the ECC, the official added.
Major trading partners, especially the United States, have raised serious concerns about the imposition of the ban given the fact that it disrupts supply chains to the domestic retail industry.
The US ambassador to Pakistan already held back-to-back meetings with Commerce Minister Naveed Qamar and Finance Minister Miftah Ismail to record his government’s concerns over the imposition of the ban.
On May 19, the coalition government imposed a ban on 33 categories of items in a plea to control the rising import bill.
The commerce ministry in the summary submitted to the ECC for withdrawal of the ban claimed that the overall imports of the banned items have shrunk by over 69pc from $399.4 million to $123.9m in two months. However, the ECC decided to lift the ban on imported goods except for complete built-up auto, mobile and home appliances units.
Further, all held-up consignments (except items that remain in the banned category), which arrived at the ports after July 1 may be cleared subject to payment of 25pc surcharge. 
“We will issue notification for withdrawal of ban after receiving cabinet decision,” the commerce ministry official further said.
The ECC decision of July 28 did not mention any procedure to withdraw the ban on those items which are in use by exporters. This clearly shows that there is a complete lack of coordination between the commerce and finance ministry over banning the import of such items.

7,Stocks stay bullish on rupee’s recovery after IMF word,KARACHI: The stock market commenced on a negative note in the outgoing week as inflation for July clocked in at 24.9...,"KARACHI: The stock market commenced on a negative note in the outgoing week as inflation for July clocked in at 24.9 per cent.
Arif Habib Ltd said in a research note the investors’ sentiment turned positive after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that Pakistan had fulfilled the last remaining prerequisite for the resumption of the loan programme i.e. incremental hike in the petroleum development levy on petrol and diesel.
The rupee strengthened against the greenback and gained Rs15.33 or 6pc week-on-week to close at 224.04. Furthermore, the trade deficit declined 47pc in July on a month-on-month basis. Moreover, a reduction in international oil prices post-Opec+ meeting further cemented the ground for a bull run on the equities. Oil index WTI traded below $88 per barrel versus $98.62 per unit a week ago.
As a result, the national equity benchmark closed at 42,096 points after gaining 1,946 points or 4.9pc on a week-on-week basis.
Sector-wise, positive contributions to the index came from banking (427 points), cement (421 points), fertiliser (112 points), chemical (111 points) and oil marketing (106 points).
Sectors that contributed negatively to the index were close-end mutual fund (three points) and real estate investment trust (one point).
Scrip-wise, positive contributors were Lucky Cement Ltd (155 points), United Bank Ltd (124 points), MCB Bank Ltd (87 points), Pakistan State Oil Company Ltd (78 points) and Colgate-Palmolive Pakistan Ltd (73 points).
Negative contributors stock-wise were Faysal Bank Ltd (10 points), Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (six points), Interloop Ltd (four points) and Adamjee Insurance Company Ltd (three points).
Foreign selling was witnessed this week as it clocked in at $0.69 million versus a net purchase of $0.57m in the preceding week. Major selling was witnessed in banking ($0.9m) and fertiliser ($0.6m) firms.
On the local front, buying was reported by brokers ($2.2m) and mutual funds ($1.6m).
The average daily volume clocked in at 263m shares, up 75pc week-on-week. The average value traded settled at $34m, up 56pc from a week ago.
According to AKD Securities Ltd, the market momentum will likely be positive next week as the country moves closer to the IMF’s disbursement of the $1.2bn loan tranche.
“The currency market will also remain buoyant and the rupee may gain further ground against the greenback as the threat of immediate default has subsided to a great extent after friendly countries came forward to bail Pakistan out,” it added.
The brokerage noted that import-oriented sectors will remain in the limelight and may end up outperforming the overall stock market. “We highlight autos, engineering and refineries may outperform in the short run,” it added.
