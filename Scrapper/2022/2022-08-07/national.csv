0,NA strength reduced to 336 as ECP issues new delimitation lists,"Fata’s 12 seats abolished, KP given six more; PPP finds fault with watchdog’s exercise.","ISLAMABAD: A key legal hitch in the way of next general elections has been removed as the polls watchdog issued final lists of national and provincial assembly constituencies, bringing down the total number of National Assembly seats from the existing 342 to 336.
Under the 25th Amendment, the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) were merged with Khyber Pakhtun­khwa pro­vince. The amendment abolished 12 NA seats of Fata and allocated six seats to KP on the basis of population. As a result, the number of general seats in the lower house of parliament came down to 266 from 272.
The fresh delimitation will now give effect to the amendment.
Women and minority seats will remain unchanged at 60 and 10, respectively.
As for provinces, Punjab will have 141 general seats in NA, Sindh 61, KP 45, and Balo­c­h­­istan 16. Islamabad will have three seats.

Fata’s 12 seats abolished, KP given six more; PPP finds fault with watchdog’s exercise

Under Article 51(5) of the Constitution and Section 17 of the Elections Act 2017, delimitation was conducted on the basis of population determined in the last census.
The ECP had cited legal hitches in conducting the elections before October, including the absence of delimitation, in case the National Assembly was dissolved by the then ruling PTI, inviting scathing criticism from the party.
‘Flawed’ census
Following the publication of final delimitation lists for 266 national and 593 provincial assembly constituencies by the ECP, the PPP rejected the exercise carried out on the basis of “flawed” census.
In charge of the party’s Central Election Cell Senator Taj Haider said delimitation could not be done on the basis of “faulty and controversial population figures”.
He said the Council of Common Interests (CCI) had accepted that the figures obtained in Census 2017 were incorrect and while validating the provisional figures in spite of Sindh’s dissenting vote had ordered a fresh census which was to be concluded before December 31, 2022.
“It is an irony that the controversial part of the CCI decision is being followed and the agreed part of conducting a fresh census is being ignored on various excuses. Such un­­fair tactics remain unwise and counter-productive. As we have seen these give rise to many more short-term and long-term problems and divisive controversies rather than amicably solving existing problems,” he remarked.

The decision to hold the ‘impressive’ power show on August 13 was taken at a meeting, chaired by PTI Chairman Imran Khan and attended by its leadership Asad Umar, Fawad Chaudhry, Shireen Mazari, Omar Ayub, Saifullah Niazi and others.
Participants in the meeting also decided to challenge the prohibited funding case at the earliest. They discussed the political situation and reviewed legal aspects regarding by-elections in nine constituencies.
According to party sources, Mr Khan at the public meeting may give an ‘ultimatum’ to the coalition government to hold fresh elections and that is why direction has been given [to party leaders] that there should be very impressive show of power.
Ex-minister and PTI leader Farrukh Habeeb also announced the public meeting through a post on social media.
The PTI had earlier decided that Mr Khan would be lone candidate from the PTI for all nine seats of National Assembly during the upcoming by-elections. The nine seats are among the 11 vacated after acceptance of resignations of PTI MNAs by the National Assembly speaker, and their de-notification, last week. The announcement that Mr Khan will contest from all nine constituencies first came from PTI’s official Twitter account on Friday, and was later confirmed by the party’s senior vice president Fawad Chaudhry a presser.
The party leadership was also briefed on legal strategy related to cases and resignations of the lawmakers.

2,Alvi should step down if he can’t perform duties: Rabbani,ISLAMABAD: Former Senate chairperson Raza Rabbani asked President Arif Alvi to resign if he can’t perform his...,"ISLAMABAD: Former Senate chairperson Raza Rabbani asked President Arif Alvi to resign if he can’t perform his duties “by reason of his political affiliation” and said the absence of the country’s “supreme commander” from martyred army officials’ funeral prayers was “a matter of deep concern”.
Meanwhile, the coalition government continued to build pressure on the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) a day after the military spokesperson said the country’s armed forces and the families of martyred security personnel have expressed “deep anguish” over a “regretful social media campaign” after the recent helicopter crash in which six army officials, including a lieutenant general, lost their loves.
On Friday, President Alvi and PTI chief Imran Khan came under the social media spotlight for not attending the funeral prayers. President Alvi has played down the “unnecessary controversy on why I did not attend Janaza of the Shaheeds recently” and condemned the “despicable tweets by those who are neither aware of our culture or our religion”.
In a statement issued on Saturday, PPP Senator Raza Rabbani presented a six-point charge sheet against President Alvi and pointed out that under Article 243(2) of the Constitution, the supreme command of the armed forces vested in the president. He said the president should resign if he was unable to perform his functions as the supreme commander.
“The supreme commander, being advised or for any other reason, not attending the funeral of the army helicopter martyrs is a matter of deep concern,” Mr Rabbani said.
Separately, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb in a press conference condemned a “social media campaign against the army by PTI trolls” and said this reflected the mindset of Imran Khan.
Meanwhile, PPP Informa­tion Secretary Faisal Karim Kundi also lamented the PTI for “running a derogatory campaign on social media” on the helicopter tragedy.

3,PTI asks court to suspend schedule of by-elections,Party argues its plea on matter of resignations is pending before court.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has requested the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to suspend the schedule for by-elections till final disposal of another petition that seeks court direction to the National Assembly Speaker and Election Commission of Pakistan to approve resignations of and denotify all the 123 MNAs belonging to the party.
PTI Chairman Imran Khan earlier announced that he would contest the by-elections on all the nine seats. The ECP only a day ago announced that by-elections would be held on nine seats of the National Assembly as the seats fell vacant after acceptance of their resignation by the NA Speaker and their de-notification by the commission.
The nine constituencies where by-elections will be held on September 25 are NA-22 Mardan, NA-24 Charsadda, NA-31 Peshawar, NA-45 Kurram, NA-108 Faisalabad, NA-118 Nankana Sahib, NA-237 Malir, NA-239 Korangi Karachi and NA-246 Karachi South.

Party argues its plea on matter of resignations is pending before court

In a civil miscellaneous application, the PTI apprised the IHC that a petition against acceptance of resignation was pending before the court, therefore, holding by-polls for the constituencies would turn the case infructuous.
He said the ECP issued the notification despite having knowledge that the de-notification of 11 MNAs had been challenged before the IHC. He requested the court to suspend the ECP’s schedule for by-elections till the final disposal of the petition for de-notification of all the 123 MNAs who tendered resignations en masse.
After preliminary hearing, the IHC issued notices to the respondents in the petition.
The petition cited NA Speaker, ECP, the cabinet division secretary and former deputy speaker Qasim Khan Suri as respondents.
It contended that after the regime change, the PTI leadership decided to tender resignation from the National Assembly since it was seeking a fresh mandate from the people of Pakistan. In pursuant to the decision of a meeting of the parliamentary party held in Parliament House on April 11, 2022, as many as 123 MNAs tendered resignations before the deputy speaker who accepted all of them forthwith, it argued.
However, the petition argued, incumbent NA Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf withheld the resignations and did not forward it to the ECP on the pretext of “so-called verification of the resignation”. 
It stated after the lapse of around three and half months, the NA speaker approved resignations of only 11 of the 123 MNAs and forwarded the same to the ECP that subsequently de-notified them.

‘Assistance to at-risk people’
The Pakistan Humanita­rian Forum (PHF), representing 35 international non-governmental organisations asked the government to allow and facilitate the international and national NGOs to deliver assistance to the people at risk in the wake of current floods in the country.
In a joint statement, the PHF and the Nat­ional Humanitarian Network (NHN) hoped that a joint response with the government will lead to a clear commitment to providing relief assistance to at-risk communities.
They requested the government to initiate a joint need assessment of the flood-affected areas. The comprehensive needs assessment would help identify humanitarian needs of the most at-risk groups, including women, children, and elderly affected by the disaster, it added.

5,"‘More tourism bane, not boon for northern areas’","German tour operator Michael Beek miffed at ""indifferent"" tourists; says tourism sans responsibility could ruin area.","

GILGIT: German journalist and tour operator Michael Beek has warned that unplanned tourism activities on some of the world’s highest mountains in Gilgit Baltistan pose a serious threat of environmental degradation.
Mr Beek has been a frequent visitor to these mountains in the past four decades and also authored a guide book “Pakistan”. After his recent trek to Nanga Parbat (8,126m) base camp, he made a post on his Facebook account highlighting the environmental degradation caused by rapid development.
In the post, he wrote: “I have just returned from Nanga Parbat, the mountain that has dominated my life since 1981. A wonderful natural paradise, such as is rarely found on our planet. I know every side of the valley, every pass and many mountain farmers, without whose help the tourists could not manage a trek.”

Michael Beek miffed at ‘indifferent’ tourists; says tourism sans responsibility could ruin area

He continued, saying: “I have often walked around this mountain and been happy. But in the last five years, everything has changed. There are now 25 hotels on Fairy Meadows and there are so many people that the peace is over. Individuals incapable of walking are carried up on horses with their mobile phones in their hands, sometimes more than 600 in one day. Plastic waste is everywhere along the path, drinking bottles are simply thrown down into the Rakhiot River, nobody cares. It makes me sad. In the meantime, a road leading to Biji (Herrligkoffer camp) in Rupal Valley where the rich drive up in their heavy off-road vehicles to distribute their rubbish. Everything is full of plastic waste and the spring river in the base camp is filthy.
“The authorities don’t care about anything. No Rangers, no waste disposal, nothing. Everyone does what they want and nature is irrevocably destroyed. I am just appalled and angry about so much ignorance and stupidity.”
Talking to Dawn Mr Beek said that he has been coming to Pakistan for the past 40 years.
“I love the country and the people. I have a lot of friends all over the country. It’s my second home,” he added. “Tourists who visit the region should understand the sensitivity of the area,” he said, adding that they should visit on foot and not on their cars or motorbikes. 
He warned that mass tourism and development in the region without responsibility and planning would result in a disaster. He observed that there should be a ban on the construction of hotels in national parks and on speed boating in lakes.
He also expressed concerns over the mass trekking activities on the K2 and its consequences for the nature. “The new expedition tourism we faced this year at K2, for example, is a disaster. Rich people in a big camp with parties in the evening and bonfires. From where do they bring wood,” he said while hinting at the environmental degradation caused by these activities.
He said the government should take responsibility and empower the forest department, public work department and environmental protection agency and help these departments to enforce the laws.

Prime Minister Hun also expressed his desire for strong bilateral ties and further engagement to promote cultural and people-to-people contact.
FM’s address
In his address to the meeting on Friday, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said Pakistan considered peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific its priority and stressed solutions instead of strategic competition among the countries.
The foreign minister also stressed to develop mechanisms and processes for a more coordinated response to future health crises, undertake efforts to ensure vaccine equity, and fight future pandemics in a more humane manner.

The foreign minister also emphasised that a peaceful, stable, prosperous and connected Afghanistan was critical for the region.
He reiterated the demand for unfre­ezing of Afghanistan’s financial assets and de-linking humanitarian assistance from political considerations.

7,BAP founder laments ‘power struggle’ amid  flood catastrophe,Senator Saeed Ahmed Hashmi says the country’s political elite is engaged in a power struggle instead of helping the victims.,"QUETTA: Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) founder and Senator Saeed Ahmed Hashmi on Saturday said that while people affected by floods in Balochistan awaited a saviour, the country’s political elite was engaged in a power struggle instead of helping the victims.
Talking to reporters, Mr Hashmi said people of Balochistan had been mired in problems after being hit by devastating floods and monsoon rains. 
He regretted that even in this state of helplessness, they were deprived of the assistance from the federal government, while the performance of provincial institutions was also dismal.
The political leadership, which claimed to represent the Baloch people and custodian of their rights, was an ally in the centre at the moment but it did not stand with the people of Balochistan in this time of need, he added.
He added that the federal government must immediately facilitate international welfare organisations to reach the flood victims and help them.
Mr Hashmi said while people were bracing the devastation left behind after the floods, the uptick in insurgency had further exacerbated their problems.
He said “helpless people” of Balochistan did not want freedom from the state, instead they demanded freedom from their backwardness, unemployment and economic hardships and their right over the coast and resources of the province.
“In order to establish peace in Balochistan and for the sake of national survival and security we will have to review our attitudes,” Mr Hashmi said.

9,Fawad questions military’s account on Zawahiri killing,KARACHI: PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said on Saturday the “question” was not about Pakistan’s soil being used in...,"KARACHI: PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said on Saturday the “question” was not about Pakistan’s soil being used in the US drone attack that killed Al Qaeda leader Ayman Al Zawahiri, but its airspace as he demanded a formal statement from ministries.
The former minister was seemingly referring to recent remarks by the military spokesperson on the matter, according to a Dawn.com report.
In a brief telephone interview with Geo News last night, the DG ISPR ruled out the possibility, saying there was no question of Pakistan soil being used for “such a purpose”.
On Saturday, Mr Chaudhry tweeted: “The question is whether Pakistan’s airspace was allowed to be used or not.” 
“Repetitive statements on Pakistan’s land not being used are unclear,” he continued, stressing that relevant ministries would have to issue a formal statement over the matter.
In a press conference on Friday, Mr Chaudhry demanded to know whether Pakistan’s airspace had been used by the United States for a recent drone strike that killed Zawahiri. “The nation wants to know whether we are again going to become a tool of the United States against Al Qaeda,” he said.
Asked about the matter, the DG ISPR said, “The Foreign Office has clarified it in detail. They are all rumours, as anybody can write anything on social media. We should avoid this. Our enemy, in particular, feeds such information and they (people) get exploited.”
The US carried out a drone strike in Kabul on Sunday morning and killed Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon who had a $25 million bounty on his head for helping coordinate the Sept 11, 2001 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.
Immediately after it was reported, a number of PTI leaders raised questions about Pakistan’s role in the attack, prompting the ISPR clarification.
In an interview with Express News earlier this week, former premier Imran Khan warned that “providing airspace to America” could damage relations with Afghanistan.
“If we give space and if America conducts a drone attack in Afghanistan, it will affect our tribal areas. Do we want to become a part of someone else’s war amid these crises?” he asked.
