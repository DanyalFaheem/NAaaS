0,‘Faysal Bank to be Sharia-compliant by end of 2022’,"Faysal Bank will formally apply for an Islamic banking licence in September, its CFO says.","KARACHI: Faysal Bank Ltd will become a full-fledged Islamic lender by the end of 2022 after ring-fencing its residual conventional loan portfolio, said Chief Financial Officer Syed Majid Ali on Tuesday.
Speaking at a press briefing at the bank’s head office, Mr Ali said the commercial lender will surrender its conventional banking mandate once the regulator grants it the licence for Islamic banking. Faysal Bank will formally apply for an Islamic banking licence in September, he added.
Five Islamic banks and 17 conventional banks with Islamic banking branches currently operate in Pakistan. The share of Islamic banking assets in the overall banking industry is 18.6 per cent while the share of Sharia-compliant deposits stands at 19.4pc.
“There’s never been a conversion of a conventional bank to an Islamic bank at such a massive scale. What we’ve done here is going to be taught as a case study worldwide,” said Mr Ali.
Faysal Bank decided to convert its entire business from conventional to Sharia-compliant five years ago. It adopted the “asset-led conversion” model, which prioritised the conversion of banking assets such as investments and financings over that of liabilities like deposits.
Besides making all new branches Sharia-compliant from day one, the bank started converting its conventional business into Islamic one branch at a time.  As a result, only one of the 639 branches remains conventional as of today. Even that branch will become Sharia-compliant by the end of this year, the CFO said.
The size of Faysal Bank’s balance sheet was Rs997 billion at the end of June. Its unconsolidated quarterly profit increased 17.3pc year-on-year to Rs2.25bn for the latest three-month period.
The bank currently holds treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds — conventional investment avenues forbidden under Islamic banking regulations — worth roughly Rs70 billion. “We’ll soon dispose of these holdings,” said Mr Ali.
Responding to a question about the paucity of Sharia-compliant investment avenues for the deployment of liquidity, Mr Ali said the conversion wouldn’t be possible had the bank stayed overly focused on the ifs-and-buts of the process. “So what if we’ll have fewer investment avenues?” he said while emphasising the need for following the letter of the religious injunctions against interest-based banking.
Replying to a comment about the similarity of the rates of return offered by conventional and Islamic banks despite the proclaimed differences between the two types, Faysal Bank’s head of Islamic banking Muhammad Faisal Shaikh said its reason is the Karachi interbank offered rate (Kibor), a reference rate at which banks borrow overnight funds from each other in the money market.
“Kibor is a pricing benchmark. A pricing mechanism doesn’t make anything halal or haram,” he said.

1,"Toyota, Millat shut plants",Plants shut down due to parts shortages and delivery disruptions because of flood devastation across the country.,"KARACHI: The auto sector crisis deepened as Indus Motor Company (IMC) and Millat Tractor Ltd (MTL) on Tuesday announced production shutdowns due to parts shortages and delivery disruptions due to flood devastation across the country. 
The assembler of Toyota vehicles informed the Pakistan Stock Exchange that its plant will remain shut from Sept 1-16 due to parts shortages caused by import restrictions. 
IMC also kept production suspended from Aug 1-13 attributing it to the State Bank of Pakistan’s mechanism for the auto sector to obtain prior approval for importing completely knocked down (CKD) kits and components of passenger cars.
Usually, the contractual and daily wage workers are laid off from the assembly lines during non-production days (NPDs). When contacted, IMC Chief Executive Officer Ali Asghar Jamali told Dawn on Tuesday that “we have not offloaded any contractual and daily wage workers in the wake of NPDs and we have no plans to do so in the near future.” 
He added that overall employees’ strength in IMC is over 4,000.
The company in a stock exchange filing said that the delay in approvals for the clearance of import consignments had created hurdles resulting in a significant reduction in parts availability and consequently creating an adverse impact on the supply chain and production activities.
IMC resumed the booking of vehicles recently after keeping it suspended from May 18 onwards.
Production of Toyota Yaris and Corolla in July plunged to 2,566 units from 4,181 units in July 2021 while that of jeeps and pickups stood at 1,016 units versus 1,082 in July 2021.
Mashood Ali Khan, an auto part maker/exporter, said only IMC supported the small and medium-sized auto parts vendors during Covid-19 and now again offering a breathing space by giving interest-free loans to these vendors for their survival during NPDs starting from July onwards. The loans can be returned from January-June next year from sales.
He said other auto assemblers should also come forward to support small and medium-sized part makers otherwise they would resort to laying off workers or closing down their plants due to increases in raw material prices and other overhead costs.
Mr Mashood also urged the assemblers to announce NPDs simultaneously rather than on different dates so that vendors could also manage their operations.
Millat Tractors Ltd (MTL) in a stock filing said it would also keep its production operations closed from Aug 31 to Sept 16. 
The company said tractor deliveries have been affected due to damaged road infrastructure in view of devastating floods all over Pakistan followed by parts shortages.

2,Rupee stages slight recovery vs dollar,KARACHI:  The rupee appreciated slightly against the US dollar on Tuesday following the approval  of a $1.1 billion...,"KARACHI:  The rupee appreciated slightly against the US dollar on Tuesday following the approval  of a $1.1 billion tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
Stakeholders  in the economy and currency dealers had anticipated the rupee to  rebound strongly against the greenback with the revival of IMF loan programme.
On Tuesday, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported the  closing price of the dollar at Rs220.12 in the interbank market while  independent sources said the actual price for the greenback was Rs221.  The dollar lost Rs1.80 against the rupee.
However, currency  dealers in banks revealed that the SBP was against a sharp depreciation  of the dollar in one-go as exporters were allowed to market their holdings. 
“The dollar could see a steep cut of up to four or five  rupees with the resumption of the IMF loan, but the SBP, which manages  the exchange rate with verbal instructions, did not allow the market to  see a sudden devaluation of the dollar,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency  dealer in the banks. He added that this was done to support the  exporters get benefits and off-load their dollar holdings. 
Some  currency analysts said the dollar would not fall to the pre-regime  change levels in April. The reason for this assumption was the flood-related devastation which caused massive  loss of crops, livestock, bridges, and roads, and the displacement of 30  million people. They said the  resettlement requires massive investment, while exports would suffer due  to the loss of crops, and a higher cost of doing business due to high  inflation and the global recession.
The  Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported the dollar  was traded at a price of Rs222 on Tuesday while it was pegged at Rs230  on Monday – a decline of Rs8 per dollar. 
The open market has been  facing a severe shortage of foreign currencies as it seeks to increase its dollar holdings.

However, investors opted for profit-taking across the board in the later part of the trading session, said Arif Habib Ltd.
The statement by the IMF on the need for a tight monetary policy amid higher inflation coupled with concerns for weakening exports on a global recession and surging energy prices played the role of a catalyst in bearish activity, said analyst Ahsan Mehanti.

7,Disbursement of Rs103bn to flood-hit families okayed,"ECC tells finance ministry to consult BISP on financial implications, orders import of 1.6m tonnes of wheat to meet higher needs.","• ECC directs finance ministry to consult BISP on financial implications
• Orders import of 1.6m tonnes of wheat to meet higher demand
ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday approved immediate disbursement of Rs25,000 each to 4.125 million families affected by the recent rains and floods, involving an additional fiscal impact of Rs103 billion, and ordered 1.6m tonnes of wheat imports to meet higher needs arising from the natural disaster.
The decisions were taken at a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet presided over by Minister for Finance Miftah Ismail. The meeting also authorised the signing of agreements with a couple of G-20 countries under the Covid-19 debt relief initiative for the poor nations, announced in April 2020.
The Ministry of Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety submitted a summary for emergency cash assistance to families affected by flash floods in 2022. The meeting was told that under the prime minister’s directives, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) had already disbursed about Rs30bn to more than 1.13m families at the rate of Rs25,000 out of its own budgetary allocation for the current fiscal year, which was to be reimbursed by the Ministry of Finance.

However, the number of affected people had increased and the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA) and BISP had identified 4.125m beneficiaries on the basis of revised criteria approved by the prime minister to a scorecard of 32. The estimated budget impact at this stage was estimated at Rs103.12bn. However, the number of affected families could go higher in view of the evolving situation following unprecedented rains and flash floods across the country that caused loss of lives and properties and assessments were in progress.
The ECC approved the summary and directed BISP to disburse Rs25,000 per household in calamity-affected districts for a poverty score of up to 32. It was also decided that the finance ministry should hold consultations with the BISP on the overall financial implications based on the allocated budget of the BISP and timelines for releases to the BISP given the emergency situation and what should be the modalities based on the revenue collection stream. The meeting also decided that the federal government will “ask the provinces to provide their share of the relief for flood-affected populations”.
TCP directed to arrange wheat
The ECC also revived the requirement for strategic wheat stocks to 2m tonnes from its earlier reduced target of 1m tonnes and resultantly ordered additional wheat imports of 1.6m tonnes. The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) was directed to arrange a further quantity of 0.8m tonnes through government-to-government (G2G) or open tender. According to an official statement, the private sector is permitted to import 0.8m tonnes of wheat with the proviso that no subsidies are provided for such imports of wheat.
The Ministry of National Food, Secu­rity and Research (MN­FSR), which sought the re-fixing of national wheat strategic reserves to the level of 2m tonnes, reported that a ministerial committee on July 15 had decided to reduce the strategic stock level from 2m tonnes to 1m tonnes and total imports were contained to 1.6m tonnes instead of an earlier decision of 3m tonne imports taken on May 9, 2022.
Read: Looming shortages
The TCP has already booked 986,000 tonnes of wheat through international tenders, and a G2G offer from Russia was declined due to the higher offered price. It was explained that after commitments and distribution of 10.1m tonnes of wheat to all stakeholders, there would be a carryforward stock of about 996,000 tonnes, which was insufficient in the wake of recent rains and flood damage and resultant financial issues of farmers for the next wheat sowing, increasing local prices on top of hoarding and smuggling issues.
Therefore, the MNFSR advocated that in order to ensure wheat availability across the border and to stabilise local wheat prices, it was necessary that the quantum of wheat strategic reserves be retained at the level of 2m tonnes.
Therefore, the ECC approved the revision of its earlier decision for the import of 3m tonnes of milling wheat and allowed for the maintenance of strategic reserves of wheat at a level of 2m tonnes, including a quantity of 80,000 tonnes on account of the Saarc food bank.
Rs7m grant to host FATF team
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MEA) presented a summary of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). This debt relief, termed DSSI-I, for IDA-eligible countries to mitigate the socio-economic impact of Covid-19 was announced in April 2020. Currently, a further six agreements for DSSI-III with Italy, Japan and Spain have been negotiated and finalised. The ECC authorised the MEA to sign the agreed rescheduling of the agreements.
The ECC also approved a Rs7m technical supplementary grant to host a 15-member delegation of the Financial Action Task Force and Asia-Pacific Group (FATF/APG). The National FATF Coordination Committee on AML/CFT had sought the grant for expenditure related to the on-site visit of a FATF/APG assessors’ team to verify the stance of Pakistan as reported in cyclic reports before formally exiting the country from the so-called grey list after four years.
The Ministry of Comm­unication submitted a summary for an extension of time to complete the business plan of the National Highway Authority (NHA) from June 30 to Sept 30, 2022. It was reported that the NHA has already shared information with an Asian Development Bank-sponsored consultant, John Standingford, in preparation for its business plan. However, additional time was required to complete the work. The ECC allowed the extension with the condition that no further extensions would be given. In case a further extension is sought, the Finance Division will start deducting interest from the NHA on Cash Development Loans.
