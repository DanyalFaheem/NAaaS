0,More flood aid pours in as world lends a helping hand,"US announces $30m for flood-hit people; Canada and Australia pledge $5m, $2m, respectively.","ISLAMABAD: The international community has continued to lend a helping hand to Pakistan in the wake of floods of epic proportions that claimed the lives of at least 1,100 people and left more than half of the country submerged.
On Tuesday, Canada, Ireland, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States became the latest states to provide monetary and material support to flood-hit Pakistan as part of the global response against flooding in the country.
The US Agency for International Development (USAID) announced an additional $30 million in life-saving humanitarian assistance to support people and communities affected by severe flooding.
The United States also provided over $1.1 million in grant and project support earlier this month to ensure direct assistance reached the communities most impacted and to help mitigate and prevent the effects of future floods, according to a statement.

The US embassy in Islamabad said that in response to the Pakistan government’s request for assistance, the US will prioritise urgently needed food support, safe water, sanitation and hygiene improvements, financial help, and shelter assistance.
Meanwhile, Canada announced $5 million in funding for humanitarian assistance to support Pakistan. Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted that his country will continue to provide food, clean water and other essential services through trusted partners.
Minister for International Development and Pacific Economic Development Agency Harjit Sajjan, while announcing the assistance in Ottawa, said that Canada’s support will help scale up the humanitarian resp­onse to provide critical emergency assistance, including food and cash assistance.
On August 19, Canada contributed to the initial funding of $3 million from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which will be used for health, nutrition, food security and water and sanitation services in flood-affected areas.
Meanwhile, a meeting of the office-bearers of local Pakistani-Canadian organisations in Ottawa was held at the Pakistan High Commission to coordinate the efforts of Canadians living in Pakistan and Canadians of Pakistani origin for relief and rehabilitation of the people affected by floods.
Similarly, the Australian government announced $2 million in urgent humanitarian assistance and said that the support will be delivered through the World Food Programme to assist Pakistan and its people in responding to immediate humanitarian needs, particularly women, children and vulnerable communities.
Furthermore, after the directives of Qatari Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the gas-rich country provided the first batch of urgent aid to Pakistan which contained 21,000 food baskets, 5,000 tents, and 5,000 personal hygiene kits aiming to benefit 35,000 individuals.
Ireland announced an initial commitment of 500,000 euros of Irish Aid support to Pakistan. The funds will be allocated to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Concern Worldwide. The IFRC through their local partner will provide emergency shelter, unconditional cash grants to the worst affected and primary healthcare with a specific focus on the special health needs of women and children.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office spokesperson said that a first flight from the UAE carrying relief items landed on Tuesday afternoon at Noor Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi. The relief assistance includes food items, medical supplies and tents for the flood victims. Another flight carrying assistance was also expected to land in Rawalpindi by the evening.

MOSCOW: Mikhail Gor­bachev, who ended the Cold War without bloodshed but failed to prevent the collapse of the Soviet Union, died on Tuesday. He was 92.
Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, forged arms reduction deals with the United States and partnerships with Western powers to remove the Iron Curtain that had divided Europe since World War Two and bring about the reunification of Germany.
On becoming general secretary of the Soviet Com­munist Party in 1985, aged just 54, he had set out to revitalise the system by introducing limited political and economic freedoms, but his reforms spun out of control.
His policy of ‘glasnost’ — free speech — allowed previously unthinkable criticism of the party and the state, but also emboldened nationalists who began to press for independence in the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithua­nia, Estonia and elsewhere.
Many Russians never forgave Gorbachev for the turbulence that his reforms unleashed, considering the subsequent plunge in their living standards too high a price to pay for democracy.

2,Israel jails former Gaza chief of US-based aid agency for 12 years,"Mohammed al-Halabi was accused of ""funnelling millions of dollars to the Hamas group""; will appeal verdict to SC, says lawyer.","

BEERSHEBA: An Israeli court on Tuesday sentenced the former Gaza head of a major US-based aid agency to 12 years in prison for “funnelling millions of dollars to the Hamas group”.
The Beersheba district court in southern Israel issued a sentence of “12 years’ prison time, less the detention” already served for World Vision’s Mohammed al-Halabi.
The court had ruled in June that Halabi was guilty of siphoning off millions of dollars and tonnes of steel to Hamas, which controls the Palestinian enclave.
Halabi, who was arrested in June 2016 and indicted in August that year, has denied any irregularities throughout his past six years in detention.
His lawyer reiterated his claim to innocence following Tuesday’s sentencing.
“He says that he’s innocent, he did nothing and there is no evidence,” Maher Hanna said. “On the contrary, he proved in the court above any reasonable doubt that he made sure that no money will be (given) directly to Hamas.”
According to Hanna, if Halabi had admitted to wrongdoings, he would have been released. “But he insisted that truth also has value. And for his personal values and for the international humanitarian work values, he insisted on the truth, and he cannot admit a thing that he did not do,” the lawyer said.
Hanna said they would appeal the verdict to the supreme court. The Israeli prosecution said it was also considering an appeal.
Halabi had been convicted of membership in Hamas and of financing terrorist activities, of having “transmitted information to the enemy” as well as the possession of a weapon. Much of the evidence against him was kept secret, with Israel citing “security concerns”, prompting his legal team to question the verdict’s legitimacy.
The 12-year sentence was also meant to deter Gazans working in international aid groups from aiding Hamas, according to the court.
In Gaza, Halabi’s mother described the anguish of following what she called an unjust trial. “I felt like I was having a nervous breakdown, and I was screaming,” Amal al-Halabi said.
“This is injustice. Where is the international community and where are Moham­med’s human rights?” Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch, called the 12-year sentence a “profound miscarriage of justice,” with the six-year trial and use of secret evidence constituting a “mockery of due process”.

3,Iraqi protesters disperse after Moqtada Sadr demands end to deadly clashes,"Clashes leave 30 dead, hundreds wounded; army lifts nationwide curfew.","BAGHDAD: Iraqi supporters of powerful cleric Moqtada Sadr withdrew on Tuesday from Baghdad’s Green Zone after he dema­nded an end to fighting between rival forces and the army that left 30 dead and hundreds wounded.
The violence that erupted on Monday pitted Sadr loyalists against Shia factions backed by neighbouring Iran, with the sides exchanging gunfire across barricades — violence the United Nations warned risked tipping the war-ravaged country deeper into chaos.
After Sadr’s speech was broadcast live on television, his supporters started dismantling encampments and clearing the Green Zone, where municipal workers began cleaning up shells and bullet casings left in the wake of the unrest.
The army lifted a nationwide curfew, with concrete barriers removed from main thoroughfares and traffic slowly starting to trickle back to its normal flow.
Sadr, a grey-bearded prea­cher with millions of devoted followers who once led a militia against Ame­rican and Iraqi government forces, gave followers “60 minutes” to withdraw after which he would threaten to “disavow” those who remained.
“I apologise to the Iraqi people, the only ones affected by the events,” Sadr said in a speech from his base in the central city of Najaf.
“Shame on this revolution... Regardless of who was the initiator, this revolution, as long as it is marred by violence, is not a revolution,” he said.
