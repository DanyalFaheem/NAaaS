5,Case against 50 for stealing ration bags in Rajanpur,"DERA GHAZI KHAN: The Fazilpur city police have registered a case against 50 flood-affected people, three of them...","DERA GHAZI KHAN: The Fazilpur city police have registered a case against 50 flood-affected people, three of them nominated, on the allegation of snatching 100 or so ration bags from a government warehouse.  
Hundreds of villages in Pachad or arid zone and Rajanpur are  still disconnected from Fazilpur. Growing food crisis in the flood-affected areas of Rajanpur and Dera Ghazi Khan is transforming into lawlessness as incidents of snatching of ration bags and relief goods are on the rise.  
On Aug 27, around 50 residents of Fazilpur stole ration bags from  the warehouse established by the government at Associate College. The city  police registered a case against them.  
Earlier, in Rojhan tehsil, a number of people looted food items from two trucks of relief goods. In a similar incident in Fazilpur, people snatched ration after getting access to two trucks loaded with relief goods for people of arid zone and tribal area.  
A government servant told Dawn that delay in construction of steel bridge to connect Fazilpur and Hajipur (arid zone) and tribal area was causing delay in rescue and relief activities. Imran, a resident of an affected area, told Dawn that people were facing an acute shortage of food as they had been shelterless for the last one month. There was also no fodder for cattle, he said. People were forced to use improvised ‘drum boats’ to cross the flooded area adjacent to the broken bridge on Dajil Hajipur Road. 
Meanwhile, hundreds of graveyards have been submerged by floodwaters.  
DROWNS: A resident of Chak Ahmedani of Fazilpur drowned in floodwater. Mujahid tried to move away from his village but drowned, says journalist Amin Anjum.  
COMMISSIONER: Liaquat Ali Chattha assumed the charge of commissioner, DG Khan, and visited the flood-affected areas of Rajanpur.  
Presiding over a meeting at Rajanpur DC office, he got a briefing from Deputy Commissioner Arif Rahim and ordered construction of a permanent bridge to connect Lalgarh (Hajipur) with Fazilpur.  
Secretary Agriculture South Punjab Saqib Ali Attil, Chief Engineer Sajid Rizvi and others were present.  
The DC said that according to the preliminary report, 70 per cent of the area of Rajanpur district was affected by the flood due to hill torrents. He said 102,420 people were rescued, dry ration was being distributed and 129,520 people were being given three meals a day.

6,"Acquittal not part of ‘criminal baggage’, rules Lahore High Court",Says making a case in which acquittal took place a part of list of cases amounts to prejudice the court.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has ruled that a criminal case has no relevance against an accused after acquittal, therefore, mentioning such a case in a list of cases against that person is a violation of his fundamental rights and an attempt to prejudice the mind of the courts through misrepresentation.
“The practice of submitting only a list of criminal cases registered against a petitioner/accused without the final fate or present status of such case(s) is hereby deprecated by this court,” Justice Ali Zia Bajwa says in a verdict issued on a petition by a man challenging alleged harassment by the police.  
In its response, Sattukatla police told the court that the petitioner was involved in a number of criminal cases and the petition was filed to just pressurise the police not to opt for the due course of law.
However, a counsel for the petitioner refuted the stance taken by the police saying his client stood acquitted by the courts in a number of cases, therefore, enlisting those cases against his name amounted to an attempt to prejudice the mind of the court.

Says making a case in which acquittal took place a part of list of cases amounts to prejudice the court

In the verdict, Justice Bajwa observes that it is a common practice of police to produce a list of criminal cases registered against a petitioner, knocking the door of the courts for relief.
He states that past criminal history has, sometimes, profound impact and is often considered by courts while granting bail, which is a relief discretionary in nature, or other relief rooted in equity.
The judge notes that more than often the criminal history of a petitioner is placed on the record by police which contains a number of cases in which he already stands acquitted.
He says the criminal history must only reflect the cases where an accused was convicted, including suspended sentences and all pending first information reports (FIRs), wherein he stands arraigned as an accused.
The cases wherein prosecution resulted in acquittal or discharge, or when court quashed the FIR or the prosecution stands withdrawn cannot be considered against an accused, the judge adds.
Issuing directions to police regarding submission of criminal history of a petitioner/accused, Justice Bajwa says the list must show the status of criminal case(s) against an accused.  
He says the fate of every criminal case must be entered in the relevant police register immediately after the pronouncement of judgment/order.
The judge maintains that the final fate of a criminal case is always decided by the court, therefore, a better coordination mechanism must be evolved/improved to promptly convey the judgment/order of the court to the police station concerned for its entry in the relevant record.
Regarding the grievance of the petitioner against alleged illegal harassment, the judge directs the SHO concerned to remain within four corners of law and not to travel beyond the sphere of his legal duties.

7,Notices on Raas’ ICA against FIA summons,LAHORE: A Lahore High Court division bench on Tuesday issued notices on an intra-court appeal (ICA) of provincial...,"LAHORE: A Lahore High Court division bench on Tuesday issued notices on an intra-court appeal (ICA) of provincial minister for school education Murad Raas, challenging dismissal of his petition by a single bench against a call-up notice of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in ‘prohibited’ funding inquiry against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).
The minister, through his counsel, contended the FIA unlawfully took cognizance of the matter relating to the prohibited funding and fake accounts after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) issued its decision.
He said the inquiry initiated by the FIA was nothing but political victimisation.
The counsel said the single bench dismissed the petition of the appellant without considering facts of the matter.
He asked the division bench to set aside the single bench’s decision and also the impugned notice issued by the FIA to the appellant for being unlawful and based on mala fide.
He also urged the bench to restrain the agency from taking any coercive measure against the appellant till the next hearing.
The division bench headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, however, did not issue any stay order and sought replies from the respondents by Sept 14.
The FIA had initiated the inquiry into the matter pertaining to the ECP order in the PTI ‘prohibited’ funding case. An investigation team was notified just a few days after a three-member ECP bench in a unanimous verdict ruled that the PTI received prohibited funding in the case pending since 2014.  
The FIA says the probe is being conducted under Section 6 of the Political Parties Order, 2002. 
The agency has issued notices to several leaders of the PTI across the country.

9,Evacuation continues amid threat of more flooding in south Punjab,"PDMA DG says 108,315 flood-affected people have been provided medical treatment and 12,491 animals have been saved.","MUZAFFARGARH / BAHAWAL-PUR / MIANWALI: People in various parts of south Punjab on Tuesday continued to face an ordeal due to rain and flood.  
Twelve union councils of Layyah district have been affected by  floodwater of the Indus river; 12 schools and eight basic health units have been submerged by water in the city which is half a kilometre away from the river. The government has already declared an emergency in the city as the flow of water in the river was  644,000 cusecs on Tuesday.  
An official, Ghulam Raza Khan, claimed that  several union councils had been affected. Officials of the district administration and police helped people in evacuation, he added. 
Deputy Commissioner Imtiaz Ahmad Khichi said efforts were being made to save the spurs of Shah Grahinwala.  
Floodwater entered villages of Muzaffargarh’s Alipur and Jatoi tehsils where  houses and hundreds of acres of crops were under water. Still some  families have yet to vacate their homes. Alipur’s Zamindara Bund  was breached and water moved to populated areas.  
Muzaffargarh Deputy  Commissioner Ali Anan Qamar claimed that next two to three days were critical for Kot Addu and Alipur tehsils. He said  the Punjab government had provided tents and  food items to the affected families.  
District Police Officer Ahmad Nawaz Shah said the SHOs of all police stations had been deputed on riversides to provide food items to the people. He said the riverine check posts had been  declared flood relief camps.  
Meanwhile, many families of Taunsa Sharif, which have been affected by the Indus  river floods last week, reached Muzaffargarh. Shabbir Ahmad, who heads a five-member family, said they came to Kot Addu to stay at a safe place but returned to Taunsa Sharif where they had nothing to eat. He said  his cattle and house had been swept away. As word got round, officials reached  the spot and provided food to the family and asked them to live in a relief camp.  
BAHAWALPUR: The Sutelj river near  the city was flowing at its full capacity and poses a flood threat to the local  population in the coming days in case of release of water from across the border at Gandasingwala head near Kasur district. 
The  apprehension was expressed by Divisional Commissioner Raja Jahnagir  Anwar while inspecting the Islam (Pallah) Headworks near Hasilpur on  Vehari Road, about 90kms away from here. He was accompanied by Irrigation Chief  Engineer Khalid Bashir Ahmed and other  officials.  
The chief engineer briefed the commissioner on the  incoming water flow in the river which passes through Bahawalnagar, Chishtian and Hasilpur and after crossing through  Bahawalpur city falls in the Chenab river near Ahmedpur East. It increases the  water capacity at Panjnad Headworks near Uch Sharif.  
The  commissioner feared release of surplus water by India, which could create problems in Bahawalnagar and Bahawalpur. He said the Indian officials had stored 78 per cent water in its Hakra  Dam on Sutlej. “If it full to its capacity and the rains continue on Indian side, they may release water in the river without informing Pakistan,” he said. He directed the officials to be  alert. 
MIANWALI: The evacuation process continued in several areas amid high flood warning  in Mianwali. 
The Flood Forecasting  Division said a very high level flood was expected at Kalabagh and Chashma.  
Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Umair said 47 mauzas were facing a threat of high flood in the district. He said 41 mauzas were located on the banks of the Indus river between Jinnah and Chashma barrages. He said six mauzas were located  downstream river between Chashma and Taunsa barrages.  
He said a population of more than 400,000 was feared to be hit by the flood. The cities were safe from  flooding as they were higher than the river, he said.  
He said 10 flood relief camps had been set up in the three tehsils of the district, providing food and shelter to the distressed.  
A handout issued by Provincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Faisal Farid in Lahore said that on the instructions of the Punjab government, the PDMA and other provincial agencies were carrying out relief activities in the flood-affected areas. The DG said 108,315 flood-affected people had been provided medical treatment and 12,491 animals had been saved.  
The relief commissioner Punjab and other officers were monitoring the activities in the flood-affected areas and were trying to provide all possible facilities to the victims. He said the teams were working to estimate the damage caused by the flood.

10,Activists demand release of missing persons,LAHORE: Human rights activists and various student bodies on Tuesday reminded the state of its responsibilities...,"LAHORE: Human rights activists and various student bodies on Tuesday reminded the state of its responsibilities towards its citizens and demanded immediate release of all the missing persons in the country besides action against their abductors.
On the occasion of International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances, observed annually on Aug 30, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) organised a protest outside the press club here that was attended by dozens of rights defenders and student organisations. The commission had also affixed, inside sacks of cement, an installation, placards bearing pictures of several missing persons, the places they disappeared from and the dates of their disappearance.
The demonstrators shouted names of each of the missing persons whose photos featured at the gathering and demanded their release. They were holding posters inscribed with slogans such as ‘Frontier Corps should immediately vacate Pashtun regions’, ‘Har shehri ka tahaffuz riyasat ki zimmadari hai’ (the state is responsible for protecting every citizen), ‘Release all Pashtun missing persons’, ‘Ali Wazir ko reha karo’ (Release Ali Wazir) among others. Some of the slogans the demonstrators were shouting demanded release of all missing persons, including Baloch, Pashtuns, Sindhis, Punjabis, and that enforced disappearances be declared illegal.
Addressing the occasion in Punjabi, Amjad Saleem Minhas from Punjab Lok Sangat said it had been a longstanding demand that if a person had committed a crime he/she should be presented before a court, a case should be registered and, if a crime was proved, punished under the law. 
“If a state just abducts a person, it shows that it is too weak to proclaim the commission of a crime. This means there are certain elements within the state that consider themselves above the law. We condemn such lawlessness and extra-constitutional steps. From the heart of Punjab and Pakistan, Lahore, we stand with our Baloch and Pashtun brothers and everyone picked up unlawfully, and demand their release,” Minhas added. 
Raja Ashraf from the HRCP said over 1,100 people from Balochistan and over 1,400 people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were missing or they were subjected to forcible disappearance. He also mentioned the case of journalist Mudassar Naru who, he said, had been missing for four years, and his wife was also found dead while campaigning for his recovery.
“There are people missing for even decades with no knowledge of their whereabouts. Their families don’t know if they’re even alive. No constitution or civilised state in the world can tolerate people being kept missing,” he said.
Muhammad Tehseen of the SAP-Pakistan mentioned that the HRCP’s local chapters were demonstrating in all big cities of the country simultaneously on the occasion. 
“There’s a village with only 34 houses and there’s not a single house where someone isn’t missing. In Khuzdar and some areas, they freed some people out of whom some can’t even remember their names or recognise their families due to the treatment meted out to them. There is a need to declare this act of illegally picking someone up unlawful.”
He also questioned why those picking up innocent people could not be prosecuted.
Prof Raheemul Haque maintained it was important for voices to be raised from cities like Lahore. 
“The nation cannot progress while people are being picked up. If there’s lawlessness, there will be no investment.”
Rubina Ghazal from the Centre for Legal Aid Assistance & Settlement commented that if activists and other people were picked up, it’ll create fear in society. 
“We demand the government and relevant institutes arrange meetings of families with their abducted relatives and simultaneously conduct investigations into the alleged crimes of the abductees.”
Riaz Khan Mehsud of the Pashtun Education Development Movement at the Punjab University, in a scathing address, called enforced disappearances a violation of law and the Constitution. He said that anyone who talked about the law and Constitution, rights and security, peace and justice was picked up in broad daylight. 
“Enforced disappearances are an international crime started by former president retired Gen Pervez Musharraf in 1999. A state has a social contract with a citizen that ensures rights to a person and the state is responsible for his/her security. Many Baloch, Pakhtun and Sindhi nationalists have been going missing for decades. Whoever demands peace, justice, security is picked up and kept in internment centres for years, and in some cases their bodies are sent back. This country and society will only function when law and constitution will prevail.” 
He also mentioned how MNA Ali Wazir had been imprisoned in a ‘fake FIR’ for two years for, what he called, criticising terrorism, demanding peace and rule of law and Constitution.
Qaiser Javed of the Progressive Students Collective spoke about the missing persons bill whose passage was impeded. He also mentioned the case of Faheem Baloch, a publisher recently picked up form Karachi, and how his whereabouts were so far unknown. “If they’re so afraid of literature and education then they can eliminate education from this country too,” he said.

LWMC: The board of directors (BoD) of the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) has asked the company management to speed up the work to search for a new suitable new landfill site outside the provincial metropolis for the timely waste collection and disposal of the solid waste. 
“We should utilise our resources to provide citizens with the latest sanitation facilities. To achieve this goal, a new landfill site must be selected for the dumping of the waste,” LWMC BoD Chairman Atif Chaudhry said at the 129th meeting of the board. 
He sought to invite foreign investors to set up waste-to-energy projects at the existing Lakhudair landfill site in Lahore. The chairman was of the view that the new board members must be entrusted with the responsibilities of heading various committees. He said better solid waste management can only be possible with the enforcement of relevant laws in the city. 
Board members say the company should be made an authority for the enforcement of laws. They also sought citizens’ cooperation to make Lahore clean. They said the citizens must know that garbage should be thrown in dustbins.  
Earlier, LWMC Managing Director Rafia Haidar gave a detailed briefing to the board members.

Binyamin Masih and his wife, Nasreen Bibi, who were flanked by their relatives, told the journalists that on July 25, his daughter went to a nearby shop in Youhanabad for grocery. 
The shopkeeper closed the shutter of his shop, made their daughter hostage and raped her.  
When the girl started crying for help, the suspect escaped from the scene through the backdoor.  
The victim’s parents filed a complaint with the Saddar Police Station but police did not register the case. Later, they moved the order and on the court order, police registered a first information report (FIR) under Section 511 (intent to commit crime) and Section 376 (rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code one month after the incident.  
Police did not dispatch the DNA samples for laboratory tests, the girl’s father alleged. However, police did not arrest the suspect, he said and added that he had bribed the investigating officer (IO) who was the family for conciliation. He further claimed that his family was also facing threats of dire consequences.  
Police spokesperson Saif Ali Wains told Dawn that police were not informed about rape. He said police would interrogate the case on merit; however, if the victim’s family had any grievances, it could approach the district police officer or SP investigation.
