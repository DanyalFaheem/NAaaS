Introducing Sherry as an experienced editor and politician, Bandial said she has done a great job of compiling, editing and publishing the collection of essays by 22 Pakistani women writers. 
Sherry, explaining the inspiration behind publishing the book, said the essays contextualize the place of women in the Pakistani settings, where they are struggling for space and identity. She said despite materialistic progress, women still needed to explain themselves. These explanations are about the available space and the space being sought, and about their identity. She said our societal values and family norms held back all women under the cover of narratives laced with modesty and loyalty. 
The moderator took the discussion to feminism, which challenges societal chains. 
Sherry said that to her, feminism is a way of life. “Yes, it’s a way of life, where instead of focusing on that how others think about you, feminism teaches how you think about other people.” 
She said feminism had redefined women. It gave a chance for women to be courageous and speak out on the matters that matter.  Sherry also differentiated between the first women’s activism exhibited during the Zia rule and the ongoing Aurat March. During the 80s, the women challenged state oppression, draconian laws and shrinking space for women. 
The Aurat March had no such challenges to take on. But the looming threat for Aurat March was extremists’ threats. She said Aurat March needed broader engagement to make it a march of the masses. It needs a ceaseless struggle. It needs women to explain to the detractors that ‘mera jism, meri marzi’ is about free will marriage, and about having choices regarding birth planning. She urged women, and civil society to get engaged with political parties for a broader change. 
The session, which otherwise was wonderful, faced technological constraints. 
ARE YOU ENJOYING?: Actress and short-story writer Mira Sethi’s debut story collection has only one purpose: she writes to see and to be seen. At the launch of her book, she with moderator actor Adnan Malik spoke about the characters and settings of her stories. She said the book was written in English to reach wider audiences, but the stories only represent localism.
Since she is not good at Urdu, she chose English to express herself. She had a disclaimer: English houses my intellect, but not my heart.
To keep the flavour of the characters and language original and local, she frequently uses desi words in her stories without explaining them. She said foreign publishers are always sceptical about non-western writers’ work and would ask them asked about the approach of their work. She said her fiction work only aimed at bringing out Pakistani culture to the world. Being a performing art person herself, Mira has several professional performers in her stories. She also spoke on the subjects of ongoing drama serials, saying that marriages, especially the bad marriages, were the ‘in’ things, but the trend would not produce strong women in our society.   
Mira is now celebrating the success of her debut work; she has no plan to bring out her second book right now. 
“Writing is an exhaustive work, so for now, I’m just concentrating on acting projects,” she said.

7,A tribute to fighters on medical front,Working at health facilities at the peak of Covid was one of the most challenging jobs but the pandemic was not...,"Working at health facilities at the peak of Covid was one of the most challenging jobs but the pandemic was not without an upside – it brought people together in an unprecedented way. 
This was the upshot of a discussion on ‘Pandemic: Doctors’ Stories from the Frontlines’ which was one of the sessions on the concluding day of the 10th Lahore Literary Festival (LLF) at the Alhamra Arts Centre. 
A distinguished panel comprising Dr Faisal Sultan, special assistant to prime minister on health, Dr Roopa Farooki (a British novelist) and Dr Saad Shafqat shared insights into how they, along with other health practitioners, treated Covid patients and helped the general public cope with the stress and anxiety while working on the frontline. Journalist Saima Mohsin moderated the session. 
These were indeed depressing times and every new day threw up a different challenge but the silver lining was that people rose to the occasion and there seemed to be a national sense of coming together, said Dr Shafqat. He also spoke about how other passions and pursuits such as literature and writing helped people in general and doctors in particular in these times. 
Dr Shafqat, who is also a writer of acknowledged standing, stressed that creative pursuits offered people an escape and it was kind of a safety valve for the doctors dealing with Covid patients and staying away from families. 
Dr Farroki shared her experiences as a fighter on medical front which she has penned in a book ‘Everything is true’. What made her story poignant was the fact that she lost her sister to cancer while saving so many other lives by working day in and day out. The personal tragedy was quite traumatic for her but the pain and suffering of Covid patients “changed my perspective”. 
“One thing I realised was that an individual’s grief was just a drop in the ocean… there was a flood of tragedies. Everyone’s sister, mother or a dear one lost life,” said Dr Farroki.  
Dr Faisal Sultan recalled the early days of outbreak of the virus when “no one knew how to fight and the systems stressed out.” However, he said, a calibrated response based on scientific research and data lent credibility to the efforts to fight the disease. He said it’s very difficult to compare the countries in terms of their response and big countries such as the US and India suffered the most. 
He said there were several myths amid a plethora of opinions and one of those was that shutting borders could curtail the virus. “It was very difficult to take decisions and communicate these to people,” he said while using the analogy of juggling balls in the air. But it was scientific knowledge and great communication which helped save lives, said Dr Sultan. 
Answering a question about the Covid scenario, he said (on a lighter note) it required a bit of clairvoyance but “the bulk of dangerous waves seems to have passed, though the virus may not altogether vanish.” The need to wear masks at crowded places is very much there, he said. 
The three doctors also spoke about vaccine inequity and the remarkable role of the manufacturers and the fact that how it saved lives. The session came to an end with a standing ovation for the doctors who graced the occasion and, by extension, to all those who put their lives on the line to save lives of others. 
ON WRITING: Ahdaf Souief, an Egyptian novelist, and Mohsin Hamid entertained the audience with their pleasing knack of expression while speaking about their respective writing journeys. 
Muneeza Shamsie moderated the session titled ‘Writings; its Promises and Disappointments’ attended by a number of literature lovers. 
Answering a question about aspiration or how she embraced writing, Souief said it was not planned but she read a lot and eventually thought of putting pen to paper and making out her name perhaps “like a rockstar”. She said she started writing after finishing her PhD. 
Hamid didn’t want to be a rock star, though he was an avid reader in the days when “there was one TV channel and no Internet”. He read the works of literary greats such as Bapsi Sidhwa and realised that “it was a different universe – me and writers”. “I began with script-writing at the college and eventually stumbled into the profession,” said Hamid whose works have been translated into 40 languages. 
Souief also shared a writer’s feeling and the “pleasure of working on the page”. It’s a really good feeling of creating a world of books, she said. The writer also informed the listeners why she turned to non-fiction saying “I hijacked myself into non-fiction because of circumstances.” 
Hamid drew a comparison between fiction and non-fiction and claimed his proclivity for the former which, in his view, was more honest and truthful than the latter. “There is an element of honesty in fiction as we stay in a world of imagination.” Souief, on the other hand, takes pride in “using her skill as a novelist to write accurate reportage of Palestine.” 
Towards the end, icon Mohsin Hamid highlighted the issue of shrinking space for the Press and the writers in Pakistan. He also addressed the oft-repeated question whether one can earn enough through writing by suggesting it is better to have another job and pursue writing as a passion which he did in the beginning.

8,"Judiciary failed to check forced disappearances, says Hina Jilani","“We are also struggling to sensitise the judiciary for implementation of rights,” says human rights activist Hina Jilani.","Senior lawyer and human rights activist Hina Jilani says the judiciary has a role to play for enforcement of human rights in the country, but sadly it has been failing on this front.  
She was speaking at a session, Prison Diaries, of the Lahore Literary Festival at Alhamra on Sunday at the launch of a book ‘You Have Not Been Yet Defeated’ written by Alaa Abd-El Fattah, an Egyptian blogger and activist who was sentenced to five-year jail term after a sham trial.
Ms Jilani said state was involved in forced disappearances that was a serious issue, but the judiciary failed to hold accountable those involved in the crime.  
She said it is satisfying that the book was written by a person who has first-hand experience of the struggle for human rights and knew where it could lead to. She added that continuing the struggle for rights was necessary because authoritarian regimes feared it.  
“We are also struggling to sensitise the judiciary for implementation of rights,” she said.  
The senior activist, however, regretted that the crowd that used to defend the struggle for rights was thinning.  
She said that in Pakistan there had been periods of great mobilisation and then of frustration, adding that democracy had always been facing challenges in the country.  
Deploring lack of public support for the rights struggle, she said: “Civil society is struggling, and we are watching as if a cricket match is going on.”  
Ms Jilani said: “We can’t accept anything that is out of [ambit of] democracy.”  
She said we have to also fight social retrogression as we all are stake-holders.
The senior lawyer said the civil-military imbalance in the country did not affect political parties only, but it also affect the people.  
Novelist Ahdaf Soueif, who is aunt of Fattah, said the book was actually not a prison diary but comprises Alaa’s writings on political issues, written in prison.  
She narrated the hardships her nephew faced, including repeated arrests by Egyptian authorities, because of his involvement in the struggle for rights. She says he is from a generation that is still optimistic and thinks they could break the ceiling.  
She described in detail how during their imprisonment Fattah and his fellow activist would exchange “voice notes” by reading out their writings aloud from their prison cells, which were later published in book form.  
She said when not imprisoned, Fattah would write newspaper articles on different political issues, including, ‘Who will write the constitution’ which discusses the making of a new constitution for Egypt. For the purpose, she said the author, through his blog, asked thousands of people about their views on the nature of the Egyptian state.  
One of the panelists, journalist Daniel Hilton, who won Amnesty International UK Media Award for his reporting on mass graves and other civil war atrocities in Libya, said their was a counter revolution after the Arab spring and totalitarian regimes in the Arab world became more oppressive after their failure to suppress dissent because of social media.  
Hina Jilani, who has been giving legal advice to the organisers of Aurat March said that before this year’s march police wanted to get an assurance from her that there won’t be any inappropriate talk during the event.  
She added that every generation had its own way of expressing their views, so there was no question of appropriateness in this regard.

9,"Jalib, the poet of masses, gets standing ovation at LLF",The Alhmra Hall No 2 was overpacked during the session to celebrate masses poet Habib Jalib at the Lahore Literary...,"The Alhmra Hall No 2 was overpacked during the session to celebrate masses poet Habib Jalib at the Lahore Literary Festival 2022 on Sunday. Besides the characteristic topic of the session, Main Nahi Manta (I don’t believe),  the session had the right panellists: long-time Jalib’s friends Mujahid Barelvi (broadcaster), and Aitzaz Ahsan (politician and lawyer).  The third guest was Dr Taimur Rehman (musician and university teacher), who kept the session alive with his melodious performance on the lyrics of the great revolutionary poet.  
Barelvi showed his strong grip on the poetry of Jalib. He related most of the poems with their context. Sharing several anecdotes, he established that Jalib was such a selfless human being, that he never tried to get his popularity and poems materialized in capitalist terms. Similarly, the ruling class from Ayub Khan to Nawaz Sharif failed to buy him. He said Jalib’s poetry set political, and foreign policy agendas. He said when Jalib recited his poem “Aise dastoor, subhe be nor ko, main nahi manta, main nahi janta’ ( I don’t believe in such a constitution, such a lightless dawn) at a mushaira in Murree. Those were the times when Sheikh Manzoor Qadir had just crafted the constitution of 1962. After hearing the prophetic verses of Jalib, Sheik Qadir called ace lawyer of his time Malik Ghulam Jilani and said the constitution would not work. 
‘But why?’ asked Jilani. 
Jalib has rejected it, he replied. Soon, the constitution was history. 
Barelvi remembers that the same Murree venue hosted another mushaira during the Yahya rule. Jalib was again on fire. 
Aitzaz shared the memories of that mushaira. 
This time, then a senior judge was to preside over the evening. Only to fail Jalib, the organizers set out the popular humorist and satirist Dilawar Figar before Jalib. Dilwar almost won the crowd. But when Jalib held the mike, he looked into the eyes of the chief guest, and then to picture of the dictator of the time. He started with the poem: 
Tum se pahle vo jo ik shakhs yahan takht-nashin tha
us ko bhe apne khuda hone pe itna hi yaqin tha
(The one who was enthroned here before you, he was just as sure of being his own god). This just demolished the organisers’ scheme to flop Jalib. The mushaira was over. 
Aitzaz said Jalib was gifted with saying complex issues in the easiest possible way.
Both Barelvi and Aitzaz shared their profound memories of Jalib. They said he would train masses on domestic politics and foreign policy issues through his poetry. Though he made his name as a poet of the revolution, his status as a romantic, ghazal writer has yet to be explored. 
Taimur concluded the session by singing a Jalib poem, which the hall gave a standing ovation to both Jalib’s poem and Taimur’s performance. 
WOMEN OF THE RAJ: At a session to unveil the book titled ‘She-Merchants, Buccaneers and Gentlewomen’, writer Katie Hickman sat with moderator Nelofar Bukhtiar to discuss the content and objectives of the book. According to the author, she wrote the book to tell untold stories of the women of British India, and to smash stereotypes, which have been established and remained unchallenged for over two centuries. The subject of the book is those women, who travelled to India before the 1857 uprising and took up the role of nurses, dressmakers, bakers, portrait painters, circus actresses, domestic help, teachers, shopkeepers, and so on. Primarily, they came to India as wife or family members of the British officials in the early 1600s, but they soon gave up their orderly life and started exploring the avenues to discover themselves. The session was aided with visuals to keep the audience engaged.

11,‘Fear is state’s handy tool to suppress dissent’,"Nothing could be sacred in a country, where the constitution is not held sacred, says leftist activist and academic...","Nothing could be sacred in a country, where the constitution is not held sacred, says leftist activist and academic Ammar Ali Jan at a session on the last day of the Lahore Literary Festival held at Alhamra, The Mall, where his book ‘Rule by Fear’ was launched on Sunday.
At the session moderated by senior journalist and TV anchor Mujahid Barelvi, Jan, also founder president of his Left-oriented Huqooq-i-Khalq movement, said his book opens with one of the the darkest episodes of Indian History, Jallianwala Bagh carnage occurred at Amritsar (now India) on 13th of April, 1919. On the day, British Indian army opened indiscriminate fire on peaceful protesters, killing, as per some accounts, up to 1,500 people, on the orders of Gen Dyer.  
Jan mentions that Gen Dyer ordered the massacre just to instill fear among the Indians so that they could never think of rising against the British rulers and that state was still using the tool of fear to subjugate people demanding their rights.
Sindh University Jamshoro Assistant Professor Amar Sindhu said Jan’s book presents the case of marginalised communities. She said the most damaging thing state has done is that it erased the nation’s memory of the atrocities committed against the people, including attempts to snatch their rights, and instilled fear and uncertainty in its collective consciousness.  
She regretted that the post-Zia generation was unaware of the state oppression because they just remember Musharraf regime. She said military dictator Gen Zia ruthlessly used fear as a tool to suppress dissent, and put its opponents in the torture cells in Lahore Fort. “Whenever a government of people would take charge, Lahore Fort would be converted into a ‘museum of torture’,” she added.
Peshawar-based human rights activist Shahida Shah referred to Dalton’s theory of structural violence to expound state’s employment of torture and other forms of violence to suppress people. She said for her activism was a natural option given the political and social conditions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where there was an atmosphere of fear and suffocation.  
To Mr Barelvi’s question that why Pakistan’s leftists could not so far make a united front to struggle for achieving their common objectives, Jan said the Left was systematically rendered disorganised because of conspiracies. He said a scattered fight was being fought by the leftists in various parts of the country, stressing the need for unity among various leftist factions. He said the situation was, however, improving as a younger generation of Punjabi leftists were supporting their comrades from other provinces like Balochistan. In this regard he mentioned support of Punjabi students of Punjab university for the Baloch students.  
Amar Sindhu was of the opinion that leftists should not have detached themselves from local and regional issues. She regretted that public domain had been left to the mullah (rigid religious people).

In one of the sessions titled `One Thousand and One Nights: Antoine Galland and the French Connection`, visual artist, poet and translator Yasmin Seale in conversation with Shafiq Naz discussed the translations by her in Arabic and French of the famous tale. Yasmin Seale was born in 1989 to a Syrian mother and a British father and grew up in Paris. She translates from Arabic and French ‘Aladdin’ which came out in 2018. She is currently working on a new translation of ‘One Thousand and One Nights’. She threw light on her translations and also discussed Antoine Galland, a French orientalist and archaeologist. His version of the tales appeared in 12 volumes between 1704 and 1717 and left a deep influence on subsequent European literature and attitudes to the Islamic world.
In another session titled ‘Fyzee Rahamins: Pakistan`s Early Power Couple`, panellists Muneeza Shamsi and art historian Samina Iqbal threw light on the life and works of the couple. The session was moderated by Naazish Ataullah. The session discussed Fyzee as a painter of portraits, figures, landscapes and murals, and also a dramatist and poet. He first painted portraits in oils, but after his return to India in 1908, soon abandoned this style in an attempt to revive the tradition of Moghul painting. He changed his faith from Judaism to Islam and his name from S Rahamin Samuel to S Fyzee Rahamins in 1912 on his marriage to Atiya Begum of the Fyzee family. 
Author Muneeza Shamsi read an article on Atiya Begum. She said Atiya Begum was a wonderful conversationalist. She was a choreographer too, and had a great intellect. She also met Allama Iqbal. She also composed music. They were a power couple because both complemented each other; her husband was a great artist and she herself was so talented. 
Samina Iqbal threw light on the works of Fyzee Rahamin and showed his portraits on the screen. 
In yet another session titled ‘Climate crisis and the framework of sustainable development, journalist Beth Gardiner and Australian journalist Marian Wilkinson discussed the issues related to climate change. Gardiner shared her journey of journalism and how after becoming a freelance journalist, she started working on climate change. She underlined the need to work on this particular subject as air pollution was leading to many serious health issues, adding that air pollution was a global challenge.
Marian Wilkinson said that climate change was a global issue and the fossil fuel industry was the most powerful industry in terms of high connections of politicians and those powerful people who could affect in this regard. 
She said that the climate change issue was something related to the power play in parliaments, as powerful elements often defeat climate legislation. She quoted examples of Australia, where bush fire led to the deaths of human beings, birds and animals and later created health issues. Another panellist of the session Shazia Rafi, who joined the session virtually from New York, said air pollution had no boundaries, adding that both federal and provincial governments in Pakistan should address the environmental issues to avoid health issues.

13,Something about fiction and decolonisation,"“It’s not about the politicians who are polemical but a large section of society, extensively sophisticated and...","“It’s not about the politicians who are polemical but a large section of society, extensively sophisticated and custodians of human rights movements, who normalise something which is gruesome. The subject has been taken by the novelist in a subtle pattern through discourse and dialogue between characters,” said novelist Osama Siddique about Maniza Naqvi’s novel The Inn.  
Ms Naqvi agreed with her fellow novelist who said The Inn was also about a group of people who normalised the gruesome.   
They were speaking at the launch of the novel at the Lahore Literary Festival in a session moderated by novelist Osama Siddique.  
Ms Naqvi wondered if the Pakistani writers had come out of colonialism or were still stuck in it.  
“What to talk about the westerners, we ourselves colonise the people around us. Regarding the question about language, it’s sad that we give importance to conversation done in English. We are unaware of the stories written in our own languages.”   
Osama called The Inn the book of ideas whose subject was international politics and the western attitude towards our part of the world.   
“There was a rage in the main character which could turn polemical and it would have affected the novel. There is a flow in the novel and the best thing about it is that it has American literary, musical, cultural, social references in the charactersation which becomes believable. It’s important for a novelist to make characters believable if she/he is writing about a certain area and its culture,” said Osama Siddique.
DECOLONISING LIVES: Vietnamese novelist Nguyen Phan Que Mai said most of the writings about Vietnam have been done by westerners while Hollywood also misrepresented the Vietnamese.   
“I wrote against that. I wrote about the Vietnamese women who I grew up with who had no choice but to be pillars of our society. Most of our men went to the war and came back traumatised and it were the women who rescued and nurtured those men,” she said during a session titled, Writing Our Stories: Decolonising Lives.   
She said her book, The Mountains Sing, was an attempt to reclaim Vietnamese narrative.  
Osman Yousefzada, the author of The Go-Between, said the decolonisation conversation for him revolved around working class women who were subjected to a patriarchal world.   
“There are amazing matriarchs in this patriarchal world.”   
Ms Mai bemoaned the Vietnamese culture had more than 4,000 years of history and the world saw it only from the perspective of the war.   
“I want to present Vietnam as it is. The Vietnamese language is so rich with each word having different meanings.”   
She declared that another way of decolonisation for her was to put the Vietnamese stories in the central stage set against the background of the Vietnam War where America had no speaking role.  
“The war killed three million Vietnamese and only 60,000 Americans but more literature has been written about the latter than the former,” she added.  
Osama Siddique, the author of Sniffing out the Moon, agreed with the two novelists.  
If one looked at South Asian fiction written in English until three or four decades back, there was a huge amount of uncertainty about the idiom to be used and the themes.   
“I face a question all the time, why English. And I can say that it’s (writing in English) also an act of defiance,” he said and added that Urdu and Punjabi also influenced his English langauge.

The Taliban came...,"People say that Pakistan created the Taliban but it’s wrong though we might take a credit for it. The Taliban came into existence through the truck mafia, said former foreign secretary Najmuddin A. Shaikh.  
“When they used to go to Kandahar, they had to pass eight to 10 checkpoints where they had to pay a fine. The truck mafia said to the seminary students and ordinary sepoys, who were not Taliban to give it a safe passage and requested them to provide it and they did that,” he said while speaking in a session, The Imperial Ghost Wars in Afghanistan on the concluding day of the Lahore Literary Festival (LLF) on Sunday. 
“Then we said, ‘the Taliban are our boys’ but the Taliban did not accept that and told that Naseerullah Babar had nothing to do with them.” 
Mr Shaikh added that Osama bin Laden went to Afghanistan in a C-31, which was only possible through the US government. “I was then the foreign secretary. I wrote to our intelligence agencies to keep a watch on him because his presence there was going to create problems for us.” 
He termed peace in Afghanistan essential for Pakistan because any disturbance there would multiply in Pakistan.  
Former ambassador to the US Maleeha Lodhi said that for Pakistan, the US was part of an external strategy to counter India’s threatening posture with Pakistan. She said the relationship has been very mercurial, problematic and turbulent and it was best when the both sides had common objectives like both sides wanted US withdrawal from Afghanistan, both sides wanted the dissemination of Al-Qaida.  
“We are in a transitional phase. It is hard to see how the new relationship is going to be redefined unless there is meaningful engagement at the senior level which I am not seeing so far. Perhaps the US has other issues now in mind vis-à-vis Ukraine.”  
Ms Lodhi said the relationship is going to be affected by three factors, the Sino-US confrontation, India factor as Pak-India relations are not normalised and the situation of Afghanistan where Pakistan wanted a greater engagement.  
Writer and journalist Zahid Hussain said US-Pakistan relations had gone through many phases in the last sixty years but a new alliance emerged after 9/11. “Before 9/11 happened, the US and Pakistan were pursuing different policies in Afghanistan but things changed after 9/11.” 
He said after the incident, Pakistan was important for the US to engage in Afghanistan as the mastermind of 9/11 was living there and Pakistan was deeply involved in Afghanistan before that.  
“There had been a lot of political statements by political leaders that ‘one call’ led to Pakistan’s alliance with the US which was completely wrong. Pakistan did not have a choice.” 
After the return of US forces from Afghanistan, the nature of relations had completely changed and they had gone back to the same situation that was before 9/11, he said. 
Zahid Hussain added that there had been a lot of talk that the US had betrayed Pakistan but one thing should be clear that nations make their relations based on their national interests.  
He said when Taliban ruled Afghanistan before 9/11, there were no Taliban fighting in Pakistan but now the TTP had emboldened, and its back in the former tribal areas of Pakistan which should be a concern for Pakistan.  
AKBAR ZAIDI: Political economist Akbar S. Zaidi talking about his book, Making of A Muslim, said many things told about Pakistan and the Muslims of 19th century were wrong. 
“I was intrigued by the idea how the idea of a Muslim is portrayed in history, social sciences by very prominent historians, including the one who was here yesterday but I can’t take the name.  
“There was a region in Hindustan where everything was written in Urdu and our historians, with some exceptions, don’t read Urdu despite writing extensive books.”  
Mr Zaidi said the crux of this book was to explore what were the Muslims talking about in the 19th century, adding that he read newspapers from that era, exploring the Khuda Bakhsh Library in Patna, Aligarh Library and British Library. 
He said contemporary historians claim that a Muslim nation came into being after 1857. “I refuse to accept it. There was nothing like it.” 
He declared there was no better word than Zillat (humiliation). “The book has many themes and there is one theme of Zillat.”  
The Urdu speaking elite realised that the condition they were in was utter Zillat.  
“People think that the sects of Islam, Deobandi, Barelvi and Ahle Hadith, had been there since centuries. In 1867, the Deoband sect started, the Barelvis came in 1895 and Ahle Hadith originated in 1870-1875. These sects are just infants compared to the 1,400 years long history of Islam.” 
Talking about his book again, Mr Zaidi said his argument was that due to the Zillat of 1857, Aligarh came into being, Sir Syed appeared, and all Muslim sects came into being. “In Aligarh of 19th century, Ghalib was not taught and you could not talk about Urdu poetry. Keats was taught. There were a Union club and English debating club,” he said.  
“Calling Sir Syed as an educationist is bullshit. Aligarh’s objective was getting jobs and not knowledge,” Mr Zaidi declared.

15,Speak truth through poetry or you justify injustice: Natiq,"Ali Akbar Natiq wants to be known as a poet first and foremost, is how moderator Arsalan Rathore introduced the...","Ali Akbar Natiq wants to be known as a poet first and foremost, is how moderator Arsalan Rathore introduced the author and poet in a session, titled ‘Safeer-i-Laila’ -- after his book of collected poems, on the last day of Lahore Literary Festival at Alhamra on Sunday.
Mr Natiq remarked that poets have been there since the world was created, sharing that a poet can write aghazal, but everyghazalwriter can’t be a poet. He called himself a storyteller while writing poetry.
“A poet is someone who loiters aimlessly (awara gard); he talks to the trees, stars and what not. Everything in the world was created beautiful, it is us who have distorted them,” he reflected. 
The poet then talks about the use of istaara (metaphor), saying mushahida (observation) is the most important element in poetry. “Things change as we move from one location to another. So if you keep writing as you go along in life, it’ll appear fresh and attract many more readers. Poetry should make people happy; it should give them confidence about life.”
Natiq then read out some versesfrom the book under discussion.
When asked about a lot of focus on nature in his poetry, Natiq gave an example that no hotel anywhere in the world could beat lying on a charpoy under ajaamantree by a waterway with a book for company. “Nature provides a person a shadow; humans are bound for life with trees and poetry is all about love and care, which nature provides in abundance.”
The moderator asked him about his philosophy of life in terms of him having a strong voice against injustices. “If justice (adal) ends from the world, life will come to an end. The objective of poetry is to speak the truth, and if you don’t then you justify the injustice. There is no compromise on it. People make friends, but I’m known for making enemies because of opinions. History will only remember those who stand on the right side.”
Mr Natiq concluded by revealing he was working on his autobiography that will be “honest and interesting”.
Video games
Video game connoisseurs gathered to listen to art historian and ethnologist Jean-Baptiste Clais talk about his passion for the games, contemporary pop culture that he specialises in, how he put together an exhibition about video games and their connection with culture, cinema, and art.
At the start of the session, ‘Video Games as a New Domain of Creation’, moderated by digital storyteller/journalist Mariam Saeed Khan at Lahore Literary Festival, Mr Clais gave a presentation on the market shares of different video game systems, the evolution of graphics of video games and glimpses into the first video games exhibition.
Talking about the exhibition, he said since the game had to be visualised, simple colours had to be used to get public attention. “Games are inspired by the real world, includingmovies, cartoons and television, while video games also exert their influence on these media.”
When Ms Khan asked what his favourite video game was, he said there were none since as a child he wasn’t allowed to play them. “I bought a computer when I became an adult and started playing then only.”
The objective of a non-profit he volunteers for, he shared, is to maintain digital heritage, organise shows and exhibitions and display gaming machines to explain to people, especially parents, how they work.“There’s so much beauty and poetry and art out there and wonderful games.Video gaming can be shaped in so many contexts. You have to find an angle that makes it interesting. Museums are there for the community that thinks games are a part of them and their lives; they’ll cease to exist once people stop playing games.”
