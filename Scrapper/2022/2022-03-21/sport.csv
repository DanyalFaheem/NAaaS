It’s the fifth season that the Poland international has scored 30 goals or more in the Bundesliga, a feat only previously achieved by former Bayern great Gerd Mueller. Kingsley Coman and Tanguy Nianzou scored the other goals. 
“We played very well and created many chances. We wanted to win to widen the gap,” ahead of Dortmund, admitted Coman. 
Bayern went ahead at the Allianz Arena when Coman hit a superb shot into the top corner from outside the area on 16 minutes. 
Teenage French defender Nianzou then headed in his first Bayern goal before Lewandowski converted a penalty to make it 3-0 at the break. Jamal Musiala set him up for his 31st goal of the season right after it. 
Earlier, Hertha Berlin earned their first win of 2022 to climb out of the bottom two with a 3-0 home victory over Hoffenheim despite new coach Felix Magath being sidelined by Covid. 
Hertha fired Tayfun Korkut as coach on Sunday and appointed the experienced Magath in his place. They ended a nine-match winless streak in the Bundesliga by brushing aside Champions League-chasing Hoffenheim. 
Defender Niklas Stark and striker Ishak Belfodil put Hertha 2-0 up at Berlin’s Olympic Stadium before Hoffenheim defender David Raum scored an own goal. 
The win lifts Hertha into 16th place, the relegation play-off spot, with seven games left, while Hoffenheim stay sixth. 
Freiburg continued their challenge for a first Champions League qualification by climbing to fourth with a goalless draw at bottom side Greuther Fuerth. 
There were curious scenes at Mainz 05 where three different penalty takers converted spot-kicks within 14 minutes for the hosts in their 4-0 trouncing of second-bottom Arminia Bielefeld. 
VfB Stuttgart pulled away from the bottom three with their second win in three games as late goals by Tiago Tomas and Omar Marmoush capped their 3-2 comeback win at home to Augsburg.

1,"Pakistan, Australia eye series win as Test cricket returns to Lahore after 13 years","”It’s a different feeling to play in front of a home crowd, at my home ground. I can’t explain this feeling,” says Babar Azam.","LAHORE: When Pakistan captain Babar Azam and his Australian counterpart Pat Cummins walk towards the Gaddafi Stadium centre for the toss of the three-match series decider on Monday, it will mark the first time in 13 years that the venue will be hosting a Test.
The last Test played here in 2009 was called off on the morning of the third day of Pakistan’s second Test against Sri Lanka after gunmen opened fire on the visiting team at the iconic Liberty Chowk, a stone’s throw from the prestigious venue.
The attack saw Pakistan’s exile from the sport as a host country with the national side playing its ‘home’ games in the United Arab Emirates.
None of Pakistan’s players in their current squad have played a Test match in Lahore, but for Babar, who only just started playing youth cricket back then, it will be a special moment, as he not only plays but also leads Pakistan in a Test in the city where he was born and grew up.
”It’s a different feeling to play in front of a home crowd, at my home ground. I can’t explain this feeling,” Babar, who made his Test debut in 2016, told reporters in an online press conference on Sunday.
The Pakistan skipper, however, didn’t seem like losing his element on what, undeniably, will be a momentous occasion. He wanted to make it more memorable by ensuring his team wins the match to take the series 1-0 after an unexciting draw in Rawalpindi and a thrilling one in Karachi.
“The main aim is the same; to win,” said the 27-year-old, whose 603-minute 196-run knock helped Pakistan save the Karachi Test to keep the series alive.
The playing surfaces in Rawalpindi and Karachi have been subjected to criticism for their lack of support to the bowlers with neither team managing to take 20 wickets.
The Lahore pitch — of which the preparation has been overseen by former International Cricket Council academy curator Toby Lumsden — is expected to assist batters as well, but Babar believed spinners will be able to extract turn from it and that a result will be a possibility unlike the first two Tests. 
“Though the pitch looks the same, I saw some little cracks which might open up from the third day and help the spinners to take advantage,” said the right-handed batter.
“I see a result here and if we win against a major team, it will mean a lot and will be a proud moment for us.”
Babar said he will have one final look at the pitch before the match to decide Pakistan’s final eleven. His Australian counterpart Cummins, on the other hand, will go with the same group that played in Karachi, expecting the pitch to behave in a similar way.
“It seems hard, but I don’t see it being too much different from the other ones [Rawalpindi and Karachi],” said the pacer. 
“We feel like we have our bases covered if needed, whether it is reverse swing or spin later in the game. 
“There are no injury worries, everyone is freshened up, so we are confident in the eleven.”
Australia could well have gone on to win the Karachi Test after giving Pakistan a mammoth 506 runs to win in the fourth innings had they held on to the chances their bowler’s created.
Abdullah Shafique, who went on to combine for more than 200 runs with Babar, was dropped while he was at 20 in the fourth day while Babar was dropped twice on the last day. Later, Usman Khawaja spilled Pakistan wicket-keeper/batter Mohammad Rizwan just before he reached his century.
With batters expected to dominate in the Lahore Test as well, Cummins said good fielding will pay dividends for both sides.
“Wickets are at a premium in this series so you cannot afford to drop too many chances,” he said. “So that is going to be the challenge this week.”

The Olympic champion beat her previous outright best of 15.67 metres set at the Tokyo Games last year, as well as her indoor record of 15.43 metres, set in 2020. 
Rojas jumped over 15 metres four times in the final, landing the record on her sixth and final attempt on the third and final morning session at the world indoors. 
Maryna Bekh-Romanchuk of Ukraine won silver with 14.74 metres, a personal best. The bronze went to Jamaica’s Kimberly Williams with 14.62 metres. 
Rojas, 26, has been a dominant force in the discipline since the 2016 Olympics, where she won silver, before winning the outdoor world title a year later and repeating the feat in Doha in 2019. 
On Sunday, she won her third straight world indoor triple jump gold, adding to successes in Portland in 2016 and Birmingham in 2018. 
“I achieved my third indoor title here which is crowned with the world record, I cannot be more thankful,” said Rojas. “Coming here, I knew it was the right time to achieve this and I took the chance. I did not want to miss this opportunity today. 
“Now, I want to focus on the world outdoor championships in Oregon and I think there is a big chance of making a double — long jump and triple jump. 
“If I am in shape and the conditions are good, I can do both. The 16-metre mark is my big goal. Every day, I am trying to add one more centimetre to get closer to it.”

Nawaz was initially picked despite doubts over his availability due to a foot injury that he sustained during the Pakistan Super League earlier this year. 
Zahid will also act as a cover for Pakistan’s white-ball vice-captain Shadab Khan, who has not fully recovered from a groin issue.  
“Unfortunately, Moha­mmad Nawaz has not recovered fully from the foot injury he suffered during PSL 7,” chief selector Mohammad Wasim was quoted as saying in a Pakistan Cricket Board press release.
“We also need to reassess Shadab Khan’s fitness once he joins the squad before playing him in this high profile series which is very important for us in terms of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Super League points.”
Wasim said Zahid, who is also a part of Pakistan Test squad, will be an “adequate” replacement for spin-bowling all-rounders Nawaz, and Shadab, if needed.
Pakistan’s white-ball players are scheduled to assemble at the team hotel in Lahore on Tuesday and will start training on March 25 ahead of the first ODI on March 29. All three one-dayers and the T20 will be played here at the Gaddafi Stadium.

Warne’s three children, parents and friends including retired Test captains Mark Taylor and Allan Border and former England skipper Michael Vaughan, were among about 80 guests at the service on Sunday at St Kilda Football Club, an Australian Rules team Warne supported all his life. 
The service ended with his coffin given a lap of honour at St Kilda’s home ground as family members walked behind and the song “The Time of My Life” from the movie “Dirty Dancing” boomed through loudspeakers. Tina Turner’s “Simply The Best” played as the hearse left the ground. 
Warne was widely regarded as one of the top players of all time. He died on March 4 while on vacation with friends on Samui Island in southern Thailand. An autopsy report said the 52-year-old Warne died of a suspected heart attack. 
His remains were repatriated from Bangkok, Thailand to Melbourne just over a week ago. 
A state memorial at the Melbourne Cricket Ground the scene of many of Warne’s iconic bowling moments including a hat-trick against England in 1994 and his 700th Test wicket on Boxing Day in 2006 will take place on March 30 and will be open to the public. 
The grounds Great Southern Stand will also be renamed in Warne’s honour.

5,Rabada takes five as South Africa square series with Bangladesh,JOHANNESBURG: Fast bowler Kagiso Rabada took 5-39 as South Africa cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Bangladesh...,"JOHANNESBURG: Fast bowler Kagiso Rabada took 5-39 as South Africa cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Bangladesh in the second One-day International at The Wanderers on Sunday to square the three-match series.
Bangladesh chose to bat, but after a poor start could only manage 194 for nine in their 50 overs. The home side had no trouble chasing down the target, which they reached with 76 balls to spare.
They earned 10 points on the ICCs World Cup Super League table, where South Africa are battling to break into the top eight to automatically qualify for the tournament in India next year.
Bangladesh collapsed to 34 for five as the home seamers got exaggerated bounce out of the surface and caught the edge with regularity.
Rabada was particularly destructive, but when South Africa lost their third seamer, Wayne Parnell, to a hamstring injury early in his spell, it opened an end for the visitors.
Afif Hossain (72 from 107 balls) and Mehidy Hasan Miraz (38 from 49 balls) put on 86 for the seventh wicket to bring respectability to the score, but it was well below par at a venue famous for high-scoring games.
That was proven by opener Quinton de Kock as he smashed 62 from 41 balls in the home side’s reply and Kyle Verreynne (58 not out from 77 balls) led South Africa to an easy win.
Bangladesh were victorious in the first game by 38 runs on Friday. The series decider will be played at Centurion Park in Pretoria on Wednesday.

Crystal Palace were also big winners in the quarter-finals, easing past Everton 4-0 to join a lineup for the last four that already contained Chelsea, who beat Middlesbrough 2-0 on Saturday to advance. 
City defender Aymeric Laporte’s own-goal had cancelled out Raheem Sterling’s opener in the first half. But a 62nd-minute penalty converted by Kevin De Bruyne regained the lead for City and goals by substitutes Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez in the space of four minutes from the 75th added gloss to the scoreline at St. Mary’s Stadium. 
Marc Guehi, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Wilfried Zaha and Will Hughes got the goals at Selhurst Park as Palace stormed into the last four for the first time in six years by seeing off sorry Everton. 
In a Premier League match on Sunday, Timothy Castagne made his return after three months out injured and scored for Leicester City in their 2-1 win over Brentford, helping the Foxes climb into 10th place.

Mercedes’ seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton took a surprise third place after a nightmare for Red Bull and reigning champion Max Verstappen who failed to score after retiring near the end with engine trouble. 
Sergio Perez’s Red Bull also retired with the finish line in sight as the race finished under a yellow flag. 
Hamilton had been lagging way behind in fifth when late drama on Lap 46 changed the race. 
Leclerc was leading comfortably from Verstappen when the back of Pierre Gasly’s AlphaTauri car caught fire forcing him to park it on the side of the track. It was quickly put out and the Frenchman walked away unharmed. 
From the restart, Leclerc got away and Verstappen started complaining about steering problems. 
A few minutes later both Red Bulls were out of the race and George Russell moved up into fourth to give Mercedes an unexpected bonus. 
Ferrari’s last win before Sunday was with Sebastian Vettel in Singapore in September 2019.

England lost quick wickets chasing second-innings runs on a rain-interrupted morning at Kensington Oval.
They were 185 for six at lunch, when captain Joe Root declared, though commentators were puzzled why England did not make the decision a little earlier, with the target already seemingly well beyond the capabilities of the hosts.
West Indies had trailed by 96 runs after the first innings on Saturday.
The final-day scenario was similar to last week’s first test in Antigua, where England set West Indies a winning target of 286 from 71 overs.
That match was drawn after West Indies lost four quick wickets before Nkrumah Bonner and Jason Holder batted out the rest of the day.
West Indies set defensive fields on Sunday morning in an effort to keep England from piling up runs too quickly.
Unfettered by any fielding restrictions, captain Kraigg Brathwaite placed up to half a dozen fielders in the deep, while the attack was able to bowl wider than would have been allowed in a limited overs contest.
All of the England dismissals were caught, mostly in the deep.
Dan Lawrence (41) and Zak Crawley (40) top-scored for England, who had resumed on 40 without loss after Kraigg Brathwaite’s grinding, marathon 160 had hauled West Indies to within 96 runs of England’s first innings total as the home side were eventually dismissed for 411.

Anya Shrubsole clipped Brooke Halliday wide of short mid-wicket in the final over to take England to 204 runs and past the total set for them by the White Ferns in the first innings. 
The win means England move to four points from five matches and into fifth place in the group standings. 
New Zealand also have four points but, having played one match more, are now in sixth and on the verge of exiting the competition. 
England had won only one of their opening four matches as losses against Australia, West Indies and South Africa had left them in danger of missing out on the semi-finals. 
New Zealand set a target of 204 to win after Maddy Green top scored for the White Ferns with an unbeaten 52 that came off 75 balls. 
Captain Sophie Devine contributed an additional 41 runs despite a back injury as New Zealand finished all out for 203. 
England made steady progress towards their target but were given a fright when they lost four wickets for nine runs with victory in sight as the rain started to come down. 
Top scorer Nat Scriver was bowled by Jess Kerr for 61 runs with England still 17 runs short and, in the next over, Sophie Ecclestone and Kate Cross fell in quick succession to Frances Mackay. 
Katherine Brunt was then run out with England still eight runs adrift, but Shrubsole held her nerve to see the defending champions across the line. 
“It’s crazy, we just got over the line. We probably shouldn’t have,” a delighted Sciver said after being named player of the match. 
Australia lead the group standings with five wins out of five so far and have already booked their place in the next round, while South Africa are in second and the West Indies third. 
Aiding England’s cause is that their remaining matches are against the two bottom-of-the-table sides — Bangladesh and Pakistan. 
New Zealand still have a remote chance of advancing to the semi-finals but need several unlikely results to go their way. 
“I’m so incredibly proud of the girls to take it where they did,” Devine said. “We knew that we were probably 40 or 50 runs short on that wicket. 
To take it where we did...I’m just so proud. We’re gutted but that’s cricket.”
Brief scores:
NEW ZEALAND 203 all out in 48.5 overs (M. Green 52, S. Devine 41; K. Cross 3-35, S. Ecclestone 3-41); ENGLAND 204-9 in 47.2 overs (N. Sciver 61, H. Knight 42; F. Mackay 4-34).

Yamaha’s Quartararo qualified in pole position but dropped to fifth before producing a late charge as Oliveira kept his composure to clinch his fourth MotoGP career win in the rain-delayed and shortened second race of the season at the Mandalika International Street Circuit. 
Oliveira made a strong start and moved from seventh to second, passing early leaders Quartararo and Jack Miller before building what proved to be an unassailable lead. 
“The last couple of months have not been easy,” the 27-year-old Portuguese said. “To be back with this win is very emotional for me. I promised my daughter I would bring back a trophy from Indonesia -- this one is for you.” 
Quartararo was joined by fellow Frenchman Johann Zarco on the podium after the race was reduced to 20 laps from 27 due to safety concerns caused by extreme track temperatures and the start was delayed by over an hour because of torrential rain. 
Australian Miller was forced to settle for fourth ahead of Suzuki duo Alex Rins and Joan Mir, with Quartararo’s team -mate Franco Morbidelli finishing in seventh place. 
Six-time MotoGP champion Marc Marquez missed the race, Indonesia’s first grand prix since 1997, after suffering a concussion following a crash in the warm-up session earlier on Sunday. 
World championship leader Enea Bastianini of Italy, who won the season-opening race in Qatar two weeks ago, struggled in the wet and could only finish 11th after starting on the second row of the grid. 
The Italian remains top of the world championship standings after two races on 30 points, two ahead of South Africa’s Brad Binder with Quartararo one point further back in third. Oliveira’s 25 points for victory elevated him to fourth in the standings.

13,"Bengaluru pitch rated below average after three-day Test between India, Sri Lanka",The day-night pink ball Test finished inside three days as India beat Sri Lanka by 238 runs to win the two-Test series 2-0.,"BENGALURU: The M Chinnaswamy Stadium pitch used for the second Test between India and Sri Lanka has been rated below average by the match referee and received one demerit point, cricket’s governing body ICC said on Sunday.
The day-night pink ball Test finished inside three days as India beat Sri Lanka by 238 runs to win the two-Test series 2-0. The pitch offered sharp turn and variable bounce from the first session as 16 wickets fell on day one.
“The pitch offered a lot of turn on the first day itself and though it improved with every session, in my view, it was not an even contest between bat and ball,” match referee Javagal Srinath said.
Demerit points remain active for a rolling five-year period and any venue which accumulates five of them for poor pitches or the outfield will be suspended from hosting international cricket for a period of 12 months. 
Bangalore is the second venue in as many weeks to receive the  “below average” reprimand, after the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in neighbouring Pakistan.
At the Rawalpindi stadium, this month’s first Test between the hosts and Australia ended in a tame draw — with 1,187 runs scored for the loss of only 14 wickets.

14,Rafael Nadal outlasts Alcaraz to set up final with Fritz,"If Nadal beats Fritz, he will tie Novak Djokovic for the most Masters 1000 titles in ATP history with 37.","INDIAN WELLS: Rafael Nadal faced down the future and emerged victorious, outlasting Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 on Saturday night to book a title clash with American Taylor Fritz at the BNP Paribas Open. 
The 21-time major champion threw his head back, smiled and raised both arms in triumph after escaping an aggressive Alcaraz. The 18-year-old never appeared rattled playing his vaunted countryman, who had the crowd, a 17-year advantage in age and loads of experience in his favour. 
“He has all the ingredients to become an amazing champion,” Nadal said. “I don’t have many doubts that he will be great. He is already, by the way.” 
Nadal, who claimed a record-setting 21st Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January, improved to 20-0 in 2022. 
If Nadal beats Fritz, he will tie Novak Djokovic for the most Masters 1000 titles in ATP history with 37. 
The 24-year-old Fritz, ranked 20th in the world, ended Andrey Rublev’s 13-match ATP winning streak with a 7-5, 6-4 victory over the world number seven in the other semi-final.

15,Milan maintain title charge as Inter lose more ground,"ROME: Amid a tight race for the Serie A title, AC Milan are displaying more consistency than their rivals.","ROME: Amid a tight race for the Serie A title, AC Milan are displaying more consistency than their rivals. 
On a night when defending champions Inter Milan were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Fiorentina, Milan won 1-0 at relegation-threatened Cagliari to extend their unbeaten run to eight matches. 
Milan remained three points ahead of Napoli, who came from a goal down to beat visiting Udinese 2-1 earlier on Saturday. 
On a rainy night in Sardinia, Ismael Bennacer scored with a long-distance volley for Milan near the hour mark. The goal was set up by Olivier Giroud, who failed to take advantage of a prime opportunity early on when he missed the target from close range. 
A third win on the bounce for Stefano Pioli’s side increased hopes of a first Scudetto since 2011, but it was a match marred by racist abuse directed at Mike Maignan and Fikayo Tomori from a section of home fans at the final whistle which sparked a on-pitch shoving match. 
Victor Osimhen scored twice for Napoli again after Gerard Deulofeu had given Udinese an early advantage, Osimhen equalised after the break with a header then won it with one touch by redirecting a cross from Giovanni Di Lorenzo. 
Oshimhen, who also had a brace in Napoli’s 2-1 win at Hellas Verona last weekend, will miss the team’s next match for accumulated cards. 
Third-placed Inter lost ground in the title race after being held by Fiorentina at the San Siro. The Nerazzurri have won just one of their last seven games and trail Milan by six points with a game in hand. 
Lucas Torreira put Fiorentina ahead after the break after beating Nicolo Barella to a cross. Denzel Dumfries equalised for Simone Inzaghi’s side five minutes later with a header.

Atletico’s sixth win in seven matches overall lifted them provisionally ahead of Barcelona and just two points behind Sevilla in second, giving them some breathing space in the fight for the top four. 
They had to see out the last nine minutes with 10 men after Angel Correa, on as a substitute, was sent off. 
Also on Saturday, Osasuna dealt a blow to Levante’s diminishing chances of avoiding relegation after easing to a 3-1 win over the league’s bottom team. Levante were left seven points from safety with nine games left. 
Two teams trying to stave off the drop produced the day’s liveliest clash, with Granada scoring late to complete a 3-2 comeback at Alaves. A first win in nine rounds lifted Granada four points clear of the bottom three. Alaves remained in second-to-last-place. 
Elsewhere, Valencia winger Goncalo Guedes scored early in the second half to help his team win 1-0 at Elche.

Lens rallied from a goal down in a 3-1 win over Clermont to move to seventh. Elbasan Rashani caught the hosts cold with a left-footed shot to give Clermont the lead after eight minutes.
