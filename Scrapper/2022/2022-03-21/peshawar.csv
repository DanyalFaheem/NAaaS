0,Educationists see no logic in govt decision to delay next academic year,"Teachers fear wastage of time, say they had completed courses in February","PESHAWAR: Educationists and administrative officers in the Elementary and Secondary Education Department see no logic in starting the next academic year from August, as teachers have already completed teaching their courses at the government primary and high schools by the end of February. 
The academic year in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa usually starts in April and ends in March. The school administration conducts annual home exams up to grade-8 in March and results are declared on March 31 each academic year. 
However, in the light of the federal government’s decision, the E&SE Department has decided to start the upcoming academic year from August instead of April, saying the students’ time had been wasted when schools were closed due to Covid-19 pandemic at the start of the ongoing academic year. 
“Due to delay caused by the Covid-19 situation, the academic year 2022-23 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shall commence from August 1, 2022, and conclude on April 30, 2023, and the academic year 2023-24 shall commence from May 1, 2023,” reads a notification issued by the education department in the start of March. 

Teachers fear wastage of time, say they had completed courses in February 

A principal of a government high school told Dawn that in the ongoing academic year, classes started in July which continued non-stop for nine months. However, he said that the school administration could not take examinations from the students due to ‘illogical’ decision of the government. 
A science teacher in a government school told Dawn that he had completed teaching his courses at the end of January. “I have completed courses of three subjects, including chemistry and Physics for class-10, and general science for grade-8,” he said. 
As per the school principal’s directives, he said, the teachers had now engaged their students in different activities like revision of their courses, weekly tests, etc. 
Several principals of the government schools said the E&SE Department had not communicated to the schools in writing about annual home examinations. 
However, a district education officer said that a senior officer of education department had recently verbally communicated to the district education officers to issue directives to the government schools to conduct examinations by the end of May. 
In plain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the summer vacation usually starts in government schools in June. 
“The teachers usually send their students for summer vacation with proper homework of the subjects taught in April and May, to be revised during the vacation,” a teacher said. 
However, he said, if they started the summer vacation at the start of June in the instant case, they would not be able to give homework to the students because they would not have started their next classes and thus the students would waste three months of summer vacation. 
School Officers Association, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, president Samiullah Khalil told Dawn that the association also had reservations about the start of academic year from August as it would waste precious time of the students. 
He said that the office-bearers of the teachers association raised this issue with the recently-posted secretary education in a meeting and demanded to revisit the decision of starting the academic year from August. 
He said it was clear in the education department’s notification that the next academic year would start from August, but it had not given any direction when the ongoing academic year would be ended. 
He said the association had also demanded of the government to hold annual home examinations in April. However, he said, the association could take its own decision of holding examinations in April in the larger interest of students.

3,ANP warns to take PM Imran to court over poll code violations,Aimal Wali Khan says the party will no longer remain silent and will raise its voice against misuse of official resources.,"PESHAWAR: Awami National Party has accused Prime Minister Imran Khan of using official resources to run campaign for his party candidates in the upcoming local government elections and warned to take him to the court for violating election rules. 
ANP provincial president Aimal Wali Khan said in a statement here on Sunday that despite repeated notices by the Election Commission of Pakistan the prime minister and his ministers were addressing public meetings to run campaign for his party candidates in the second phase of the local government elections, which was scheduled to be held on March 31. 
The ANP, he said, would not remain silent any longer on the issue and it would raise voice against the misuse of official resources. He said that spending of national wealth on the election campaign was illegal and thus his party would also move a court of law for taking action against the government. 
Aimal Wali said that the premier had lost majority in the National Assembly and he was legally bound to step down without any delay. He said that the opposition parties had taken a unified stand to oust the ‘selected’ government at the earliest. 
Referring to the PTI’s public meeting at Dargai in Malakand district, he claimed that the people belonging to Mardan, Batkhela and Swat had been provided free transport facilities, but even then they did not take interest to listen to the PM’s speech. 
The ANP provincial chief said that Imran Khan’s speech in Dargai was nothing more than a request to the deserting MPs of his party to rejoin him. He said that sooner or later the PM would step down to pave the way for fresh elections in the country.

4,Police raid on musical concert in Peshawar brings censure from netizens,Official says action taken after local people’s complaints to avoid clash.,"PESHAWAR: The city police violently disrupted a private concert of Peshawar’s leading singer, Karan Khan, over the weekend, triggering a storm of protest and remonstration on the social media on part of some, while others supporting the police action.
On Friday night, police raided a music party in the neighbourhood of Nazirabad that fell in the Pishtakhara police dominion, saying it took action after the locals complained that a musical concert was held on Shab-i-Barat. They said they did so in order to preempt a possible clash between the locals and the organisers of the concert held at the farmhouse of Dilshad Afridi, a local resident.
“Police took action after complaints from the local people,” said a spokesperson of Pishtakhara police. “The people had gone to ask the organisers to stop the party several time but they did not do so.”
In addition to the locals who also asked via the social media platforms for action against the party, the police also received complaints from a seminary in the neighbourhood of the house, where the concert was held.

Official says action taken after local people’s complaints to avoid clash

However, the organisers said the police broke into the party, smashing musical instruments and arresting people. They said a bag full of money was also lost in the melee that ensued in wake of the police raid.
“We had gathered on the night of March 18 to celebrate the wedding of my friend with Karan Khan performing for some 100 guests,” said Dilshad Afridi. “The police suddenly raided the venue, manhandling the guests and breaking the instruments.”
The police said none of this happened. There was no use of force but the musicians were taken carefully to the police station under custody to protect them from the angry seminary students and for fear of confrontation. Later, Karan Khan and his band of musicians were released. According to the police spokesperson, nobody approached them to register a case for losing a money bag.
The incident led to heated protests on social media, amidst objections that the police action was uncalled for, with both political and social activists weighing in with the argument.
Mohsin Dawar of the National Democratic Movement took to Twitter saying, “Strongly condemn police attack on @karankhan music show in Peshawar. Police in other provinces provide security to music and cultural events while police in Peshawar attacks such events.” Dawar demanded that immediate punitive action should be taken against those who raided the concert.
Some of the Twitterati found parallels for the police raid in the Taliban intolerance for music in Afghanistan. Others, like Aimal Wali of the Awami National Party, said the ANP would raise the issue on the assembly floor to “find out who used the police as a Taliban force”.
The SHO police said the organisers were asked to report any loss or damage to property but instead, they took to the social media to bring it a bad name.
The Pishtakhara Islahi Committee, a local social welfare organisation, lauded the police raid, saying it was taken against song and dance on Shab-i-Barat.
Meanwhile, artists, rights activists and literati also took strong exception to the alleged harassment of noted Pashto folk singer Karan Khan during the musical concert. 
They urged the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to take notice of the incident. Khadim Hussain, provincial secretary culture of Awami National Party, told this scribe the ‘attack’ on the musical concert was unjustified and termed it a raid on Pakhtun culture. He said his party would raise voice against this incident. 
“According to my information, local police officials were involved in the incident. Karan Khan is a respectable artist and raid on his live performance, breaking of musical instruments and denigrating wedding guests were in no way permissible in a Pakhtun society. The high-ups should take notice of this incident,” Mr Hussain said. 
Social activist Shafeeq Gigyani in a statement condemned the incident and also announced a protest in front of the Peshawar Press Club on Monday (today). 
“Police officials headed by the SHO raided the musical concert, beat up the musicians, broke their musical instruments and got away with a bag full of money,” Mr Gigyani alleged. 
When contacted, Hunari Tolana Welfare Society president Rashid Khan said the artist community condemned the raid against Karan Khan and his colleagues and asked KP authorities to ensure security of artists. 
“The incident has created a sense of insecurity among the artists,” he maintained. 
Tariq Pakhtunyar, a young poet, said that artists and musicians had been under threat in KP for the last several decades and no steps had been taken to ensure their security.

14,Over 50pc independent female candidates contesting local govt polls in KP,ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the...,"ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the political parties for the Neighborhood and Village Councils in the second phase of local government elections being held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) on March 31.
Overall, the independent female candidates constitute 51pc as against 27pc and 22pc women fielded by liberal and religious parties respectively.
This was revealed by Pattan, an NGO that works for democracy, human rights and gender equality in a report released here on Sunday.
It said reserved seats remained vacant or being won without any contest, a phenomenon that had also been seen in the first phase of the polls.
According to Pattan, lack of political will appears to be mainly responsible for low rate of female participation in local elections.
The second phase of local election shows that on an average only 1.76 female candidates are in the field against one seat, while seat to candidate ratio on other categories of seats is much high. For instance, on average there are 10 candidates against one seat for chairmen/mayor category.
Pattan argues that prior conditions (female literacy rate, human development level, women’s participation in labour force and access to public life, etc.,) appear to have played a major role in determining the level of women’s participation in the election.
Because of the existing differentiation, women’s participation as candidates varies from district to district. For instance, in Lower and Upper Kohistan – extremely poor and underdeveloped districts --about 90pc women seats remained vacant. 
In Battagram, out of total 90 female seats as many as 71 or 79pc remained vacant.
In South Waziristan too, more than 68pc of female seats remained vacant, while in Abbottabad, only 32 or 15pc of the 209 seats are vacant. 
In Upper Chitral, female candidates did not leave a single seat vacant.
However, there appears significant variations across districts. 
For instance, share of religious parties is higher than liberal parties in six districts - Mansehra 16pc, North Waziristan 36pc and Kurram 36pc, and Orakzai 32%. The liberal parties have clear edge over religious parties in eight districts - Upper Chitral 33pc, Lower Dir 49pc, Malakand 44pc, Shangla 43pc, Swat 50pc and Upper Dir 57pc. 
In 11 districts the independent candidates constitute clear majority in comparison to combined strength of all parties. 
In Abbottabad 88pc, Battagram 94pc, Upper Chitral 56pc, Lower Chitral 64pc, Mansehra 84pc, North Waziristan 53pc, South Waziristan 81pc, Orakzai 56pc, and Shangla 50pc.
Analysis of the contestation data (ECP Form X List of Contesting Candidates) also reveals some interesting socio-political trends:
1) High participation of female candidates even in the conservative or traditional districts than the combined female candidates of political parties is a clear sign of emergence of new social forces that are ready to play an important role in local governance.
2) Political parties appear to be ignorant of their emergence and have little appetite to broaden and deepen democracy and to avail this opportunity.
3) Political parties seem to be more interested in top positions i.e. mayors and chairpersons than in the quota seats of the marginalised sections of the society.
4) As a large number of women seats will remain vacant even after by-election female populations of many Neighborhood and Village Councils of KPK are likely to be deprived of women representatives.
Pattan’s analysis is primarily based on the ECP’s Form X (list of contesting candidates) of 17 districts.
The Pattan in it’s recommendations said the ECP should make available data and forms of every election promptly.
It said political parties need to invest resources to set up party chapters at grassroots level and must also hold internal party election and ECP should monitor their polling processes.
It also said civil society, women groups and trade unions should plan to field candidates against quota seats.
