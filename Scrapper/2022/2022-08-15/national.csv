0,"Carbon pricing to be enforced under tax policy, ADB assured","Govt commits to approve and commence implementation of National Carbon Pricing Strategy with effect from Jan 1, 2022.","ISLAMABAD: The government has given a commitment to the Asian Develo­pment Bank (ADB) to approve and commence with effect from January 1, 2022 the implementation of National Carbon Pricing Strategy under the country’s overall tax policy to raise tax-to-GDP ratio to 10pc by FY2025 from 8.5pc now.
This is part of about $200 million loan — Resource Mobilisation Reforms programme — of the ADB that has to begin on January 1, 2023 and be completed by end-March 2024, primarily by the Federal Board of Revenue. Under the programme, the government would also expand the track and trace system (TTS) for improved tax recoveries to large number of sectors including petroleum, pharmaceuticals and beverages.
The FBR has availed a series of loan programmes over the past 10-15 years including those from the World Bank to increase tax-to-GDP ratio to 10pc but failed to sustain tax ratios after some initial progress. The tax-to-GDP ratio over this period has fluctuated between 8 and 10 per cent.
The programme is designed by the ADB to promote an inclusive and evidenced-based institutional framework for tax policy and administration for which the government will create a new tax policy wing (TPW) in the Ministry of Finance that would “guide inclusive tax policy design and associated public consultation”.
This wing would undertake legal drafting to ensure that policy objectives are reflected in laws and regulations, conduct revenue and economic impact analysis with specific attention to its implications for gender and guide the government and negotiate tax policy and treaties with other countries.
Under the loan programme conditions, the federal cabinet will approve the submission of the proposed harmonized Inland Revenue (IR) Code to the Parliament and the FBR will roll-out improved products and services for taxpayers based on the results of the independent third-party survey, particularly for women, disabled and vulnerable groups, and people in remote or rural areas.
The FBR will finalize and submit proposed amendments to the legislation on the taxation of cross-border transactions to the federal Cabinet which will align this legislation with international standards and best practice, including the G20’s and OECD’s domestic tax base erosion and profit shifting.
The FBR would also fully operationalize and roll-out SWAPS (an automated financial system of incoming and outgoing transactions including profits etc) through integration in telecom companies and listed companies covering at least 50pc of their transactions as done with methodologies for tax gap analysis in the past for core taxes (import duties, income tax and sales tax).
The system electronic monitoring (TTS) of pharmaceuticals, petroleum, and beverages sectors would be expanded by operationalize a control room for the TTS system to enhance tax revenue collections, reduce counterfeiting, and prevent smuggling of illicit goods.
The FBR will also deploy upgraded software architecture for inland revenue information system (IRIS-2) to integrate modules for taxpayer declaration (income tax and sales tax), refund application, withholding statement, and computerized payment receipt correction and then align the sales tax platform of IRIS-2 with WeBOC system, and Pakistan Single Window (PSW) system and fully roll-out modules under the governance risk and compliance framework for 2022-24.
The FBR will establish and fully operationalize the client-based reporting system (CFRS) by recruiting and deploying adequately skilled staff including at least one gender expert according to approved organizational chart in line with an already completed diagnostic study. Under the programme, the FBR will also introduce the gender and social inclusion policy and action plan and begin implementation of key measures that will support the recruitment promotion and retention of women, transgender persons, persons living with disabilities, and minorities for inclusive and diversified workplace.
In order to improve taxpayer integrity and compliance, the FBR will approve ann­ual compliance improvement programme based on the recommendations from tax gap analysis and sectoral benchmarks.
The loan programme will help the government address major binding constraints to mobilise larger resources to enhance productive investment by improving domestic revenue mobilisation; quality of public expenditure and cash management for improving allocation efficiency of scarce public resources; and mobilisation and utilisation of domestic savings and foreign direct investment (FDI).
Prior to finalising the loan, the ADB had approved a technical assistance to Pakistan to prepare the improved domestic resource mobilisation reform programme to ensure fiscal sustainability and generate fiscal space to finance critical investments in human capital, infrastructure and poverty alleviation.
With a large informal economy, macroeconomic shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and the global supply chain disruption in 2021 have pushed the country’s poor deeper into poverty. According to the ADB, the country’s ability to mobilise adequate domestic resources, including the creation of fiscal space through better expenditure management, remain critical to ensure quality investments in essential public services such as health and education and promote equitable development across its provinces.

1,Rs75 commemorative banknote marks nation’s pledge to tackle climate change,"Markhor and Deodar trees pictured on reverse of Banknote highlight national commitment to address climate change, says SBP.","


 
KARACHI: To mark the country’s 75 years of independence, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Sunday issued a Rs75 commemorative banknote featuring not only the portraits of Quaid-i-Azam Moha­mmad Ali Jinnah, Allama Iqbal, Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah and Sir Syed Ahmed Khan but also highlighting nation’s commitment to address climate change.
The green and white currency note has tones of yellow, where the green represents growth and development and derives inspiration from the country’s Islamic identity and the white colour emphasises religious diversity of the population, according to the SBP. 
“The Markhor and Deodar trees pictured on the reverse of the Banknote highlight our national commitment to address climate change and its repercussions,” a statement issued by the SBP mentioned. 
While unveiling the banknote in a ceremony at the SBP Museum, SBP Acting Governor Dr Murtaza Syed said that while coins and postage stamps were regularly issued to mark days of national importance, it was rare for the SBP to issue a commemorative banknote.
Mr Syed also inaugurated the Roshan Pension Plan (RPP) under the Roshan Digital Account initiative for Overseas Pakistanis. Overs­eas Pakistanis could also avail the benefits of financial planning for their retirement through RPP, he said.
Talking about the economic challenges faced by the economy, Dr Syed advised citizens to not pay heed to misinformation propagated on social media. He hoped the crucial IMF bailout programme would provide reprieve to the country and Pakistan will not be vulnerable as compared to the countries that do not have the IMF programme.

2,Awake brain surgery with shortest stay at Islamabad hospital sets the bar high,"Doctor says awake brain surgeries are performed in some countries, but discharging patient on the day of surgery is rare.","ISLAMABAD: Just hours after undergoing an awake brain operation, as claimed by a neurosurgeon in the federal capital, a 32-year-old patient was allowed to go home in a rare instance of medical advancement in the country.
The surgery was performed by Prof Dr Akbar Ali Khan, a neurosurgeon at Maroof International Hospital having the expertise in minimally invasive brain and spine surgery, on Asim Shehzad who was later advised to visit after a week for a follow-up examination.
In recent years, doctors at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad and Aga Khan Hospital in Karachi have performed awake brain surgeries, also known as craniotomy, but mostly patients are not discharged the same day after the operation. 
In a statement, Dr Khan said awake brain tumour surgery was a complex neurosurgical technique that he had been practising for last four years. “Through this technique, the tumour is removed, saving the patient from brain damage and paralysis. I am delighted that after four years of my hard work, I successfully conducted the most difficult and complicated operation in Pakistan. The biggest advantage of this surgery is that the patient had control over his limbs and speech throughout the operation,” he said.

Method reduces operation’s cost, claims Dr Akbar

He said awake brain surgeries were held in some countries, but discharging the patient the same day of the surgery was a dream that rarely came true across the world. “At present, Howard University in the US and a hospital in Toronto, Canada, have been performing awake brain surgeries in which patients are discharged the same day. I have worked in UK and till 2018, not a single such surgery was performed. Even after that I did not get any information that such a surgery has been performed to date,” Dr Khan said, adding that he was grateful to all doctors who had taken part in the operation.
In reply to a question, he said that during traditional surgeries patients had to stay for at least five days in the hospital due to which the cost of surgery increased a lot. 
“As Pakistan is a developing country, it is not possible for a large number of patients to afford the cost of brain surgeries, but awake brain tumour surgeries will facilitate patients to get treatment at a much lower cost,” he said.
When asked about the patient, Dr Khan said the name of the patient, who allowed him to disclose his identity, was Asim Shehzad. “He was discharged from the hospital the same day just hours after the surgery. I have advised him to come for a follow-up visit after a week and then after six months he will undergo an MRI test to see if there is any re-growth the tumour,” he said.
He said it was an advanced surgery and hospitals should go for it as it reduced patients’ stay in the hospital and made the surgery affordable for a large number of patients. “It is a delicate surgery in which a mild anaesthesia is given and small cuts have to be ensured,” he said. 
During the surgery, Dr Khan said he asked the patient “Pakistan Ka Matlab Kia?” and the patient actively responded: “Laila Ilaha IllAllah, Muhammad ur Rasool Allah.”  
According to hospital sources, the patient was discharged within 12 hours of his surgery. 
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Ministry of National Health Services, Mr Sajid Shah, said it was very positive and encouraging development that a private hospital in Islamabad had performed an awake brain surgery in which the patient was discharged the same day after surgery. “The private sector has been providing health treatment to 70 per cent of the country’s population and it has been contributing in managing the load of the patients,” he added.
Mr Shah expressed the hope that more such hospitals would come forward to bring innovation in their treatment facilities for the betterment of the patients and decreasing the financial burden on them.

3,Imran flays govt for ‘cracking down’ on pro-PTI media,"""If we allow these terror tactics ...  to succeed, then we will be returning to the dark days of dictatorship,"" he says.","ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan has condemned what he called a government crackdown on the media houses and journalists supporting Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s narrative.
“I want to warn our nation of an unprecedented crackdown campaign by the imported government and state machinery against media houses and journalists who are carrying PTI and my narrative to the public,” Mr Khan tweeted on Sunday. “Two journalists, Arshad Sharif and Sabir Shakir, have had to leave Pakistan fearing for their lives.”
In subsequent tweets, he said others like Imran Riaz Khan, Sami Ibrahim and Ayaz Amir had suffered threats, violent attacks and arrests.

 





 
“In my mass public campaign across Pakistan from next week, I will take up the issue of media freedom and freedom of expression. If we allow these terror tactics, designed simply to target PTI and myself, to succeed, then we will be returning to the dark days of dictatorship when there was no independent media and no room for freedom of expression.”
He said haqeeqi azadi (real freedom) could not be achieved without a free media and freedom of speech as guaranteed in the Constitution.
Meanwhile, former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry alleged on Sunday that the information ministry had received Rs750 million from the government to observe Independence Day celebrations but “still failed to hold impressive events”.
“The PTI government gave the task to young officers who worked hard to prepare a wonderful plan. I wonder why their suggestions were ignored [by the current government],” he said in a Twitter post.

4,PM Shehbaz visits residence of Balochistan chopper crash martyr,"Martyrs are nation’s pride and their sacrifices will never go in vain, says Marriyum.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday visited the residence of martyred army officer Maj Talha Manan, who lost his life this month in a helicopter crash during a flood relief operation in Balochistan, to offer his condolences.
The premier met the bereaved family members and offered fateha for the departed soul, Prime Minister Office said in a statement.
Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aura­ngzeb, who accompanied Mr Sharif during the visit, said martyrs were the nation’s pride and their sacrifices would never go in vain.
“Our martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the right path,” she said while offering her condolences to Maj Manan’s family.

Martyrs are nation’s pride and their sacrifices will never go in vain, says Marriyum

Maj Manan is survived by two sons. In a meeting with his mother, Ms Aurangzeb paid tribute to him for rendering great sacrifice for the country.
“The entire nation was proud of the mothers who gave birth to the sons like Talha Manan,” she said, adding that his sacrifice for the country would never be forgotten.
The minister said every officer and soldier of the Pakistan Army was wholly devoted to serving the country.
Major Manan was among the six service members martyred in the Aug 1 Lasbela chopper crash, including Commander XII Cor­ps Lt Gen Sarfraz Ali. 
The army aviation helicopter, which was helping with flood relief work in Balochistan, lost contact with air traffic control and crashed on a mountain, leaving no survivors.

5,World is her oyster: Hazara girl recounts journey to Harvard,Karima Batool clinched a gold medal at GIK Institute and now she is on her way to joining Harvard University.,"

Karima Batool

 
SWABI: Despite the material hardships and persecution she faced for being a Hazara girl, Karima Batool managed to clinch a gold medal at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering and Technology and now she is on her way to joining Harvard University.
Karima, a resident of Quetta’s Mari Abad neighbourhood, was raised by a working-class family who migrated from Afghanistan two generations ago. Quetta, however, was no different for them as they still lived under the shadow of fear. But fear did not deter her from turning her dreams into reality.
She started attending a school in her neighbourhood and her parents did everything to support her education despite having no formal education at all. Over the years, she managed to win awards for her work at the national and international levels. 
“GIKI not only groomed me professionally but it also introduced me to a new and better version of myself,” Karima says while speaking about her time at the Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute.
She recalls that though her initial year at the institute was testing, she managed to overcome the tribulations through sheer hard work and at one point students started coming to her for advice on good grades. Karima also became the president of the Women Engineering Society and she, alongside her team, breathed a new life into this organisation which was on the brink of collapse. “I participated in three international competitions on its platform and won a prominent position which proved very helpful in clinching the gold medal,” she says.
Her journey took great resilience. Youngest among six siblings, Karima says she did not like the “white and blue” uniform which she wore to an “Urdu medium” school in the neighbourhood and her schooling was dotted with incidents of discrimination based on her gender and ethnic identity.
In a conversation with Dawn, she dwells upon the ghettoisation of the Hazara community in Quetta. “We were confined to our homes” amid widespread targeted killings and bombings. 
She says her cousin was killed in an explosion in front of her eyes when she was in her fifth grade; and the memory still haunts her. All this violence took a toll on my self-esteem as well, she says, recalling her struggles.
Karima credits her parents for providing her an enabling environment where she thrived and started to excel in academic and non-academic activities.
“In fact, my parents promoted my interests and always provided full moral and financial support in critical times throughout my endeavours despite financial hardships,” she says. She also expressed gratitude for her supportive siblings. 
Shackles of patriarchy
But it took time to convince her parents, according to Karima.
“Despite securing the fifth position in the board examination, it took me another couple of years to break the shackles of patriarchy and to prove that a woman can live miles away from her family all by herself,” she recalls.
Karima says she overcame her fear and societal constraints and soon she was winning accolades in national and international science fairs. “In 10th grade, I represented Balochistan in a national science and engineering fair in Islamabad and won an excellent award for my multiplication game designed for school dropouts,” she tells Dawn.
“These fairs helped me expand my horizon as I was introduced, in the capacity of a young researcher and developer, to a new level of diversity and inclusive environment,” Karima reminisces. Her professional growth demanded such an environment.
Today, she is a proud Hazara who broke through the glass ceiling. “My parents are proud,” she tells Dawn. Karima says she wants to play her role in the uplift of the Hazara community and she is already counseling young students for three years. “I am giving something which I had yearned for when I was their age; this will motivate them to realise their dreams.”
At Harvard, she wishes to explore more of her interest and expose herself to the rich academic and professional world that is Ivy League. There are hits and misses, but every opportunity needs to be taken advantage of.
“I can say with confidence that I have made full use of everything offered to me in my student life, and today I walk with my head held high.” 
Now Harvard is Karima’s oyster.

6,"Independence Day celebrated with zeal, fervour in GB, Balochistan","""We, as a nation, should carefully analyse what we have lost and found over the last 75 years,"" says Balochistan acting governor.","QUETTA / Gilgit: The Independence Day was celebrated with great enthusiasm and zeal across Balochistan and Gilgit Baltistan on Sunday with the determination to make Pakistan a developed and prosperous nation.
Flag hoisting ceremonies were held in Quetta and other areas of Balocshitan while political parties, members of civil societies and youth organisations took out processions carrying national flags on cars and motorbikes throughout the day.
Key ceremonies were held at Governor House, Balochistan Assembly, Balochistan High Court and all divisional and district headquarters.
Balochistan Acting Governor Mir Jan Muhammad Jamali congratulated the entire nation on 75 years of independence and noted that Pakistan was the only nuclear power among Muslim countries, “which makes its defence impregnable”.
He said Balochistan was the guarantor of the country’s bright future, so the federal government must also play an active role in developing the province and bringing prosperity to its people.
“We got freedom after a long struggle of our elders and countless sacrifices. 
“Now, it’s the responsibility of the young generation to maintain their freedom forever,” Mr Jamali said.
“On this important day, we, as a nation, should carefully analyse what we have lost and found over the last 75 years.”
Speaking at a flag hoisting ceremony in the lawns of the provincial assembly, Balochistan Chief Minister Abdul Qudus Bizenjo said freedom was a great blessing of Allah which we should cherish and should not hesitate to make any sacrifice to protect and develop the country.
He regretted that the nations that became independent after Pakistan were now more developed.
“We are lagging behind them because we failed to play our role for the development and prosperity of Pakistan.”
The chief minister noted that citizens were going through a tough phase across the province due to recent rains and flash floods but stressed that it had also ended a long drought and raised  groundwater levels.
He also expressed sorrow over the crash of a military helicopter during a relief operation in Lasbela earlier this month and said history will always remember the officers who had lost their lives in that accident.
The chief minister paid homage to Lt Gen Sarfraz Ali and five other service members who were martyred in the incident and said the manner in which the Pakistan Army had conducted relief work in the flood-hit districts was commendable.
He claimed relief goods were supplied to the people affected by floods in a transparent manner and no case of corruption in the delivery of relief goods was reported.
He also noted that helicopters were used to supply relief goods and rescue citizens in some areas.
The chief minister said the biggest challenge was rehabilitating the affected people and the damaged communication system.
The unprecedented rains in Balochistan badly damaged the communication system and government infrastructure, he said.
He expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal government for their cooperation.
The premier’s visits to Balochistan’s flood-hit areas was a proof of his love for the province, the chief minister added.
Independence Day celebrations were also held in Dera Murad Jamali, Khuzdar, Kalat, Turbat, Loralai, Noshki, Gwadar, Pishin, Chaman, Sibi, Hub, Ziarat, Dera Bugti and other areas of the province.
Lt Gen Ghafoor’s visit to Quetta
Meanwhile, Commander XII Corps Lt Gen Asif Ghafoor paid a surprise visit to Quetta on Independence Day and met citizens.
He visited several areas of the city without additional protocol and stopped at several places.
It was Lt Gen Ghafoor’s first visit to the city after assuming the office of the XII corps commander.
Celebrations in GB
The Independence Day was celebrated across Gilgit-Baltistan with traditional zeal and fervour.
The  national flag was hoisted on all important public and private  buildings, offices and tourists areas while bazaars and markets were  illuminated with colourful lights.
Rallies and functions were held to highlight the importance of the day.
The  main function was held at Yadgar-i-Shohda in Chinarbagh area of Gilgit  where Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Khalid Khurshid Khan hoisted the flag. 
Speaking on the occasion, the chief  minister said that the independence of Pakistan had inspired the people  of GB to revolt against the Dogra regime and they finally  secured independence on November 1, 1947.
A floral wreath was laid  at the mausoleum of Havaldar Lalak Jan Shaheed in Ghizer district to pay homage to the brave son of the soil.
Force Command Gilgit-Baltistan Major General Jawwad Ahmad laid the floral wreath. 
A  contingent of Pakistan Army presented guard of honour while  people from different walks of life, civil and military officials and  relatives of the Havaldar Lalak Jan Shaheed attended the ceremony.
