5,PHC grants bail to suspect in honour killing case,Legal heirs of deceased reach compromise with petitioner...,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court has granted bail to a suspect charged in honour-related murder of his sister, who had contracted marriage with her free will over two months ago in Swat district.
A single-member bench consisting of Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan accepted plea of the suspect, Shaukat Ali, as legal heirs of the deceased woman, Ms Mehnaz, entered into compromise with him. The bench directed the petitioner to submit two sureties of Rs300,000 each.
The husband of the deceased, Momin Khan, appeared before the bench and stated that in the larger interest of the family they had affected a compromise with the suspect, Shaukat Ali.
Similarly, other legal heirs including mother and two brothers of the deceased had also submitted their affidavits before the court, stating that they had patched up the matter and were no more interested to prosecute the suspect.

Legal heirs of deceased reach compromise with petitioner

The FIR of the occurrence was registered at Khursheed Shaheed police station in Swat on June 29, 2022, under section 302 (intentional murder) and section 311 (mischief on earth) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The complainant in the FIR was SHO Shujaat Ali Khan, who stated that he had received information that dead body of Meghnaz had been lying in Khwazakhela hospital.
On inquiry, he stated, he was informed that about a month prior to the occurrence, she had left her residence and for the said elopement one Momin Khan was charged.
He stated that on the day of occurrence, her brother Shaukat Ali brought her from Mardan and killed her on pretext of honour.
Later on, the mother and brothers of the deceased also charged Shaukat Ali for the commission of the offence in their statements, recorded with a local magistrate under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The petitioner’s counsel, Ali Namdar, referred to an earlier judgment of the high court, stating that in almost identical facts and circumstances the compromise was considered as a sole ground for the grant of bail.
He also contended that his client was falsely implicated in the case as there was no eyewitness to the occurrence to depose against him.
He argued that the story of the prosecution was based on presumption and could not be believed. He added that the petitioner was entitled to the concession of bail.
Earlier, an additional district and sessions judge in Swat had rejected bail plea of the suspect, observing that the pistol used in the offence was recovered on pinpointing of the suspect.
The court had also observed that the suspect had confessed to his crime before a judicial magistrate and if in such like cases lenient view was taken, it would create chaos in the society.
Despite compromise, the additional sessions judge had ruled that courts still had the discretion to reject plea of compromise in appropriate cases like the present one as such offences were non-bailable and not compoundable.

7,KP health dept starts categorisation of hospitals offering free treatment,"Payment to be made according to infrastructure, services.","PESHAWAR: The health department has started categorisation of the empanelled hospitals offering free treatment under Sehat Card Plus (SCP) scheme to offer rates to them on the basis of the quality of their services being provided to patients.
“The categorisation of health facilities will give us an idea about their infrastructure including availability of doctors, equipment, human resources and other facilities there on the basis of which they would be offered rates for different operations, admissions and surgical procedures,” Dr Amir Rafiq, the director empanelment of SCP, told Dawn.
He said that so far they had empanelled a total of 1,115 hospitals including 861 private and 254 public health facilities across the country where 1.57 million families of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and newly-merged districts were entitled to seek free treatment.
Of these, 203 including 149 private and 54 public sector hospitals are located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 912 in other provinces where the people having the Computerised National Identity Cards of the province are eligible to avail treatment up to Rs1 million per year.

Payment to be made according to infrastructure, services

Dr Amir said that all those facilities had been selected for cashless services on the basis of their infrastructure and were given rates differently. “As empanelment of hospitals for the scheme is an ongoing exercise due to increase in the number of patients, therefore, we have undertaken the exercise to divide the health facilities into five categories from one to five and offer them rates accordingly,” he added.
The best facilities would be bracketed in the category-5, which will receive more amounts in lieu of treatment of patients whereas the remaining facilities falling in 4, 3, 2 and 1 categories will get low rates.
Dr Amir said that the categorisation would result in competition among the hospitals and they would try to move to better category by improving their quality of services. He said that presently some hospitals were also complaining about the lower rates compared to the ones that getting more amount for the same treatment and procedures but after categorisation, there would no complaint as the rates would be fixed in line with their services.
He said that the number of patients was increasing since the extension of the programme to entire population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in November 2019 due to which the department required to empanel more hospitals and cater to the needs of patients.
“We recorded 88,329 admissions in June, the highest number in one month, since the launch of the programme with 68 per cent in private hospitals and 32 per cent in public sector. Last year, we spent Rs20.108 billion on free treatment of 818,275 patients,” said Dr Amir.
He said that with passing of time, the government was including new procedures and treatments in the scheme like renal and liver transplants, costing Rs1.4 million and Rs5 million, respectively. He said that so far, 98 patients had undergone free renal transplants and 31 liver transplants. Other costly treatments included cardiac, gynea and oncology procedures, he said.
Dr Amir said that Health Minister Taimur Khan Jhagra constantly monitored the flagship initiative of the government to remove its weaknesses and further improve it to benefit more patients. “Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has given legal status to Universal Health Insurance Programme due to which we are motivating the hospitals to upgrade the quality of their services to get empanelled,” he added.
He said that since start of the programme in 2016, the government had spent Rs33.563 billion on the treatment of more than 1.375 patients. He said that the services had improved greatly during the past few years. He said that contracts of many hospitals were cancelled for violating the agreements. He added that new hospitals were empanelled to ensure that people receives quality treatment services under the programme free of cost.

8,Delay increases cost of Swabi dam project,Construction work remained suspended for a year over technical issues...,"SWABI: The cost of the under-construction Utla Dam project in Gadoon Amazai area here has gone up from Rs1,500 million to Rs2,400 million because of suspension of work over technical grounds for almost a year. 
Sources in the communication and works department told Dawn on Sunday that this project would now cost Rs900 million more than the earlier estimated cost. They said all the funds for the project had been provided by the federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments and work on it was now in full swing. 
The dam is a drinking water project because the people of Gadoon Amazai mountainous belt usually faces shortage of water and the district administration has to arrange tankers to meet the need of the people. 

Construction work remained suspended for a year over technical issues

The sources said that the project earlier scheduled to be completed in 2023 was now expected to take three more years. 
They said that after emergence of certain issues a second consultant was hired who rejected the claim of first consultant and declared that there were no solid rocks at the bed of the dam. 
The sources said that the circumstances forced the government officials to stop work for resolving the related technical issues first. 
“To clear the confusion, the government told the officials of communication and works department to conduct another survey, which established that there were rocks in the dam bed,” said the sources quoting Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MPA Rangaiz Khan. 
The sources said that the spillway design had also undergone a change, making it more workable and durable. They said that Mr Rangaiz and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser were kept updated about the issues as the area fell in their constituency. 
They said that after the claim of the second consultant, which delayed the project for almost a year, the construction activities on the dam were now in full swing. 
They said that a road leading to the dam had been taken from Topi-Utla road. This road will make travel easy from Utla to the dam and also help the people to reach the scenic Mahaban Mountain.
