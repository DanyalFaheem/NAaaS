0,A disappointing trajectory,The question is how sustainable is it to depend on foreign largesse and ignore critical governance and fiscal reforms.,"


 
At 75, Pakistan — in the words of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) — is at a ‘challenging economic juncture’. No wonder most Pakistanis today are poor, hungry and angry. The nation of 220 million people is ranked 154th among 189 countries and territories by the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Index. It is at the bottom of the list of South Asian countries, including Iran, and just above war-ravaged Afghanistan. Iran, facing decades of international sanctions, has invested much more in its people to rank at 70th position on the index.
The index is a summary measure of average achievements in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and having a decent standard of living. Pakistan’s ranking on it is a reflection of the national policy choices its ruling classes have made over the last three-quarters of a century. It also shows that the country’s economic performance has been underwhelming compared to most other regional nations. Even in years of growth when the economy expanded by an average of 6 per cent between 1960 and 1990, governments did not invest in human development.

That it has not invested enough in human development explains why Pakistan has failed to grow and remains a low-income consumer economy in spite of having received enormous external financing in loans, grants and aid by selling to the world its strategic location in the region. The flow of free money fueling consumption-based growth meant that the ruling classes would never feel the need to fix the questionable economic and security policies that have held down growth, sustained poverty, inequality and underdevelopment, and fueled religious extremism and ethnic militancy.
The gross underinvestment in human development meant that successive civil and military governments would look for consumption-driven shortcuts to growth to protect their political capital despite repeated ‘boom-and-bust cycles’ that always lead the country to the IMF for its bailout money to stabilise its balance-of-payment imbalance.

The flow of free money fueling consumption-based growth meant that the ruling classes never felt the need to fix the questionable economic and security policies that have held down growth, sustained poverty, inequality and underdevelopment and fueled religious extremism and ethnic militancy

Recently, the IMF said that Pakistan has a difficult external environment combined with procyclical domestic policies that have fueled domestic demand to unsustainable levels. It goes without saying that each new IMF programme has caused more pain to the people as none of the governments has shown an inclination to implement structural reforms for sustainable and inclusive growth.
When the new government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif came into power a little over four months back, it was expected to undertake critical reforms. With almost every political party backing the coalition government and the ‘tough’ decisions it needed to take, finance minister Miftah Ismail also promised the same. However, it appears to have baulked at the idea of sacrificing more political capital for difficult reforms — at least until the next elections, and chose to just fight the current liquidity crisis by securing the IMF dollars.
The budget shows the political choices made by the Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government. No doubt it had little space to make difficult decisions in the face of a swirling political crisis, growing power shortages and inflation. Yet, the fact that it chose to not tax the untaxed and undertaxed segments of the economy, and put the entire burden of additional taxes on existing individual and corporate taxpayers underscores its lack of commitment to undertake tough structural reforms to steer the economy on a sustainable growth path.
The additional taxes imposed on the corporations do not help the broader narrative of increasing the tax base or documenting the informal economy for boosting the existing tax-to-GDP ratio of 9pc, one of the lowest ratios in the world. It has conveniently spared the PML-N’s core constituency, traders, and stops far short of netting agriculture, professionals, etc. Likewise, it also frees the PML-N and its coalition partners from the need to reduce wasteful expenditure on the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that have been haemorrhaging taxpayers’ money for years now.
In his recent TV interviews, Mr Miftah has repeatedly stated that the government has taken steps that will put the country on the right track. But has it? The policies and actions implemented so far will indeed bring the country out of its present liquidity crisis with the help of the IMF bailout money expected to start flowing in from the end of this month. The question is how sustainable is it to depend on foreign largesse and ignore critical governance and fiscal reforms for a country that is fighting for its survival as the recent spike in the global commodity and energy prices has exacerbated its debt problems.
The main issue facing Pakistan’s economy pertains to its inability to earn sufficient dollars to pay for its import bill and retire debt. This cannot be tackled without implementing meaningful reforms aimed to boost competitiveness, business environment and industrial and agricultural productivity, attract direct investment in productive sectors that promote exports and a sustained effort to end the regulatory mess and protectionist policies that encourage rent-seeking, holding down growth, and sustaining poverty and inequality. But structural economic reforms are not enough for achieving sustainable growth. The government must invest in human capital, execute land reforms and improve rule of law.
Last but not least, Pakistan needs to reset its foreign policy priorities and use its geostrategic advantage to integrate itself deeper with the regional economies for rapid and sustainable growth and development. Political and territorial disputes with neighbours, especially India, should not be allowed to trump the country’s economic interests. As Mian Mohammad Mansha, chairman of the Nishat Group, one of the country’s largest business conglomerates, recently said in an interview: “Disputes between countries should not impact bilateral trade; resumption of trade between Pakistan and India will throw fresh possibilities.”

1,Changing geopolitics,Foreign assistance and aid contribute to future economic development only when we employ them in development projects wisely.,"As we celebrate the completion of 75 years of freedom, the time is ripe for choosing a wiser course of action for future economic development.
Historically, foreign aid played an important role in Pakistan’s economic development in the 1960s and 1970s. During this period, the country made a massive investment in physical infrastructure, electric power and irrigation projects with the help of foreign aid. Mega projects such as Tarbela and Mangla dams were constructed during this period.
Foreign aid during these two decades, mixed with domestic private and public investment, enabled Pakistan to undertake crucial public sector projects including the construction of road networks, electric power generation, construction of the Indus Superhighway and the establishment of Pakistan Steel Mills. These and other similar projects were launched during the governments of General Ayub Khan and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.
Read: Money & control 
In the 1960s, yearly net inflows of development assistance and foreign aid into Pakistan ranged between $252 million and $501m and in the 1970s, between $282m and $1.01 billion, according to the World Bank. (The current value of $1.01bn received in 1976 comes to around $5.21bn after adjusting for US inflation during this period).

International assistance is influenced by Pakistan’s position in the region

The separation of then East Pakistan, which became Bangladesh on Dec 16, 1971, however, changed the dynamics of foreign aid inflows towards the South Asian region. Aid inflows to new-born Bangladesh grew in terms of percentage of Gross National Product leaving Pakistan behind, scanning of the World Bank stats reveals.
Besides, even during the 1970s, foreign aid disbursement into Pakistan markedly fell during 1977-78 and 1978-79 to $593.3m and $631.7m, as the US curtailed aid because of Islamabad’s nuclear policy.
But as soon as Pakistan (under Gen Zia’s regime) became a front-line ally of the US in its war with the then Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Afghanistan, inflows of net development assistance and foreign aid got thicker again. During the 1980s, yearly inflows oscillated between $625m in 1984 and $1.19bn in 1989. The current value of $1.19bn in 1989 is about $2.844bn. This amount is still higher than what Pakistan got in development assistance and foreign aid in 2020 —$2.59bn.
That provides us with a clue about how Pakistan’s positioning in geopolitics plays a part in determining the size of international economic assistance and foreign aid. The shift in the US policy of foreign aid to Pakistan — from aid sanctions between 1985 and 1995 on concerns regarding Islamabad’s nuclear ambitions to the wide opening of the gates of foreign aid after 9/11 — is another, more recent example of how foreign aid into Pakistan remains linked with the geopolitical interests of the donor countries in particular and the Western world at large.
History offers us a few lessons even in the case of net development assistance and foreign aid. The first and foremost lesson is that inflows of such aid and assistance, too, remain tied to our positioning in geopolitics.
The second lesson is that foreign assistance and aid contribute to future economic development only when we employ them in development projects wisely. Both Gen Ayub Khan and Z.A. Bhutto deserve credit for using foreign development assistance with a futuristic outlook of the then Pakistan’s economy.
Even during Gen Musharraf’s era foreign funds received (in addition to the compensation paid to Pakistan for the economic fallout of being a front-line ally of the US in its War on Terror) were spent on capacity building of institutions, for introducing the required improvement in the social sector, particularly in education — and for strengthening district governments. Earlier Benazir’s and Nawaz Sharif’s governments had also channelised foreign aid and assistance into social sectors, particularly in health and education.
The third lesson, which can be drawn easily from the ongoing China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) funding, is that partnering for progress with the world’s economic superpowers is fast replacing the concept of development assistance. This is truer in the case of the relationship between emerging economies (with geopolitical aspirations) and developing countries.
Advance economies still provide assistance and aid to developing countries but unlike in the past, their assistance has become more target oriented. They now want to ensure that such assistance is used in the recipient countries for meeting Social Development Goals or for partnering in progress in common areas of interest.
It was easier to build mega projects in the 1960s and 1970s with the help of foreign aid and assistance because those inflows covered a significant portion of the total cost of those projects. But just look at the financing mix of any large CPEC-related project and you will find that commercial Chinese loans and foreign direct investment, or in some cases interest-based Chinese state financing, form the bulk of the financing even where the requirement of counterpart Pakistan’s domestic financing is low. You will not see foreign aid and zero-rated development assistance featured in the financing mix except in very few cases where the projects fall in the areas of knowledge sharing or strengthening of cultural ties.

2,Diverse views in policymaking,"Pakistan’s politics are highly partisan, with little cooperation or compromise between the government and parliament.","There is some impression gaining ground among analysts that the maximum economic stress is behind us, at least for a brief period as frequently witnessed in the past in absence of structural reforms and sustainable economic growth.And there is also a growing view that prices have hit a level where these are expected to stabilise. And the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) average inflation rate forecast remains unchanged between 18-20 per cent for the current fiscal year despite the higher rate of inflation recorded over the past two months.
With a sharp drop in imports in July and the reduced current account deficit, the central bank on August 5, reversed the cash margins on imports from 100pc to 25pc and in some cases to zero. But the government ban on imports was not lifted as stipulated.
Finally, perhaps no less important, the concerns of local markets about a further tightening of monetary policy owing to high headline inflation seems to have been mitigated by two different statements of the Acting SBP Governor Dr Murtaza Syed.
Read: Wanted: a non-partisan economic plan
“We do not have to create an economic recession to bring inflation down and real positive interest rate can be achieved in the long run,” said Dr Syed in an interview with an English daily. This is not in tune with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) prescription.

Pakistan’s politics are highly partisan, with little cooperation or compromise between the government and parliament — the role of the military is seen as a guarantee of stability but is also criticised for undermining civil governance capacity

While reiterating that the rupee would not be managed artificially, he made it clear in another media talk that “speculators could not be allowed to do whatever they want to do. The central bank would remain vigilant in taking action to stop the disorderly movement of the exchange rate.” Some steps have also been taken in this direction.Earlier local markets were concerned that further policy tightening measures could lead to a recession.
After two years of 6pc economic growth, Dr Syed said “we can afford to slow down the economy but we can not slow it to the point where there is a danger of recession.”
Similar views about the US interest rate outlook with risks of recession have been expressed lately by the US Federal Reserve. In fact, famous economist James K. Galbraith argues that tightening US monetary policy (MP) will inflict social and economic harm with little or no payoff.
But Dr Syed’s approach seems to be somewhat different. In an article on Dr Mahbbub ul Haq’s vision and insights, he recalled that his mentor had argued that the mythical force of demand and supply does not work when people are shackled by low purchasing power or a handful of monopolists. Dr Syed takes pride in acknowledging that “ Dr Mahbub taught me all I know about economics that is ultimately worth knowing.”
President of Punjab Bank Zafar Masud described Dr Syed’s observations about MP ‘as a significant step in the right direction. Mr Masud, who was involved in monetary policymaking in the recent past, says monetary measures should be pegged with the ‘most stable inflationary number’ or core inflation index that excludes high volatility commodities such as food and energy that have been hit by the global supercycle and supply chain issues and a surge in administered utility prices at home.

The headline inflation is 25pc which is more than double the rate of core inflation of 12pc

Today, the gap between the headline and the core numbers is perhaps the widest, with headline inflation of 25pc — which is more than double core inflation of 12pc. For long the monetary policy was anchored on core inflation before being abandoned under IMF’s ongoing stability programme.
Pakistan needs to move towards an inflation-targeting framework focused on core inflation that will benefit the economy more holistically, says Dr Masud. Thus he believes that markets will have greater transparency and confidence in SBP’s policy actions.
Referring to unsustainable and unaffordable imports, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail told the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry that Pakistanis should live within their means and in a dignified manner instead of asking for loans. “If we have exports of just $30 billion, then we should not import as much (as we do). If we do not have products to sell to the world, we should not buy things from it either.”
While recognising the need for balance in trade, analysts and economists note that imports are a complex problem in Pakistan. Exporters also favour imports as they use reportedly over 30pc of imported constituents for their exportable goods. They say the government also does not want exports to fall by slashing imports.
The key issue here is that the country has not been able for decades to produce enough goods and services to meet its domestic demand particularly fuelled by surging workers’ remittances (WRs). However, the $31bn WRs in 2021-22 do play a crucial role in financing the current account deficits.
The country’s economic model is too reliant on consumption, which accounts bulk of overall output while investment and exports make up 15pc and 10pc, respectively. As a result, Dr Syed says, the country runs a perennial current account deficit. This leaves the country at the mercy of foreign savings.
The acting SBP governor recalls how Dr Mahbub ul Haque pioneered the paradigm of human development and with it the vastly influential human index which looks beyond GDP to capture other vital dimensions of human well-being — such as decent education, good health, political freedom, cultural identity, personal security, community participation and environmental security.
Hybrid democracy is also identified as a major hurdle in economic progress. According to European Union’s Multi-Annual Indicative Programme report on Pakistan for 2021-22, politics is highly partisan, with little cooperation and compromise solutions between government and parliament. The role of the military in politics and administration is seen as a guarantee of stability but is also criticised for undermining civil government’s governance capacity.
In absence of real accountability of elected representatives by voters in free and fair elections, a hybrid democracy provides the space for dynastical politics. In fact, they are political twins.
Getting the basics of the economy right is important but there can be no boilerplate solutions for achieving them that can simply be imported, says Dr Syed, and adds, that local realities must be kept in mind.

3,Agri’s 75 years of success and stagnation,"Despite early victories, lack of investments in research and planning has led to the disappointing over-reliance on imports.","


 
Agriculture, by far, is the biggest human activity in Pakistan, providing a way of life to two-thirds of the population, contributing 22.7 per cent to GDP, providing 37.4pc of national employment and anchoring over 70pc of exports.
Despite this phenomenal importance, the last 75 years present a patchy picture of the sector: progressing here and regressing there — enviable during a certain period and disappointing in others. Painting this decade-wise picture tells us that it witnessed record growth in the 1960s before slumping during the early 1970s. Recovering in the second half of the 70s, it sustained around 5pc growth in the 80s and 90s.
Since then, a growth rate between less than 1pc to 4pc has merely covered population growth and demand for food and fibre for the last two decades.
Historically speaking, the stage for early growth was set by a commission in the late fifties, which led to multiple development strategies through the sixties. Commonly known as the Green Revolution, it was an era of high, rather record, growth with the introduction of high-yielding crop varieties. Modern inputs like fertiliser and pesticides were introduced and progressive irrigation ways revolutionised the sector.

Despite early victories, lack of investments in research and planning has led to the disappointing over-reliance on imports while water is scarce and soil deteriorates

During that decade (1963-73), Pakistan’s per capita income grew by a healthy 27pc. As added an advantage, this growth mainly occurred in rural areas, where poverty resided. This high growth period led to the setting up of the embryonic fertiliser, tractor and seed industry, which later grew to expand to their current levels. The early seventies also saw the beginning of the poultry industry, which now boasts of over Rs400 billion investment and is a proud global competitor when it comes to technology and stocks.
The next foundational policy document was produced three decades down the line by Pakistan’s most prolific technocrat Sartaj Aziz in the late eighties, which not only diagnosed the then emerging ills but also prescribed its treatment and set parameters for the way forward. For most writers and experts in the sector, it is still considered the most relevant, but ignored, document.
For the next 34 years ago, no one bothered to seek guidelines from it or refresh it through another attempt at the same level, thus creating a policy vacuum at the national level.
However, beyond these works, which should have created a policy and development discipline, the sector has grown at its own pace and direction — dictated by potential and profits, regardless of sustainability and cost of the experiment.
In the last seven decades, crop concentration has hit 167pc against the 67pc of irrigation planning — producing three crops instead of the historical one crop from the same soil. Imported hybrid seeds multiplied the number and yields of crops beyond most calculations and sustainability.
For example, maize, which at merely 705,000 tonnes in the 70s, has gone beyond eight million tonnes. Rice numbers grow both in variety and yield and hit production of 7.5m tonnes — with over 4m tonnes being exported — making Pakistan the tenth largest producer globally.
Cotton production rose from 188,000 bales in the 1950s to over 14m bales at one point, before dipping down to half of it right now. Sugarcane stood at 81m tonnes in 2020 — rising from 23m tonnes in 1971. The potato crop has gone beyond 6m tonnes.
All these figures look impressive when taken out of context because they have put Pakistan on the world food map in a respectable position: cotton, rice and mango (4th), milk, sugarcane and date palm (5th), citrus (6th), wheat and onion (7th), chickpea (3rd) and apricot (6th).
However, when taken in the backdrop of the cost of this unplanned growth on soil health and underground water, the achievements are disastrous. According to global standards, the soil must have 1.29pc organic matter to qualify as healthy. In Pakistan, most of it has fallen below 1pc, with massive tracks having only half of 1pc.
As far as subsoil water is concerned, Pakistan’s potential is 68bn square meters, out of which 60bn square meters are being exploited. It is not being exploited only in those areas where pumping the water out is not feasible for technical or economic reasons. It means that this resource is almost exhausted. In most of Punjab, as some recent studies indicate, the level is dropping by one to three feet every year.
Even among those crops, which have seen a phenomenal rise in the last few decades, the two most crucial ones — wheat and cotton — have hit stubborn stagnation. Wheat has been stuck at 25m tonnes for the last eight years, with little variation every year — turning Pakistan into a net importer over the last four years.
Similarly, cotton production is actually receding, leaving the industry largely dependent on imports as other crops hog its area and economic sheen. Since policy planning and direction are missing, Pakistan is importing both at great foreign exchange pain.
These seven decades also present two more phenomenal failures: mechanisation and research. Since independence, mechanisation meant tractorisation and some harvesting and thrashing units. The tractor industry, which was the harbinger of the farm mechanisation process, has hogged all subsidies and other benefits for itself, leaving others out and ignoring the fact that the tractor does not perform at its optimum utility when running on its wheels alone — it needs implements alongside to hit optimum utility and most of them are simply not there.
Soil generally needs three kinds of inputs — primary (soil preparation), secondary (agronomic practices) and tertiary (harvesting). All of them need a complete range of implements which are missing in Pakistan’s scheme of things. Successive governments have announced subsidies on tractors and ignored the rest and compromised farm mechanisation in the process.
Research has also been a sore point in Pakistan’s context. It has spent far less than 1pc of agriculture GDP on research, against 6-7pc by others like India. This only increased dependence on imported seeds, which defied local ecological realities and soon lost utility. Climate change has added urgency to research requirements and makes this investment absolutely necessary.

6,A lamentable tale of neglect,There is hope for the future if reforms are carried out with continuity and rigorous planning.,"


 
As the nation celebrates 75 years of independence, Pakistani people and businesses continue to strive for freedom from want/fear/nepotism and liberty to compete, to choose, to access economic opportunities, to trade and to a fair deal.
Looking back may not necessarily be a pleasant exercise for informed Pakistanis especially when neighbouring China overcame bigger challenges to reach where it is today over the same period and many others did relatively far better. Sadly, the demands of the current ongoing crises have also been draining and did little to lift spirits this year.
Movers and shakers approached for their input, however, put up a brave face expressing hope. They suggested reforms, continuity, inclusivity and rigorous planning. They argue that with some tweaking in the system, Pakistan has the potential to make up for the lost time and take a leap into the future, provided the nation collectively decides to focus on the future and its demands.

Some leading executives insisted that it’s lame to wait to stumble into success. No one does. To arrive at the future, Pakistan needs to get objective, ditch fiction and invest in planning based on facts, dump the parasitic culture, stick to transparency, leverage technology, and promote and reward hard work. This in their opinion is the only path that could free people from want and let the country earn trust and respect in the comity of nations.

Looking back is an unpleasant exercise but there is hope for the future if reforms are carried out with continuity and rigorous planning

Syed Salim Reza, a former governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, blamed uncompetitive industry, which flourishes in protection, for the slow growth. He believes the neglect of agriculture has led to progressively greater reliance on imports which is a sad commentary on the quality of government planning and development initiatives. He lamented the capture of investable funds by land and property at the cost of productive capacity growth.
“The hope for the future is in the galvanisation of agriculture capacity, working with China to help intermediate goods production, deepening of industrial capacity, and all the different ways in which IT interventions are adding to internal distribution efficiency and exports,” he said.
Some corporate heads hammered for a consensus of all stakeholders on the key issues to avoid moving in circles at the cost of the public and the business.
Muhammad Aurangzeb, Chairman of the Pakistan Business Council shared his mind: “There is no dearth of policy prescriptions. We all very well know the “what” and “why” part of it. Need of the hour is for all major political parties and economic stakeholders to sit down together and agree on the “how” part of the economic agenda.
“If we are able to do this and then execute it over the next 25 years, there is every reason to believe that we can deliver sustainable and inclusive growth to become a $3 trillion economy (as World Bank report reckoned) by the time we get to be 100 years young in 2047 InshAllah”.
Most experts and businessmen concur that people deserved better. Currently, they felt the stakes are too high to be left to luck. Instead of blindly following narratives available in the market they made a case to see through the manufactured fog and urged people to raise their voices on critical issues to trigger a change in the right direction.
Moin Fudda, Chairman, Board of Directors, Central Depository Company, who sits on multiple other boards lamented the neglect of the natural resource base of the country and holds half-baked policies of nationalisation/privatisation and a weak capital market for the laggard rate of progress.
He was all for active public participation in the national debate on key issues: “Public needs to realise that they empower politicians and corporates. We can influence and question their decisions. We need to use logic over emotions and start questioning the leader we support.”
Some business leaders questioned the capacity of the leadership and blamed it partially for Pakistan’s underperformance. They believed Pakistan needs structural reforms based on long-term plans owned up by the public in all key social and economic sectors. They did not expect much from the current crop of leaders and pinned their hopes on youth.
Majyd Aziz, President, United Nations Global Compact Network Pakistan, was candid. “To expect policymakers to effectively cope with frequent crises is frankly a pie in the sky”.
He called to subdue the dominant archaic mindset through structured land reforms and digitalisation of all sectors and argued to promote local products, skills and processes to enhance exports and reduce dependence on imports. He said investors abhor ad hoc measures and frequent policy U-turns. This needs to stop. “The government policies should be inclusive as favours to special interests promote rent-seeking and corruption.”
He thought despite high talk on “demographic dividend” youth did not get the attention it deserved. “Today’s youth need to be cultured into the innovative digital environment that could bring about financial, social, and progressive change for them and for the nation”.

7,"Nascent recovery, what next?",The most worrying aspect continues to be the prevailing political uncertainty that has the potential to unravel economic health...,"


 
The initial signs of economic recovery have started to pour in, setting aside the volatile market conditions triggered by speculations and manipulations coupled with political turmoil. At least the economic data for July is not only encouraging but the fiscal year’s takeoff on a positive note could not have been more opportune for Finance Minister Miftah Ismail facing internal party politics and external pressures amid record-breaking inflation.
The nascent recuperation is expected to be bolstered by an economic bailout by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) when its executive board meets on August 29 to clear the way for the disbursement of $1.2 billion the following two days at a critical juncture when foreign exchange reserves are no more than 5 weeks of import cover.
The steadfast commitment to the implementation of most of the inflationary IMF conditions at the cost of the party’s political capital has helped overcome massive economic and fiscal risks. More than a 40 per cent drop in the import bill in July contributed by the lower oil import bill, belated central bank’s action against market manipulators, confirmation of bilateral funding and resultant clarity on the revival of the IMF lifeline has set in motion a much-needed appreciation of currency — almost 10pc in the first fortnight of the current month — and return of activity in the stock market.
The ease in import ban by the government and reduction in cash margin requirements for imports would give confidence to the market as exports and remittances have started to take care of imports. It has to be kept in mind that targeting import control also had early signs of significant export contraction of more than 20pc in July. Hopefully, it would not be a repeat of the previous PML-N government when exports declined instead of going up with long-term ramifications.

The most worrying aspect continues to be the prevailing political uncertainty that has the potential to unravel economic health that is just coming out of the intensive care unit

At the same time, two major questionable decisions — reversing yet again the taxation on the trader community and doling out scarce public money to top bureaucrats as special allowances — also stand out as a profligate fiscal policy. The fiscal gap, thus emerging from such moves, would have to be filled through a mini-budget within two months of the fiscal year.
But this sends an unfortunate message to the larger public that while the majority of the middle class had been crushed under record-breaking inflation, particularly through higher electricity, petroleum, taxes and gas rates, those with the right connections in the political parties could get away with whatever they like out of the public purse. By all standards, an irresponsible fiscal approach in challenging times.
The sustainability of these signs of improvement is not very certain and will remain subject to a couple of variables. The international prices of major commodities (like oil, fertiliser, wheat and edible oil) appear to be heading towards Pakistan’s advantage but remain significantly unpredictable for example oil prices are moving both ways almost daily. Key forecasts about the global economy are on the downside, which can reduce oil prices and cut Pakistan’s oil import bill, but exports can not remain unaffected by the global recession. How the pendulum moves at least on these two fronts remains to be seen.
More importantly, the lower import bill will have a proportionate impact on Pakistan’s revenue collection as well. The revenue collection in July has seen about 10pc growth against a budgetary target of about 23pc committed to with the IMF under the budget 2022-23 and is thus a key pointer of what may lie ahead unless more ‘mini budgets’ follow over the coming months, starting with one within the current month.
The public has already paid a heavy price for perhaps the country’s toughest fiscal and monetary adjustments and which will have no let up in the near term. Mr Ismail honestly concedes that he has not been able to focus on the two foremost priorities of any finance minister — reducing inflation and increasing economic growth — because of his preoccupation with firefighting to avoid sovereign default. But this should change now and he should revert to his primary responsibility of bringing ease in the lives of the people, particularly the middle class, in the form of lower energy costs and inflationary impacts.
Unfortunately, the energy sector remains the big elephant in the room and there are fewer indications of lowering electricity and gas rates in the near future amid an adverse combination of high technical losses and low recoveries — the two factors are estimated to cost almost Rs700bn this year in the power sector alone — and capacity payments worth Rs1.4 trillion during the year.
With annual inflation at almost 14pc and June and July inflation at above 21pc and 24pc respectively, a good sign is that the central bank has ruled out any further increase in the existing 15pc policy rate, at least in the near future, as the yield on government papers hovers around 17pc. This is apparently for the fact that the recent inflation spike had been a lag impact of administered prices that had been kept artificially lower by the previous government in its sunset days.
In such an environment, the most worrying aspect continues to be the prevailing political uncertainty that has the potential to unravel economic health which is just getting out of the intensive care unit. The multilaterals and international community including the ‘friends’ have sounded in so many words that this may be the last chance for all of Pakistan’s stakeholders to put the house in order. They are fatigued by repeated bailouts and so is the country’s own middle class repeatedly funding the extravagance of the rich, irresponsibility of the key players of the state and increasing cross-subsidisation to the poor.

With all its posturing, waving of the green flag, shouts of ‘Pakistan Zindabad’, it cannot fudge the historic numbers that blatantly tell the story of economic and political turmoil that led to neither growth nor human development. Without an excuse for its inept management, Pakistan lags behind India and Bangladesh in most indicators.
Rupee’s journey



 
After independence, remnants of Pakistan’s colonial heritage lingered for the rupee that remained linked to the pound sterling till September 1971, according to the State Bank. Given the bungee dive that the rupee has taken of late, a time when the PKR remained constant for years seems like the golden period. It wasn’t.
In 1949, the Bank of England devalued the pound sterling relative to the rupee, leading India to follow suit. By keeping the exchange rate constant, Pakistan’s exports were expensive relative to its competitors in its main market at the time of independence: India. An archived New York Times article of August 1, 1955, states that the Pakistan Government reduced the value of the rupee by one-third in a day, bringing it down to the same rate as India in hopes of boosting exports. An effort that was too little too late.



 
Pakistan maintained a fixed exchange rate till 1982, converting to a managed floating system that remained in place till the International Monetary Fund put its foot down in 2018. Previously, Pakistan used to keep the dollar artificially stable by selling its reserves, hardly feasible during current times when the country floated perilously close to a default.
Averaged out, the Pakistani rupee has steadily weakened since it came into existence with the recent appreciation being an anomaly following weeks of speculation that artificially pushed up the value of the dollar.
Inflation



 
“In our time, we got a few anna for pocket money,” muse old grandparents while tch tching at prices. Though this is a refrain multiple generations have heard growing up, the prevailing over 20pc inflation rate will put the elderly horror of current prices to shame. Further adjustments are expected as electricity rates continue to march up, though the real inflation is hardly reflected in the ‘official’ rate quoted by World Bank data that was used to make the graph.
India and Bangladesh are no strangers to volatility of inflation rates though both countries have fared better than Pakistan in recent years. The recent 50pc hike in fuel prices in Bangladesh to trim its subsidy burden will further aggravate its 7.5pc inflation rate. At 95 to a dollar, Bangladesh’s taka is more than twice as strong as Pakistan’s rupee but the global crisis created by the Russia-Ukraine war has pushed it to approach the IMF for a bailout as well.



 
While the Indian rupee has received a drubbing as well, it is nowhere close to running to the IMF for a bailout. At around INR 80 for $1, its depreciation has been roughly 7pc in 2022 with the slight expectation that the worst is over. For both regional countries, a stronger local currency has helped hedge against inflation compared to Pakistan’s rupee’s free fall.
GDP growth rate



 
Pakistan’s story of GDP growth rate has always been of boom-and-bust cycles that have gotten steadily shorter. The economy overheats as soon as growth rates perk up, leading the government to reign it in and enter a ‘stabilisation’ phase while knocking at IMF’s door with the proverbial dollar bowl.
India and Bangladesh have not escaped the volatility that makes their GDP growth rate graph look like a death-defying roller coaster ride. Despite that, India’s GDP growth averaged 4.4pc during the 1970s and 1980s, accelerating to 5.5pc during the 1990s-early 2000s, and further to 7.1pc in the decade before the pandemic, according to a World Bank blog. Its progress has been broadly diversified, accelerating the fastest in services, followed by industry but less so in agriculture.



 
“Much of Bangladesh’s growth is owed to its exports which zoomed from zero in 1971 to $35.8bn in 2018 (Pakistan’s is $24.8bn). Bangladesh produces no cotton but, to the chagrin of Pakistan’s pampered textile industry, it has eaten savagely into its market share,” explains Mr Pervez Hoodbhoy in an article.
Population growth rate



 
“My husband refuses to use birth control measures,” laments Saima, a maid and mother of six children, not all of whom she has given birth to. “He already has four sons, one from me and three from his previous wife, yet he wants more while refusing to provide for any of them,” she laments. Her tale is similar to many others that belong to the lowest income classes and are solidly driving population growth in Pakistan. Without measures, the population may double in the next 33 years.
In the last six decades, India’s population has more than tripled. Despite bringing its population growth rate down, it gains about a million inhabitants a month and is on course to surpass China as the world’s most populous country by next year.



 
In contrast, Bangladesh has been more successful in bringing down its population rate. From government efforts to convince ulema to educate the masses to higher literacy rates for females, a combination of factors has led the country that was once part of Pakistan to bring down its fertility rate from 6.1 in 1980 to 2.3 in 2010.
GDP per capita



 
In 2021, before the rupee’s devaluation eroded what little strength the local currency had, India’s per capita income was over $1,000 more than Pakistan and Bangladesh’s was $740 more. Meaning: an average Indian or Bangladeshi was better off than a Pakistani.
At over $3tr, India is the sixth largest economy in the world with the second largest population. IMF’s projected real GDP growth rate for 2022 is 7.4pc. In the last fiscal year, it a record high of $418bn in exports.



 
Bangladesh’s exports were $52.08bn and its GDP last year was $416bn. It’s national income has multiplied 50 times, per capita income 25 times (higher than India’s and Pakistan’s), and food production four times, according to an article by Ishrat Hussain. To put their progress in perspective, Pakistan’s per capita income in 1990 was twice as much as Bangladesh’s but has fallen today to only seven-tenth, he says.
At a GDP of $346bn in 2021 and annual exports of $31bn, Pakistan’s numbers pale in comparison, explaining why an average Pakistani is worst off.
FDI inflows as a % of GDP



 
After an all-time high in 2007 at 3.67pc, Pakistan’s FDI as a percentage of GDP has drooped down. In 2007 and 2008, Pakistan attracted reasonable inflows of $5.6bn and 5.4bn respectively but the momentum could not be sustained owing to militant violence, global financial meltdown, political upheaval, and usual inconsistent economic policies, lack of rule of law and so on.
With over 44m cases and half a million deaths, India suffered a lot more than Pakistan during the pandemic. Despite that India continued to attract foreign direct investment at record levels while Covid-19 wreaked havoc in the country, amounting to $81bn in 2021-21, 10pc higher than the previous year.
The historical impetus of foreign cash has allowed India to improve its infrastructure and increased productivity and employment. It has led Pakistan’s neighbour to acquire sophisticated technology and mobilise foreign exchange reserves that can be used to stabilise its exchange rate.
Despite steady economic growth in the country over the past decade, foreign direct investment has been comparatively low in Bangladesh compared to India and Pakistan. At around 1pc, it is one of the lowest rates in Asia.
In absolute terms though, Bangladesh has fared better. The FDI stock in Pakistan fell from $41.9bn to $35.6bn in five years to 2020. Bangladesh on the other hand built its stocks from $14.5bn to $19.6bn and India from $318.3bn to $480.3bn in the same period.



 
According to the IMF, an increase of a dollar in capital inflows is associated with an increase in domestic investment of about 50 cents. As in the case of India during the peak pandemic period, FDI has also proved to be resilient during financial crises.
Another instance is the East Asian countries where investment was remarkably stable during the global financial crises of 1997-98. The resilience of FDI during financial crises was also evident during the Mexican crisis of 1994-95 and the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s.
Given its importance, is Pakistan an attractive destination for foreign investment in the region? To put it bluntly, the answer is, no, according to the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics. The reason why is simple: Pakistan has had volatile and episodic growth since the 1950s with low rates of local investment, lags in innovation and low productivity.
The policymakers need to make strong efforts to come out of this vicious circle of low investment, low innovation and low productivity which is hardly possible when each government spends its tenure firefighting to keep the economy afloat while battling it out for the throne of power.
Military spending as a % of GDP



 
Defence is one indicator where Pakistan outshines both countries. With perpetual enmity against one neighbour, suffering from persistent low-key (and frequently high-key) terrorism from another neighbour, and various insurgencies within the country, the military chunk of the budget is 17.5pc. So for every Rs6 spent by the government, more than Rs1 is spent on the armed forces.



 
Though Pakistan spends a higher proportion of its income on defence, it is dwarfed by India whose military expenditure is $70.6bn compared to Pakistan’s $10.3bn. With fewer hassles on its border, Bangladesh’s expenditure is $4.4bn.
