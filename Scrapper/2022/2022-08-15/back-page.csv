JERUSALEM: Israeli police Sunday arrested a suspect in a pre-dawn shooting spree targeting a bus just outside Jerusalem’s Old City that wounded eight people, including a pregnant woman and several US citizens.
“The terrorist is in our hands,” police spokesman Kan Eli Levy told Israeli public radio hours after the bloody attack not far from the Western Wall, the holiest prayer site for Jews.
Several American citizens were among the wounded, said the US embassy, which declared that “we are shocked and saddened by the terrorist attack” but gave no further details on the victims, citing privacy concerns.
In the  renewed wave of violence that ended last Sunday after Egypt negotiated a truce, at least 49 Pale­stinians, including a num­ber of children, were killed.
‘Lone assailant’
Following an hours-long manhunt, police said a suspect had turned himself in. They also published a picture of the handgun he had allegedly used.
Prime Minister Yair Lapid told his cabinet meeting that “this is a lone assailant, a resident of the city with a criminal record”. He had earlier warned in a statement that “all those who seek us harm should know that they will pay a price for any harm to our civilians.”
‘Terror attack’
The gunman started spraying bullets at the public bus and people on the street in the attack at the Tomb of David bus stop near the Old City’s Zion Gate, recounted bus driver Daniel Kanievsky.
“I was coming from the Western Wall. The bus was full of passengers,” he told reporters in front of his bullet-riddled vehicle.
“I stopped at the station of the Tomb of David. At this mo­m­ent, the shooting star­ted. I saw two people outside falling, two inside were ble­eding. Everybody panicked.”
Israel’s emergency medical services, the Magen David Adom (MDA), called the incident a “terror attack in the Old City”.
“We were on the scene very quickly,” its medics said in a statement.
“On Ma’ale Hashalom Street we saw a passenger bus ... in the middle of the road. Bystanders called us to treat two males around 30 years old who were on the bus with gunshot wounds.” MDA spokesperson Zaki Heller initially said six men and one woman were wou­nded, with all seven “fully conscious”, before police raised the wounded toll to eight.
One of the wounded was a pregnant woman, whose baby was delivered by Caesarean section after the attack, a spokesman at Jerusalem’s Shaarei Tsedek Hospital told AFP.
The Palestinian militant group, Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, hailed a “heroic operation” without claiming responsibility for the attack. “Our people will continue to resist and fight the occupier by all means,” it said in a statement.Since March, 19 people — mostly Israeli civilians inside Israel — have been killed in attacks. Three Israeli Arab attackers were also killed.
In the aftermath of those attacks, Israeli security forces stepped up raids in the occupied West Bank. More than 50 Palestinians have been killed, including fighters and civilians, in operations and incidents in the West Bank since then.

1,Fire in Cairo’s Coptic church leaves 41 dead,"Fourteen others injured in the blaze, blamed on an electrical fault...","

CAIRO: More than 40 people were killed when a fire ripped through a Coptic Christian church in a working-class district of Greater Cairo during mass on Sunday, state and religious officials said.
The blaze, blamed on an electrical fault, hit the Abu Sifin church in densely populated Imbaba west of the Nile river, part of Giza governorate.
Witnesses described panicked scenes as people rushed into the multi-storey house of worship to rescue those trapped but were soon overwhelmed by the heat and deadly smoke.
“Everyone was carrying kids out of the building,” said Ahmed Reda Baioumy, who lives next to the church. “But the fire was getting bigger and you could only go in once or you would asphyxiate.” 
The Egyptian Coptic Church and the health ministry reported 41 dead and 14 injured in the blaze before emergency services said they had brought the blaze under control.

Fourteen others injured in the blaze, blamed on an electrical fault

President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi declared on his Facebook page in the morning: “I have mobilised all state services to ensure that all measures are taken.” He later said he had “presented his condolences by phone” to Pope Tawadros II, who has been the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church since 2012.
The Giza governor ordered “urgent aid of 50,000 pounds (around $2,600) for the families of the deceased and 10,000 pounds for the injured”.
The grand imam of Al-Azhar, Egypt’s foremost Muslim institution, expressed his condolences for “the tragic accident” and affirmed “the readiness of Al-Azhar hospitals to receive the injured”.
Power surge 
The interior ministry said “forensic evidence revealed that the blaze broke out in an air-conditioning unit on the second floor of the church building” which also houses social services.
Father Farid Fahmy, of another nearby church in Imbaba, told AFP the fire was caused by a short circuit.
“The power was out and they were using a generator,” he said. “When the power came back, it caused an overload.” Accidental fires are not uncommon in the sprawling megalopolis of Cairo, where millions live in informal settlements.
Baioumy, the neighbour, told AFP that fire-fighters were hampered by the fact the church is located “on a very narrow street” where buildings stand barely a few metres apart and fire engines can barely manoeuvre.
Egypt, with its often dilapidated and poorly maintained infrastructure, has suffered several deadly fires in recent years.
In March 2021, at least 20 people died in a blaze in a textile factory in an eastern suburb of Cairo.
In 2020, two hospital fires claimed the lives of 14 Covid-19 patients.
Last Monday a church caught fire in the eastern Cairo district of Heliopolis, though no deaths or injuries were reported.
Religious minority 
Copts are the largest Christian community in the Middle East, making up at least 10 million of Egypt’s 103 million people.
The minority has suffered attacks and complained of discrimination in the majority Muslim north African country, the Arab world’s most populous.
Copts have been targeted in deadly attacks by militants, particularly after Sisi overthrew former president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, with churches, schools and homes burnt down.
Members of the minority also complain they have been left out of key state positions and they have deplored restrictive legislation for the construction and renovation of churches compared to that of mosques.

2,Iraq’s judiciary dismisses Moqtada Sadr’s demand to dissolve parliament,Sadr has urged the judiciary to dissolve parliament by the end of this week to pave the way for new legislative elections.,"BAGHDAD: Iraq’s judiciary said on Sun­day it lacks the authority to dissolve parliament as demanded by Moqtada Sadr, who is engaged in an escalating standoff with political rivals.
Followers of Sadr, in defiance of his rival and pro-Iran Coordination Framework, have been staging a sit-in protest at Iraq’s parliament.
In the latest twist to the political turmoil, the firebrand cleric has urged the judiciary to dissolve parliament by the end of this week to pave the way for new legislative elections.
But the judiciary replied that “the Supr­eme Judicial Council has no jurisdiction to dissolve parliament”, citing “the principle of a separation of powers”.
Under the constitution, parliament can only be dissolved by an absolute majority vote in the house, following a request by one-third of deputies or by the prime minister with the approval of the president.
Nearly 10 months on from the last elections, Iraq still has no government, new prime minister or new president, due to repeated squabbles between factions over forming a coalition government. In the latest turmoil to strike the oil-rich but war-scarred nation, Sadr has called for “early democratic elections after a dissolution of parliament”.
The Supreme Council said it agreed with Sadr’s criticism of the system’s “failure to elect a president of the republic, a prime minister and the absence of a government formed within the constitutional timeframe”.
“This is an unacceptable situation that must be remedied,” it said.
The Coordination Framework opponents of Sadr launched their own Baghdad sit-in on Friday, nearly two weeks after his supporters stormed parliament and began an open-en­d­ed protest, first inside, then outside the legislature. The opposing encampments are the latest turn in a standoff which has so far remained peaceful. 
On Twitter, a close associate of Sadr, Saleh Mohamed al-Iraqi, said it was time to show “which of the two sides has the most support” among the Iraqi people.
He called on Sadr’s supporters across the country to rally in Baghdad for a “million-man demonstration”, without giving a date.
Sadr’s camp launched the sit-in after the Co­­­o­r­dination Framework nominated a candidate they saw as unacceptable for prime minister.

3,US seeks robust long-term ties with Pakistan,"Secretary Blinken, UK prime minister among several world leaders who express good wishes on Independence Day.","WASHINGTON: As greetings on the completion of 75 years of independence poured in from different parts of the world, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in his message on the occasion on Sunday emphasised the need for Pakistan and United States to rebuild their robust relationship for the next 75 years and beyond.
The top US diplomat said that in addition to 75 years of independence, this year also marks 75 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations.
Also, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the occasion tweeted, “A very happy 75th  Independence Day to the people of Pakistan. In 75 years our people have  forged close ties, with 1.6 million people of Pakistani heritage calling  the UK home. I look forward to seeing our relationship strengthen yet  further in the years ahead!”

 





 
“On the 75th Independence Day of  Pakistan, we celebrate our two nations’ strong ties and cooperation at  every front, and extend our warmest congratulations and wishes for  progress, peace and prosperity to the people and government of the  Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” said UAE Minister of Finance and Deputy  Ruler of Dubai Maktoum bin Mohammed Al Maktoum.

Recently, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Masood Khan was invited to the White House to mark the 75th year of diplomatic relations between the two nations, where he conveyed Pakistan’s desire to continue a strong relationship with the US.
“As we commemorate the 75th anniversary of our diplomatic relations, let us resolve to renew and strengthen our partnership for the next 75 years and beyond,” said Secretary Blinken. His message, however, went beyond the traditional greetings and noted that the two nations have enjoyed robust cooperation in many sectors.
While highlighting various aspects of this cooperation, Secretary Blinken said tens of thousands of Pakistani exchange students come to the US and the country has committed to provide 77 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to Pakistan during the pandemic.
Secretary Blinken pointed out that the United States continues to be Pakistan’s largest export destination and said that he was confident this relationship will continue to grow.
The message comes at a time when two nations have resumed efforts to rebuild the relationship that once brought them together as close strategic, military, and economic partners.
The US was now helping Pakistan negotiate the loan programme with the International Monetary Fund and was also expected to make similar arrangements with other bilateral donors.

The two allies, whose differences started with disagreements on Afghanistan, now also seem eager to cooperate on these contentious issues.
Even former prime minister Imran Khan, who has accused the United States of backing efforts to topple his government, has hired a public relations firm to improve his relations with Washington.
At a flag-hoisting ceremony at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, Ambassador Khan noted that in the past seven decades, the US and Pakistan have achieved a lot and the two countries commit themselves to working together for peace, security and stability.
“Most importantly, we will strengthen our people to people ties that will nurture our relations at all levels. Long Live Pakistan-US friendship,” he added.
At the United Nations, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative Munir Akram reminded the international community of their pledge to help the people of Kashmir attain their fundamental rights usurped by India.
In a message shared with the member states of the United Nations, Ambassador Akram said: “As we celebrate our independence, we stand firmly with our Kashmiri brothers and sisters in their struggle for right to self-determination and freedom.”
He pledged to “continue to raise Kashmir’s call for liberation at the United Nations and in all forums.”
Noting that Pakistan was a young but resilient nation, Ambassador Akram assured the international community that Pakistan will also overcome the challenges it was facing now.
“Our entire history is a history of resilience. We are a strong nation. We are an influential and important country on the world stage,” he said.
“Today, we face great challenges but God Willing, we will overcome these challenges also.”

4,US lawmakers land in Taiwan on heels of Pelosi’s visit,"11 Chinese military aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defence zone on Sunday, says Taiwan's defence ministry.","TAIPEI: A delegation of US lawmakers arrived in Taiwan on Sunday for a two-day trip during which they will meet President Tsai Ing-wen, the second high-level group to visit Taiwan while there are military tensions between the self-ruled island and China.
Beijing, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has conducted military drills around the island to express its anger over US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei in early August.
The de facto US embassy in Taipei said the delegation is being led by Senator Ed Markey, who is being accompanied by four House lawmakers on what it described as part of a larger visit to the Indo-Pacific region.
Taiwan’s presidential office said the group would meet Tsai on Monday morning.

11 Chinese military aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defence zone

“Especially at a time when China is raising tensions in the Taiwan Strait and the region with military exercises, Markey leading a delegation to visit Taiwan once again demonstrates the United States Congress’ firm support for Taiwan,” it said in a statement.
Markey chairs the Senate Foreign Rela­tions East Asia, Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Subcommittee. The co-leaders of the visit are Representative John Garamendi of the congressional Nuclear Weapons and Arms Control Working Group and Representative Don Beyer, a spokesperson for Markey said.
Markey’s office said the lawmakers 
“will reaffirm the United States’ support for Taiwan as guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, US-China Joint Comm­uniques, and Six Assurances, and will encourage stability and peace across the Taiwan Strait”. 
The group will meet “elected leaders and members of the private sector to discuss shared interests including reducing tensions in the Taiwan Strait and expanding economic cooperation, including investments in semiconductors”, Markey’s office said.
Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry published pictures of four of the group being met at Taipei’s downtown Songshan airport having arrived on a US air force transport jet, while Markey arrived at the Taoyuan international airport.
“The delegation will meet with senior Taiwan leaders to discuss US-Taiwan relations, regional security, trade and investment, global supply chains, climate change, and other significant issues of mutual interest,” the de facto US embassy said.
While China’s drills around Taiwan have abated, it is still carrying out military activities.
Eleven Chinese military aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait’s median line or entered Taiwan’s air defence zone on Sunday, Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said. Thirteen planes crossed the strait on Saturday, the ministry said.

5,Aramco unveils record profits as oil prices soar amid Ukraine war,90pc year-on-year jump in net income as oil giant clocks its second straight quarterly record of $48.4bn.,"

ARAMCO CEO Amin H. Nasser

 
RIYADH: Oil giant Saudi Aramco on Sunday unveiled record profits of $48.4 billion in the second quarter of 2022, after Russia’s war in Ukraine and a post-pandemic surge in demand sent crude prices soaring.
Net income leapt 90 per cent year-on-year for the world’s biggest oil producer, which clocked its second straight quarterly record after announcing $39.5bn for first quarter. Aramco’s massive second quarter windfall was the biggest quarterly adjusted profit of any listed company worldwide, according to Bloomberg.
The state-owned Saudi firm heads a list of oil majors raking in eye-watering sums after ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, TotalEnergies and Eni also revealed multi-bn-dollar profits in the second quarter.
“While global market volatility and economic uncertainty remain, events during the first half of this year support our view that ongoing investment in our industry is essential,” said Aramco president and CEO Amin H. Nasser. “In fact, we expect oil demand to continue to grow for the rest of the decade,” he added.

90pc year-on-year jump in net income

Net income rose 22.7pc from the first quarter in “strong market conditions”, Aramco said. Half-year profits were $87.9bn, up from $47.2bn for the same period of 2021. Aramco will pay an $18.8bn dividend in Q3, the same as it paid in the second quarter.
It “continues to work on increasing crude oil maximum sustainable capacity from 12 million barrels per day to 13 million (a day) by 2027”, its earnings announcement said.
The quarterly profits, the highest since Aramco’s record-breaking IPO in 2019, beat a company-compiled analyst forecast of $46.2bn. Aramco shares closed down 0.9pc at 40.5 riyals ($10.8) on the Saudi stock exchange. They are up 25pc this year.
‘Crown jewel’ 
Aramco floated 1.7pc of its shares on the Saudi bourse in December 2019, generating $29.4bn in the world’s biggest initial public offering.
The “crown jewel” and leading source of income for the conservative kingdom temporarily supplanted Apple as the world’s most valuable company in March. It now lies second in the list with a market valuation of $2.4 trillion.
Saudi Arabia has sought to open up and diversify its oil-reliant economy, especially since Mohammed bin Salman’s appointment as crown prince and de facto ruler in 2017.
Despite raising production, Aramco has pledged to reach “operational net zero (carbon) emissions” by 2050. Carbon pollution is tallied in the country that uses the fuel, not where it is produced.
Saudi GDP jumped nearly 12pc in Q2 on the back of high oil prices, the government announced last month. Abu Dhabi-based energy expert Ibrahim Elghitany said the oil bonanza was a “golden opportunity” for the country.
“Saudi Arabia has recently achieved financial surpluses that it did not achieve during the last decade, which helps to provide financing for its development projects,” Elghitany told AFP.
Nasser said Aramco recovered quickly from a series of attacks from Yemen on its facilities earlier this year, including a dramatic strike in Jeddah that sent smoke billowing during a Formula One practice session in March. “We were able to restore our production in all these facilities immediately. In a few weeks, all facilities were working and producing at full capacity,” he told a media conference call.
Oil prices have dropped by $30 per barrel from a peak in June due to growing supplies, but remain close to $100.
The OPEC group of oil-producing countries has been gradually raising production, despite pressure from Western leaders including US President Joe Biden, who visited Saudi Arabia last month, to pump more.
Biden’s trip was seen as a climb-down after he previously promised to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” over the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Turkey in 2018.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also visited Saudi Arabia since the Russian invasion in February.
High oil prices are contributing to the inflationary pain suffered by consumers worldwide. In June, Biden grumbled that Exxon “made more money than God this year”, advocating higher taxes on oil companies.
