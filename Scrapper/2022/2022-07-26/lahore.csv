1,Lawyers oppose JCP meet during court holidays,See discrimination in elevation of judges; Hamid Khan says ignoring Justice Minallah an injustice,"LAHORE: Former president of Supreme Court Bar Association Hamid Khan and other leaders of lawyers’ professional group on Monday strongly opposed the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) move to ignore seniority policy in elevating judges to the apex court.
Speaking at a press conference, Khan regretted that chief justices of the high courts were being ignored by the JCP and the Supreme Court was being filled with junior judges on personal preferences.
He pointed out that ignoring Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah for the elevation was an injustice not only with the judge but Islamabad as well. He said elevation of judges against the policy of seniority would weaken the institution of judiciary.
He said the JCP also subjected the chief justice and senior judges of the Sindh High Court to discrimination in the elevation to the SC.

See discrimination in elevation of judges; Hamid Khan says ignoring Justice Minallah an injustice 

Khan said the country was facing a political turmoil and there were summer vacations in the SC and three high courts. He recommended the JCP to defer the elevation of the judges till the end of summer vacations and return of senior puisne judge Justice Qazi Faez Isa from ex Pakistan leave.  
Attorney General Ashtar Ausaf, another member of the JCP, is also abroad.  
Commenting on a demand of PDM parties to form a full court to hear a case about the election of chief minister of Punjab, the senior lawyer said it was a prerogative of the chief justice whether to constitute a full court or not.
However, he said, the political parties should not pressurize the judiciary. He further said that the bodies of lawyers should not become a mouthpiece of any political party.
Other leaders of the professional group included Mian Abdul Qaddus, Rana Zia Abdul Rehman, Rabboya Bajwa, Asad Manzoor Butt and Shamimur Rehman Malik
The JCP is set to meet on July 28 to consider elevation of judges from different high courts.
Last time, the JCP met on June 28, a day after Justice Isa’s three-page letter in which the senior puisine judge had taken exception to the calling of the meeting with a suggestion that it should be postponed until the scheduled vacations of the court were over.

5,PML-N's Saad Rafique spells out ‘objectives of project Imran’,Alleges ‘facilitators’ of ousted premier in institutions still hatching conspiracies.,"LAHORE: Federal Minister for Railways and Aviation Khwaja Saad Rafique said on Monday the coalition parties ousted former prime minister Imran Khan through means available in the Constitution to foil a “conspiracy” aimed at bringing him back in power with a two-thirds majority by fudging results through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), making appointments in the armed forces beyond merit and defacing the 1973 Constitution.
Talking to journalists outside an accountability court here, he alleged the facilitators of ‘project Imran’ wanted to introduce presidential form of government, wiping out political leadership in the country.
However, he said economic meltdown was the main reason to oust the Imran Khan government and it was done without any support from the establishment.
Saad said the political parties in the coalition had no idea that their government would have to face “conspiracies by the facilitators of project Imran sitting in the institutions”.

Alleges ‘facilitators’ of ousted premier in institutions still hatching conspiracies 

He alleged a huge investment had been made in the “project” of launching Imran Khan and that the PML-N’s mandate was snatched in the 2018 general elections. He said his party accepted the results of “rigged” elections only to protect the country from destabilisation.
He asked the “facilitators” of Imran Khan to stay clam as their project had failed.
The minister said the minds of the younger generation had been polluted against political leadership of the country by design through false propaganda since 2011. He said efforts had been made to project the former prime minister as an angel.
He said the PTI government made shameless agreements with the IMF and destroyed the economy of the country.
About the Supreme Court’s proceedings in the case pertaining to the election of Punjab chief minister, Mr Saad said the courts could only interpret the Constitution and that too only in accordance with the supreme law.
Earlier, Saad and his brother Khwaja Salman Rafiq appeared before the court in the hearing of Paragon reference against them.
The court adjourned the hearing till Aug 5 due to a strike of lawyers against the murder of the Punjab Bar Council’s secretary Ashraf Rahi.
The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) reference accuses the Khwaja brothers of wrongfully receiving around Rs18.2 million from M/s Paragon City (pvt) Limited in their bank accounts. It says the brothers, through their “benamidars” and with the abetment of Qaiser Amin Butt, a former MPA, and a private person, Nadeem Zia, established a housing scheme -- Air Avenue -- and later changed its name to avoid legal actions.
It say the suspects, along with their accomplices, cheated the public at large and obtained illegal financial benefits from the funds of the illegal society.

According to the FIR, Abdul Majeed, of Mauza Choghatta Araian, was riding a motorcycle when Shoaib and Waheed, of Bahawalnagar, and Shan Ali, of Sahiwal, intercepted him near Pak Rice Factory at about 9pm. The trio looted cash, documents and a mobile phone from him and fled when Rizwan and Khawar arrived at the scene.  
The FIR said the men confessed to their crime and promised to return the booty when the victim along with eyewitnesses met them soon after the incident. Later, the trio refused to return the valuables, it added.
Police sources told Dawn that the duo were overpowered, thrashed and abused by a mob when they were looting people near Pak Rice Factory. B-Division officials deliberately concealed their arrest because they were hardened criminals and the officials wanted to get the credit for their arrest.
They said it was the second such incident in the district within a week in which the people handed over dacoits to the police after severely thrashing them. However, the police avoided taking any action against the mob in both cases.
DPO’s spokesperson Shehzad Ishfaq said he did not know why the B-Division police showed the gunmen as absconders in the FIR. 
He said as soon as he got information about the matter from the B-Division SHO, he would inform this scribe. However, later when contacted, the spokesperson’s number was switched off.

Though there has been no shortage of the fertiliser currently in the district, a formal request is made to the provincial government to fix the required quota of urea bags in the next month by keeping in view the increase in the cultivation of paddy crop, said Afzal Hayat Tarrar, Gujrat additional deputy commissioner general (ADCG), here on Monday. 
He said the provision of fertiliser that was imported by the government, could keep the rates of it controlled in the market. He said the laser land leveler would also be provided to the farmers having less than 12 acres land on subsidised rates in Gujrat as per the government policy for which applications had already been invited by the agriculture department.
Such applications could be submitted until Aug 10 by those who fulfil the prerequisites for the issuance of agricultural implements as the provincial government would give a subsidy of Rs200,000 for the provision of laser land leveler, Mr Tarrar said and added that a meeting of agricultural advisory committee of the district had also been held to review the situation in this regard. 
It is learnt that the local agriculture department authorities have set a target of installation of drip as well as sprinkler system for the irrigation purposes at every 200 acres of the paddy crop in the district. 
An official of the agriculture department said at least 10 cases of sale of fake fertiliser to the farmers had been lodged against those involved in the illegal practice whereas a fine of Rs900,000 had also been imposed against such elements across the district.

21,Torrential rains damage cotton crop,MUZAFFARGARH: Recent heavy rains have damaged the cotton crop in Muzaffargarh and Layyah districts as the rainwater...,"MUZAFFARGARH: Recent heavy rains have damaged the cotton crop in Muzaffargarh and Layyah districts as the rainwater has been standing in the fields for the last three days.   
The intermittent rain lashed Muzaffargarh and other districts of south Punjab during the last three days, causing heavy losses to the cotton farmers. The Met Office has predicted more rain in the coming days.  
Cotton has been cultivated on more than 300,000 acres of land this year. There was a shortage of canal water as the only 1,000 to 1,200 cusec canal water was released for Muzaffargarh at the start of the season when cotton crop was sowed. 
The farmers had to use peter engines for irrigating the crops, spending huge amounts of money on fuel.   
The affected farmers demanded the government declare an emergency and announce a special relief package for them. They bemoaned that the cotton yield was excellent this season and its rate was also very attractive but the rain damaged it.  
Malik Khalid, a local farmer leader, says the rate of lint (Phutti) was more than Rs12,000 per maund and they were very happy but rain hit the crop and destroyed it. Due to the rainwater constantly standing in crops, the plants colour had changed to yellow, he added.  
On the other hand, the cotton research officials have asked the cotton farmers to remove water from the fields and spray the crops with pesticides.   
The Punjab Department of Agriculture has issued an advisory for the farmers to protect crops from the monsoon rains.  
A spokesman for the department said the crops of sugarcane, rice and fodder could tolerate excess water and excess rainwater from cotton and vegetable crops should be transferred to them, any empty field or a trench. 
He said the cotton crop was very sensitive to water and if rainwater remained standing in it for 48 hours, its plants would start dying.   
After the rain, growth regulators, if needed, could also be sprayed on the cotton plants with the advice of the staff of the agriculture department, the official says, advising the farmers to keep an eye on the weather forecast on radio and TV to plan their irrigation accordingly.
