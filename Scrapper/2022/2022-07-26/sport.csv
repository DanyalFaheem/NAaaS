The 3 to 2 shot chestnut put up an amazing display of speed in the home stretch to score a two length success on his seasonal debut for owner Najeeb Haider Bagri. He beat bay Silent Assassin who finished second with Salam-e-Dera third, another one-and-a-half lengths back.
The winning owner received the cup from Lahore Race Club (LRC) member Syed Pervez Hussain.
Dark brown favourite thoroughbred horse Drums of War was given a patient ride by jockey Tahir Abbas in winning the supporting feature event, the Naran Plate Class VII Division II and III run over 1,100 metres. His success gave trainer Rashid Latif a magnificent hat-trick of victories after he had sent out Jalpana Fire and Surkhab in the day’s third and fourth race, respectively.
Odds-on favourite colt Pride Of Performance took vengeance for his disqualification by the administrators on objection after winning the first race last Sunday as he scored a three lengths victory in the opener to give owner Ali Raza Zia a big consolation. Filly Umer Prince finished second.
Chestnut mare Golden Pound made amends for her defeat last Sunday by winning the day’s second race as she thwarted a challenge from bay Master Prince while Soldier Queen finished third.

1,"English leagues announce tougher sanctions on smoke bombs, invasions","Last season saw an increasing number of pitch invasions with fans celebrating titles, promotion or survival.","MANCHESTER: England’s Premier League and Football League have announced tough new sanctions for pitch invasions and the use of smoke bombs and pyrotechnics.
Last season saw an increasing number of pitch invasions at the end of the season with fans celebrating titles, promotion or survival.
Several altercations took place on the field, including one involving Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira, while Sheffield United’s Billy Sharp was attacked by a fan after a playoff defeat at Nottingham Forest.
Smoke bombs and pyrotechnics, which have long been used at games in continental Europe and elswhere in the world, used to be relatively rare in England but their use has become a more regular occurance.
The leagues and the Football Association said that from the start of the new season  “all identified offenders will be reported by clubs to the police and prosecution could result in a permanent criminal record, which may affect their employment and education, and could result in a prison sentence.”
“Furthermore, anyone who enters the pitch and those identified carrying or using pyrotechnics or smoke bombs will now receive an automatic club ban. These bans could also be extended to accompanying parents or guardians of children who take part in these activities,” the statement said.
The bodies said they were working with the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure prosecution  “will become the default response”.
The leagues are also seeking to censor publication of videos showing pitch invasions and smoke bombs by working with social media companies to remove footage quickly while asking government to reform regulations to restrict the supply of pyrotechnics and smoke bombs.
FA Chief Executive Mark Bullingham said:  “The rise in anti-social behaviour that we saw in stadiums at the end of last season was entirely unacceptable and put peoples safety at risk. Together, English football has introduced new measures and stronger sanctions, for the start of the coming season, to send out a clear message that we will not tolerate this type of illegal and dangerous behaviour.”  The move was backed by the Football Supporters Association (FSA).
“We are contacted by supporters on a fairly regular basis who have been caught jumping on the pitch, or with pyro in the stands, and without exception they regret doing it,” FSA head Kevin Miles said.
“Whether they had positive intentions or not is irrelevant in the eyes of the law — pyro and pitch incursions are illegal, you will be prosecuted and you will be banned by your club.”

2,"Messi, Neymar star as rampant PSG end Japan tour in style",OSAKA: Paris St-Germain’s new coach Christophe Galtier said his side conceded  “two goals too many” despite...,"OSAKA: Paris St-Germain’s new coach Christophe Galtier said his side conceded  “two goals too many” despite Lionel Messi and Neymar combining to deadly effect in a 6-2 thrashing of Gamba Osaka on Monday.
Neymar scored a brace and Messi bagged one in Osaka as a rampant PSG rounded off their pre-season trip to Japan with a third win in as many games.
The French champions will now head to Israel to play Nantes in the French Super Cup in Tel Aviv on July 31.
Galtier, taking charge of the full squad for the first time since joining PSG from Nice this summer, said playing J-League teams in the middle of their domestic season had  “forced us to raise our physical level”.
“We trained a lot, we played a lot with little recovery time,” he said, after PSG’s third game in the space of six days.
“But overall I’m satisfied both with this match and more generally with the three matches we’ve had here in Japan.” Star forwards Neymar and Messi both played the opening 70 minutes against Gamba, and Neymar scored a first-half penalty before setting up a goal for his Argentine team-mate.
Messi then returned the favour in the second half, releasing Neymar for the Brazilian to notch his second goal of the game.
Kylian Mbappe got his name on the scoresheet with a late penalty after coming on for the final 30 minutes.
Pablo Sarabia and Nuno Mendes also scored for PSG, but Galtier was concerned by the way his team conceded two at the other end to Gamba, who lie 16th in the 18-team J-League table.
“There is still a lot of work because we conceded two goals, which is two too many,” he said.
“I hope that even when we have a substantial lead, we will be more difficult to beat when we have to defend as a team. We must be more structured.” PSG beat J-League champions Kawasaki Frontale 2-1 in their first game in Japan last Wednesday before downing Urawa Reds 3-0 three days later.

3,Repechage to be introduced at Paris 2024,MONACO: World Athletics will introduce a repechage round in individual track events from 200 metres to 1500m at the...,"MONACO: World Athletics will introduce a repechage round in individual track events from 200 metres to 1500m at the Paris 2024 Games, the global governing body for athletics said on Monday.
The repechage round takes place after the initial qualifying rounds, and gives athletes who have failed to make the cut for the later rounds of an event a second chance at qualification.
It is already a part of the format of other Olympic sports like wrestling and taekwondo.
The introduction of a repechage round -- rubber-stamped by the World Athletics Council -- will also apply to hurdles events.
It will not be implemented in the 100m, which already features preliminary heats.
“In the new repechage format, athletes who do not qualify by place in round one heats, will have a second chance to qualify for the semi-finals by participating in repechage heats,” World Athletics said in a statement.
“This will replace the former system of athletes advancing through fastest times in addition to the top placings in the first round heats.”
World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said the decision had been taken after consultation with athletes and broadcasters.
“We believe this ... will make progression in these events more straightforward for athletes and will build anticipation for fans and broadcasters,” Coe said.
“The repechage rounds will give more exposure to our sport during the peak Olympic period and will be carefully scheduled to ensure that every event on our Olympic programme retains its share of the spotlight.”

4,Ali’s ‘Rumble’ title belt sold for $6.18 million,WASHINGTON: Boxing legend Muhammad Ali’s championship belt from his 1974  “Rumble in the Jungle” victory over...,"WASHINGTON: Boxing legend Muhammad Ali’s championship belt from his 1974  “Rumble in the Jungle” victory over George Foreman has been purchased by Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay for $6.18 million.
Noted memorabilia collector Irsay announced the purchase Sunday on Twitter, saying he was  “proud to be the steward” of the historic World Boxing Council belt.
Irsay hinted the item might be shown at an August show of his collection in Chicago as well as in September at Indianapolis.
The sale price early Sunday through Heritage Auctions, reported by Sports Collectors Daily, was called among the highest prices ever paid for a sports memorabilia item.
Ali upset previously undefeated Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) with an eighth-round knockout to reclaim the world heavyweight crown.
Ali, who died in 2016 at the age of 74, kept the WBC crown until losing to Leon Spinks in 1978.

5,Patel’s career-best knock steers India to series clinching win over WI,PORT-OF-SPAIN: Axar Patel’s career-best 64 not out lifted India to a series-clinching two-wicket win with two ...,"PORT-OF-SPAIN: Axar Patel’s career-best 64 not out lifted India to a series-clinching two-wicket win with two balls to spare over the West Indies in the second One-day Inter­national of a three-match series here at the Queen’s Park Oval on Sunday.
After Shai Hope’s assured 115 in his 100th ODI paced the home side to a competitive 311 for six batting first, the tourists were indebted to Patel’s bludgeoning innings off just 35 balls in his first ODI for five years.
Three fours and five sixes highlighted the left-hander’s spectacular effort in which 100 runs came off the last 58 deliveries of the match to give India an unbeatable 2-0 lead and extended their winning streak against the West Indies to 12 matches dating back to November 2018.
Kyle Mayers, who had taken two early wickets and featured in two other dismissals, was entrusted with the final over with India runs away from victory.
He looked on course to deny the visitors until a full-toss was smashed for a straight six by Patel to obliterate the previous record of 272 by the West Indies against Pakistan in 1988 as the highest success ODI run-chase at the venue.
“When I went out there we were aiming to get 10-11 runs-per-over,” said Patel after receiving the man-of-the-match award. “We thought it could be done because of our IPL experience.”
Shreyas Iyer (63) and Sanju Samson (54) had gotten India back on course after early setbacks, but it was Patel’s intervention which made all the difference.
Hope’s 13th ODI century earlier in the day, just his second in the Caribbean, came off 135 balls and was decorated with eight fours and three sixes.
He received good support from Nicholas Pooran as the home captain stroked 74 in a 117-run fourth wicket partnership with the opening batsman to justify his decision to bat first.
Mayers, West Indies top-scorer in the first match two days earlier which India won by just three runs, again set the pace with a brisk 39 in an opening stand of 65 with Hope.
Seam bowling all-rounder Shardul Thakur was the leading wicket-taker with three for 54, removing Pooran, Rovman Powell and then Hope to peg back their opponents who looked on course for a total closer to 330.
“Axar played well and we didn’t hold our nerve,” Pooran admitted in reflecting on a second nail-biting loss in three days.  “We just could not keep things under control in the last five overs.”

6,Sri Lanka eye big lead after Mendis’ all-round display in second Pakistan Test,Mendis contributed 35 in Sri Lanka’s 378 all out at the Galle International Stadium.,"GALLE: Ramesh Mendis chipped in with a lower order cameo and then claimed three wickets to put Sri Lanka on course for a significant first innings lead despite a fighting 62 by Pakistan batsman Agha Salman on day two of the second Test in Galle on Monday. 
Batting at number nine, Mendis contributed 35 in Sri Lanka’s 378 all out at the Galle International Stadium. The off-spinner then returned to wreck Pakistan’s middle order and the tourists, who lead the two-match series 1-0, ended the day on 191-7, still 187 behind in their first innings. 
Salman resisted the bowling attack with his maiden Test fifty but fell to Prabath Jayasuriya’s left-arm spin in the final moments of play before stumps was called. Jayasuriya got Salman caught at slip with a drifter coming into the right-handed batsman. 
Yasir Shah survived 61 balls, and an lbw decision against him that was reversed, for his 13 not out. 
Salman, who made his debut in the previous match, put on 46 runs with Yasir to lift Pakistan from 145-6. He expects the lower-order to fire come day three. 
“It’s been my dream to play for Pakistan in Test match cricket,” Salman said. “Glad that I was able to score a half-century in my second game. Disappointed that I couldn’t see through today.

“The way the partnership was going, we wanted to see off the day and come back tomorrow to start afresh, but it’s cricket and it happens. It’s a still good wicket to bat and we have plenty of batters who are capable of getting us closer to Sri Lanka’s total. 
“They were bowling well, to be very honest, and they were not giving runs, that’s why they took the wickets. They were playing patient games and we lacked that.” 
Earlier, Pakistan fast bowler Naseem Shah and spinner Yasir split the last four Sri Lankan wickets after the hosts had resumed on 315-6 in former captain Angelo Mathews’ landmark 100th Test. 
Niroshan Dickwella struck 51 and Mendis proved he was no dud with the bat to frustrate Pakistan. Naseem accounted for both overnight batters — Dunith Wellalage (11) and Dickwella — while Mendis was the last man dismissed. 
Dickwella, who started the day on 42, hit six fours and one six in his 54-ball knock and believes the pitch will improve for batters in time for their second innings. 
“Our bowlers bowled really well and that’s why we were able to get to seven wickets today,” he told reporters. “Tomorrow it will be a good wicket to bat.” 
Pakistan stuttered early in their reply losing Abdullah Shafique, whose unbeaten 160 had secured their victory in the series opener, to the second ball of the innings. 
Abdullah dragged the ball onto his stumps after an ugly poke at an Asitha Fernando delivery to be dismissed for a duck. 
Pakistan captain Babar Azam (16) departed in a similar fashion, trying to drive a Prabath Jayasuriya delivery without getting to the pitch of the ball and creating an inside edge that crashed onto his stumps. 
Opener Imam-ul-Haq attempted to rebuild the innings with Mohammad Rizwan but Dhananjaya de Silva broke through with his off-spin to send him back on 32. 
Mohammad Rizwan and Fawad Alam, both made 24, also got the starts but could not convert them with Mendis trapping both lbw. 
Rizwan also wasted a review trying to overturn the lbw decision against him. 
Mendis removed Mahammad Nawaz for figures of 3-42 but Salman refused to throw in the towel. The right-hander hit four fours and a six and played the spinners on the front foot until his departure. 
After being criticised for being unable to defend 342 runs in the first Test, the Sri Lankan spinners tightened their lines and bowled to good lengths in their bid to even the series. 
“We have played four back-to-back games here and all four wickets were different to each other,” Dickwella said. “I would say this is the best wicket to bat. It’s still a good pitch to play.”

7,Confusion surrounds appointment of new PHF secretary,"""The entire situation is making a mockery of the PHF constitution,"" sources say.","LAHORE: Already up against the Pakistan Sports Board, embattled Pakistan Hockey Federation president retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar has picked up another fight — this time within the federation.  
Earlier this month, Khokhar — along with PHF secretary Asif Bajwa and treasurer Ikhlaq Usmani — had been de-notified by the PSB after failing to hold elections of the country’s hockey governing body which were due in May this year. 
PSB, the country’s sports regulatory body, then appointed a four-member ad-hoc committee, which also included Khokhar, to hold elections within a month. 
Khokhar has not only rejected both those measures but on Monday there were widespread reports that former international Saeed Khan had been appointed as the acting PHF secretary in place of Bajwa. 
Bajwa, however, was still in office on Monday and remained tight-lipped on the development. He also did not comment on reports that he had tendered his resignation. 
Khokhar also did not speak on the issue as he was preparing to travel to Birmingham for the Commonwealth Games, where the national hockey team is due to participate. 
Sources close to the situation questioned how Khokhar could appoint Saeed, who has never been a member of the PHF Congress. 
According to the constitution, only the associate secretary of the PHF, Zahir Shah, could take the charge as acting secretary in place of Bajwa. 
“The entire situation is making a mockery of the PHF constitution and it is clear that the PHF president is not acting on the measures taken by the PHF,” sources told Dawn. 
They added that the best solution to tackle all the pertaining issues was to hold a PHF executive committee or congress meeting to take all stakeholders into confidence regarding the decisions. “Fresh elections can be another solution,” they added. 
In another development on Monday, Manzoor Junior was one again made the chairman of the national selection committee. 
Manzoor had been removed from the post and had resigned earlier this month after being given the role as the manager of the national junior team.

The slogan was released alongside a video promising the Olympics and Paralympics would be  “faster”,  “higher” and  “stronger” -- as well as  “more inclusive, more brotherly, more beautiful.”
It is  “an invitation to the entire world to come to experience new emotions, together. Our games are a promise of unprecedented experiences and powerful feelings,” the organisers said.
A total of 13 million tickets will be sold for the two events, with nearly half of tickets reserved for the public set to be sold at less than 50 euros ($51).
Outside the opening and closing ceremonies, prices for events will range from 24 euros to a maximum of 950 euros, organisers said in a press statement.
Fans are invited to enter a draw for tickets from December. Packages comprising tickets for three separate events will be available from 72 euros and will go on sale from February.
Also on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron gathered senior ministers to discuss growing concerns about costs and security for the mega-event.
France’s top audit body, the Cour des Comptes, warned in a recent report that it was  “imperative” to ramp up preparations for the  “considerable” security challenge of the games.
It suggested scaling down the ambitious opening ceremony, which is set to take place on the River Seine and feature an armada of 200 boats and some 600,000 spectators.

9,Classic events in doubt as F1 plans for city-centred future,LE CASTELLET: The future of the French Grand Prix and several other classic European races was declared uncertain on...,"LE CASTELLET: The future of the French Grand Prix and several other classic European races was declared uncertain on Monday as the dust settled following Max Verstappen’s crushing victory in front of a sell-out crowd at the Paul Ricard Circuit.
Widespread misgivings about F1’s plans to scrap established traditional races, or rotate them, and instead to hold more ‘international’ big city street circuit events, including a proposed Las Vegas race, dominated paddock debate during a sun-baked weekend.
World champion Verstappen had joined other drivers before the race in objecting to the likely loss of the sport’s iconic traditional circuits, including the Spa-Francorchamps track in the Belgian Ardennes, from a proposed 25-race calendar for next year.
Other historic events, including the Monaco and Italian Grands Prix, have been cited as targets for the axe as Liberty Media, owners of the commercial rights, forge a new future, breaking from the past and targeting new younger audiences.
“I don’t want to see myself in 2028, or whatever, driving only on street circuits close to a city just for the fan engagement, or whatever,” said championship leader Verstappen.
“I understand everyone wants to make money, but there is also a limit to that because it’s important to keep these really cool circuits on the calendar instead of just driving on street circuits, which I think F1 cars are not designed for anyway.”
Verstappen has been reluctant to accept the sport’s Americanisation, led by owners Liberty Media’s push for a Netflix-driven expansion into new markets including the United States, the Middle East and South Africa and objected to participating in the ‘Drive to Survive’ series.
The sport’s traditionalists were given hope on Monday when race promoter Christian Estrosi said he was  “not resigned” to the loss of the French Grand Prix next year after record crowds at this season’s event.
“It’s the end of a contract in which France had to show its know-how in organisation,” he said.  “200,000 people filled the circuit between Friday and Sunday, which is an absolute record.
“We are in the middle of a discussion -- so no, I am not resigned. I saw our country regain its Grand Prix de France -- this magnificent, popular sporting event. I am convinced that in the coming weeks, we will have extremely positive things to announce for the future of our Grand Prix.”
French driver Esteban Ocon of Alpine suggested Le Mans, the venue of the world’s most famous 24-Hour race, could be used in a new format that also helped to preserve the Belgian Grand Prix.
“I think we have multiple options,” he said.  “I don’t think around Paris is realistic with the way the people there are running the area, but there are others that could work -- Magny-Cours, of course, but it is hard to get to. Le Mans as a French Grand Prix could be awesome.”
He added that alternating races in France and Belgium could be a solution.
“I don’t care about the business aspect of it as a driver, but it leaves F1 in a better place and for us it’s important, but as a driving experience I like Jeddah and many of these new tracks.”
France, Belgium and Italy, along with Britain and Monaco, hosted races in the inaugural 1950 world championship season.
All five have been touted as under threat in recent years as the hosting fees have risen with the arrival of new events including Miami, Singapore, Las Vegas, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Jeddah and more planned.
France has paid a reported fee of around $20 million to host a race at Le Castellet since returning to the calendar in 2018, after a 10-year absence, while Saudi Arabia pays a reported $50 million.
“The reality is that F1 is extremely attractive and there are a lot of cities and countries that want to host F1,” said French GP director Eric Boullier.
Verstappen offered a more purist view that helped explain why thousands of fans would spend three days in cold, wet woodlands, staying in tents, to watch the Belgian race rather than a luxury hotel in a warm climate with a street track.
“It’s just a great track to drive... I understand that to get there compared to other tracks, it’s probably a little bit more difficult, but it is just fantastic,” he said.

10,Williamson returns for white ball tour of West Indies,WELLINGTON: New Zealand captain Kane Williamson has been named in his first white ball squad since the T20 World Cup...,"WELLINGTON: New Zealand captain Kane Williamson has been named in his first white ball squad since the T20 World Cup as the Black Caps ramp up their preparations for the global tournament with their first tour of the Caribbean in eight years.
Williamson, who played his last T20 match in the defeat by Australia in the World Cup final last November, will captain identical T20 and ODI squads to play the West Indies in six white ball matches starting in Jamaica on Aug 10.
Williamson will be joined by pace veterans Trent Boult and Tim Southee, and batsman Devon Conway, all of whom were rested following the team’s 3-0 whitewash by England in the Test series in June.
“It’s always exciting to be heading somewhere you’ve not been in a while and I know this group cant wait for the challenge of taking on the West Indies in the Caribbean,” coach Gary Stead said in a statement on Monday.
“For Kane, Trent, Tim and Devon, this will be the first time they have played white ball cricket for New Zealand since last years T20 World Cup and tour to India — so this trip will be important for them.”
New Zealand wrapped up a 3-0 T20 series defeat of Ireland with a six-wicket win in Belfast last week.
A number of players who featured in that series have been omitted for the West Indies tour, including Dane Cleaver, Jacob Duffy and Blair Tickner.
Batsmen Finn Allen and Michael Bracewell have broken into New Zealand’s best 15 in the lead-up to the T20 World Cup being hosted by champions Australia in October-November.
Allen made his ODI debut against Ireland this month, while Bracewell made his T20I debut against the Irish last week.

11,Multi-format cricketers could be on way out: De Kock,"""Three formats is a lot and it looks like more games are happening over the calendar,"" he says.","LEEDS: Quinton de Kock believes it will become increasingly difficult for leading cricketers to play all three main formats, although he remains confident about the future for One-day Internationals.
The South Africa wicket-keeper/batsman, who made a fine unbeaten 92 before the third ODI against England at Headingley on Sunday was washed out, ended his Test career late last year, shortly before becoming a father for the first time.
Questions regarding a congested global schedule were raised again after the ODI retirement of England all-rounder Ben Stokes following the first match of this series at the 2019 World Cup final star’s Chester-le-Street home ground.
De Kock, speaking after Sunday’s rain in Leeds meant a three-game contest ended in a 1-1 draw, told reporters:  “It’s going to start being tough for players — three formats is a lot and it looks like more games are happening over the calendar.
“Players need to make decisions individually and if they feel they can do it [play Tests, ODIs and T20 Internationals], I am happy for them,” the 29-year-old added.
“But guys need to take decisions into their own hands. For me, I am happy where I am.”
De Kock though stressed curtailing a 54-match Test career had yet to have the desired effect.
Although he had two months off after returning from paternity leave to play in South Africa’s white-ball matches against India in January ahead of the series against Bangladesh, he has been on the go playing cricket ever since.
De Kock featured for the Lucknow Super Giants in the Indian Premier League before the tour of England, which also includes several further T20 Internationals.
He will then remain in England to play in the Hundred before heading to the Caribbean Premier League prior to another white-ball series in India which precedes the T20 World Cup in Australia.
“It [retiring from Tests] hasn’t freed up my calendar -- at least not this year,” said De Kock.
“I’ve been roped in to play a couple of leagues but that’s my own consequence.
“I am happy to do it. It’s still a sacrifice but I’m slowly getting to an age where I need to think about where I want to be in my career.”
South Africa have never won a 50-over World Cup — something they will try to put right in India next year — with De Kock insisting:  “The (ODI) game is doing well for itself with the way players are going about it and from a batting and bowling competitiveness.
“There’s a future for it and a lot of us still want to win 50-over World Cups.”
Meanwhile, England captain Jos Buttler was left frustrated by a gruelling schedule, as much as the bad weather.
The 50-over world champions are currently nine games into a hectic period of 12 white-ball fixtures in 24 days, with just a solitary training day in that time.
Buttler, who recently succeeded Eoin Morgan as England’s limited-overs captain following the 2019 World Cup-winning skipper’s international retirement, said:  “It’s tough.
“To get the highest standard of cricket possible, you need to prepare properly. Hopefully that’s something we can look at going forward.
“That’s been a frustration to be truthfully honest — it would be nice to have that time to do the work,” Buttler added.

12,Record-breaking Duplantis soars as US complete historic medal haul,EUGENE: Armand Duplantis brought down the curtain on the World Athletics Championships in stunning fashion on ...,"EUGENE: Armand Duplantis brought down the curtain on the World Athletics Championships in stunning fashion on Sunday, breaking his own pole vault world record in the final act of the 10-day global track and field extravaganza. 
After the United States claimed emphatic victories in both the men’s and women’s 4x400 metre relays, Duplantis took centre stage and duly delivered a perfect finale for the first championships on American soil — apart from the fact maybe that the US-born and raised 22-year-old was wearing the yellow and blue of Sweden and not representing the Stars and Stripes. 
The Swede sailed over 6.21 metres to surpass his previous mark by one centimetre — set in March en route to winning gold at the World Indoor Championships — and complete his collection of medals by claiming a first world title. 
The packed, raucous crowd at Hayward Field went wild as Duplantis sprinted to see his father and coach Greg and plant a kiss on girlfriend Desire Inglander. 
“It’s great; I cannot complain,” Duplantis said. “Actually, I did not think about the record that much today .... I really wanted to win the gold so badly. It was the medal I was missing. So when I was on this height, it was like everything came together and it happened from there. 
“I love jumping in Eugene and it was amazing here. I cannot figure the next heights right now. I am going to have a bit time off with my family and my friends.” 
American Chris Nilsen took silver with 5.94 metres on countback from Ernest John Obiena, whose bronze was the first-ever world medal for the Philippines. 
Unheralded Nigerian Tobi Amusan had earlier stolen the show with two electric runs on her way to gold in the 100m hurdles. 
In the very first event of a loaded evening of track, people had barely had chance to sit down with their sodas and popcorn before Amusan rocketed to a new world record of 12.12 seconds in the semi-finals. 
When she retook to the track later in the session, the Nigerian stormed to victory in 12.06sec, although a tailwind speed of 2.5 metres per second meant it wouldn’t go down in the freshly-inked record books. 
“The goal was to come out and to win this gold. .... The world record is a bonus. I just did it,” said Amusan, who finished 0.17 seconds ahead of Jamaican Britany Anderson while Puerto Rico’s Olympic champion Jasmine Camacho-Quinn went home with bronze. “I believe in my abilities but I was not expecting a world record at these championships.” 
American Athing Mu lived up to her hype by adding the world 800m title to her Olympic crown. 
Mu, still only 20 years of age, was forced to dig deep to hold off British rival Keeley Hodgkinson in a thrilling battle down the final straight before taking gold in a world-leading 1min 56.30sec. 
“I’m just glad I made it to the line to finish the race, and thankfully I won gold. I just physically wasn’t where I would like to be,” Mu said. 
Another gold medallist from last year’s Tokyo Olympics, Malaika Mihambo, won Germany a long-awaited medal as she retained her world long jump title. 
But Uganda’s Joshua Cheptegei floundered in a 5000m race won convincingly by Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who bounced back from the disappointment of silver in the 1500m. 
“I didn’t want a sprint finish,” Ingebrigtsen said.  “I wanted to prove that I’m a better runner than the rest of the guys. It was a great race. I ran it, I needed it. I felt really good today, but 5km is really tough.” 
French world record holder Kevin Mayer regained the decathlon title after impressive performances in the pole vault and javelin, seizing opportunity after a competition-ending injury to Olympic champion Damian Warner. 
Mayer accrued 8,816 points after 10 disciplines over two days to follow up on previous world gold in 2017 in London. 
In the morning session, Italy’s Massimo Stano claimed a one-second victory over Masatora Kawano of Japan in the men’s 35km race walk, adding a world gold to his Olympic crown. 
The United States wrapped up the championships by consolidating their place at the top of the medals table with a championship record 33 medals. 
The men’s quartet came home in two minutes, 56.17 seconds and strengthened the Americans’ stranglehold on the event. The United States has now won eight of the past nine world titles and eight of the past 10 Olympic golds. 
Sydney McLaughlin, the newly crowned 400 metres hurdles gold medallist, anchored the women’s team and ran a remarkable 47.91 final leg to give the hosts their 13th gold medal of the event. 
The women’s victory meant the now-retired Allyson Felix bagged a 20th world medal as she was a squad member who ran in Saturday’s heats.
