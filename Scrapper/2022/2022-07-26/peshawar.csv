Idrees Khan Khattak from the Panel of Chairmen, who presided over the sitting, ordered staff members to ring the bells after the opposition members pointed out a lack of quorum twice.
After recitation from the Holy Quran, Munawar Khan of the the opposition Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal requested the chair to adjourn the sitting insisting a very important case is being heard by the Supreme Court about the election of the Punjab chief minister.
The chair ignored the plea and continued with the session.
On that occasion, the opposition members drew the chair’s attention toward a lack of quorum. The chair directed the staff to carry out a headcount, which showed the required number of lawmakers absent from the house.
Idrees Khattak ordered to adjourn proceedings for 10 minutes to complete the quorum. After completion of the question hour session, the opposition benches again pointed out a lack of quorum leading to headcount orders by the chair for the second time.
The sitting was adjourned for 10 more minutes but the house continued to be without quorum forcing the chair to adjourn it until 2pm today (Tuesday).
During question hour, member of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party Nighat Yasmin Orakzai said officials had long been facing accommodation problems, so the government should build residential quarters for them.
She also demanded the handing over of the Fata House in Islamabad and Himalaya House in Nathiagali to the provincial assembly’s secretariat.
Ms Orakzai said ministers and senior bureaucrats had been living in four to eight kanals specious bungalows in Peshawar, so the provincial government should construct houses for cabinet members and bureaucrats, including the chief secretary, over just one kanal.
Like the Judges Colony, she suggested that the government put up enclaves for ministers and senior officers as well as small houses to make more efficient use of state properties.
Labour minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai agreed with the proposal and said a feasibility report was being prepared for the purpose. He also suggested that the government allocate at least Rs500 million in the annual budget to build colonies for its employees.
The minister insisted the government should go for high-rise residential buildings instead of horizontal construction to save land.

3,Govt likely to revise rates of cardiac procedures under Sehat Card Plus programme,Hospitals seek increase owing to surging prices of implants in international market,"PESHAWAR: The health department is likely to revise rates of cardiac procedures under Sehat Card Plus programme after requests by empanelled hospitals owing to surge in the prices of implants in the international market as local currency has depreciated against dollar, according to sources.
Recently, the hospitals empanelled for heart surgeries and other procedures under Sehat Card Plus wrote a letter to State Life Insurance Corporation (SLIC), pointing out that the cost of implants in the international markets had risen due to depreciation of rupee against dollar. They requested for increase in rates of the procedures.
The SLIC, which is implementing the free treatment programme on behalf of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, has signed contracts with all the hospitals wherein rates for different operations have been fixed. During the last few months, the rupee faced more depreciation against dollar owing to which the hospitals have demanded increase in their rates.
Doctors in private and government hospitals told Dawn that all the implants were imported in dollar due to which the margin of profitability had decreased. They said that imported stent was available at Rs100,000 and local at Rs20,000 but as per agreement’s policy they were bound to provide quality treatment to patients on SCP.

Hospitals seek increase owing to surging prices of implants in international market

“Therefore, we have sent genuine demand to the government to allow increase in rate so that the patients can get quality services and prevent complications in treatment,” they said.
The government has so far spent Rs26.58 billion on the treatment of 1.085 million patients on SCP including 30 per cent heart patients. Most of the cardiac procedures have been conducted in private hospitals as Peshawar Institute of Cardiology (PIC) is the only public sector facility offering the services to cardiac patients.
Officials in health department said that a meeting with representatives of the empanelled hospitals would be held on Tuesday wherein issues relating to the cardiac procedures and their rates would be discussed. They conceded that the issue raised by the hospitals was genuine and the government wanted to continue providing free of cost treatment facilities to patients owing to which the representatives of the empanelled hospitals had been invited to resolve the issue.
“Not only free treatment but provision of quality health services is the major aim of the programme. The government doesn’t want to compromise on the quality of the treatment, therefore, it has been decided to sit with the representatives of hospitals and accept their demand for increase in the rates,” they said.
However, the officials said that they expected that the hospitals wouldn’t push the government for unjust revision of the rates to ensure that the patients continued to get quality services as per international standards.
During the last one week, from July 18 to July 25, a total of 52 cardiac procedures have been performed on SCP, costing Rs15.46 million.
The government has registered 1,100 hospitals countrywide including 192 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where 9.5 million families of the province and the newly-merged districts are entitled to avail treatment costing up to Rs1 million. Under the programme, patients are entitled to Rs5 million and Rs1.4 million treatment expenses for liver and renal transplants, respectively. However, the major portion of the amount under SCP is spent on cardiac patients.
Meanwhile, spokesman for Rehman Medical Institute (RMI) Peshawar told Dawn that statements by some of its doctors regarding stopping heart surgeries was their personal view as the institute continue to facilitate the patients on SCP as per contract with the health department.
“There is no fact in the media news about suspension of heart procedures and the patients have been getting uninterrupted services for the past one year,” he said.

They told journalists on Monday that 5,000 residents of three villages -- Kass, Shehd Sar and Kandaw -- had been facing acute water shortage since long. 
They said that women had to cover a long distance to fetch water from a spring.
Amjad Ali, former village nazim, said that the issue of water shortage turned severe and people faced great difficulties.
“Minister for Labour and Culture Shaukat Yousafzai has approved Rs15.1 million water supply scheme. The project was tenderised and pipes were brought by the contractor but the scheme could not be executed owing to opposition of people of other area,” said Amjad Ali.
He said that four water bores in the area also failed. However, they approached the executive engineer of public health engineering department to supply water to the area from a down spring for which electricity would be required.
Waseem Yousafzai, a resident of Shehd Sar, said that the only option for addressing the issue was to install solar panels or get electricity from Wapda to pump water from the spring. He said that they were consuming electricity generated by mini power stations.
He claimed that the area had been ignored by the successive governments. He said that they were deprived of basic rights in that modern era of technology.
Waqar Ahmad Khan, Alpuri tehsil chairman, when contacted, said that the water supply scheme approved for the area was halted due to a conflict over the water and politicising of the issue for damaging his reputation during local bodies’ elections.
He said they were striving to construct a huge tank in the area and install a heavy pumping machine to supply water to the people. 
However, he said that electricity was needed to run the pumping machine.

“Your request regarding de-sealing of the premises at 3rd and food court at 7th floor is not ceded,” read the letter of the CDA’s estate wing.
The letter said the CDA board in its meeting held in November 2017 revoked the lease of plot No 5, F-7 Markaz.
“To date, no record exists that shows that the cancellation of lease of plot No 5, F-7 Markaz has been rescinded,” read the letter.
CDA had auctioned plot No 5 in Jinnah Super Market in 2010, where its health department was once located. But in a highly questionable move, the civic agency converted the health facility in to a commercial plot.
According to CDA officials, in the allotment letter, it was clearly defined that the floor-area ratio of the building would be 1:5 with 100pc coverage and the number of storeys was ground-plus four, thus capping the height of the building.
Later, the plot owner, in connivance with the CDA officials constructed three additional and unauthorised storeys. 
Though, he got permission from CDA for three additional storeys, but when the matter was highlighted, the CDA withdrew the permission of three additional storeys.
Later, the matter was probed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and several CDA officials as well as owner of the mall faced jail.

On the other hand, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a low-medium flood alert for Haripur, Swabi and Nowshera districts due to the opening of the Tarbela Dam’s spillways.
Spokesman for Rescue 1122 Bilal Ahmad Faizi said in a statement that the swollen Kabul River caused its water to enter houses in the nearby low-lying villages in Peshawar.
He said water entered houses in Wazir Killay, Bela Mohmandan, Parchavay and Shah Alam Pul areas prompting rescuers to shift the residents, including women and children, to safer places.

PDMA issues flood alert for Haripur, Swabi and Nowshera due to opening of Tarbela Dam spillways

The spokesman said 225 people were rescued from Bela Mohmandan area early on Monday and 36 from Shah Alam area afterwards due to the rising water in the river.
He said the Rescue 122 had set up rescue and relief camps in Wazir Killay and Parchvay areas of Michini village for the residents, while small boats, ambulances and workers were sent there to handle emergency.
Mr Faizi said the rescue agency had deployed its teams in Nowshera, Swabi and Haripur districts in anticipation of the opening of Tarbela Dam’s spillways.
“We have arranged five boats, three ambulances, a recovery vehicle and around 50 rescuers for every district,” he said.
Meanwhile, the PDMA issued a low-to-medium flooding alert for Haripur, Swabi and Nowshera districts over the opening of Tarbela Dam’s spillways for the first time during the current monsoon spell. A notification issued by the superintending engineer (survey and hydrology) residency, Tarbela Dam project, said the spillways of the dam were likely to be ‘put into operation’ within 24 hours.
“Discharge downstream Tarbela in the Indus River may vary between low to medium flood limits,” it read, adding that all necessary arrangements could be made accordingly.
The PDMA directed district administrations to take precautionary measures to prevent damage to public life, infrastructure, crops and livestock.
In the advisory, the authority directed districts administrations to put all departments on alert round the clock, ensure vigilance of the Indus River Downstream Tarbela and update the vulnerable population to prevent human losses in case of flooding and ensure the availability of machinery in their areas.
Also, an emergency flood control room was established in Haripur deputy commissioner’s office.

It feared that in an event of river outflow exceeding 600,000 cusecs, the villages situated on the right and left banks of the Indus River for around 40 kilometers downstream of Tarbela would be inundated.
The working paper, however, said the downstream Tarbela valley could take up to 500,000 cusecs of water safely without causing any significant damage to the structure.
“Flows exceeding 600,000 cusecs will inundate adjacent villages and valleys and cause damage to public life and property,” it said.
The PDMA said the outflow of the Kabul River was recorded 95,400 cusecs in Nowshera on Monday afternoon with the river recording medium flood.
It added that the outflows of the Indus River at Khairabad point in Nowshera and Chashma in Dera Ismail Khan were 181,400 and 215,556 cusecs of water, respectively.
