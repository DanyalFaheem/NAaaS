According to a notification issued by Member Estate Naveed Ilahi on July 25, Deputy Director General Estate Afnan Alam will head the committee while Deputy Director Human Resource Department (HRD) Mian Usmanud Din will be its member. The committee will investigate the matter and submit a report within 10 days.
The notification available with Dawn stated: “Director Security CDA has reported fake and bogus allotment of plots in sector D-13/2, Islamabad. In order to determine the facts in the matter and to identify the officials involved in this illegal allotment, the competent authority has directed that a formal inquiry may be held in this regard.” 
It said: “the committee will determine the loss caused to CDA and will identify and pinpoint those involved in this fake and bogus allotment.”
Sources said a few months ago, the then additional director land Sobia Toru, who is currently serving as the deputy commissioner CDA, informed the security directorate that two plots in D-13 had been allotted with her fake signatures.
The sources said when the matter was brought to the notice of CDA high-ups they directed the security directorate to conduct a preliminary probe.
During the preliminary probe, it was transpired that at least seven such plots of one kanal each had been allotted with fake signatures. 
The probe committee also pointed out that the plots were allotted against fake claims of land as the allottees had no land in Shah Allah Ditta but were allotted alternative plots using fake claims.
The sources said files of the seven plots were also missing from the land directorate. The committee, which completed a preliminary inquiry, recommended to the CDA management to issue orders for cancellation of the plots and hold a formal inquiry.
A couple of months ago, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had also sought the record of the two plots in D-13, which were initially reported to the security directorate by the former additional director land.

RAWALPINDI/Islamabad: Heavy rain on Monday played havoc in the garrison city with rainwater inundating low-lying areas and entering houses and shops, damaging goods worth millions of rupees.
Leh Nullah rose to 15 feet at Gawalmandi and Kattarian bridges. The rain, varying from light to heavy, forced the local administration to switch on sirens of the flood warning system, asking people along Leh Nullah to move to safer places.
Army was put on alert and officials of Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), Rescue 1122, Civil Defence and health department were called in to deal with any emergency.
“The army was not called out but put on alert to deal with any emergency,” Deputy Commissioner Tahir Farooq told Dawn.
In downtown areas, rainwater destroyed motorcycles and cars parked on main roads in Mochi Bazaar, Bohar Bazaar, Sadiqabad and Jamia Masjid Road.
Nullahs and streams flowing from Islamabad merged into Leh Nullah at New Kattarian on I.J. Principal Road and discharged into Soan River. In the 11km-long route, 11 nullahs in Rawalpindi also fell into Leh Nullah.
Every year, a flood-like situation develops in the nullah due to the faulty sewerage system in the city. The last flood that the garrison city witnessed was on July 23, 2001 when 620mm of rain was recorded in just four hours. At least 35 lost their lives while many slums were swept away.
The Meteorological Department on Monday recorded 100mm of rain at Golra, 81mm at Zero Point, 13mm at the airport and 31mm at Saidpur in Islamabad while 27mm was recorded at Shamsabad, 59mm at Chaklala and 29mm at Kutchery in Rawalpindi. More rain has been forecast on Tuesday.
“It is not cloudburst but a heavy rain spell. Usually, minimum 200mm an hour rain is called cloudburst,” said a Met Office official.
He said strong monsoon currents were continuously penetrating the upper, central and southern parts of the country. More rain-wind/thundershower is expected in Punjab, Islamabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, Sindh and Balochistan. Isolated heavy falls are likely in Kashmir, Punjab, Sindh and southern Balochistan.
The residents of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, especially those living along Leh and other nullahs, faced great hardship as the rain continued from morning till evening. 
Dhoke Juma, Faizabad, Arya Mohallah, Nadeem Colony, Javed Colony, Muslim Colony, Dhoke Ratta, Ganjmandi, Jamia Masjid Road, Banni Chowk, Sadiqabad, Satellite Town, Commercial Market, College Road, Bohar Bazaar, Naya Mohallah, Iqbal Road, Raja Bazaar, Kohati Bazaar, Mochi Bazaar, Mohanpura, Nanakpura, Arjan Nagar, Amarpura, Service Road along Murree Road, Khayaban-i-Sir Syed and Rawal Road were covered with three to four feet of rainwater.
The situation in Islamabad, especially in I-9, I-10, Karachi Company, Peshawar Mor, G-8, G-7 and even Margalla Road was no different.
The officers’ ward at Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH) and the basement of Holy Family Hospital (HFH) were also inundated while Rescue 1122 officials said rainwater entered metro bus stations on Murree Road and accumulated on the elevated track.
Electricity and gas supply was suspended in low-lying areas to avoid any harm to human lives.
Deputy Commissioner Tahir Farooq and Wasa Managing Director Mohammad Tanveer visited different parts of the garrison city to inspect the operation to drain out water from roads and streets.
When contacted, the Wasa chief said residents in localities adjacent to Leh Nullah were alerted as the nullah rose to pre-alert level of 15 feet.
He said all officials were called to deal with any emergency and to drain out water accumulated on roads adjacent to Leh Nullah, adding that main roads were cleared of water within an hour.
Rawalpindi Traders Association President Shahid Ghafoor Paracha told Dawn that rainwater entered Raja Bazaar and adjoining markets, including Moti and Mochi bazaars, and destroyed goods in shops and stores.
“Traders remained busy clearing rainwater from their shops,” he said, adding that the government should help small traders whose goods were damaged in the urban flooding.
He said nullahs should be cleared before the monsoon to avoid such damages.
Meanwhile, CDA officials remained on their toes during the heavy rain, draining out rainwater accumulated on various roads and the Peshawar Mor metro bus station.
According to the CDA, complaints about accumulation of rainwater were received from different areas and were addressed promptly. It said water accumulated on highways was also cleared to maintain normal traffic flow.
A press release issued by the CDA said 20 complaints of water accumulation were received on its helpline. “These complaints were addressed well on time and dewatering was carried out with the help of pumps,” it stated.
Similarly, complaints were also received about collapse of walls of two houses in Tarnol but there was no loss of life. Joint teams took timely action and evacuated the residents of nearby houses to safe places.
The teams also ensured strict monitoring in different sectors, housing societies, non-sectoral areas such as H-13, E-11 and other low-lying areas.
According to the assistant commissioner rural Islamabad, water level in Rawal Dam reached 1,750.10 feet and its spillways will be opened from 6am to 10am on Tuesday to release 861 acre feet of water to attain the level of 1,749.5 feet. The opening hours will depend on the rain conditions.
The deputy commissioner directed all response units, departments, monitoring and relief camps to remain on alert while police reserves will also be deployed along Korang River.
Moreover, strict action will be taken against anyone entering Korang River and violating Section 144.

He made this offer to Afghanistan through Mufti Mohammad Taqi Usmani, President Jamia Darul Uloom Karachi, who is visiting Afghanistan and is expected to meet top Afghan leadership, says a press release issued by the Presidency.
Talking to Mufti Usmani, the president said that since Afghanistan did not possess nationwide internet connectivity, initially education materials of AIOU and VUP can be communicated to Afghan students, both male and female, through its television network.
The president said the government and the state of Pakistan believed in providing equal educational opportunities to women, at par with its male population. He said keeping in view the specific socioeconomic norms of Afghanistan, women could be imparted education by making special arrangements as deemed appropriate.
He said there was no bar in Islam on women’s education and if Afghanistan was taking measures to provide education to its female population according to its own preferences, this far-reaching initiative should also be properly publicised through all channels of media and communication tools to rest of the world to allay their concerns.
According to the press release, the president has been making the offer of providing online and virtual education facilities to Afghanistan during his meetings with the Afghan ambassador and counsel generals and other Afghan government leadership, directly or indirectly, on various occasions which has received positive response from Kabul.

7,Poonch varsity lacks facilities,"MUZAFFARABAD: With over 5,000 students on its rolls, the state-run University of Poonch (UoP) in Rawalakot has been...","MUZAFFARABAD: With over 5,000 students on its rolls, the state-run University of Poonch (UoP) in Rawalakot has been grappling with acute shortage of physical facilities and student accommodation and its recently appointed vice chancellor has urged all stakeholders to play their role in addressing this issue at the earliest.
Prof Dr Mohammad Zakria Zakar, who assumed office early last month after serving as the founding vice chancellor of the University of Okara, told varsity officials at a consultative meeting on Monday that infrastructural development was greatly linked with academic excellence and he would therefore give equal importance to both simultaneously.
The UoP was founded by an Act of the AJK Assembly in 2014 with its main campus in Rawalakot, the district headquarters of Poonch. It has two sub-campuses in the towns of Mang in district Sudhnoti and Forward Kahuta in district Haveli. The varsity has 32 departments with an enrolment of as many as 5,500 students at the moment which Mr Zakar wants to augment by further improving the standard and reputation of the institution.
Construction of a new campus in Chota Galla on the outskirts of Rawalakot was initiated by Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (Erra) in 2010 at an estimated cost of Rs1.233 million under the funding by the Kuwait government. However, work on it was shelved in 2018 after only 30pc progress allegedly due to Erra’s internal issues.
Side by side, a Rs1,292 million Higher Education Commission funded infrastructural development project was also initiated by the UoP in 2018.
The meeting was told that 64pc work of this project has been completed at a cost of Rs487 million, despite Covid-19 restrictions in the past two years, and the remaining work would be completed in one year as there was no interruption in cash flow.
The vice chancellor asked the varsity officials to prepare a report on factors that had led to the inordinate delay in Erra supervised project so that the concerned quarters could be reached with “facts and figures” for early redress.

“Your request regarding de-sealing of the premises at 3rd and food court at 7th floor is not ceded,” read the letter of the CDA’s estate wing.
The letter said the CDA board in its meeting held in November 2017 revoked the lease of plot No 5, F-7 Markaz.
“To date, no record exists that shows that the cancellation of lease of plot No 5, F-7 Markaz has been rescinded,” read the letter.
CDA had auctioned plot No 5 in Jinnah Super Market in 2010, where its health department was once located. But in a highly questionable move, the civic agency converted the health facility in to a commercial plot.
According to CDA officials, in the allotment letter, it was clearly defined that the floor-area ratio of the building would be 1:5 with 100pc coverage and the number of storeys was ground-plus four, thus capping the height of the building.
Later, the plot owner, in connivance with the CDA officials constructed three additional and unauthorised storeys. Though, he got permission from CDA for three additional storeys, but when the matter was highlighted, the CDA withdrew the permission of three additional storeys.
Later, the matter was probed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and several CDA officials as well as owner of the mall faced jail.

The auditor general has written letters to the Establishment Division, the secretary Ministry of National Food Security and Research (NFSR) and as a last resort to the minister for NFSR Tariq Bashir Cheema.
In the letters, copy available with Dawn, the auditor general stated that “Mr Abdul Ghufran Memon, BS-22 officer of Pakistan Audit and Accounts Service, was proceeded under the Harassment of Women at Workplace Act 2010 with the approval of the prime minister.

Mr Memon, on the other hand, filed a petition in Islamabad High Court (IHC) and obtained a stay order. The IHC directed the authorities concerned not to take adverse action against the officer.
Under sub-section 4 of section 4 of the Protection against Harassment of women at the Workplace 2010, “the inquiry committee shall submit its findings and recommendations to the competent authority within 30 days of the initiation of inquiry. If the inquiry committee finds the accused to be guilty it shall recommend to the competent authority for imposing one or more of the penalties.”
