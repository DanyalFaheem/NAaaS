City limping back to normality
In the evening, the city started to limping back to normality as rainwater on major arteries receded. The Sindh government had declared a public holiday on Monday in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions. 
The city administration was seen taking extra efforts by using more manpower and deploying resources to clear the key road links.
Karachi Administrator Barrister Murtaza Wahab Siddiqi took to social media to post updates of relief and drainage operation across the city. Apart from some pockets in district South and few other parts in PECHS, Defence, the major roads of the city including Sharea Faisal, M. A. Jinnah Road, University Road, Shershah Suri Road, Shahrah-i-Pakistan, Rashid Minhas Road, Garden Road, etc, had been cleared for vehicular traffic.
However, there was no word from city administration including Sindh government’s Solid Waste Management Board, Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB), Cantonment Boards and DHA about situation in residential areas, streets and a large number of societies where rainwater still standing.
Despite claims from the city administration life remained miserable in several low-lying areas, residential neighbourhoods, housing societies and commercial centres that remained submerged by rainwater. 
A senior KWSB official conceded that the situation in almost across Karachi would take time to normalise.
“The rainwater is almost drained out from all major roads and thoroughfares but it’s the overflowed sewerage lines in almost all city districts, which have become a challenge in residential areas. We have deployed more resources and hired temporary staff to meet the challenge but it would take time to complete the job,” he said.

2,Hub Canal breach not yet plugged,KARACHI: Water supply to district West remained suspended on Monday after a portion of the Hub canal developed a...,"KARACHI: Water supply to district West remained suspended on Monday after a portion of the Hub canal developed a 150-foot breach near Manghopir following heavy rains on Sunday.
Karachi Water and Sewerage Board Managing Director Rafiq Qureshi told Dawn that the breach had been plugged temporarily as the teams of the water utility were taking all-out measures since last night to restore the water supply to the city from Hub Dam. 
“The breach in the canal will be plugged completely within 48 hours,” he said.
He added that the breach did not pose any threat to people living near the canal.
“The flow of water from the breach is far away from hum­an settlements,” he added.
Panic gripped the localities in Malir and adjoining areas after the Malir river overflowed.
Due to heavy flow of water, Kathor Link Road was closed for general traffic, which was diverted to alternative routes.
Reports suggested that the road from Memon Goth to Shah Latif Town was also closed for general traffic due to overflowing water.
Police also closed the roads to and from Dumba Goth where rainwater was flowing fast.
KWSB sources said that the Malir river water would flow towards Korangi Caus­eway that connects Korangi from district South.
Meanwhile, Malir SSP Irfan Bahadur said that several parts of Malir were flooded as water coming from hills had filled the Malir river, which was overflowing. 
The SSP said that six small dams in Malir overflowed, and of them, three had developed breach because of heavy rains, therefore, a huge quantity of water has entered crops and human settlements, causing problems for several villages. 
SSP-East Abdul Rahim Shirazi said that due to torrential rains, there was some turbulence and high tide in the Lyari river, which also carried dirty water. 
He said after the drowning of a young boy he had visited the spot and observed that in case of heavy downpour, there would be further turbulence in the Lyari river. 
“We made contact with the deputy commissioner of East who subsequently sent his revenue staff so that all inhabitants of the left bank of the Lyari river could be evacuated to safer places,” he added.
The SSP said that police had also made announcements from mosques to ask the people to be shifted to safer places as the residents appeared to be reluctant.

4,Amphibious car — a ’60s solution to Karachi’s 21st century problem,KARACHI: Many people stranded at home during the recent rains and subsequent urban flooding in the city wished for a...,"KARACHI: Many people stranded at home during the recent rains and subsequent urban flooding in the city wished for a car with boat features that they could take out in the water. Many people saw the four-wheeler Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV) as that kind of a car. But there actually is a car that can work as a boat. 
The Amphibious Car, or Amphicar, was such a before it’s time vehicle. It was manufactured in West Germany where it’s designer, Hans Trippel, used technology from wartime amphibious vehicles to build the world’s first such commercially available car. Though manufactured in Germany, the Amphicar was launched at the New York Auto Show in 1961. 
Sadly, the car’s manufacturer stopped production in 1965. Today there are very few Amphicars left in the world and one of them recently emerged in a WhatsApp group of classic car collectors and enthusiasts. Even rare for this car is that it is right-hand driven as most of these cars were left-hand drive to suit the US market where they have plenty of lakes.
The Amphicar is currently owned by classic car collector Razi Nayyer. He was the one who posted a picture of his beloved Amphicar in the group saying: “Karachi will never change so I am going to get my Amphicar ready before the next monsoon.”
Nayyer told Dawn that he fell in love with the Amphicar when he first read about it as a little boy. 


Many Amphicars floating like boats in this promotional picture from the 1960s.

 
“I had read that the US President Lindon Johnson owned two Amphicars and he would enjoy taking his guests out on a ride in the cars. He would often joke with them by taking them into a lake in the car and informing them that he cannot turn around as his brakes had failed. That’s when I also wanted the car. I was fascinated with it,” he said. 
“And one day I happened to see the very vehicle at the house of another collector of vintage and classic cars, my friend Imad Samad. Often after that when I would visit him, I would be looking at the car longingly. Then one day, Imad Bhai asked me if I would be interested in buying it from him since I was obviously quite crazy about it. I didn’t waste a moment in taking it off his hands then,” said Nayyer. 
“That was in 2011. The heavy rains when water entered the homes of people happened in Karachi was in 2020. ‘Necessity is the mother of invention’. My fascination with the Amphicar turned into a need after my home at Khayaban-i-Tanzeem in DHA Phase-V got flooded.
“Right now if I bring this car out, it, too, will get flooded and sink like a broken boat because with time it’s seals have opened. To make my Amphicar roadworthy again I need to travel abroad to buy new parts for it. The company that had manufactured it is closed now but I know of others dedicated in making spare parts for it to this day.
“Due to the serious Covid-19 situation in 2020 and 2021, I was unable to travel abroad, but I’m determined to do it now,” he said.
Speaking to Dawn, the Amphicar’s first owner, Imad Samad, another lover of classic cars and a member of the Vintage and Classic Cars Club of Pakistan, said that he had bought the car in 1993 from the late Adnan Bhabha, son of Yusuf Bhabha, who owned Intercontinental Motors in Saddar, near Fawara Chowk.
“There were a few Amphicars there gathering dust at the time and most of them were left-hand drive. There are only 103 right-hand drive Amphicars in the world and this one is numbered 099, so it is quite a rare model. It is a 770 Amphicar, model 1966. Though production of the car had stopped in 1965 due to lack of demand it was distributed in the market till 1968,” he said.
After buying the Amphicar from Bhabha, Samad restored it. “It was a regular delight for onlookers when I would drive it around in the creek waters around the DHA Marina Club in Phase-VIII. We would receive standing ovations,” he shared fondly.
“Now the same will happen when Nayyer brings it out on the flooded roads of Karachi,” he smiles.

5,Just another rainy day in Karachi,Architect Arif Hasan calls for a surface water drainage system in city,"KARACHI: Should Karachiites stop complaining about the havoc that monsoons wreak across Karachi? It has become almost a customary exercise now that every time torrential rains paralyse the city, hullabaloo is caused on social and mainstream media, government functionaries come out with some machines to drain the water off the roads, have their pictures and views taken, and after two or three days all is forgotten conveniently. 
This time around things do not appear to be that straightforward: civic shortcomings are further deepening the cavernous fault lines that already exist in society. Anyone who can’t see these fault lines is either callous or in denial. Somewhat luckily, July 24 was a Sunday; a vast majority of people were in their homes when the rains came down with ferociousness, clogging almost every street and alleyway in the city by the sea. 
The provincial government, pre-empting the next day’s situation keeping weather reports in mind, declared Monday a public holiday for Karachi and Hyderabad divisions, which begs the following question: if they can anticipate inclement weather, can’t they be proactive in not letting rainwater accumulate on the roads and streets where it usually does every year? 
Interestingly, the scenes around Governor House and Chief Minister House were evidence enough to suggest that measures should be taken on a war-footing basis before the submerged roads could cause irreparable damage. Sadly, year after year, lessons are not learnt, as if the monsoon season is that part of our collective history from which we can learn nothing. 

Architect Arif Hasan calls for a surface water drainage system in city

Speaking of history, after the British conquered Sindh in the early 1840s, they were the ones who tapped into the urban potential of this area, which back then was a small fishing village. So they took all the measures required for proper town planning. Their striking achievement was, however, the awe-inspiring buildings that they constructed. But they did put in place a worthy sewage system, too. What about drainage, though? 
Talking to Dawn on Monday, architect Arif Hasan said, “There was a sewage system in those days but the drainage system was not that extensive… kahin kahin tha. There would be open drains on both sides of a road from where sewage and rainwater would drop into a nullah.” 
Asked what the British would have done had they been here in the 21st century, the eminent architect replied they would have to make a surface water drainage system to keep things in check. 
Given that revisiting the past would not be a plausible idea because at the time there was no or little danger for the city to burst at the seams with population, today Karachi is demographically an extremely challenging piece of land to administer. And that’s precisely the point that the authorities need to take into consideration. Instead of paying excessive attention to social media trends (which are pretty important), they should seriously do some planning to make the city liveable according to its demographic necessities. Otherwise, political fault lines will hurt the politicians more than anyone else.

The new features include popular feed, keyword mute, reset and dispersion.
The “popular feed” would have a non-personalised feed of popular content appr­o­priate for people aged 13 and older. “Keyword mute” would filter content with specified words or hashtags from ‘For You’ feeds. The “reset” option would allow users to reset their ‘For You’ feed if their recommendations don’t quite feel like they’re for them anymore. And, the “dispersion” feature would expand TikTok’s tests to diversify and safeguard recommendations globally.
The entertainment platform also plans to introduce a content classification system known as ‘Content Levels’, which classifies content that is commonly used by entertainment companies to identify how mature content is for audiences of different ages or with different tolerances of comfort for some themes.
This system will add an additional layer of protection by classifying content that has passed through moderation.
“When the platform detects that a video contains mature or complex themes, for example, fictional scenes that may be too frightening or intense for younger audiences, a maturity score will be allocated to the video to help prevent those under 18 from viewing it across the TikTok experience,” the company announced.

7,Five suspects indicted for raping woman on Karachi-bound train,All of them pleaded not guilty and opted to contest the case.,"KARACHI: A sessions court has indicted five employees of a privately-run train for subjecting a female passenger to gang rape and filming the sexual assault.
A train manager and four ticket checkers of Bahaudin Zakaria Express have been charged with sexually abusing the 25-year-old victim, who was travelling from Multan to Karachi on the night between May 27 and 28.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (South) Ashraf Hussain read out the charges to the accused. Three detained men were produced from prison while two others appeared on bail.
All of them pleaded not guilty and opted to contest the case. Therefore, the judge summoned the witnesses of prosecution to appear on August 1 to record their testimonies against the accused persons.
Last month, a judicial magistrate had accepted an investigation report filed by the investigating officer under Section 173 (police officer report) of the criminal procedure code (CrPC).
The IO, Inspector Habibullah Khattak, had charge-sheeted four accused for allegedly sexually abusing the woman. The fifth accused was chargesheeted for allegedly aiding and abetting the crime and attempting to conceal the evidence.
According to the prosecution, the 25-year-old woman was raped while she was travelling alone in the economy class on the night between May 27 and 28. The incident took place when the ticket checker offered her a seat in the air-conditioned compartment of the Multan-Karachi train, where he, along with other train employees, subjected her to a sexual assault, it added.
The investigation report alleged that the accused also made a video of the victim to blackmail her or take monetary benefits by using it.
It was only after a local daily published a report about the alleged sexual abuse that the police contacted the woman and lodged an FIR on her complaint.
The IO concluded in the investigation report that in the light of circumstantial, forensic and medical evidence, as well as statements of the witnesses, it had been proved that the accused raped her one after another.
He claimed that their DNA samples had also matched with those of the victim, confirming their involvement in the offence. 
The IO listed as many as 67 witnesses, including doctors, a judicial magistrate, trains guards, other staffers and officials. He added that the victim had also identified the trio before a judicial magistrate, who had also recorded her statement under Section 164 (power to record statements and confessions) of the CrPC, wherein, she rightly picked out them as the accused who had subjected her to sexual assault.
A case was registered under Sections 376 (punishment for rape) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Pakistan Railways City police station on the complaint of the victim.

8,SHC allows Fazaia Housing Scheme builder to travel abroad for treatment,Order says builder has paid over Rs15bn to affectees and Rs462m claim is still pending,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has allowed the builder of the Fazaia Housing Scheme to travel aboard for treatment.
The SHC also directed Tanveer Ahmed of M/s Maxim Properties to execute a personal bond of Rs2 million before the nazir of the court.
The applicant, through his lawyer, moved the SHC seeking permission to visit the United States for treatment of his heart and kidney ailments between Aug 1 and Oct 15.
The counsel argued that the applicant had never breached the terms and always returned to the country within stipulated time.

Order says builder has paid over Rs15bn to affectees and Rs462m claim is still pending

A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro observed that the matter was at the investigation stage and a settlement process was going on.
“More than Rs15 billion has been given to the affectees as confirmed by the investigating officer and special prosecutor of National Accountability Bureau while a claim of Rs462 million is still pending, but the security filed by the applicant with NAB worth more than Rs2 billion was lying and as and when claimants file applications for compensation, the claim would be satisfied from the said amount,” it added.
The bench in its order stated that in view of such facts, the special prosecutor for NAB and IO had submitted that any appropriate order might be passed.
“Accordingly, in view of what has been stated above, the application is allowed and respondent No.2 [Tanveer Ahmed] is permitted to travel to USA from the period mentioned above,” it added.
In May 2020, the SHC had allowed the Directorate of Estate Projects, Pakistan Air Force, and builders to settle all the liabilities of the Fazaia Housing Scheme and refund the amount to the allottees within six months.
While releasing the builders, the SHC had also directed the NAB chairman to suspend the investigation into this matter and supervise and facilitate both sides to fulfil their agreements and ensure that all the affected people were paid in full within the shortest period of time.
The builders — Tanveer Ahmed and Bilal Tanveer — had entered into a joint venture agreement with the PAF directorate in 2015 to create the Fazaia Housing Scheme, Karachi and members of the public were given an opportunity to apply for plots. 
A large number of people paid substantial amounts in respect of such plots. However, in January 2020, NAB had arrested the builders for allegedly depriving the public of around Rs13bn through investments in the scheme.

They said that over 30,000 wheat bags had been stocked in the silos of food department in the town for onward delivery to flour mills weeks before it had started raining in the area.  
There has been no official word on why the stocks were not timely delivered to mills or traders. 
Food inspector Abdul Majeed Bhayo, when contacted, claimed that the officials concerned of the department had repeatedly been written for the lifting of the stocks but without any response.  
He said rainwater had now made its way into the solos and might have destroyed several thousand wheat bags worth millions of rupees. He attributed the feared losses to the failure of the officials concerned in shifting the stocks to their buyers or would-be buyers on time. 
He said the stocks had been kept in the silos owing to the delayed procurement of wheat crop. 
Mr Bhayo said that an exact number of damaged wheat bags could not be ascertained as those lying in the bottom of the piles had been submerged in rainwater and could be counted only when many thousand other bags were removed from above them.

12,Torrents from Taunsa push up water level at Guddu,"Barrage to remain in low flood for some days, says official","HYDERABAD: Guddu Barrage attained low flood level on Monday evening with an upstream discharge of 276,472 cusecs and downstream discharge of 261,959 cusecs.
The barrage is said to be receiving flush waters of Taunsa Barrage downstream where downpour is reported to have lashed Koh-i-Suleman range, according to a Sukkur Barrage official. He said that these were torrents’ water reaching Taunsa and then Guddu barrages.
He believed that present water flows entering Indus River from different sources would finally reach Guddu first. “Guddu Barrage will maintain low flood level for a few days,” said the official, Aziz Soomro.
Sukkur Barrage reported a flow of 181,780 cusecs upstream and 160,770 cusecs downstream while Kotri Barrage reported 94,505 cusecs upstream and 93,305 cusecs downstream. “Flows from Sutlej river are around 11,000 cusecs [at Islam] and then 21,642 cusecs flows from Sedhnai barrage, 77,789 cusecs flows from Trimmu barrage and around 50,000 cusecs discharge will be reported at Panjnad barrage. Subsequently, all these flows will join at Chachran and will then head for Guddu barrage to enter Sindh,” said the official.

Barrage to remain in low flood for some days, says official

His assessment was that Guddu barrage might be having around 300,000 cusecs flows in the next 48 hours in view of these anticipated flows. “Sukkur barrage’s left bank chief engineer Sardar Ali Shah has closed left bank canals of Khairpur Feeder East, Khairpur Feeder West and Rohri canals,” he said, and added that discharge in Dadu canal had reduced.
Nara canal is also getting reduced flows only to fill Chotiari reservoir in Sanghar district. Storage in Tarbela increased by another 4 feet, rising from 1,507 feet on July 24 to 1,511 feet on at 6am today (July 25). Inflows in the Tarbela Dam are constantly increasing.
Sukkur Barrage’s chief engineer (left bank canals) has also deputed staff at the main left bank dyke after canals remained either closed or levels dropped. 
Breaches in dykes
Minor rain-related breaches in canals and distributaries were also reported. Rohri canal superintending engineer Zaheer Memon told Dawn over phone that due to a ‘river action’ T-spur of the Sadhiyon Matiari (SM) bund near Bhanote (Hala) in Matiari district was damaged at 135/7-mile location of the main bund.
“The river had changed its course and directly hit this part of the T-spur,” he said, and added that stones were being dumped and this work would continue for a few days because river’s main current had damaged apron and stone pitching of the spur. The Matiari deputy commissioner also visited the spot.
Sedimentation removal at Chashma
Meanwhile, Wapda on Monday requested the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) to allow it to carry out sedimentation removal operation at Chashma reservoir. Wapda’s chief engineer and project director Gohar Zaman Bhabha said: “It is informed by Irsa that due to filling constraint at Tarbela Dam surplus water flows are expected at Chashma Barrage in due course of time. Monsoon rain spell is continuing at present in large parts of the country and expected to continue for some time”.
He mentioned that availing this opportunity the project office would like to utilise surplus water/flood flows for effective removal of sedimentation from Chashma reservoir. He hoped that Irsa would allow this for executive subject activity, for enhancement of reservoir storage and flood routing capacity of the barrage in best national interest.
All three barrages in Sindh had experienced severe water shortage during Kharif season this year. Sindh did not get water against its allocated share and, similarly, Balochistan also did not gets its allocated share from Sukkur and Guddu barrages in the same period.
Now heavy rainfall has changed the water situation altogether, forcing the barrage authorities to reduce discharges into major canals to avoid breaches and also focus on flood-fighting at vulnerable points.

14,CM’s order ignored as officials deny Malala Raho her eyes back,"THATTA: The light, which had shone once after four long years of darkness in the life of six-year-old Malala Raho ...","THATTA: The light, which had shone once after four long years of darkness in the life of six-year-old Malala Raho — who suffers from a complex visual disorder and lost her sight at the young age of two — went out again thanks to negligent officers who did not even care about chief minister’s special directives to provide treatment to the poor girl at government expenses.
The chief minister had taken notice of the girl’s helplessness and ordered the officers concerned of the health department to make arrangements for her treatment after her dejected father Nawaz Wadho, who was an skilled woodworker, had announced before media persons in Thatta on July 1 that he would commit self-immolation along with his family of seven if state, civil society and philanthropists did not help his daughter get back her vision. 
But unfortunately, according to Wadho, Sujawal DHO Ahmed Ali Palijo did not take the chief minister’s orders seriously. The officer was to make arrangements for sending Malala along with her parents to Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS), Jamshoro, to appear before a special team of ophthalmologists for a thorough examination but he handled it very irresponsibly, said Wadho.  
He said: “We were provided a ramshackle minivan to carry us to LUMHS on July 22 where Dr Maria Memon and Dr Bushra Baloch checked Malala and advised a fresh magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test in addition to other necessary eye tests but Dr Rashid Khoso, who had arrived from DHO Sujawal’s office in his car, disputed the experts’ advice after consulting with DHO Palijo on his cell phone, and refused to get the tests done.” 
He disclosed to Dawn that he knew it because he had accidentally overheard Dr Khoso’s conversation with the DHO at a private laboratory in Hyderabad where they were brought to have the tests. 
Dr Khoso briefed the DHO about the tests and the total cost they would incur and then told the family in a dismissive manner to return to their village without communicating to them the patient’s condition and the treatment plan to be followed from then on, he said.
He said that Dr Khoso rushed back to his hometown Mirpurkhas leaving them at the mercy of the van driver, who was supposed to take them back to their village, Gul Mohammad Raho, in Mirpur Bathoro taluka, 92 kilometres from Hyderabad.  
He said that halfway through the journey the driver parked the van on the roadside and asked them to leave on the pretext that the vehicle had developed some fault. Hungry and tired as the family had not even 
been given anything to eat throughout the day, Wadho and his wife Basra started walking on foot under rain, lightning and thunderstorm taking turns to carry Malala on their shoulders, he said. 
They walked nine kilometres before a sympathetic pickup driver gave them a lift and dropped them at Bathoro stop, two and a half kilometres from their village, he said.  
He said that finally their ordeal came to an end as they reached the village at midnight after having walked more than 11 kilometres on foot.
The heartbroken Wadho appealed to Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah to direct some honest and God-fearing officers to help her blind daughter and take notice of the negligent functionaries who had not taken his orders seriously.
