0,Gas prices for export-oriented sectors increased by up to 82pc,ECC fixes electricity rates for five sectors at 9 cents per unit from August 1.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Monday increased for the export industry the price of imported and domestic gas by over 38 per cent and 82pc, respectively, and protected power rates at 9 cents per unit for 11 months effective Aug 1.
The meeting of the ECC presided over by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail was attended by its members — Commerce Minister Naveed Qamar and Industries & Production Minister Syed Murtaza Mehmood — besides former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Defence Minister Khwaja Asif, Power Minister Khurram Dastgir Khan, state ministers for finance and petroleum Dr Aisha Ghous Pasha and Musadik Malik, respectively.
The ECC “approved RLNG rate at $9 per mmBtu, all-inclusive to five export-oriented sectors across Pakistan for existing gas connections,” said an official statement, adding the ECC also recommended to the federal cabinet to raise the tariff of indigenous gas for export-oriented sectors at Rs1,350 per mmBtu and general industry at Rs1,550 per mmBtu. This will mostly apply in Sindh where the current price for export and general industry stands at Rs820 and Rs853 per mmBtu, respectively, showing an increase of almost 65pc and 82pc.
The RLNG to five export sectors — jute, leather, carpet, surgical and sports goods — is currently being supplied at $6.5 per mmBtu. The increase, thus, works out at about 38.5pc. A subsidy cover of Rs40bn for RLNG has been allocated under the federal budget 2022-23 which will be reviewed quarterly.

ECC fixes electricity rates for five sectors at 9 cents from Aug 1

The ECC also approved the electricity rate at US cents 9 per kWh to five export-oriented sectors from Aug 1 subject to Rs20bn subsidy provided by the Finance Division in the budget, quarterly review of the subsidy and provision of a list by the Petroleum Division of industrial units getting subsidised gas and electricity, within one month to the ECC for review.
The meeting was informed that regionally competitive energy rates had been finalised in consultation with commerce, energy and finance ministries and the export sectors to continue the supply of electricity at a final all-inclusive rate of US cents 9 per unit to five export-oriented sectors.
Secondly, the imported and regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) would be provided to these sectors at $9 per mmBtu (also all-inclusive) instead of $6.5 per unit at present, from July 1 to June 30, 2023 across Pakistan without any disparity. As such, the RLNG would also be provided to consumers of Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) on the same concessionary tariff as that of Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) consumers of five export sectors. At present, there is a restriction on new industrial gas connections due to a shortage of natural gas.
The case for fixed energy prices for the export industry was earlier finalised at a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. It has been accepted at the policy level that regionally competitive rates had provided a launching pad to the export sector to achieve a historically high level of $32bn in 2021-22, showing an increase of almost 26pc over 2020-21, hence the continuation of fixed rates for the current year and regionally competitive rates throughout the 2020-25 Textile & Apparel Policy to maintain the export momentum.
For the time being, only 50mmcfd gas will be supplied to captive power plants (CPPs) of export-oriented sectors on the SNGPL network till the time supply-related issues arising out of the tight international market get settled. The textile industry agreed that its CPPs in Punjab using local gas primarily for power generation would be shifted to the national grid. However, it would be important for the gas and power companies to ensure uninterrupted supply and reliability of grid electricity and sort out issues of new connections, load enhancement and transmission and distribution in the first place.
The sources said the commerce ministry’s summary for the gradual removal of the ban on luxury and non-essential imports could not make it to the ECC’s agenda due to limited time for consultations as authorities wanted to wait until the next meeting of the committee for foreign inflows to come in before opening up a free outflow of foreign exchange amid limited reserves.
The ECC also approved a supplementary grant of Rs750 million for the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for the 75th Independence Day celebrations. The meeting also approved the proposal of the Ministry of Interior for payment of compensation/goodwill package from its budget.

1,Oil payments create shortage of dollars in Pakistan,Bankers say an emergency should be declared to fix the balance of trade.,"KARACHI: The dollar has come under renewed pressure amid higher demand from importers.
The dollar rate appreciated Rs1.51 to Rs229.88 on Monday in interbank trading while the open market rate increased Rs2.50 to Rs231.50.
Bankers said the “import mafia” has practically drowned the national economy and is still insisting that more imports be allowed while the country is already on the brink of default.
“Emergency should be declared to fix the balance of trade. A 48-billion-dollar trade deficit in 2021-22 has eroded the country’s ability to make payments,” said a senior banker.
“There is no concern among the economic managers as to how the country will make payments for these imports. Dollar reserves of banks are already at rock bottom. Banks are unable to arrange dollars for imports,” he said.
“If the inflow of dollars comes within a week, the exchange rate will be in a comfortable zone. Otherwise, a more difficult situation is waiting for us,” said Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pak-Kuwait Development and Investment Company.
He said there is an acute shortage of dollars and yet the government spent $3.6bn for the import of petroleum products for the next two months. The payment is due within 30 days, he said. The huge outflow is causing dollar shortages as the banks are unable to arrange foreign exchange for imports.
“During a meeting last week, I asked Finance Minister Miftah Ismail to stop Afghan imports, which have created a huge trade deficit,” said Malik Bostan, chairman of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP). He added that Afghanistan has been hostile towards Pakistan as it increased coal prices by $200 per tonne when Pakistan expressed willingness to buy coal.
“Since the Taliban took charge of Afghanistan, we have to pay about $2bn per month for imports from Afghanistan,” said Mr Bostan. He noted that the dollar was at Rs157 in August 2021 and reserves of the State Bank were $20bn.
“The official dollar rate is not the actual rate. A grey market has emerged. One can buy dollars at higher rates from the grey market,” said Anwar Bhai, a currency dealer in Karachi.
To raise dollars, the federal government on July 22 passed an ordinance that allows it to sell national assets without any intervention from regulatory authorities.
The ordinance is yet to be signed by the president. The move shows the desperation of the government over its inability to stop the economy from looming default. Arab countries are demanding stakes in important national assets against dollars. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund is demanding that the country should first raise $4bn and then the Washington-based lender will disburse the $1bn tranche.

2,Gold at all-time high,Traders threaten to close down businesses and stage a sit-in following the government’s decision to impose a fixed income.,"KARACHI: Prices of 10-gram and one-tola gold reached an all-time high of Rs127,143 and Rs148,300 in the local market on Monday, showing a jump of Rs1,714 and Rs2,000 respectively.
Rates issued by the All Sindh Saraf Jewellers Association (ASSJA) mentioned a rise of only $2 per ounce to $1,730. But the domestic rates have been adjusted upwards owing to a record fall in the rupee’s value against the dollar, which traded at Rs229.88 in the interbank market on Monday.
On January 1, 2022, prices of 24-karat 10-gram and one-tola gold were Rs108,196 and Rs126,200, respectively, based on the world bullion rate of $1,830 per ounce. One dollar at the time was equal to Rs177.
Gold traders have threatened to close down their businesses and stage a sit-in following the government’s decision to impose a fixed income and sales tax of Rs40,000 on those retailers that have shops of 300 square feet or less irrespective of their electricity consumption, location and business size.
ASSJA President Haji Haroon Rasheed Chand said the fixed tax has created uncertainty among gold jewellers.
He said the threshold of 1,000 square feet of shop space has been maintained for general retailers. All general retailers, other than those belonging to Tier-1, will pay reduced fixed charges at Rs3,000-Rs10,000 as per their electricity consumption.
Mr Chand said shifting jewellers having shop space of more than 300 square feet to Tier-1 category is highly discriminatory as general traders below 1,000 square feet of shop space are not in Tier-1 category.

3,Automakers mull production shutdown as supply of parts dries out,Hold Rs189bn booking deposits of customers; assemblers face looming price increases due to rupee depreciation.,"KARACHI: Restrictions on the opening of letters of credit for parts import amid exchange rate volatility have caused unrest in the auto sector and one assembler has hinted at a production shutdown besides refunding bookings to the customers perturbed over late delivery issues.
While some assemblers have also opted for non-production days (NPDs) this month and in August because of the uncertain economic situation.
Assemblers have been facing severe problems in timely handing over the keys to their buyers due to delays in the arrival of imported parts and looming price increases due to rupee depreciation.
An official in Indus Motor Company (IMC) told Dawn that the production remained suspended from July 1 to 17  due to the non-arrival of parts and the long eid holidays. 

Hold Rs189bn booking deposits of customers

The company, he added, is planning NPDs from Aug 1-14 depending on the quota being negotiated with the State Bank of Pakistan for the imports of completely knocked-down (CKD) kits.
He said the company is considering paying back the amount to the buyers who had booked vehicles due to the company’s inability to hand over the vehicles on time or would ask the customers to wait for three more months and also pay the price difference due to change in rupee-dollar parity. 
IMC has already suspended the booking of vehicles from May 18 due to a volatile exchange rate and the non-opening of LCs.
Last week, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was informed that Rs189 billion was deposited by customers in advance with 10 auto assemblers, and IMC tops with Rs99.2bn followed by Rs35.4bn by Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL), Rs21.8bn by Honda Atlas Cars (HACL), Rs11bn by Master Changan Motors, Rs10.6bn by Kia Lucky Motor Corporation Ltd, Rs6.9bn by Hyundai Nishat Motors, Rs1.7bn by Al Haj Motors, Rs1.6bn by Ghandhara Nissan Motors, Rs0.7bn by Sazgar Engineering Works and Rs0.3bn by Regal Automobile Industries. 
An automaker, who attended the PAC meeting, said the government had asked the assemblers if they could not deliver the vehicles on time then why they are taking a huge number of bookings from the customers.
On the contrary, the companies had been mercilessly passing on the impact of the rising dollar against the rupee. The delivery time of vehicles has been ranging from two months to 10 months in case a buyer books the vehicles whose bookings are open.
An official in Kia Lucky Motor Corporation Ltd (LMCL), who asked not to be named, said the company had opted for three to four NPDs in the current month besides shutting down the plant on Saturdays. He said the company plans to operate on a single shift in case the LC restrictions were not lifted.
An executive in Honda Atlas Cars Ltd said the company did one or two days of NPDs in the current month due to Eid holidays. The company is not planning any future NPDs or considering any booking closure. However, he added that the smooth flow of CKD kits is still an issue depending on the quota by the SBP.
Some quality issues are also going on. For instance, PSMCL’s website flashes a public notice regarding the service campaign of Alto’s fuel filler neck which was manufactured from 2019 to 2021. The company suspects that the neck fuel filler could burst with time and in the worst condition, it may be perforated.

6,Ghandhara Group CEO deplores practice of ‘own money’,Calls on govt to make regulatory changes to curb  this “illegal practice”.,"ISLAMABAD: Ahmed Kuli Khan Khattak, CEO of the Ghandhara Group, on Monday, deplored the practice of “own money” — a premium charged over and above the quoted  price of a vehicle for immediate delivery — terming it a a curse.  
Opposing the practice, he called on the government to make regulatory changes to curb  this “illegal practice”.
He was speaking to the media at the launch of Tiggo-8 Pro and Tiggo-4  Pro of Chery Automobiles Company Ltd, a Chinese automaker that has  entered the Pakistani market through a manufacturing and licensing  agreement with the Ghandhara Group.
The CEP said the middle class in the country was shrinking as the poor and the extremely well-off were growing in numbers.
“This is the key reason why the auto industry is launching more vehicles in the high-end category compared to low-cost cars,” said Mr Khattak, adding that the demand for motorcycles was increasing as two-wheelers served the needs of the low-income groups.
Mr Khattak said his company plans to initiate the manufacturing of components and parts in Pakistan and revealed that Ghandhara plans to invest about $10 million over the next four years.
The company launched the two SUVs in Karachi in March. However, the latest event in the federal capital was held to formally launch the two vehicles upcountry.
