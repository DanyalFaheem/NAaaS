0,OIC adopts 70-point Islamabad Declaration,"Qureshi says an OIC ministerial committee will work with other states to “go beyond resolutions” on Kashmir, “chart way forward”.","ISLAMABAD: The two-day meeting of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Council of Foreign Ministers ended on Wednesday with affirmation of support for Palestine and Jammu and Kashmir disputes.
OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha, while speaking at a media conference at the end of the 48th meeting of the 57-member body, said: “Palestine remains high on the agenda of OIC and was discussed thoroughly. All participating ministers reiterated their support for the Palestine cause.
“The question of Jammu and Kashmir was thoroughly discussed. This is a just cause. It has our full support. The conference reaffirmed our stance and reiterated support for the right of Kashmiri people to self-determination.”
Forty-six countries participated in the moot at the ministerial level, while the other countries were represented by senior officials. Nearly 800 delegates attended the meeting hosted by Islamabad. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was the special guest at the conference. It was the first time in OIC’s history that a Chinese foreign minister attended its foreign ministers’ meeting, indicating Beijing’s expanding role in the Muslim world.
The meeting agenda included deliberations on the situation in Palestine, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and Afghanistan. Also, issues pertaining to Africa and Muslims in Europe and developments in Yemen, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Syria were taken up at the meeting. Islamophobia, international terrorism and cooperation in economic, cultural, social, humanitarian, and scientific domains were the other subjects that were discussed.
Islamabad Declaration
A wide-ranging Islamabad Declaration containing as many as 70 points was adopted at the meeting by the conference.
Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while speaking at the conference, said Palestine and Kashmir were two glaring examples of injustice, oppression, occupation, and human rights violations.
Mr Qureshi said a ministerial committee of OIC would work with other states to “go beyond resolutions” on Kashmir and “chart the way forward”. An action plan will also be formulated in this regard, according to him.
He said the OIC Contact Group on Occupied Kashmir decided that its members would meet more frequently to coordinate their positions on the dispute and monitor human rights violations. “We have a clear plan of action (on Kashmir) for the members of contact group, the secretary general, the secretariat, the special envoy, and the OIC independent permanent human rights commission,” he maintained.
Islamabad Declaration renewed solidarity with the people of Kashmir and expressed full support for their inalienable right to self-determination. It, moreover, condemned the human rights violations in the IIOJK and rejected India’s illegal and unilateral actions related to Kashmir since August 5, 2019.
“We declare that the final settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions is indispensable for durable peace in South Asia. We reiterate our call on India to: a) reverse its unilateral and illegal measures instituted since 5th August 2019; b) cease its oppression and human rights violations against the Kashmiris in IIOJK; c) halt and reverse attempts to alter the demographic structure and to redraw electoral constituencies in IIOJK; and d) take concrete and meaningful steps for full implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir,” the OIC participants stated in the Islamabad Declaration.
Indian missile fiasco 
The OIC foreign ministers also expressed concern over Indian missile striking a building in Pakistani territory on March 9 and put their weight behind Pakistan’s demand for a joint probe with to accurately establish facts.
“We acknowledge Pakistan’s pivotal role as an anchor of stability in South Asia, and commend its role and efforts for promotion of regional peace, based on the UN Charter principles including sovereign equality of States, political independence, non-use or threat of use of force and pacific settlement of disputes,” the foreign ministers noted.
Mr Qureshi said the participation of Chinese foreign minister indicated Beijing’s desire to expand ties with Muslim countries and its willingness to invest about $400 million in Muslim countries under its Belt and Road Initiative.

1,Govt fails to convince IMF over amnesty scheme,Sources say the IMF has raised questions about the impact of relief measures announced by the govt and their financing guarantees.,"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is not convinced with the government’s justifications for a recently announced amnesty scheme and has doubts over the financial impact and financing sources of the prime minister’s relief package on electricity and petroleum prices.
As a result, the Fund’s mission and the government authorities are unlikely to conclude the ongoing seventh review of the $6 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) shortly and may lead to the disbursement of about $1.9bn worth of two tranches close to the federal budget due in June, depending on the outcome of a no-confidence motion against the prime minister.
Informed sources told Dawn that during the final round of policy-level talks with Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin, the IMF staff mission raised more questions on the estimated impact of relief measures announced by the government and their financing guarantees.
The mission was completely dissatisfied with the arguments advanced in favour of the money-whitening scheme for the industrial sector.

Ongoing seventh review of $6bn loan programme unlikely to conclude anytime soon  

“You had written and signed a memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) that there would be no more amnesty scheme,” a source said, paraphrasing the IMF side as telling the Pakistani team led by the finance minister.
The Fund is critical of the third tax amnesty scheme introduced by the government despite a recent withdrawal of tax distortions by removing GST exemptions as part of the mini-budget agreed under the sixth review, which led to the revival of the EFF after a nine-month suspension and then disbursement of over a $1bn instalment.
“We also reaffirm our commitment to not granting further tax amnesties (continuous structural benchmark) and avoiding the practice of issuing new preferential tax treatments or exemptions,” said the written undertaking given by Finance Minister Tarin and State Bank Governor Dr Reza Baqir.
The sources said the IMF mission had worked out their own numbers on the financial impact that was quite higher than estimates and data provided by the government authorities. The Fund’s mission is reported to have privately met some stakeholders in the energy sector, including refineries and oil companies, and had gathered a different set of data.
Mr Tarin said on Sunday that the IMF had sought agreements with the provinces for sharing the financial burden of the relief package and project details, which would be shared on Monday and then he would wind up policy-level discussions on Tuesday.
The minister did not respond to calls for comments. The IMF side also avoids direct comment.
The Pakistani side insisted that all end-December 2021 targets needed for the seventh review had been met and there was no reason for the review to be kept incomplete. However, the IMF team appeared to be evasive on concluding the review before the political dust settled sometime next week on the completion the no-confidence motion against Mr Khan, the sources said.
The time would then be very close to the IMF-World Bank spring meetings starting April 18, during which time a board meeting with the Pakistani side could not be arranged.
By the first week of June, the time for the eighth review would become due and therefore both reviews involving $950 million each could be merged and major policy actions could be pushed through the next year’s budget.
The sources said the authorities were also not that hard-pressed after the rollover of $4.24bn loans by Chinese banks that were due for payment on March 23 ($2bn) and March 25 ($2.24bn). The rollover coupled with a reduction in the current account deficit last month, expected operationalisation of Saudi oil facility next week and lower oil prices could sustain the reserves position in the short term amid political uncertainty.
Besides questions over the financing of the prime minister’s relief package, the IMF mission also has concerns over the growth prospects in view of a major cut in the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP). It wanted to know precise project details that would be affected by the PSDP cut and wanted expenditure control should not affect social sector spending.
Talks were originally targeted to be completed by March 14 but were extended as differences remained.
The talks on the seventh review of the $6bn Extended Fund Facility started on March 4. The Fund had been concerned over the “one step forward, two steps back” approach of the government on critical reforms having serious budget implications going forward.
There are three critical areas, including tax amnesty, untargeted subsidy on petroleum products and general subsidy on electricity rates. These are estimated to drive the primary budget account — the gap between revenues and expenditures minus debt servicing — from a targeted Rs25bn in surplus to about Rs650bn in deficit by end-June, when the current fiscal year ends.
Pakistan has so far received little over $3bn out of $6bn worth of 39-month IMF programme. The Fund earlier expressed concern over expansionary policies adopted in the 2021-22 federal budget, which it said had created fiscal imbalances, leading to the introduction of mini-budget in December to address these slippages.
After initial compliance with the commitments to increase the petroleum levy, Prime Minister Khan reversed the progress when he announced a Rs10 per litre reduction in petroleum products, bringing down the levy to zero, besides a cut in electricity rates by Rs5 per unit instead of scheduled increases agreed with the IMF to address the circular debt.
The 39-month IMF programme is scheduled to end in September.

2,Confident Imran says ‘will have last laugh’,Says he has many options that would be made public a day or two before voting on the no-trust move takes place.,"ISLAMABAD: Beaming with confidence, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday predicted he would prevail over the opposition’s no-confidence move and definitely would have the last laugh, announcing that he still held a ‘trump card’ that would be revealed at the right time. 
“Let me predict in clear terms that we will succeed in the no-confidence motion because the entire party and our workers are standing with us like a rock and even the debate raging on the menace of corruption and horse-trading has become a topic of household discussion,” the premier said while talking to a group of reporters at his office at the picturesque Prime Minister House. 
The prime minister was accompanied by Attorney General for Pakistan Khalid Jawed Khan, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, Parliamentary Affairs Adviser Dr Babar Awan, Special Assistant Shahbaz Gill, senior lawyer Chaudhry Faisal Hussain and others. 
Why PPP chairperson and then prime minister Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, despite having at least 33 per cent vote bank in national politics, was removed in 1996, PM Khan questioned before asserting that it was because the “people were not with her” at that crucial time. 

Claims opposition leaders have no idea they are ‘about to be swept away’; Fazl termed ‘twelfth man’  

With the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), however, it was an altogether different story, as its workers firmly stood with their leaders. Rather, more and more people were joining the party ranks, the premier said, adding that no ‘political animal’ could withstand such public opinion. 
Attired in a traditional white shalwar suit with red rosary in his right hand, PM Khan recalled how the 1992 Pakistani cricket team, despite being the weakest, managed to clinch the world cup just because its captain was confident about victory from the very beginning. He said the opposition, under intense pressure, had exposed all their cards ahead of time, but nobody was aware what the government had in store for them. 
The PM acknowledged that ruling party lawmakers were “openly being lured in” or “threatened” to desert the PTI-led government, but without elaborating upon his ‘trump card’, the PM said he had many options that would be made public a day or two before the voting. 
He said the ever-rising tide of public opinion in his favour would scale up further on March 27 when the PTI government would stage the biggest-ever public rally in Islamabad. He said the government’s allies were also closely gauging the tide. He warned all lawmakers that it would be very difficult to face the public wrath, whosoever would go against the government. 
A strong military
About the use of the word ‘neutral’ in his speech, PM Khan clarified that it was totally misconstrued because he meant to ask how one who enjoins the good and forbids the wrong could ‘remain aloof and impartial’ in society. 
He was very bitter over the malicious campaign against national institutions, especially the army, saying the history of meddling into political affairs was not good but it was unfortunate that the institution had to face the onslaught sometimes in the shape of the Memogatescandal, among others. 
“A strong army is the need of the hour,” the PM said. While citing the condition of some Muslim states, he said Pakistan was surviving only because of the powerful armed forces, otherwise, the country could have disintegrated into three. 
“One should not malign the institution of army only to serve their political interest, especially at a time when we have an intolerant neighbour ruled by bigoted BJP and RSS,” he added. 
Asked if he would resign before the vote on no-trust motion, the PM wondered why he should quit. “Should I resign due to the pressure of these ‘thieves’,” he said, adding the fight had just begun. He recalled his 25-year struggle to challenge the mafia and expressed the hope that their politics of ‘loot and plunder’ of the national wealth would soon end. “The crooked politicians were only puppets and dancing to the tune of others,” he remarked. 
Whosoever believed that Imran Khan would sit idle if voted out of power lived in a fool’s paradise, he said.  
12th man
Shrugging off the idea of sitting with Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif, PM Khan said he would not sit with a ‘thief’. He then described JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman as the ‘12th player’ in a cricket team, saying time had come when he would be out. 
About former minister Chaudhry Nisar, PM Khan claimed he had 40-year-long association with him. He conceded that he met him a while ago and said he would respect whatever decision he made. 
The prime minister said the government had to move a reference before the Supreme Court to seek Article 63-A’s interpretation due to the inaction of relevant quarters over horse-trading during the Senate election, and the elections in Azad, Jammu and Kashmir, Khanewal and Lahore. 
Corruption was the brand name of ‘the three stooges’ and allegations of mega corruption were at their credit, the PM said, reiterating that bags full of money had reached Sindh House.  
Asked why his party members were openly venting their anger against the government, the PM said there was no parliamentary party in the world, except in the presidential form of governance, where there was no difference of opinion.

3,Law ministry bypassed in filing of presidential reference,Sources say the reference was drafted by the AGP and transmitted to the Parliamentary Affairs Division for completing formalities.,"ISLAMABAD: The law ministry has been bypassed in the filing of a presidential reference, seeking the interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution by the Supreme Court.  
Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan is of the view that since the reference pertains to Article 63, which is linked to the Elections Act, the relevant authority is the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs which has completed all the codal formalities.  
But legal experts and former government officials insist that it is the purview of the law ministry.  
Sources in the law ministry pointed out that the presidential reference sought “interpretation of Article 63-A in a manner that Khiyanat by way of defections warrant no preemptive action save de-seating the member as per the prescribed procedure with no further restriction or curbs from seeking election afresh”, and Article 63-A, which itself was an explanation of Article 63, was a subject of the law ministry.  
The sources said the law ministry was kept in the dark on this particular issue since it had objected to proposal to promulgate an ordinance to disqualify the PTI dissidents planning to vote on the no-confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan.  
The law ministry is of the view that explanation of Article 63 (1) (P) pertaining to disqualification of members of the national and provincial assemblies is obvious as it states: “For the purposes of this paragraph ‘law’ shall not include an ordinance promulgated under Article 89 or Article 128.”  
It meant a lawmaker could not be disqualified through the presidential ordinance, the sources said, adding that the law ministry was asked to review the objection and draft a ‘vague’ ordinance to deter the dissidents, but “the ministry did not cooperate”.  
Subsequently, the law ministry was kept out of further consultation vis-à-vis filing of the presidential ordinance and its input was not sought even on the issue of National Assembly session requisitioned by the opposition in connection with the no-confidence motion against the prime minister.  
According to well-placed sources, the presidential reference was drafted by the attorney general and transmitted to the Parliamentary Affairs Division for completing the formalities and, after slight changes, Adviser to Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan submitted it to the Cabinet Division under Sub-Section ‘e’ of Section 16 of the Rules of Business of 1973.  
The section defines the cases to be brought before the federal cabinet and its sub-section refers to “a reference to the Supreme Court for advice on a question of law under clause (1) of Article 186”.  
As per Section 54 of Schedule V-B of the Rules of Business, it is the responsibility of the relevant division to deal with the “reference to Supreme Court on any question of law”.  
Former special assistant to the prime minister on bureaucracy Khawaja Zaheer Ahmed said that Section 14 (b) of the Constitution clearly stated that on the matters relating to interpretation of any law, every division had to consult the Law and Justice Division.  
The sources said the Parliamentary Affairs Division, however, forwarded a summary to the law secretary with an instruction for onward submission to the prime minister, hence, in this particular case, the law ministry was merely used as a post office.  
Former law minister Farooq H. Naek, when contacted, said that since Article 63-A was not part of the Elections Act, the presidential ordinance should have been prepared by the law ministry. He pointed out that the PPP government had in the past filed two references, including the one seeking revision of the conviction of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and both were initiated by the law ministry.  
Former attorney general Ashtar Ausaf told Dawn that it was the sole responsibility of the law ministry to prepare and file the reference.  
“In my considered view, whenever the opinion of the court is sought, on a reference by the president of Pakistan, the following ought to trigger: notices under Order XXVII-A need to be issued to all the advocates general; the elected representatives of the apex bars should also be put to notice; since there is no room for review of an opinion and finality is attached to it, the entire court should assemble and deliberate on the issues; and amicus briefs should also be invited,” he added.

4,Reports of allies switching sides send govt into frenzy,PM Imran tasks senior leaders with appeasing MQM; Tareen group denies being asked to withdraw demand for Punjab CM's removal.,"ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: Prime Minister Imran Khan was informed on Wednesday that the party’s allies have decided to side with the opposition on the no-confidence motion, after which the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) once again geared up its efforts to appease the annoyed coalition partners.
A delegation of PTI leaders met the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) as a last ditch effort to pacify the allied party.
A government source told Dawn that Prime Minister Khan was apprised in the PTI’s Political Committee meeting that their allies had decided to join the opposition camp and vote against him on the no-trust motion. On this, the PM dispatched senior PTI leaders to meet the heads of allied parties and assure them that their reservations would be addressed. He hoped the allies would return to the government and support him in the National Assembly on the voting day.

When contacted, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry claimed the next 48 hours were “quite crucial” when the political ambiguity would be cleared. He hoped that allies will not leave the prime minister’s side in this hour of need.

PM tasks senior leaders with appeasing MQM; Tareen group denies being asked to withdraw demand for CM’s removal

He further said PM Khan had directed the ruling party to stage the “country’s biggest” public meeting at Parade Ground on March 27 as a “show of power” before the vote on the no-confidence motion.

On the occasion, federal Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood, Industries Minister Khusro Bakhtiar and Defence Minister Pervaiz Khattak gave separate briefings on the arrangements they had made to bring people to the federal capital for the party’s power show from central Punjab, south Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, respectively.
The prime minister was quoted as saying: “It should be the biggest public meeting in the history of Pakistan,” he added.
On Tuesday, a federal minister, who did not want to be named, had claimed the government was in “real trouble” and it seemed impossible that their disgruntled MNAs would return to the party fold.
Later on Wednesday, a PTI delegation comprising National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser, Asad Umar and Pervaiz Khattak met MQM leaders and tried to appease them. Inside sources said the MQM did not offer any assurances to the ruling party, and said “the party has not yet decided which side to choose”.
However, the MQM leaders, including its chief Rauf Siddiqui and Federal Information Technology Minister Syed Aminul Haq, were of the view that the government had not listened to their advice and demands in over three years. Now, the time to address the MQM’s grievances was over, the source said.
The presence of the NA speaker in the meeting was noticed by many after he was widely criticised by the opposition parties for being partial towards the ruling party despite being the custodian of the House. 
Meanwhile, the prime minister continued meeting MNAs of the PTI and allied parties. On Wednesday, he met MNAs Aliya Hamza, Saira Bano and Amir Liaquat Hussain.
Speaker attempts to clear position
Later, the speaker tried to clear his position in a tweet, saying: “I as the custodian of the National Assembly of Pakistan will fulfil my constitutional obligations and will proceed in accordance with Article 95 of the Constitution & Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007.”

 





 
PM praises Covid team
Prime Minister Khan, in a tweet, also congratulated his team for effectively handling the Covid-19 pandemic in a way that led to the country recording the lowest unemployment rate in South Asia.
“I want to congratulate my government for the way we handled the Covid-19 pandemic – better than all the countries in South Asia,” he wrote.

 





 
The tweet came in response to a survey by South Asia Index, based on World Bank data, which showed Pakistan outranking other South Asian countries with the lowest unemployment rate.
The survey showed the rate of Pakistan’s unemployed population at 4.3 per cent, as compared to India’s 8pc, Maldives 6.3pc, Bangladesh 5.4pc, Sri Lanka 5.9pc, Bhutan 5pc and Nepal 4.7pc.
Murad Raas to meet Tareen group today
Meanwhile, the Jehangir Khan Tareen group expressed surprise over Punjab School Education Minister Murad Raas’s claims that he had met the disgruntled party members and was trying to convince them to drop their core demand of Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar’s removal.
“The Tareen group core committee members are not in Lahore and it came as a surprise to us to see news reports that a meeting took place with Murad Raas,” committee member Abdul Haye Dasti told Dawn on Wednesday.
Mr Dasti, however, said the core committee had indeed met Murad Raas a few days ago who was now supposed to present a report on whether the group’s concerns had been addressed or not. “Our next meeting with Mr Raas has been scheduled for Friday,” Mr Dasti stated.
The education minister’s spokesman had sent tickers from news channels to media houses, claiming that Mr Raas had met the Tareen group and tried to convince them to withdraw their “minus-Buzdar” demand.
When contacted, a member of the Jehangir Tareen clique claimed Murad Raas was getting jittery and had issued the statement as he was not being facilitated by the chief minister’s office for resolving the group’s concerns.
