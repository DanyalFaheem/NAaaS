0,Appointment of DCs as justices of peace stirs controversy,District judge claims judicial officers already exercising those powers.,"KHYBER: The recent move of the government to appoint deputy commissioners in tribal districts as ‘justice of peace’ has stirred a controversy as the district and session judge has questioned the same, stating that he had already been exercising the powers under Code of Criminal Procedure.
In this regard, the district and sessions judge, Hidayatullah Khan, has sent a letter to Khyber district police officer, clarifying the legal position in relation to powers of “justice of peace.”
Home and tribal affairs department had on March 14 issued a notification whereby the deputy commissioners of the seven tribal districts were appointed as ‘justice of peace’ under Section 22 of CrPC.
In reaction to the notification, the district judge has sent a letter to the DPO with the subject “clarification with respect to jurisdiction under Section 22-A CrPC.”
The judge stated that after merger of the erstwhile Fata including Khyber into the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the light of the 25th Amendment, all the federal and provincial laws had been extended thereto. “The district courts have been established in all newly merged districts including Khyber which are fully functional,” the letter stated.

District judge claims judicial officers already exercising those powers

It stated that Section 22-A of CrPC conferred jurisdiction upon justice of peace and Section 25 defined the district and session judges of the area as ex-officio ‘justice of peace’ in explicit terms and was implemented in its true sense in Khyber.
“I am therefore, to reiterate that since the above mentioned jurisdiction is being exercised by the courts of session in district Khyber in the true spirit of law, therefore, the exercise of similar jurisdiction by any executive authority would be coram non judice and void ab-initio,” said the letter.
It is pertinent to mention that the March 14 notification also stated that the justice of peace should exercise all such powers and perform such functions, as conferred upon them under Section 22-A and 22-B of Criminal Procedure 1989 in the local areas falling within the jurisdiction of their respective districts.
The notification also immediately attracted the ire of the tribal people, who termed it a reversal to the notorious Frontier Crimes Regulations under which the then political agents were enjoying unbridled powers while curbing the constitutional and legal rights of the tribal people.
They also accused bureaucracy of conspiring against the much desired merger of tribal areas into the province and demanded their accountability.
Legal experts are of the opinion that the notification was not only against the spirit of merger of tribal areas with the province but it was also against a Supreme Court’s ruling soon after the merger that no separate laws would be drafted for the merged and settled districts.
They said that the new notification regarding appointment of DCs was tantamount to creation of a parallel judicial or policing system in tribal districts. They said that under the new arrangement, the DC could order the SHO to register an FIR or make arrests at the whims of the district administration. “DCs in districts other than tribal districts don’t enjoy such powers” they added.

7,Shangla people complain votes shifted to other villages,SHANGLA: Some local residents have complained that their votes have been shifted to other village councils from ...,"SHANGLA: Some local residents have complained that their votes have been shifted to other village councils from their own areas.
They told journalists here on Wednesday that their votes were registered in other village councils so they would be unable to cast vote in favour of their desired candidates, contesting the local bodies’ elections from their original village councils.
Amir Khan said that he was a permanent resident of Butyal-1 village council. He said that he had cast his vote in Butyal-1 in the 2015 local government elections. He added that his vote was shifted to Butyal-II village council.
He said he wanted to vote for their family member, who was candidate for the polls, but misplacement of his vote snatched the opportunity from him. Fayaz Khan, a resident of Bisham, said that his vote was shifted to Batkto area, located several kilometres away from his village Butyal-II.
“I am unaware about this and no one has asked me about shifting my vote. It will deprive me of the right to vote for our local village council candidate,” he said.
Sharafat Ali, a candidate for village council seat, said that around 200 voters were shifted from the all three village councils of Butyal union council to Bisham.
He said that 20 to 30 votes of each village council of Bisham tehsil were shifted to other areas owing to which the voters would face problems. He said that they would have to travel to other village councils or would avoid voting in the local government elections.
Advocate Jamilur Rehman, a candidate for youth seat in Bisham, said that the votes of his six family members including his cousin Shafiq Yousafzai were shifted to other villages.
The voters in Shangla said Election Commission of Pakistan should take notice of the issue and shift back their votes to their village councils.

8,Women’s disenfranchisement feared in Battagram,Social activist insists women don’t cast vote in some areas due to local traditions,"BATTAGRAM: With the second phase of local body elections just a week away, some residents have feared the women’s disenfranchisement in conservative areas on March 31.
They said stopping women from exercising their right to vote was illegal and therefore, the relevant authorities should crack down on such restrictions.
Social activist Zakirullah told Dawn that in some areas, women didn’t step out to cast vote without the permission of male family members in line with the local traditions.
He said the women’s disenfranchisement also occurred to favour certain election candidates.

Social activist insists women don’t cast vote in some areas due to local traditions

Mr Zakirullah said in the past, candidates made an agreement to bar women voters in the PK-28 constituency, but no such agreements or restrictions were seen ahead of the March 31 local body polls.
He also said women didn’t cast vote in the 2019 by-election in Pazang VC prompting fresh polling four times in line with the election law.
The activist said under the law, re-polling would be carried out until the minimum number of women voters participated in the electoral exercise.
When contacted, district election commissioner Mohammad Aslam, who is also the district monitoring officer, claimed higher voter registrations in the district and attributed them to the campaigns carried out to highlight the importance of vote among residents.
He said the district election commission with the assistance of Nadra sent mobile registration vans to 110 of 353 blocks in the district, which recorded ‘dismally’ low turnout of women voters.
“Only four per cent of registered women cast vote in the 2013 general elections and 13 per cent in the 2018 elections, so their overall turnout remained very low,” he said.
Mr Aslam said the district had 258,155 voters, including 105,858 women, in the 2018 general elections but the number had gone up to 317,224, including 138,301 women, ahead of the local body elections.
“Bearing the local culture, traditions and norms as well as accessibility issues in mind, we established polling stations for women close to their houses to encourage more and more of them to exercise their right to vote,” he said.
He said he hoped that the voter turnout, especially women’s, would be higher in the local body elections compared with those recorded in the previous polls.
Mr Aslam said under the election law, if the turnout of women voters was less than 10 per cent of the total votes polled in a constituency, the Election Commission could presume that women voters have been restrained, and may declare polling at one or more polling stations or election in the whole constituency void.
He asked voters and candidates to encourage more and more women to take part in the electoral exercise.

11,Man gets bail in Malakand honour killing case,PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has granted bail to a man named in a Malakand honour killing case.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has granted bail to a man named in a Malakand honour killing case.
Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan of a single-member bench accepted the bail petition of the accused, Noorullah alias Noore, a resident of Peshawar, on the condition of furnishing two surety bonds of Rs300,000 each.
The honour killing incident had occurred in the jurisdiction of the Pul Chowki police station in Malakand area on Oct 27, 2020.
Tasleem, a woman, who was injured in the firing, was the complainant in the case. She had initially charged her brother, Nawab, and two unidentified people with killing her husband, Hassan Wali, and injuring her. She also named petitioner Noorullah and another accused, Asfandyar, in the FIR.
The complainant claimed that she was a resident of Peshawar and was engaged to Shakir but married her cousin, Hassan Wali, of her own free will to the annoyance of her family members.
She alleged that on the day of the firing incident, her brother, Nawab, had visited her residence along with two unidentified people and said he wanted to see her husband.
The woman added that the three men later sat down with her husband in a room of the house before she heard gunshots and when she entered the room, she found her husband to be in a pool of blood.
She alleged that the accused also fired at her causing several injuries.
Lawyer Said Hakeem appeared for the petitioner and insisted that his client was falsely implicated in the murder case.
He contended that initially, his client was not named in the FIR but the complainant later charged him committing the murder without any legal justification.
The counsel said that even the identification parade conducted by the police was doubtful as the complainant had declared therein that her younger brother had told her that the petitioner was also involved in the murder of her husband.
He wondered why the petitioner would kill the complainant’s husband when he was not even related to them.

He said that the district administration assured the Tesco that it would call a meeting of trader leaders and other major stakeholders from across the tribal district for the amicable resolution of the power meters issue.
The official said that the Tesco, which had earlier announced zero tolerance against the traders opposed to meter installation, accepted the administration’s request and agreed to restore power supply to trade centres without delay.
He said that power supply was restored in the main Khar bazaar three days ago and in trade centres of Inayat Kallay, Nawagai and Sadiqabad areas on Tuesday.
The traders of Khar and Inayat Kallay areas, which have the largest and second largest commercial centres in the district respectively, confirmed the restoration of electric supply.
They said that the power supply, which remained suspended for more than 17 days, was restored on Tuesday by the Tesco following the holding of protest demonstrations by the traders.

Station House Officer (SHO) Wajahat Kazmi confirmed to Dawn that Faizullah and Yousuf, residents of Ugi Battagram, were digging along the house of Manzoor Shah in Taami Gojra neighbourhood, which triggered a landslide in the adjacent mountain. 
Local residents, who were later joined by Rescue 1122 personnel, launched a rescue operation and retrieved their bodies after an effort of almost two hours.
Both bodies were later dispatched to their native area, SHO Kazmi said.
Expressing grief over the loss of lives, civil society activists said that government departments had turned a blind eye towards illegal cutting of mountain slopes in different neighbourhoods, notwithstanding the threat, the unlawful practice posed to the lives of labourers and passers-by.
“Influential people excavate mountain slopes with impunity to carve out residential and commercial plots even along main arteries, let alone less visited areas, but none among the government functionaries stops this unlawful practice fraught with threats not only to human beings but also the environment,” said Saeed Shah, a civil society activist.
