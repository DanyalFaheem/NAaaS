0,Pace bowling icon Waqar Younis inducted into PCB Hall of Fame,"“Playing for Pakistan was a dream come true and I still cherish every single moment of wearing the Pakistan colour,"" says Younis.","LAHORE: Former Pakistan captain and fast bowling icon Waqar Younis was on Wednesday formally inducted into the PCB Hall of Fame when he received his commemorative cap and plaque during the third Test between Pakistan and Australia here at the Gaddafi Stadium.
Known for his toe-crushing yorkers, Waqar is the eighth cricketer who received the Hall of Fame honour from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
Earlier, legendary players Fazal Mahmood, Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Abdul Qadir, Hanif Mohammad, Javed Miandad and Zaheer Abbas have been inducted into the Hall of Fame.
In an illustrious international career spanning over 13 years,  right-armer Waqar played 87 Tests to take 373 wickets at an impressive  average of 23.56 and claimed 416 scalps at 23.84 in 262 One-day  Inter­nationals. 

 





 
Speaking on the occasion of the induction, the 50-year-old Waqar credited her mother for the successes that he achieved in international cricket for Pakistan.
“I feel honoured to have been inducted into the PCB Hall of Fame with my mother and wife standing alongside me. In fact, it was an honour to receive the beautiful plaque from my mother, who has been my inspiration throughout this highly rewarding and immensely satisfying cricketing journey. Without her blessings, I would not have been able to achieve this much as a professional,” Waqar, who made his Test debut in 1989 against India at Karachi, said. 
“Playing for Pakistan was a dream come true and I still cherish every single moment of wearing the Pakistan colour. And to be awarded by the PCB with this honour 19 years after I last represented my country is just an icing on the cake, for which I amgrateful to them,” Waqar, who last represented Pakistan at the 2003 World Cup against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo, remarked.
Waqar continued, “It is indeed a very proud moment for me to be placed in the same category as Abdul Qadir, Fazal Mahmood, Hanif Mohammad, Imran Khan, Javed Miandad, Wasim Akram and Zaheer Abbas. These individuals are abso­lute legends of the game and their achievements and success stories are well documented.
“I would like to thank all the players I played with and against as well as all the support staff who contributed towards my accomplishments.”
In Tests, Waqar took 50 or more wickets against New Zealand (70), Zimbabwe (62), Sri Lanka (56), West Indies (55) and England (50). In ODIs, he took 84 wickets against Sri Lanka, followed by New Zealand (79), West Indies (60), South Africa (58), India (37), England (30), Australia (29) and Zimbabwe (23).

1,Cummins-Starc reverse swing show wrecks Pakistan in final session,"“We have given ourselves a really good opportunity [to win], in front of the game and hopefully we will bat well,"" says Cummins","LAHORE: Australia spectacularly demonstrated on Wednesday why they are world’s top-ranked Test team — which cruise when it really matters. Reverse swing was their primary tool at the Gaddafi Stadium as Pakistan batting wilted in the second half of the final session on day three of the third and final Test.
Reaching 227-3 in their first innings at tea as a solid-looking Babar Azam was joined by Fawad Alam, Pakistan were perhaps not fully prepared for what was coming their way from the right-left pace bowling duo of Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc who shared nine wickets between them.   
Right-armer Cummins brilliantly led from the front in denting the hosts’ batting picking up his seventh five-wicket haul — the first against Pakistan — in his 41st Test to halt and quickly end the innings at 268 with the able support of Starc, giving Australia a solid 123-run first innings lead. 
And the Australian skipper hoped the turnaround would help the tourists win the Test.
“I thought that we bowled really well. In the first two sessions we just didn’t get the reward, so the message was just hang in there,” Cummins, who claimed three of the last seven Pakistan wickets, stated.
“We have given ourselves a really good opportunity [to win], really in front of the game and hopefully we will bat well [in the second innings] and then take the last ten wickets,” the 28-year-old added.
Veteran left-armer Starc, who had taken just three wickets in the first two drawn Tests at Rawalpindi and Karachi, finally showed his class on Wednesday as the lanky pacer sent four Pakistanis back to the pavilion.
The left-armer later said reverse swing would be the key for Australia if they were to beat Pakistan in the series deciding Test.
“I don’t think this wicket helps the fast bowlers at all,” Starc said. “The wicket started out quite slow and dead and we’ve seen it shoot lower and lower as the days have gone on.
“The key is reverse swing and both teams have used that well. We’ve got to stay patient, it’s a hard slog, and things are going to happen quicker as the game goes on.”
Starting the day at 90-1, Pakistan in a cautious advance reached 159-1 with opener Abdullah Shafique (75) and experienced Azhar Ali (63) at the crease.
Seasoned off-spinner Nathan Lyon (1-95), in a tight and gruelling spell of 30 overs, claimed the first Pakistan wicket on Wednesday when he found the outside edge of Abdullah’s bat after lunch to end the 150-run stand.
Right-handed Abdullah has been in prime form in the series during which the batter scored his maiden Test century in the drawn Test in Rawalpindi before his enduring 96 in Karachi helped Pakistan force a draw while in pursuit of a mountainous 506-run target.
The 22-year-old resisted Australia with yet another solid 228-ball 81 studded with 11 fours before Lyon struck in the fifth over after lunch and successfully overturned umpire Aleem Dar’s not out decision through a TV referral.
Next to go in the post-lunch session was Azhar (78), with the second new ball only seven overs old, as the 37-year-old veteran was dismissed by Cummins who took a brilliant return catch to make it 214-3 for Pakistan. He batted for 337 minutes, striking seven boundaries and a six in his 35th Test half-century.
Starc, who bowled only two overs with the second new ball, returned in the final session to dislodge the off-stump of Fawad Alam (13) and Mohammad Rizwan (1) with Pakistan batters struggling to cope with reverse swing.
Pakistan’s long tail didn’t last long with captain Babar making a 67 off 131 balls with the help of six fours and a six.
Cummins accelerated the collapse by dismissing Sajid Khan, Nauman Ali and Hasan Ali within two overs.
Starc wrapped up Pakistan’s innings by trapping Babar lbw off a delivery which shaped into the skipper and then clean bowled No. 11 batter Naseem Shah off a fast full-pitched delivery.
Right-handed Azhar, in the 94th Test of his career and the first in his hometown of Lahore, became the fifth Pakistan batter to complete 7,000 runs in the five-day format of the game when he reached 74 by sweeping Lyon to deep square leg for a single.
Former Test captains Younis Khan (10,099, 118 Tests), Javed Miandad (8,832, 124), Inzamam-ul-Haq (8,829, 119) and Mohammad Yousuf (7,530, 90) are the other Pakistan batters to score more than 7,000 Test runs.
Azhar was happy to make the individual feat but was dejected he could not complete the job.
“I am happy at the achievement in Lahore but unfortunately I could not carry on,” said the batter after play ended.
“We had a collapse after tea which stranded our chances a little bit in the game but Test cricket is like that, up and down, but hopefully we will turn things around tomorrow.”
The player, however, gave full credit to the Australian bowlers.
“We always knew how good they are, especially Starc when it comes to reverse swing,” Azhar said. “Cummins is a top bowler in the world right now and he exploited the conditions, also featuring low-bounce pitch, very well ... they kept asking questions even to the set batters and unfortunately we were at the receiving end.”
According to Azhar, Pakistan for the Lahore Test picked fast bowler Hasan Ali instead of all-rounder Faheem Ashraf because it was decided that the regular batters would take the responsibility of scoring.

2,Babar Azam rises to fifth spot in ICC Test rankings after Karachi heroics,His match-saving knock in the second Test against Australia has pushed him to the fifth spot in the ICC rankings.,"DUBAI: Pakistan captain Babar Azam’s match-saving knock in the second Test against Australia has pushed to the fifth spot in the latest International Cricket Council (ICC) batter rankings.
The performance, which saw the 27-year-old score 196 runs off 425 deliveries over almost two days in the fourth innings against the visiting Aussies at the National Stadium, has earned Babar a gain of three spots.
Wicket-keeper/batter Mohammad Rizwan, who also scored an unbeaten hundred in the historic Test, has also taken a massive leap of six spots to be joint No. 11 with Australian opener David Warner.
Warner’s opening partner Khawaja, who scored 160 and 44 not out in Karachi moved up 11 spots to No.13. 
West Indies skipper Kraigg Brathwaite is another big mover, gaining sixteen spots up to No.27 after scoring 160 and 56* in the second Test against England in Barbados. 
In the bowling charts, Pakistan pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi has moved down one spot to No.6 after struggling in the Karachi Test, picking up only two wickets in the match. Mitchell Starc, who claimed three victims in the first innings moved up one place to No.15. 
In the all-rounders’ chart,  West Indies’ Jason Holder has dropped down to No.2 after struggling during the Barbados Test. Holder picked up only one wicket and aggregated 12 runs in the match. 
Australian skipper Pat Cummins moved up one spot to No.8 after bagging three wickets and scoring 34 not out in the first innings of the Karachi Test.

3,Bangladesh seal historic ODI series triumph in South Africa,SA were left languishing in 9th place and in danger of missing one of the eight qualifying places for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.,"CENTURION: Taskin Ahmed and Tamim Iqbal starred as Bangladesh sealed an historic series triumph with a nine-wicket win in the third One-day International against South Africa at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Wednesday.
Fast bowler Taskin took five for 35 as South Africa were bowled out for 154, their lowest total against Bangladesh.
Visiting captain Tamim then scored 87 not out off 82 balls to take Bangladesh to victory with 23.3 overs to spare, sharing a century opening partnership with Liton Das (48).
Bangladesh won the World Cup Super League series by two matches to one, consolidating their place at the top of the table.
South Africa were left languishing in ninth place and in danger of missing one of the eight automatic qualifying places for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.
Bangladesh had lost all 19 matches across all formats against South Africa on their home soil before winning the series opener by 38 runs at the same venue on Friday.
South Africa won the second match by seven wickets in Johannesburg but Bangladesh dominated Wednesday’s series decider.
The Proteas made a fast start, with Janneman Malan and Quinton de Kock putting on 46 for the first wicket inside seven overs.
But Taskin bowled superbly after off-spinner Mehidy Hasan made the first breakthrough by dismissing De Kock.
Taskin, 26, produced his best performance since taking five for 28 on debut against India on debut in Mirpur in 2014. He bowled at a lively pace in three spells and troubled all the batters.
With South Africa defending a low total, Keshav Maharaj dropped Litton Das at backward point off Kagiso Rabada in the first over of the Bangladesh innings before Das had scored.
Das and Tamim took full advantage of the let-off, putting on 127 for the first wicket.

4,England’s Robinson set to miss final WI Test,ST GEORGE’S: England are set to be without Ollie Robinson for the Test series decider against the West Indies...,"ST GEORGE’S: England are set to be without Ollie Robinson for the Test series decider against the West Indies starting on Thursday after the paceman struggled to prove his fitness in a net session.
Robinson had a back spasm during the warm-up before the three-match series began and was subsequently ruled out of the Tests in Antigua and Barbados, which both ended in draws.
The 28-year-old Robinson, who was expected to play a key role in the Caribbean after the omission of veteran fast bowlers James Anderson and Stuart Broad from the touring squad, also looks likely to miss the third Test in Grenada and therefore complete the tour without making a single appearance.
Craig Overton missed the second Test at the Kensington Oval because of illness but came through a practice session well on Tuesday and is set to replace Matthew Fisher in the only change in the England line-up.
“The two of them trained,” England captain Joe Root said of Robinson and Overton,  “And Ollie wasn’t as good as we would have liked or he was expecting himself.
“It’s just frustrating for him as it is for me. He’s working very hard but there’s something that’s nagging away at him. I’m not sure exactly of the medical prognosis. He’s just got to keep on doing what he’s doing and trust in time that he’s going to get himself back.”
The prospects of a second spinner in Matt Parkinson, to back up Jack Leach playing have receded given the prospect of a greener, livelier surface.
“I think were looking forward to a wicket with a bit more grass on it, as all of our seamers will be,” Root said.  “By all accounts that’s what were expecting here.”
Grenada last hosted a Test in 2015, when England claimed a nine-wicket win following an unbeaten 182 by Root.
England are looking to bounce back with a series win following a 4-0 loss to Australia in the Ashes.

5,Three-time Grand Slam winner Barty puts racket down at 25,BRISBANE: Ash Barty surprisingly retired from tennis at age 25 while ranked No. 1 and less than two months after...,"BRISBANE: Ash Barty surprisingly retired from tennis at age 25 while ranked No. 1 and less than two months after winning the Australian Open for her third Grand Slam singles title.
“I’m so happy and I’m so ready. I just know at the moment, in my heart, for me as a person, this is right,” Barty said, her voice shaky at times, during a six-minute video posted on her Instagram account Wednesday in Australia.
Saying it was time to chase other dreams, Barty said she no longer feels compelled to do what she knows is required to be the best she can be at tennis.
“It’s the first time I’ve actually said it out loud and, yeah, it’s hard to say,” Barty said during an informal interview with her former doubles partner, Casey Dellacqua. 
“I don’t have the physical drive, the emotional want and everything it takes to challenge yourself at the very top of the level any more. I am spent.”
This is not the first time Barty walked away from tennis: She was the Wimbledon junior champion at age 15 in 2011, presaging a promising professional career, but left the tour entirely for nearly two years in 2014 because of burnout, overwhelmed by the pressure and travel required.
She played professional cricket back home in Australia, then eventually picked up a racket once again and returned to her other sport.
Barty went on to win major championships on three different surfaces on clay at the 2019 French Open, on grass at Wimbledon last year and on the hard courts of Melbourne Park in January, becoming the first Australian player in 44 years to triumph at the nation’s Grand Slam tournament.
She won 15 tour-level titles in singles and another 12 in doubles since first turning pro in 2010. She spent 121 weeks at No. 1 in the rankings, including the last 114 in a row.
Her announcement was all the more stunning from an on-court perspective given her recent run of success: Barty had won 25 of her last 26 matches and three of her past four events.
In a statement released by the WTA, CEO Steve Simon called Barty the ultimate competitor and said she has always led by example through the unwavering professionalism and sportsmanship she brought to every match.
During her 21-month sabbatical from tennis as a teen, Barty played cricket with the Brisbane Heat of the Women’s Big Bash League. She returned to tennis in May 2016, playing a $50,000 ITF event in Eastbourne winning three qualifying matches and three more in the main draw.
One year later, she was ranked No. 88; by the end of 2017, Barty was an established member of the top 20.
“I know I’ve done this before,” Barty said with a laugh in the retirement video, but in a very different feeling. “I’m so grateful to everything that tennis has given me. It’s given me all of my dreams, plus more, but I know that the time is right now for me to step away and chase other dreams and to, yeah, put the rackets down.”
A semifinal loss to Petra Kvitova in Doha in February was the last match she played in 2020; Barty stayed home in Australia for the balance of the season when the global pandemic emerged.
After six months on the road in 2021 and after winning five titles, including at Wimbledon, Barty ended her season abruptly after a loss to Shelby Rogers at the US Open.
“Wimbledon last year changed a lot for me as a person and for me as an athlete,” Barty said. “When you work so hard your whole life for one goal to be able to win Wimbledon, which was my dream, the one true dream that I wanted in tennis, that really changed my perspective.” She described what she termed a gut feeling after Wimbledon about maybe being ready to move on, but she also described herself then as “not quite fulfilled.” 
Her victory at the Australian Open satisfied another gap, and Barty said she was completely aware that “my happiness wasn’t dependent on the results.”

6,Crunch time for Portugal and Italy in World Cup qualifying play-offs,"“Our goal is to win the World Cup, and to win the World Cup we have to win these two matches,"" says Italy coach Mancini","PARIS: The World Cup hopes of the last two European champions are on a knife edge with Portugal and Italy on a collision course in decisive qualifying play-offs over the next week.
A potential clash in Porto between the Euro 2016 winners, captained by Cristiano Ronaldo, and an Italy team who succeeded them as continental champions last year is a mouth-watering prospect.
However, both must first come through semi-finals on Thursday that are far from foregone conclusions, with Portugal hosting Turkey and Italy facing North Macedonia.
Failure to reach this year’s World Cup would be a catastrophe for the Azzurri, who had gone to every finals since 1958 until missing out in 2018 when they lost a play-off to Sweden.
It would be all the more remarkable given that they bounced back from that under Ito win Euro 2020 while on a world record 37-game unbeaten run.
Yet four draws in their last five World Cup qualifiers last autumn saw them finish second in their group to Switzerland, and now they must come through these two one-off ties to secure a place in the April 1 draw in Doha.
“Our goal is to win the World Cup, and to win the World Cup we have to win these two matches. There’s nothing else to say,” Mancini said on Monday.
Italy host North Macedonia in Palermo, and they will know not to take the Balkan nation of two million people lightly.
After all, they beat Germany away in qualifying last year before appearing at their first major tournament at Euro 2020, and they also held Italy to a damaging draw in Turin in qualifying for the last World Cup.
“We are not going to Italy as tourists, but to outplay (them) and to win,” said coach Bobi Milevski, who is aiming to take North Macedonia — born in 1991 out of the break-up of Yugoslavia — to their first World Cup.
Portugal skipper Ronaldo will be 41 come 2026, so Qatar surely represents his last chance to win the World Cup. Missing out altogether is unthinkable for the all-time top scorer in international football with 115 goals.
“We know the road will not be easy and we have full respect for our opponents, who share the same objective as us. But together we will fight to take Portugal where we belong,” Ronaldo posted on Instagram this week.
Portugal, who are ranked eighth in the world, two places behind Italy, must beat Turkey in Porto to reach the play-off final, in which they would have home advantage.
However, their two first-choice centre-backs have been ruled out — Manchester City’s Ruben Dias succumbed to injury before 39-year-old veteran Pepe tested positive for coronavirus.
Three World Cup berths from Europe remain up for grabs, with 10 teams led by holders France having already qualified.
The play-offs were meant to feature 12 teams, split into three separate paths, but they have been impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with both of those countries initially due to take part.
Hosts of the 2018 World Cup, Russia were excluded after being suspended by FIFA and UEFA until further notice.
That meant Poland getting a walkover to a final against either 2018 quarter-finalists Sweden or the Czech Republic, who meet in Solna on Thursday.
Ukraine were due to face Scotland in Glasgow, but that match has been postponed until June.
Therefor, whoever wins Thursday’s clash between Wales and Austria in Cardiff will also have to wait until June for their play-off final.
Wales have impressed at the last two European Champ­ionships but have not been to the World Cup since 1958.
They made the play-offs after finishing second in their qualifying group behind the world’s top-ranked side Belgium.
“It’s massive. It’s been a long wait, a long time since Wales qualified for a World Cup,” Neco Williams, currently on loan at Fulham from Liverpool, told the BBC.
Wales coach Robert Page is hoping Gareth Bale can play although the Real Madrid man missed his club’s defeat against Barcelona at the weekend reportedly due to illness.
He has only played five times for Madrid this season, and just twice since August.

7,"Russia launches shock bid to host Euros, challenges British Isles, Italy",LONDON: Russia launched a shock bid to host football’s European Championship one month after invading its neighbor...,"LONDON: Russia launched a shock bid to host football’s European Championship one month after invading its neighbor and seeing its teams suspended from international competitions over the war in Ukraine.
The late declaration of interest in bidding is a challenge to the British Isles, which through its combined bid thought it was unchallenged to host the UEFA showpiece in 2028 until Turkey also entered the contest on Wednesday. 
Italy is the only declared bidder for Euro 2032 apart from Russia.
“A meeting of the Russian Football Union executive committee decided on Wednesday to support the decision to declare interest in the 2028 and 2032 tournaments,” the organisation said in a statement ahead of the deadline for expressions of interest to be submitted to UEFA.
Russia’s federation was not suspended by UEFA despite the ban on its teams from playing since last month. The RFU president, Alexander Dyukov, also still sits on the UEFA executive committee and is CEO of an oil subsidiary of state-owned Gazprom, which was dropped as a Champions League sponsor over the war.
“We must take the opportunity to host the Euro,” Dyukov told Russia’s Match TV. “It will be at the World Cup stadiums and we have developed infrastructure.”
Russia hosted the 2018 World Cup and the venue for the final Luzhniki Stadium was used last week for a rally supporting President Vladimir Putin.
“We are sending the declaration today,” Dyukov said. “We assume that Russia is already prepared to to host large-scale competitions. We have the experience.”
Russia’s unlikely plan is sure to face fierce opposition. Poland, Sweden and the Czech Republic had independently announced they would refuse to play Russia in World Cup qualifying even on neutral territory ahead of FIFA’s decision to suspend Russia.
UEFA will provide the tournament requirements to bidders next Wednesday and then confirm their candidacies on April 5. The deadline to submit final bid dossiers is not until April 2023 with a decision by the UEFA executive committee in September 2023.
“We reserve the right to enter a bid,” Dyukov said. “This option doesn’t cost anything. And you cant refuse it, if it isn’t expensive.”
The British Isles bid is being led by England and also features Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

8,Moriyasu expects aggressive Australia in World Cup clash,The Japanese are on the verge of a seventh consecutive World Cup despite a poor start to the final phase of qualifying round.,"HONG KONG: Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu has experienced joy and despair throughout Asia’s World Cup preliminaries but victory over Australia in Sydney on Thursday will guarantee a happy conclusion to a dramatic campaign.
Both Japan and Saudi Arabia can confirm their spots at the finals in Qatar this week, with Herve Renard’s Saudi side set to advance if they beat already eliminated China in Sharjah.
The Saudis lead Group ‘B’ by a point from Japan with Australia in third, three points behind Moriyasu’s side and needing to defeat the ‘Samurai Blue’ to put their qualifying fate back into their own hands.
The Japanese are on the verge of a seventh consecutive World Cup despite a poor start to the final phase of qualifying, when losses against Oman and Saudi Arabia raised questions over Moriyasu’s future.
But the former Sanfrecce Hiroshima boss has come through that slump to lead his side to five straight wins, including a 2-1 victory over the Australians in Japan in October, and another three points will be enough to secure a place in Qatar.
“Australia were very strong and their intensity level was high when we played them last October,” Moriyasu told the Asian Football Confed­eration’s website.
“I am quite sure that the next game is going to be more aggressive and intense than our last game, and think it will be a good game of football.”
Iran and South Korea have already claimed the two automatic berths available from Group ‘A’, with the pair facing off in Seoul on Thursday in the battle for top spot.
That leaves the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and Iraq battling for third in the group and a spot in the playoffs.
Iraq will face the UAE in Riyadh while Lebanon host Syria in Sidon.
The UAE, under new coach Rodolfo Arruabarrena, are third with nine points, three ahead of the Lebanese with Iraq a further point adrift.
The two third-placed teams meet in a playoff in Qatar on June 7 before taking on South American opposition for a spot at the finals a week later.

The fifth-placed team in South America will play an intercontinental playoff against the fifth-placed team from Asia in June for another spot in Qatar, so the competition is still intense.
Peru, Chile and Colombia are seeking to remain in contention for the fourth or the fifth positions in qualifying right until the last round. Bolivia, Paraguay and Venezuela are already out.
The most anticipated match on Thursday will be at the Centenario Stadium in Montevideo, where Uruguay (22 points) and Peru (21) will face off. Sixth-placed Chile are on 19 and their hopes depend on getting points against first-placed Brazil (39) in Rio de Janeiro.
Third-placed Ecuador (25) can secure their spot in Qatar with a combination of different results. A win at Paraguay is enough for Gustavo Alfaro’s team. A draw could also work, as long as Peru don’t beat Uruguay. A loss could also suffice if the Peru lose in Montevideo.
Uruguay were at serious risk of not qualifying for the World Cup after four consecutive defeats under veteran coach Oscar Tabarez. The outlook has improved in the two matches since Diego Alonso took over. Now the Uruguayans can reach the World Cup with a victory against a direct rival for the spot, as long as Chile don’t win at Brazil.
“We will play this match as if it were a final,” Alonso told a news conference.
Peru can achieve at least fifth position with a win at Uruguay as long as Chile don’t beat Brazil. Avoiding defeat in Montevideo could also be enough to get close to Qatar.
“To reach the final round depending only on ourselves is what we had expected all along,” said Ricardo Gareca, who took Peru to a World Cup for the first time in 36 years in the latest edition. “We have to have a lot of narrative, conviction, mentality to depend only on ourselves in the two final rounds.”
For Chile, a loss to Brazil would mean the end of its World Cup hopes for 2022. Chile have never beaten Brazil away. 
“It is clear that we cannot play a fearful match,” Chile coach Martin Lasarte said. “We have to play as equals.”
Colombia (17) host Bolivia (15) and need an extremely unlikely combination of results to qualify.
Friday’s only South American qualifying match features Argentina as Venezuela’s hosts. The last round of qualifying will be staged next Tuesday.
The final rounds of qualifying are also a relief for South American teams, who have faced serious headwinds since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, not only because of their high toll of the virus in their countries but also with health protocols required to bring Europe-based players in for matches.

10,"Russian, Belarusian swimmers banned from world championships",LAUSANNE: Russian and Belarusian swimmers were banned Wednesday from competing at the world championships because of...,"LAUSANNE: Russian and Belarusian swimmers were banned Wednesday from competing at the world championships because of the war in Ukraine.
The sport’s governing body FINA, had broken with most other organisations by continuing to allow Russians and Belarusians to compete, though as neutral athletes without national symbols.
“Following the review of an independent risk assessment, the FINA Bureau met today and confirmed that athletes and officials from Russia and Belarus will not take part [in the world championships],” FINA said.
The event, which will be held in Hungary in June and July, includes swimming, diving, water polo and artistic swimming.
The German and Swiss teams had previously indicated they could boycott the championships if Russia was still allowed to compete. Russia finished third in the medal table behind China and the United States at the last championships in 2019.
FINA added that Russia responded to the ban by withdrawing from all events on this year’s calendar. Russia was stripped of hosting the world short-course championships in Kazan in December and FINA is now seeking a new host.
Russian and Belarusian athletes already have been suspended from sports  including football, track, gymnastics, skiing and ice skating because of  the invasion of Ukraine.
