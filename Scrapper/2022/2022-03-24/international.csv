0,Black box of crashed China Eastern jet recovered,The cause of the disaster has mystified aviation authorities who have scoured rugged terrain for clues.,"WUZHOU: A black box from the crashed China Eastern airliner was recovered on Wednesday as investigators try to determine what made the jet carrying 132 passengers nosedive into a mountainside in southern China.
The cause of the disaster has mystified aviation authorities who have scoured rugged terrain for clues, finding no survivors from what is almost certain to be China’s deadliest plane crash in nearly 30 years.
Aviation officials confirmed they had found a black box they believed to be the cockpit voice recorder, which should provide important clues to the cause of the crash.
Zhu Tao, an official at China’s aviation authority, told reporters that the exterior was  “severely damaged, and the storage unit was also damaged to a certain extent, but it was relatively complete”.
The stricken jet, a Boeing 737-800, was equipped with two recorders: one in the rear passenger cabin tracking flight data, and the other a cockpit voice recorder. Rescuers are still looking for the other recorder.
Officials have not declared all of the passengers dead despite the pulverised mass of twisted metal and charred belongings that recovery teams found at the crash site.
Zheng Xi, head of the area’s rescue service, said Wednesday evening that some human remains had been found.
Earlier in the day reporters saw a small crowd of people guided by officials across the police cordon that marks entry to the site, huddled under umbrellas in the driving rain.
One middle-aged man later confirmed that he was the relative of someone on the flight, and asked the media not to crowd around him.
Rescue work is ongoing across the huge 45,200 square metre crash zone.
Orange-clad rescuers have been using dogs, drones and scanners to scour the debris scattered across the mountainside.
The Boeing 737-800 plane went down near Wuzhou in southern China on Monday afternoon after losing contact with air traffic control. Up until that point, communication with ground staff had been normal, state media reported.
Tracking website FlightRadar24 showed the jet sharply dropped from an altitude of 29,100 to 7,850 feet (about 8,900 to 2,400 metres) in just over a minute.
After a brief upswing, it dropped again to 3,225 feet, the tracker said.
The captain had more than 6,700 hours of flight experience and the first co-pilot had more than 31,000 hours of flight time, officials said on Wednesday.
There was a second co-pilot on board, with more than 550 hours of flight time, and all three were in good health with no known personal problems.
Rescuers were forced to pause the search on Wednesday as rain raised risks to teams working in the zone, where a large pit had been bored out by the impact of the aircraft.
A reporter for state broadcaster CCTV given access to the crash area said there were risks of  “small-scale landslides” as rain had destabilised the steep slopes.
The rescue service chief told reporters that water had built up in the crater at the centre of the accident site, which was being pumped away.
Authorities have sealed off access to the crash site and blocked foreign media from speaking to the distraught relatives who have gathered in Wuzhou.

1,UN wants worldwide weather warning systems within five years,Plan will cost $1.5bn but UN insists it will be money well spent compared to devastation wrought by meteorological disasters.,"GENEVA: The United Nations said on Wednesday it wanted the whole world covered by weather disaster early warning systems within five years to protect people from the worsening impacts of climate change.
A third of the world’s people, mainly in the least-developed countries and developing small island states, are without early warning coverage, the UN said, with 60 percent of people in Africa wide open to weather catastrophes.
The plan will cost $1.5 billion — but the UN insisted it would be money well spent compared to the devastation wrought by meteorological disasters.
“The United Nations will spearhead new action to ensure every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems within five years,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced, launching the plan on World Meteorological Day.
Proper early warning systems — for floods, droughts, heatwaves or storms — allow people to know that hazardous weather is coming, and set out plans for what governments and individuals should do to minimise the impacts.
“Each increment of global heating will further increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events,” said Guterres.
“Early warning systems save lives. Let us ensure they are working for everyone.”
The UN’s World Meteorological Organisation will present an action plan at the next UN climate conference, to be held in Egypt in November.
WMO chief Petteri Taalas said the $1.5 billion required to build weather, water and climate early warning services would provide one of the highest rates of return on investments in climate adaptation.
The organisation believes the investment would save countless lives, protect the most vulnerable and make good economic sense.
The WMO said the number of weather disasters it recorded went up fivefold from 1970 to 2019, due to climate change and an increased number of extreme weather events, but also improved monitoring.
“Thanks to better warnings, the number of lives lost decreased almost three-fold over the same period,” the organisation said.
The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, struck at the COP21 summit, called for capping global warming at well below two degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial (1850-1900) level, and ideally closer to 1.5 C.
Guterres said it was vital to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 C as the hotter the planet gets, the greater the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.
“Keeping 1.5 alive requires a 45 percent reduction in global emissions by 2030 to reach carbon neutrality by mid-century,” he said. However, carbon emissions are set to rise by almost 14 percent this decade.
It is also feared that as countries turn away from Russian oil and gas following the Kremlin-ordered war in Ukraine, short-term alternatives will end up becoming new, long-term deals that lock in fossil fuel dependency, putting the final nail in the coffin for the 1.5 C target.
One problem stemming from the lack of advanced weather monitoring systems in Africa is that climate projections are built from sparse information.

2,US Supreme Court hearings test senators on race,Chairman Senator Dick Durbin laments his panel had become the testing ground for conspiracy theories and culture war theories.,"WASHINGTON: It’s not just Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson who is being scrutinised. Senators are also being watched at this milestone moment considering the first Black woman for the high court.
Some senators are overcome with joy, as Cory Booker of New Jersey described the swell of emotion he felt over the potential to confirm a judge who would help the court look more like America.
Others, led by Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, quiz the federal judge about her views on issues of race and crime, amplifying election year grievances and a backlash over changing culture.
Jackson appeared for a third day before the Senate Judiciary Committee for grueling confirmation hearings that are providing a vivid portrait of the promise, and enduring racial challenges, facing the country.
Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill, opened on Wednesday lamenting that his panel had become the testing ground for conspiracy theories and culture war theories.
Nevertheless, he declared, America is ready for the Supreme Court glass ceiling to finally shatter.
Here are some takeaways from Day Three of the weeklong confirmation hearings.
Jackson is the first federal public defender to be nominated to the Supreme Court, and she related her views about the importance of the work to ensure fair trials for all Americans.
Under questions from Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, she explained that prior to the court’s 1963 ruling in Gideon v. Wainwright, people who were accused of crimes but couldn’t afford lawyers were not guaranteed the right to legal representation.
The protections of the Sixth Amendment, the right to trial, includes the right to appointed counsel, so that everybody who is accused of criminal behavior now has the right to an attorney, she said. And thats very important.
Jackson’s efforts representing those accused of crimes, alongside the sentences she handed down as a federal judge, have provided a lengthy record of difficult cases for senators to review, in particular as Republicans have suggested she is soft on crime. Critics say she brings too much empathy to the cases.
Democrats counter that Jackson, who comes from a family with police officers, is backed by the Fraternal Order of Police, the large law enforcement organisation.
Jackson’s record is being scrutinised much the way the work of the first Black nominee to the court, Thurgood Marshall, the storied civil rights attorney, was probed for representing criminal defendants a half a century ago.
Jackson has presented herself a judge who relies on method, not judicial philosophy, to remain neutral as she works to stay in my lane as a judge rather than a policy-making legislator.
She expanded on that view Wednesday reminding senators that the Constitution gives Congress the power to make laws and gives the courts the judicial authority, the power to interpret the laws.

3,Palestinians in Gaza giving up studies for Israeli wages,Israeli work permits have become a rarity for Palestinians in the last decade or so — making the few on offer seem like gold dust.,"GAZA CITY: The moment Hussein got permission to work in Israel, the Palestinian resident of Gaza City said he was ready to quit university to seek the attractive wages offered for menial Israeli jobs.
“I felt that the doors of heaven were opened for me,” said Hussein. Like other Gazans who have abandoned their studies to take low-skilled work inside Israel, embarrassment led him to ask that his full name be withheld.
Gaza, a Palestinian territory of some 2.3 million people under Israeli-blockade since 2007, suffers from an unemployment rate above 50 percent, where even those with post-graduate degrees can struggle to get by.
And Israeli work permits have become a rarity for Palestinians in the last decade or so — making the few on offer seem like gold dust.
Hussein was pursuing a masters degree and hoping to boost his earnings potential, but said that with three children to feed and student debts of $3,500, continuing to study was proving untenable.
“I hadn’t worked in years,” he said, explaining his decision to leave Gaza several months ago.
He got a job as a delivery person in Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv, one of several places in Israel where Palestinian labourers say they can earn between 250 and 700 shekels (between about $75 and $215) per day, far more than most could hope for from equivalent work in Gaza.
Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organisation by much of the West, took power in Gaza in 2007.
Before the Islamist takeover, roughly 120,000 Gazans had permission to work inside Israel.
But Hamas and Israel have fought repeatedly over the last 15 years and, due latterly also to the coronavirus pandemic, Israel has at times fully closed its land crossings with the enclave while completely curbing cross-border work.
Since reopening a few months ago, the Jewish state has issued 12,000 work permits to Gazans — mostly six month visas, with the option to renew.
The parking lot at the Erez crossing through which Gazans enter Israel is now teeming with taxis and minibuses, waiting to take Palestinians to work.
Among them was Mahmud, who found work at a restaurant in Herzliya, an affluent town north of Tel Aviv.
He had previously worked for international organisations in Gaza — highly coveted employers.
But he said ultimately he decided that he could not turn down the chance to earn up to 550 shekels ($170) a day, including overtime — on top of room and board — in Israel, even if the work had no connection to his masters degree in social work.
While many Gazans welcome higher Israeli pay, the head of Gaza’s workers union, Sami al-Amsi, called for the permits to include mandatory social security protections.
Under current terms, workers from Gaza entering Israel are only covered for accidents if their Israeli employer agrees to pay for insurance — a rarity, according to the Israeli labour rights organisation Kav LaOved.

4,WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange to marry in prison,"“This is not a prison wedding, it is a declaration of love and resilience,"" writes his fiancee Stella Moris.","

LONDON: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and his fiancee Stella Moris are to marry on Wednesday, at the high-security London prison where he is being held during his extradition case.
Assange, 50, is fighting attempts to remove him from Britain to face trial in the United States over the publication of secret files relating to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Last week, the UK Supreme Court turned down a request to hear his appeal against the move, bringing the long-running legal saga nearer to a conclusion.
Assange and Moris announced their engagement in November and were given permission to marry at Belmarsh prison in southeast London where he is on remand.
“This is not a prison wedding, it is a declaration of love and resilience in spite of the prison walls, in spite of the political persecution, in spite of the arbitrary detention,” Moris wrote in The Guardian on Wednesday.
The Don’t Extradite Assange (DEA) group said the wedding would be conducted by a registrar, with just four guests, two witnesses — and two security guards — in attendance. The guests will have to leave immediately after the ceremony.
Vivienne Westwood, the British fashion designer who has been a long-standing supporter of the Australian publisher, has designed Moris’ wedding dress, the DEA group said.
She has also provided a kilt for Assange in a nod to his Scottish heritage, it added.
Moris, who is in her late 30s and has two young sons with Assange, will cut a wedding cake and make a speech outside the prison in front of their supporters.
She criticised British authorities for not allowing Assange to be seen for almost three years.
“Julian is being turned into prisoner X, an abstraction that is neither seen nor heard, and therefore nonexistent,” Moris wrote in The Guardian.
“Julian is being disappeared because his imprisonment is a national disgrace, an embarrassment for the British state, and a vicious, authoritarian move.” Assange has become a figurehead for media freedom campaigners, who accuse Washington of trying to muzzle reporting of legitimate security concerns.
If found guilty of violating the US Espionage Act by publishing military and diplomatic files, he could face the rest of his life in prison.
For critics, he is seen as having been reckless with classified information that may have endangered the lives of sources.
Assange initially won a ruling against his extradition, after his lawyers successfully argued he would be a suicide risk if he were transferred to the United States.

5,‘US only now coming to terms with Afghan situation’,Pakistan’s outgoing envoy in Washington says the Ukrainian crisis won’t divert world’s attention from challenges in Afghanistan.,"WASHINGTON: There was ‘surprise and frustration’ in Washington when Kabul fell to the Taliban but gradually, they understood the situation, says Pakistan’s US Amba­ssador Asad Majeed Khan. 
“Obviously, it came as a surprise for everybody, contrary to the intelligence estimates here and earlier than anybody had expected,” said the outgoing ambassador, explaining why Washington reacted so strongly to the fall. 
Ambassador Khan, the longest serving Pakistani diplomat in the US, leaves for Islamabad on Thursday from where he will head to Brussels as his country’s new envoy for the European Union, Belgium and Lux­embourg. 
He served as Pakistan’s ambassador in Washington from Jan 7, 2019, to March 24, 2022. He has also served in Washington as the deputy chief of mission for four years and spent six years in New York, including as a diplomat at Pakistan’s UN Mission. 

Pakistan’s outgoing envoy in Washington says Ukrainian crisis won’t divert world’s attention from challenges in Afghanistan

Asked to define the most difficult issue he handled in Washington, Mr Khan acknowledged that the Afghan issue was difficult but pointed out that “both sides have never shied away from addressing problems”. And this (US-Pakistan) “has never been an easy relationship,” he added. The United States and Pakistan, he said, have had a “clear convergence” in Afghanistan because “the US is as much interested in peace and stability in Afghanistan as we are”. 
Mr Khan represented Pakistan in Washington during much of the Doha talks between the United States and the Taliban that were facilitated by Pakistan. The talks ended on a peace deal that led to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and consequently to Kabul’s fall to the Taliban. 
“Our job was to articulate and convey our national position to Washington and to listen to the concerns expressed here and explain how Islamabad looked at developments in Afghanistan,” he said. 
The embassy, however, was not involved in arranging the visits of Taliban officials to Doha as that was handled by Islamabad, he added. 
Ambassador Khan said that Pakistan’s key role in facilitating the evacuation of those wishing to leave Afghanistan also helped improve bilateral ties after the fall of Kabul. 
“We saw appreciation for Pakistan’s positive contribution during the peace process and dealing with the aftermath of the Taliban takeover,” he said. “People understood that the international community must come together to stabilise Afgha­nistan as Pakistan alone cannot do this.” 
Ambassador Khan hoped that the Ukrainian crisis would not drive the world’s attention away from the humanitarian challenges in Afghanistan. 
Asked if the embassy was ever asked to arrange a telephone call between President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Imran Khan, Ambassador Khan said: “You don’t make formal phone call requests. Leaders do get in touch on issues and such possibilities are explored. But it is dependent on the convenience of the leaders.” 
Mr Khan also said that telephone “calls should not be a yardstick for any relationship, and certainly not for US-Pakistan ties”. The relationship, he noted, has been moving at its pace and there have been regular contact between the national security advisers, cabinet ministers and the military leaderships of the two countries.

6,Ukraine pleads for help as Joe Biden heads to summit,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says almost 100,000 people remained trapped by relentless Russian bombardment in Mariupol.","KYIV: Ukraine on Wednesday appealed for Western military help, ahead of an emergency Nato summit, and denounced Russian  “war crimes” in besieged places including the port of Mariupol where it says mass starvation is possible.
Tens of thousands of residents have already fled the southern city, bringing harrowing testimony of a  “freezing hellscape riddled with dead bodies and destroyed buildings”, according to Human Rights Watch.
But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that almost 100,000 people remained trapped by relentless Russian bombardment in Mariupol without water, food and power.
The mayor of Kyiv, former world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said Ukrainian forces were pushing the invaders back in several areas around the capital.
“We are ready to fight for each building, each street, every part of our city,” he told reporters.  “We would rather die than kneel in front of the Russians or surrender to the invaders.” As President Joe Biden travelled to the summits of Nato, the G7 and European Union in Brussels, Andriy Yermak, a top advisor to Zelensky, said Ukraine was holding out  “with superhuman courage”.
“But we cannot win a war without offensive weapons, without medium-range missiles that can be a means of deterrence,” Yermak said.
‘Ruins of Verdun’
Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the leaders at Thursday’s summit would agree to  “major increases of forces” including four new battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.
The allies will also offer  “additional support” to Kyiv against nuclear and chemical threats, he said, after Biden warned anew that Russia could be prepared to unleash Syria-style horror in Ukraine.
But Nato members, while maintaining a steady supply of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, have balked at Zelensky’s demands to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, fearing all-out war with nuclear-armed Russia.
Zelensky kept up the pressure on foreign allies, using speeches to French and Japanese lawmakers to invoke their own national traumas of the past. He told the French National Assembly that images of devastated cities such as Mariupol  “recall the ruins of Verdun as in the photos of World War I that everyone has seen”.
“The Russian army makes no distinction between targets. They destroy residential areas, hospitals, schools, universities.
“They do not take into account the concepts of war crimes.” Nearly a month on in to the invasion, peace talks have agreed on daily humanitarian corridors for refugees, and Ukraine says it is willing to countenance some Russian demands subject to a national referendum.
But it has refused to bow to Russian pressure to disarm and renounce all Western alliances, and Zelensky was also due Thursday to address the NATO meeting.
Ukraine’s lead negotiator Mykhaylo Podolyak said the peace talks were encountering  “significant difficulties”, after Moscow accused the United States of undermining the process. Russia meanwhile refuses to rule out using nuclear weapons if it faces an  “existential threat”, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN.
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby slammed Moscow’s  “dangerous” rhetoric.
Charred landscape
For Ukrainians besieged in Mariupol and other cities, Russian talk of peace rings hollow as they come under indiscriminate shelling that Western countries agree amounts to a war crime.
Satellite images of Mariupol released by private company Maxar showed a charred landscape, with several buildings ablaze and smoke billowing from the city.
Ukrainian forces also reported  “heavy” ground fighting, with Russian  “infantry storming the city” after they rejected a Monday ultimatum to surrender.
“Even if Mariupol falls, Ukraine cannot be conquered city by city, street by street, house by house,” United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said.

7,"Madeleine Albright, former US secretary of state, dies at 84","Albright, who had become the US ambassador to the UN in 1993, had pressed for a tougher line against the Serbs in Bosnia.","


 
WASHINGTON: Madeleine Albright, who fled the Nazis as a child in her native Czechoslovakia during World War Two but rose to become the first female US secretary of state and, in her later years, a pop culture feminist icon, died on Wednesday at the age of 84, her family said.
Albright was a tough-talking diplomat in an administration that hesitated to involve itself in the two biggest foreign policy crises of the 1990s — the genocides in Rwanda and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
“We are heartbroken to announce that Dr Madeleine K. Albright, the 64th US Secretary of State and the first woman to hold that position, passed away earlier today. The cause was cancer,” the family said on Twitter.
Albright, who had become the US ambassador to the United Nations in 1993, had pressed for a tougher line against the Serbs in Bosnia. But during President Bill Clinton’s first term, many of the administration’s top foreign policy experts vividly remembered how the United States became bogged down in Vietnam and were determined to not repeat that error in the Balkans.
The United States responded by working with Nato on airstrikes that forced an end to the war but only after it had been going on for three years. Albright’s experience as a refugee prompted her to push for the United States to be a superpower which used that clout. She wanted a  “muscular internationalism,” said James O’Brien, a senior adviser to Albright during the Bosnian war. She once upset a Pentagon chief by asking why the military maintained more than 1 million men and women under arms if they never used them.
Early in the Clinton administration, while she unsuccessfully advocated for a quicker, stronger response in Bosnia, Albright backed a United Nations war crimes tribunal that eventually put the architects of that war, including Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leaders, in jail, O’Brien said.

8,Trump aide Manafort removed from plane for revoked passport,MIAMI: Former Trump adviser Paul Manafort was removed from a plane at Miami International Airport before it took off...,"MIAMI: Former Trump adviser Paul Manafort was removed from a plane at Miami International Airport before it took off for Dubai because he carried a revoked passport, officials said on Wednesday.
Miami-Dade Police Detective Alvaro Zabaleta confirmed that Manafort was removed from the Emirates Airline flight without incident on Sunday night but directed further questions to US Border and Customs Protection. That agency did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
A lawyer who has represented Manafort did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment on Wednesday.
Manafort, 72, led former President Donald Trump’s campaign for several months during the 2016 presidential race but was ousted in August of that year after revelations about his business dealings in Ukraine.
He was later indicted on a broad array of financial crimes as part of special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. He was convicted by a jury in August 2018 and later pleaded guilty in federal court in Washington.
In May 2020, Manafort was released from a low-security prison where he was serving a more than seven-year federal sentence amid concerns about the coronavirus. Although Manafort had not served long enough to be eligible for release under the guidelines, the Bureau of Prisons decided to free him because of his age and health vulnerabilities, a person familiar with the matter has said. Trump pardoned Manafort in December 2020.
Manafort’s removal was first reported by the website Knewz.com.
