0,693 more Covid cases; low testing ‘exaggerates’ data,Hyderabad’s positivity jumps to 50pc on the back of three positive results from six tests.,"ISLAMABAD: The country reported 693 Covid-19 cases on Friday, with the national positivity rate touching 3.28 per cent, according to official statistics.  
The data released by the National Command and Operation Center (NCOC) showed that 21,137 tests were conducted over the past 24 hours. The number of patients on critical care remained unchanged at 165.  
However, the city-wise positivity ratio data presents an ambiguous picture as high ratios don’t necessarily point towards an outbreak. For example, the positivity ratio in Sindh’s second largest city Hyderabad hit 50pc on Friday, but only six tests were conducted, out of which three returned positive.  
The positivity rate in other cities remained under 7pc.  

Hyderabad’s positivity jumps to 50pc on the back of three positive results from six tests

So far, 275,382,626 doses of vaccine have been administered across the country, according to the NCOC. Out of this, 137,503,769 individuals have received the first dose and 127,590,195 have been fully vaccinated. Moreover 28,103,609 people have been inoculated with booster shots as well. 
The Vice Chancellor of Health Services Academy, Prof Dr Shahzad Ali Khan, while talking to Dawn, expressed fear that Covid cases may rapidly increase during the upcoming religious events of Eidul Azha and   Muharram-ul-Haram.
“People should strictly adhere to the standard operating procedures so that the pace of increase in cases could be controlled as it directly affects the occupancy rate of beds in hospitals,” he said, adding that if the number of cases continued to increase on a daily basis, there would be more admissions in the hospitals.
Dr Khan, who is also a member of the NCOC, said if the two religious events passed without witnessing any increase in cases, the country may not have the sixth wave of Covid-19.
Earlier this week, the NCOC had advised travellers to exercise caution, check weather forecasts and pre-book their hotel accommodations during Eid holidays. Tourists have been advised to wear face masks, use hand sanitisers and avoid going to crowded places and maintain social distancing.
“It should be made sure that all tourists [are] vaccinated and those who have been vaccinated, should go for the booster dose,” the advisory stated.
The tourists should check weather prediction and confirm hotel bookings before travelling.
“As hotels and restaurants ... remain jam-packed during Eid holidays, make sure that your residence is already booked and you have edible items   [to] use in case of prolonged stay,” it stated.
National Institute of Health Executive Director Maj Gen Aamer Ikram had also urged tourists to collect route and weather information before embarking on the journey.

1,Quetta-Chaman highway blocked after landslide; traffic comes to standstill,Large number of trucks carrying transit goods stranded in Shella Bagh area of the Chaman district.,"QUETTA: Traffic between Quetta and Kandahar was suspended on Friday after a landslide at Khojak Pass on the Quetta-Chaman national highway in the wake of heavy rains and flash floods.
Trade and other commercial activities with Afghanistan were affected as a result and a large number of trucks carrying transit goods were seen stranded in the Shella Bagh area of the Chaman district. 
The trucks coming from Afghanistan loaded with fresh fruit, vegetables and other goods were stuck at the Chaman border.
Levies officials said flash floods from nearby mountains after heavy monsoon rains lashing the Chaman and Qila Abdullah districts caused heavy property and financial losses. 
“Big boulders and mud fell on Khojak Pass, blocking the Quetta-Chaman highway and suspending the vehicular traffic,” a senior Levies official said, adding that efforts were under way to clear the road and restore traffic.
He said rain and floodwater also affected the railway line in the Shella Bagh area. “The Quetta-Chaman train service remained suspended for two days,” Levies officials said. 
However, Pakistan Railways officials said the track linking Quetta with the border town of Chaman was intact and floodwater had not entered the Shella Bagh tunnel. 
“The train services remained suspended for Chaman for two days as the passenger bogies of the Chaman train were used for a special Eid train from Quetta to Punjab and Karachi,” senior railway official Muhammad Kashif told Dawn, adding that the train would leave for Chaman from Quetta on Saturday. 
He said the railway staff concerned had already been put on high alert in view of heavy rains lashing the entire province.
Meanwhile, four dams were washed away in the Toba Achakzai area of Chaman district due to heavy rains near the Pak-Afghan border area, which caused heavy flooding in downstream areas of Toba Achakzai.
“Over 200 houses were washed away in the flash flood,” Additional Deputy Commissioner Revenue Chaman Munir Durrani said, stressing that the provincial disaster management authority should immediately provide homeless people with tents and other relief goods.
Balochistan Chief Secretary Abdul Aziz Aquili visited the Qila Abdullah district, where floods damaged or washed away many dams. Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo has ordered an inquiry into dams’ substandard construction and raw materials.

According to a Finance Division notification dated July 7, the finance minister will head the committee as its chairman. Its members will include the ministers for planning, communication, commerce, maritime affairs and the minister of state for finance. The secretaries of the ministries of finance, planning and industries will also be a part of the committee besides the additional finance secretary.
The terms of reference of the committee include periodically reviewing and ensuring the implementation of austerity measures and related matters for the financial year, inviting proposals from principal accounting officers for curtailing expenditures, and approving proposals for relaxing the approved measures.
The committee will also constitute a separate body for reviewing the need and utility of autonomous bodies, state-owned enterprises, corporations and authorities.
The Finance Division also issued an office memorandum, also dated July 7, noting that extraordinary measures needed to be taken for ensuring “rational utilisation of public money” in addition to curtailing expenditures.
The notification reiterated a ban on purchasing all types of vehicles except utility ones, including ambulances, buses for educational institutes and for solid waste; creation of new posts except those required for development projects; treatment abroad at government expense; and appointment of daily wagers except for development projects.
A ban was also placed on purchasing office furniture, machinery and equipment and unnecessary official visits abroad by government officials; official lunches/dinners/hi-teas except for foreign delegations; and periodicals, magazines and newspapers.  
The principal accounting officers were told to reduce consumption of utilities by 10pc and of petrol entitled to government functionaries by 30pc; and curtail avoidable travel by promoting online meetings.

3,"Unbridled power to PM encourages ‘dictatorship’, says SC judge","In dissenting note on Article 63-A, Justice Jamal Mandokhail says vote in parliament is not fundamental right of party but member.","ISLAMABAD: Unbridled power to prime minister in determining the constitutional and fundamental right of his party parliamentarians would result in a culture of civil dictatorship, observed Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail of the Supreme Court in his dissenting note on the presidential reference seeking interpretation of Article 63A of the Constitution.
The apex court, in its verdict by a majority of three to two, on May 17 held that Article 63A that dealt with defection ensured fundamental rights of the parliamentary party rather than an individual lawmaker, therefore the vote casted contrary to the party lines should not be counted.
In a 15-page dissenting note on the reference, Justice Mandokhail observed: “The vote in the parliament is not the fundamental right of the party, rather is a fundamental right of a member, to be exercised in the interest of people.” Since the defector was ready and willing to pay the price for defection, the right of the political party stood protected to award its symbol to any person to contest by-election, he reasoned.
No parliamentarian could be treated to be no longer ‘sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen’ simply on the declaration of a party head and that too without due process and fair trial, Justice Mandokhail said.
Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel has already issued his dissenting note, whereas the detailed reasons of the majority judges, namely Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar, is still awaited.
Justice Mandokhail explained that giving unbridled power to the premier would create the culture of civil dictatorship, thus encouraging a situation where no member would then have the right to remove PM even if the latter himself no longer remains sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen or if his policies were against the state, the Constitution, the interest of the constituents, the injunctions of Islam or even contrary to the party manifesto.
For these reasons, the Constitution makers intentionally did not include the word “disqualification” of a member for any period of time in Article 63A,” Justice Mandokhail noted, adding that the Constitution permitted every member to cast his vote “freely” and “according to his conscience”, subject to reasonable restrictions.

4,HRCP calls for probe into allegations against NAB chief,"A woman, who testified before PAC, has accused NAB chief of sexual harassment, alleges PMO used her case to secure personal gains.","ISLAMABAD: The shocking allegations levelled against former National Accoun­tability Bureau head retired Justice Javed Iqbal must be investigated with transparency and independence, and he should be removed from office if these allegations are proved, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said on Friday. 
The commission said it took “serious note of the allegations of sexual harassment” levelled against the official, who was also chairman of the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (COIED).
“It is of a grave concern to the HRCP that these allegations were levelled by a woman who had approached Justice Iqbal in his capacity as COIED chairman — a position in which he was responsible for protecting [Tayyaba] Gul’s testimony and securing her right to seek justice for a missing relative,” says a commission statement.
Not only has Justice Iqbal allegedly abu­sed his office in two capacities, but he has also failed to appear before the Public Accounts Committee to answer these char­ges. 
The HRCP said it will follow up this demand for investigation and the process in the Public Accounts Committee.
On Thursday, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the National Assembly was stunned by the testimony of a woman who disclosed under oath that she was treated inhumanely and even strip-searched by officials of the accountability bureau. 
She also alleged that the Prime Minister Office used her case to secure its personal gains by blackmailing the NAB hierarchy and misusing evidence.
Testifying before the PAC, Tayyaba Gul had alleged that Azam Khan, former principal secretary to prime minister Imran Khan, respectively, had invited her for a meeting after she lodged a complaint on the Citizen Portal. 
In the complaint, she had accused then-NAB chairman Justice Iqbal of sexual harassment and had also attached screenshots from secretly-recorded footage.
She had told the PAC that Azam Khan asked for the video and assured her they would take action against Mr Iqbal, but the video was later aired on a television channel.
Ms Gul accused the PM Office of using the video to pressurise the then-NAB chief in a bid to get NAB inquires dropped. 
PAC Chairman Noor Alam Khan has already called for the suspension of Justice Iqbal and other officials.

5,"After Chakwal, journalist Imran Riaz Khan now in CIA custody","Lahore police arrested him from Chakwal and handed him over to CIA in case relating to mutiny abetment, criticism of institutions.","LAHORE: A team of the Lahore police arrested anchorperson Imran Riaz Khan from Chakwal and handed him over to the city’s Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) in a case lodged against him at the Civil Lines police station.
The case was lodged by a citizen, Muhammad Asif, a resident of Lahore’s Faiz Bagh area, on charges of abetment of mutiny and criticism of state institutions.
The journalist, who was taken into custody by Attock police near Islamabad on Tuesday night, was granted relief by a local court in the wee hours of Thursday, but was immediately arrested by a team of Chakwal police outside the courtroom. 
Bef­ore shifting him to Lahore, a local court of Chakwal district had allowed his judicial remand.
In the latest first information report (FIR) against Mr Khan to come to the fore, the complainant alleged he was browsing the internet when he saw a video clip of the journalist criticising the Pakistan Army. Mr Asif alleged that Imran Riaz accused the army of violating human rights and damaging the state by indulging in politics.
Mr Khan further said the army had put Pakistan’s integrity at stake, the complainant alleged, adding that the journalist committed an offence by inciting officers and other personnel of the army.
The complainant mentioned that recently Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had awarded army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa with the King Abdulaziz Medal for making “significant contributions to defence cooperation” between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
Mr Asif alleged in the FIR that the journalist also mocked the Saudi government’s decision in his video, and that Gen Bajwa went to Riyadh to seek the Kingdom’s financial help for the incumbent government in Pakistan.
Meanwhile, an official said police handed over the journalist to the CIA Kotwali police for interrogation. He is likely to be presented before the duty magistrate on Saturday (today).
Meanwhile, Mr Khan’s counsel, Mian Ali Ashfaq, alleged that police tried their best to shift his client to an undisclosed location, but his friends and brothers foiled the attempt. He said the journalist had been implicated in more than 20 criminal cases lodged against him in various police stations across Punjab.
