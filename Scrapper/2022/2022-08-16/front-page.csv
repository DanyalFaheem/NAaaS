0,MBS accepts invitation to visit Pakistan,Shehbaz thanks Saudi crown prince for ‘support in times of need’; PM seeks Uzbek investment in Pakistan; grieved by Giza fire,"ISLAMABAD: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman on Monday agreed to visit Pakistan on the invitation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The development came during a telephonic conversation between the two leaders where they also reiterated the resolve to strengthen bilateral ties and expedite cooperation in the fields of investment, energy and trade.
According to a handout issued by the Prime Minister Office, the crown prince congratulated Shehbaz Sharif and the people of Pakistan on the Independence Day and conveyed his best wishes for the country’s progress and prosperity.
The two leaders reviewed the progress made on the decisions taken during the prime minister’s visit to Riyadh in April, reads the handout.

Shehbaz thanks Saudi crown prince for ‘support in times of need’; PM seeks Uzbek investment in Pakistan; grieved by Giza fire

Recalling the historic support extended by Saudi Arabia to Pakistan in times of need, the prime minister thanked the crown prince for the “recent support for the stability and development of Pakistan’s economy”, apparently hinting at Riyadh’s plan to renew its $3 billion deposit with the State Bank.
Last week, Bloomberg reported the Saudi finance ministry has planned to renew the deposit ‘as soon as this week’. Moreover, the kingdom has also planned to provide $100 million a month for 10 months in petroleum products as additional support.
The report added that the assistance would plug Pakistan’s funding gap and pave the way for the IMF’s loan approval at the end of this month. The commitment is likely to be announced within two days.
The amount of $3bn was deposited by Saudi Arabia last year, when the PTI-led government was in power, to shore up Pakistan’s depleting foreign reserves.
Saudi Arabia had agreed to discuss the terms to extend the facility when the prime minister visited the kingdom in April on the crown prince’s invitation.
During that visit, the two leaders discussed ways to strengthen economic, investment and trade ties, said a joint statement issued at the conclusion of the three-day visit.
Separately, the two sides agreed to explore options to enhance the financing of petroleum products and support economic structural reforms in Pakistan.
In recent years, the crown prince has engaged in high-level contacts with the Pakistani leadership.
In February 2017, Pakistan rolled out the red carpet for Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman’s first official visit to the country. Former prime minister Imran Khan himself drove the visiting dignitary from the airport.
The highlight of that visit was a commitment from the crown prince ‘to look into the hardships faced by Pakistani labourers and prisoners’ in Saudi Arabia.
In reply to Mr Khan’s request, the Crown Prince told him to ‘consider me the ambassador of Pakistan in Saudi Arabia’.
Later, in May last year, the two sides signed a prisoner transfer agreement for repatriation of over 2,000 Pakistani prisoners languishing in Saudi jails.
Two months after the agreement, 62 Pakistani prisoners returned home.
Uzbek ambassador calls on PM
In a separate development, Uzbekistan’s Ambassador Oybek Usmanov called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday and conveyed greetings from Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyeyov.
According to the PMO, the ambassador said Mr Mirziyeyov was looking forward to welcoming the prime minister to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Samarkand next month.
The prime minister expressed satisfaction with the close and fraternal relations between the two countries, said the PMO.
He underlined the significance of the Trans-Afghan Railway Project to advance the connectivity agenda and promote regional prosperity.
Mr Sharif invited Uzbek investments in Special Economic Zones which would accrue mutual benefits, the PMO added.
“Prime Minister Sharif underscored the need to urgently operationalise the Transit Trade Agreement and Preferential Trade Agreement in order to fully unlock the immense bilateral economic potential,”’ the statement added.
Mr Sharif reiterated the commitment to provide transit access to the Central Asian states to the ports of Karachi and Gwadar.
Separately, in a tweet, the prime minister expressed grief over the loss of precious lives in a fire incident in Abu Sefein Church in Egypt’s Giza city.
“On behalf of the people of Pakistan, I extend my most sincere condolences to [President Abdel Fattah al Sisi and] families of the deceased and pray for the speedy recovery of those injured,” he tweeted.

1,Minister gives time frame for Nawaz’s return,"Those who ‘removed Nawaz and brought in Imran’ haven’t learned anything, says Latif","LAHORE: A federal minister of the PML-N on Monday claimed that former premier Nawaz Sharif is set to return to the country next month, ending his three-year ‘self-imposed exile’ in London. His ‘announcement’ comes a couple of days after Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan alleged that ‘several conspiracies’ were being hatched to disqualify him and pave the way for Nawaz’s return.
However, Mr Javed Latif’s party colleagues feign ignorance to any news regarding Nawaz’s supposedly impending return to the country, though they admit it will happen soon.
Addressing a press conference here, Mr Latif, who is yet to be assigned a portfolio in the Shehbaz Sharif cabinet, said: “Nawaz Sharif is coming back to Pakistan in September to lead the nation. He will be accorded a historic welcome upon his return.”
“Nawaz was disqualified by former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar under the doctrine of necessity. Now, he should be given a level-playing field so that the country can move forward,” the minister demanded.

Those who ‘removed Nawaz and brought in Imran’ haven’t learned anything, says Latif

He was critical of the role of judiciary in the country’s politics, saying the “judicial coup” was started by justice Munir and reached its peak during the tenure of justice Nisar.
Flanked by PML-N Punjab information secretary Azma Bokhari, Latif, who had also been jailed on charges of inciting people against state institutions, indirectly blamed the military establishment for not learning any lesson by removing Nawaz and installing Imran.
“Those who removed Nawaz and brought in Imran have not yet learnt anything. Some elements (in the establishment) are still supporting Imran… otherwise he wouldn’t bein Banigala (but jail),” he claimed.
Latif, who has in the past announced different deadlines for Nawaz’s return, is not taken seriously by his party’s main leadership. Federal Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb did not respond to Dawn’s query about Latif’s claim despite repeated attempts.
Another one of his colleagues in the cabinet, Ahsan Iqbal, did not confirm the claims either. “It is not in my knowledge that Nawaz Sharif is returning next month,” he maintained.
However, a PML-N leader Dawn spoke to confirmed “something is cooking regarding Nawaz’s homecoming”. He said not only the PML-N was working on bringing in legislation in parliament to undo the lifetime ban of Nawaz, but backdoor talks were also under way with the powers that be.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah has already declared that the coalition government might make certain amendments that would help repeal the ban imposed on Nawaz by a Supreme Court judgement in the Panama Papers case against him.
“Parliament can undo the lifetime ban on politicians and it may not be struck down by the court. Nawaz will be the ultimate beneficiary if this legislation is brought to parliament and subsequently adopted,” a party insider had told Dawn.
On Saturday night, addressing a jam-packed PTI rally at the National Hockey Stadium here, Imran Khan had referred to alleged pressure from powerful quarters on him to agree on ‘nullifying’ Nawaz’s lifetime disqualification so he could contest the next general elections in 2023.
“A plot is being hatched to disqualify me in the Toshakhana and prohibited funding cases to pave the way for Nawaz Sharif’s return from London by the end of September,” he had said.
Nawaz not to face jail on return
During the presser, Javed Latif also announced that his party would not let Nawaz go to jail upon his return, as ‘injustice’ had been meted out to him in his case.
In the face of rising popularity of the PTI chairman, who was ousted as the prime minister in April, the entire PML-N leadership is unanimous that the party needs Nawaz in Pakistan ahead of the polls if it wants to score a victory.
Despite a vigorous campaign by Maryam Nawaz, the PML-N faced a crushing defeat in the by-polls held in July that cost the Sharifs their Punjab ‘citadel’. Only Nawaz can handle Imran Khan in the political field, as per the PML-N senior leadership.
An ‘ailing’ Nawaz Sharif has been in London since November 2019 for medical treatment after the high court allowed him a four-week reprieve. He was serving a seven-year imprisonment in the Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore in the Al-Azizia corruption case before his departure to London on ‘medical grounds’ which Imran Khan and his party declared that the elder Sharif feigned an illness to flee the country.

2,Kashmiris mark India’s independence with protests,Decry New Delhi's atrocities amid increase in “search and cordon operations” by Indian forces in Srinagar and its surroundings.,"

(CLOCKWISE) Members of civil society release black balloons in Islamabad’s F-9 Park to express solidarity with the people of India-held Kashmir; an Indian paramilitary soldier guards the street leading to Srinagar’s Lal Chowk as residents observed Aug 15 as a ‘Black Day’ to protest against Delhi’s continuous disregard for UNSC resolutions; and, participants of a rally chant anti-India slogans during a demonstration in Muzaffarabad, on Monday.—Mohammad Asim / AFP / Dawn

 
MUZAFFARABAD: As India marked the 76th anniversary of its independence, Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) protested the atrocities unleashed by New Dehli in the occupied region amid an increase in the intensity of “search and cordon operations” by the Indian forces in Srinagar and its surroundings.
In Muzaffarabad, a rally was taken out under the aegis of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir government and Pasban-i-Hurriyat Jammu Kashmir (PHJK), an organisation of post-1989 migrants from held Kash­mir, to remind the international community that there was no place for India in the hearts of the Kashmiris.
Participants of the rally were wearing black armbands and walked from Burhan Wani Chowk to Garhi Pan Chowk, holding black flags.
“India’s Independence Day is Black Day for people of Jammu and Kashmir,” read a banner carried by protesters.
“India’s Independence Day has always been a ‘black day’ for the Kashmiris because they celebrate their freedom in brazen denial of the same privilege to the Kashmiris [in occupied region]. They also subject them to war crimes,” PHJK chief Uzair Ahmed Ghazali said on the occasion.
Mr Ghazali said the Indian government had recently launched an “abhorrent campaign” in held Kashmir whereby it was forcing Kashmiris to buy and hoist the Indian flag on their houses, educational institutions, and business centres.
“Those families whose one or the other member has lost life in state-sponsored terrorism are particularly being coerced to hoist Indian flags in an extreme form of tyranny,” he said. “If that campaign does not stop there, we will start a drive to tear, trample and burn India’s flags here in the liberated territory and elsewhere in the world,” he said.
Altaf Ahmed Butt, an AJK-based pro-freedom leader whose elder brother Zaffar Akbar Butt has been in jail since 2018, told Dawn that even though India had put numerous curbs on the oppressed Kashmiris to keep them disconnected from the rest of the world, reports suggested that a shutter down strike was observed in the region to denounce India’s Independence Day.
Ahead of this year’s Independence Day, he said, Indian authorities launched a “Tiranga (tricolor flag) hoisting drive”. Kashmiris were asked to not only hoist the Indian flag but also post its pictures on their social media accounts, he said and added that at least 40 Kashmiris were sacked from government services, including a son of Syed Salahuddin and spouse of incarcerated Farooq Dar alias Bitta Karate, as a part of a crackdown on Kashmiri Muslims.
Meanwhile, in a statement, AJK Prime Minister Sardar Tanvir Ilyas said that observance of India’s Independence Day by Kashmiris as a ‘black day’ was an open expression of their “hatred and condemnation against India’s illegal and forcible control over their motherland”.
OUR CORRESPONDENT ADDS FROM NEW DELHI: Cordon and search operations by security forces intensified in and around Srinagar where a shutter down strike was observed on the day India won freedom.
In a telling picture of what appeared to be Srinagar’s Lal Chowk city square, a man painted in the colour of the Indian national flag could be seen posing victoriously against a background of empty streets and shops with shutters down.
Traditionally, Kashmiris opposed to Indian rule in their state have celebrated August 14 with fervour and August 15 with protests. Going by scant reports out of the valley on Monday, unlike the previous years, the crackdown appears to have been severe.
The Hindustan Times said a civilian and a policeman were injured in two grenade attacks by alleged militants that took place in Budgam and Srinagar districts on Monday. In the first attack in Budgam district, they hurled a grenade in the Gopalpora Chadoora area, injuring a civilian, identified as Karan Kumar Singh. Shortly after that, suspected militants hurled a grenade at a police control room in Batamaloo locality of Srinagar, resulting in minor injuries to a policeman, according to reports.
According to the Hindustan Times, the attacks came a day after an encounter broke out between alleged militants and security forces in Srinagar’s Nowhatta in which a police constable, Sarfaraz Ahmad, succumbed to his injuries.

3,"Petrol price raised, HSD, kerosene rates cut",Price of petrol raised by Rs6.72 per litre to Rs233.91; light diesel oil rate inched up by 43 paisa per litre to Rs191.75.,"ISLAMABAD: The government raised the price of petrol and reduced those of high speed diesel (HSD) and kerosene on Monday for the next fortnight.
According to an annou­ncement by the ministry of finance, the rate of petrol and light diesel oil (LDO) was increased by Rs6.72 and 43 paisa per litre, respectively. On the other hand, the prices of high speed diesel (HSD) and kerosene were cut by 51 paisa and Rs1.67 per litre respectively.
“In the wake of fluctuations in petroleum prices in the international market and exchange rate variation, the government has decided to revise the existing prices of petroleum products to pass on the impact to consumers”, said the ministry of finance.
As such, the ex-depot price of petrol was raised to Rs233.91 from Rs227.19, showing an increase of Rs6.72 per litre, or 3pc.
The price of light diesel oil inched up by an inconsequential 43 paisa per litre to Rs191.75 per litre from Rs191.32 at present.
On the other hand, the ex-depot price of HSD was set at Rs244.44 per litre, down from Rs244.95 per litre at present, with a notional cut of 51 paisa, or 0.2pc. Likewise, the ex-depot rate of kerosene was cut to Rs199.40 per litre from Rs201.07 per litre, down by Rs1.67 per liter, or 0.8pc.
The government is charging a petroleum development levy of Rs20 per litre on petrol and Rs10 each on HSD, kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) in line with commitment with the international Monetary fund.
Read: New govt pays big price to placate IMF
On August 1, the government had increased the price of HSD and kerosene by Rs9 and Rs5 per litre and reduced those of petrol by Rs3 per litre. Earlier on July 14, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced a reduction of Rs18 to 40 per litre in the prices of various products as international prices have gone down.
That was the first time the PMLN-led coalition government reduced petroleum prices after it came to power in the second week of April.
Between May 26 and July 1, the petrol price had risen by 66pc, or Rs99 per litre, while HSD price went up by 92pc since May 26 from Rs144.15 per liter, up by 132.39 per liter. Likewise, the ex-depot price of kerosene had gone up to Rs230.26 per liter, up by 95pc between May 26 and July 1. Similarly, the ex-depot price of LDO went up to Rs226.15 on July 1, up 80pc from Rs125.56 per litre on May 26, up by about Rs100.59 per litre.
Under the deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the government has to gradually increase PDL on oil products to a maximum of Rs50 to collect Rs 855 billion during the current fiscal year.
The petroleum levy had come to an end after the March 1 price revision as international prices were going up and the PTI government had decided to not only reduce petroleum prices by Rs10 per litre but also froze it for next four months i.e. until June 30.
After initial indecision, the PML-N led coalition has been increasing petroleum prices since May 15 under the IMF deal.
At present, the GST is zero on all the key products including petrol, HSD, kerosene and LDO against 17pc normal GST. The government is also charging about Rs20 per litre custom duty on petrol and HSD.
The PTI-led government had given a commitment to IMF for Rs4 per litre increase in PL in December last year on the first day of every month to a maximum of Rs30 per liter, but reversed it on February 28.

4,Who will be the next army chief?,"4 of 6 top Lt-Gens at time of Gen Bajwa’s retirement will be from same batch, while a fifth is senior to almost the entire lot.","ISLAMABAD: It is almost time for the government to make what is likely to be one of the toughest calls of its tenure: who to appoint as the next chief of Pakistan’s Army.
A senior Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader — a member of the federal cabinet — hinted in background discussions that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif could initiate discussions on the appointment by the end of August, and pos­s­ibly take a decision by mid-September.
The general perception is that he will consult his allies in the ruling coalition before making a final call. A source in the Pakistan Peoples Party, however, suggested that the party may not want to get involved as it is the prime minister’s prerogative to make the decision.
According to Article 243(3) of the Constitution, the president appoints the services chiefs on the recommendation of the prime minister.

Four of the six top Lt-Gens at the time of Gen Bajwa’s retirement will be from the same batch, while a fifth is senior to almost the entire lot.

Schedule V-A of the Rules of Business, which elaborates the cases to be presented to the prime minister for his approval, states that: “[…] the appointment of, and above the rank of, lieutenant-general in the army and equivalent ranks in the other Defence Services will be made by the prime minister in consultation with the president.”
The manner in which this process plays out, however, is less clearly defined in the rule books. Nor have any specific criteria been laid down for consideration for elevation, except for the vague condition that the general chosen to lead the army should have commanded a corps.
The tradition is that General Headquarters (GHQ) sends a list of the four to five senior-most lieutenant-generals, along with their personnel files, to the Ministry of Defence, which then forwards them to the prime minister to pick the officer he finds best suited to the role.
Theoretically, the defence ministry can vet the names before presenting them to the prime minister, but that does not usually happen and the ministry acts merely as a post office.
The credentials of the generals are then deliberated either at Prime Minister’s Office or in the cabinet. The matter comes down to the prime minister’s ‘informal consultation’ with the outgoing army chief, his own perceptions and his discussions with his closest advisors.
Keen observers also talk about an ‘institutional recommendation’, which is given to the prime minister about a particular candidate. However, at least two former defence secretaries have rubbished this claim. They insist that it is only the outgoing army chief, during his ‘informal consultation’ with the prime minister, who provides personal input on who he thinks should succeed him.
Of the ten army chiefs the country has had since 1972, five were appointed by the incumbent’s elder brother, Mian Nawaz Sharif, in separate tenures as prime minister. The elder Sharif was repeatedly criticised for appointing officers he saw as an ‘apna banda’ (his man). Ironically, none of the appointments worked out very well for him.
The experience has reportedly left the Sharifs with the belief that they will never quite get it right. Some PML-N leaders said in background interviews that they have, therefore, more or less decided that instead of succumbing to the temptation of finding an ‘ideal’ candidate, they will make the appointment based on seniority alone.
“Then, no matter how things turn out, we will at least be content that no personal choices were involved,” one party leader said.
However, another group within the party speculates that PM Shehbaz Sharif may simply go along with the current chief’s advice.
Transitioning out
Appointed in 2016, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa is set to retire in the last week of November. The army chief’s appointment is meant to be for three years, but Gen Bajwa was given an additional three-year term in 2019 after a bit of political drama. Then-prime minister Imran Khan had given him an extension in August, but the Supreme Court later demanded legislation on the re-appointment of the services chiefs.
Parliament complied in January 2020, allowing the prime minister to extend the tenure of services chiefs at his discretion. The legislation had, however, fixed 64 as the age at which a service chief must be retired.
Gen Bajwa, still 61, can therefore be eligible for another term. This technicality had led to speculation that the incumbent may be seeking or interested in another extension. But according to a military source, Gen Bajwa has communicated to those around him that he will retire in November. Inter-Services Public Relations, too, has confirmed that the chief is, indeed, retiring.
The army chief’s is not the only four-star position that will fall vacant in November. Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) Gen Nadeem Raza will also be retiring at the same time. The simultaneous appointment of two four-star generals gives the government a little bit of space to pick a commander for the army without causing too much consternation among the top brass.
Interestingly, four of the six senior lieutenant-generals at the time of Gen Bajwa’s retirement are from the same batch. The seniority of this lot is determined on a technical basis — ie, through the PA number assigned to them from their training days at the PMA — and may or may not be of consequence when the new CJCSC and COAS are chosen. Among the other two, one is senior to almost the entire lot, while the other one is relatively junior.
Lt-Gen Asim Munir


Lt-Gen Asim Munir

 
At the time when the decision to appoint the next CJCSC and COAS is made, Lt-Gen Asim Munir will be the senior-most among the lot. Although he was promoted to the rank of two-star general in September 2018, he took charge two months later. As a result, his four-year tenure as Lt-Gen will end on November 27, around the same time when the incumbent CJCSC and COAS will be doffing their army uniform. Since the recommendations and decisions for the appointment of the two four-star generals are to be made a little earlier, it would be for Gen Bajwa to decide if his name is to be included and for the prime minister to make the final call. He is an outstanding officer, but because of the technicalities involved, he may remain the proverbial dark horse.
Lt- Gen Munir entered the service via the Officers Training School (OTS) programme in Mangla, and was commissioned into the Frontier Force Regiment. He has been a close aide of the incumbent COAS ever since he commanded troops in the Force Command Northern Areas as a brigadier under Gen Bajwa, who was then Commander X Corps. He was later appointed DG Military Intelligence in early 2017, and in October next year was made the ISI chief. However, his stint as the top intelligence officer turned out to be the shortest ever, as he was replaced by Lt-Gen Faiz Hamid within eight months, on the insistence of then-PM Imran Khan. He was posted as Gujranwala Corps commander, a position he held for two years, before being moved to the GHQ as Quartermaster General.
Lt-Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza


Lt-Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza

 
In the current cohort, Lt-Gen Mirza is senior-most amongst the four candidates belonging to the same batch. He hails from the Sindh Regiment; the same parent unit as the outgoing CJCSC, Gen Nadeem Raza. He has had an impressive career in the army, particularly in senior leadership positions during the past seven years. Lt-Gen Mirza came to prominence as director-general military operations (DGMO) during the last two years of Gen Raheel Sharif’s tenure. In that role, he was part of Gen Sharif’s core team at GHQ, which supervised the military operation against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militants in North Waziristan. Further, he was closely involved in the Quadrilateral Coordination Group (QCG) that brokered intra-Afghan talks involving Pakistan, China, Afghanistan and the United States. Besides, he was also a member of the Sartaj Aziz-led committee on reforms for Gilgit-Baltistan.
After his promotion to the three-star rank, he was appointed chief of general staff, effectively making him the second-most powerful person in the army after the COAS. In that role, he was closely engaged in crucial decision-making related to national security and foreign affairs. He also joined former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi in strategic talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in 2021.
In October 2021, he was posted as Corps Commander Rawalpindi to enable him to acquire operational experience and become eligible to be considered for the top posts.
A military source, while commenting on his profile, said he was the clear frontrunner for either of the two posts of COAS and CJCSC.
Lt-Gen Azhar Abbas


Lt-Gen Azhar Abbas

 
Lt-Gen Abbas is most experienced in Indian affairs among the current brass. Currently, he is the chief of general staff (CGS), effectively running the army with direct oversight of both operations and intelligence directorates at GHQ. Prior to that, he commanded the Rawalpindi-based but Kashmir-centric and politically-significant X Corps, which indicates that he enjoys the complete trust of the present army chief. It was during his time as commander X Corps that the Indian and Pakistani armies reached an understanding on respecting the 2003 ceasefire agreement along the LOC, and it was Lt-Gen Abbas’s job to ensure compliance on it.
Previously, Lt-Gen Abbas served as commandant of the Infantry School, Quetta. He was the personal staff officer of the former army chief, Gen Raheel Sharif — a position which gave him a ringside view of the decision-making processes at the highest-level. That stint also enabled him to interact with the PML-N leadership as well as the top leadership of friendly countries. After that, he commanded the 12th Infantry Division based in Murree, from where he was responsible for Azad Jammu & Kashmir.
Lt-Gen Nauman Mehmood


Lt-Gen Nauman Mehmood

 
Belonging to the Baloch Regiment, Lt-Gen Mehmood is currently president of the National Defence University. He also has extensive experience as chief instructor at the Command and Staff College, Quetta. He has commanded an infantry division based in North Waziristan. From there, he was posted as director-general (Analysis) at the ISI, playing a crucial role in foreign policy analysis from a national security perspective. That posting provided him with the opportunity of liaising with foreign intelligence agencies on behalf of the ISI.
On his promotion as a three-star general in 2019, he was appointed inspector-general of Communications & Information Technology, GHQ. In December 2019, he was sent to the Peshawar-based XI Corps. From there, he oversaw security along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and its fencing at a time when the US withdrew its forces.
In November 2021, he handed over command of the XI Corps to Lt-Gen Faiz Hamid.
Lt-Gen Faiz Hamid


Lt-Gen Faiz Hamid

 
Lt-Gen Hamid, too, belongs to the Baloch Regiment and is one of the most widely-discussed contenders among the competitors for the top office. Gen Bajwa and Lt-Gen Hamid have reportedly known each other for long. As brigadier, Lt-Gen Hamid served as chief of staff of the X Corps under Gen Bajwa, who was then commanding the corps.
At the time of Gen Bajwa’s appointment as COAS, Lt-Gen Hamid was a two-star general and was commanding an infantry division in Pano Aqil, Sindh. Soon after his promotion as army chief, Gen Bajwa posted him as director-general (Counter-Intelligence) at ISI, where he was not only responsible for internal security, but also political affairs.
After his promotion to the three-star rank, he was initially appointed adjutant-general at the GHQ in April 2019. But only two months later, in a surprise move, he was appointed DG ISI. In that role, Lt-Gen Hamid was active in supporting the government on issues as diverse as renegotiating contracts with power-sector IPPs, reforming governance, and reviving the economy etc, aside from traditional foreign policy issues and national security challenges.
In the last phase of his stint as head of the ISI, he became focus of a controversy between Imran Khan and the COAS as the latter had decided to post him as commander of the Peshawar Corps and the former was not willing to relieve him. He was ultimately posted out to Peshawar, where he served for less than a year before being moved to the Bahawalpur Corps.
Some political pundits say it might be difficult, if not impossible, for the PML-N leadership to consider him for the post of the next COAS due to the highly-publicised nature of his role as ISI chief during the last government’s tenure.
Lt-Gen Mohammad Amir


Lt-Gen Mohammad Amir

 
Lt-Gen Amir belongs to the Artillery Regiment and is, at present, commanding the XXX Corps in Gujranwala. He is considered a close confidant of Gen Bajwa. Previously, he was adjutant-general at the GHQ. As major-general, he commanded the 10 Infantry Division stationed in Lahore from 2017-18. He has also served as director-general Staff Duties at the COAS Secretariat, giving him considerable experience in both GHQ and command positions. Prior to that, he was military secretary to then President Asif Zardari from 2011-13.
