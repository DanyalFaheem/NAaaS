After two good chances for Roma by winger Nicolo Zaniolo, and a close attempt by Salernitana striker Federico Bonazzoli, Jose Mourinho’s men finally took the lead in the 33rd minute. 
Cristante fired a low shot from outside the crowded box to put Roma ahead as the ball bounced off the pitch twice before it landed in bottom right corner. 
Roma’s new signing Dybala came close to doubling their lead before the break but his strike hit the right post.  The 28-year-old continued his search for goal after the halftime as he hit the ball from a tight angle on the edge of the six-yard box, sending it just off the right post. 
Substitute Georginio Wijnaldum was even closer than Dybala to scoring on his Roma debut as he found the net after receiving a neat pass from Dybala in the 86th minute, but the referee disallowed his effort for offside. 
Earlier on Sunday, an own goal by Lorenzo De Silvestri cost Bologna dearly as it allowed 10-man Lazio to bounce back from one goal down and seal a 2-1 home win helped by Ciro Immobile’s 183th goal for the Rome-based club. 
Italy striker Immobile coolly slotted home the winner with 11 minutes remaining at the Stadio Olimpico to complete a comeback which looked unlikely when the hosts went a man down in the fourth minute. 
Goalkeeper Luis Maximiano was sent off for handling outside his own area, and Lazio were a goal down in the 38th minute after a silly foul on Nicola Sansone led to a penalty which Marko Arnautovic happily tucked away. 
Lazio were level in terms of on-pitch personnel going in at the break after Adama Soumaoro picked up two bookings in the space of five minutes at the end of the first half. And they were level in the 68th minute thanks to De Silvestri’s own goal, the Italian watching on in horror as Manuel Lazzari’s cross was patted onto him by goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski and then rolled into his own net. 
Lazio were in the ascendency and Immobile netted the winner after being put through by Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. 
Fiorentina, meanwhile, were handed three points on a silver platter thanks to a clumsy mistake by Cremonese goalkeeper Ionut Radu in the dying minutes, which condemned the recently promoted side to a 3-2 defeat.  In Sunday’s other late match Spezia beat Empoli 1-0 thanks to a strike from M’Bala Nzola.

The son of Enak out-of-Runaway Cherie, Sea Bird registered a runaway success in record timing of one minute, 17 3/5 seconds over the race run over 1,300 metres, in the process bettering the record of one minute, 18 seconds set up by bay horse Gujrat One in 2018.  He beat filly Queen by eight lengths, who nosed out Fox Trot to third place.
The main supporting event, the Jashn-e-Azadi Cup run over 1,100 metres, was won by bay horse Silent Assassin, who registered an easy success from bay Drums Of War by a distance in one minute, 5 1/5 seconds.
Once again the equine sports connoisseurs witnessed impressive racing action in the Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar Cup in which chestnut horse Galactic Song recorded a stunning victory to claim the cup named after one of the close comrades of the Father Of The Nation, Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.
Favourite bay colt Chacha won the third race convincingly. It opened a 60 to 100 favourite but soon its odds eased upwards to evens when it was suspected that something was wrong with the colt. However, the Club’s veterinary officer examined and certified the colt as fit in every respect.  Eventually, he beat Golden Pound by seven lengths. 
Earlier bay colts Wonder Boy and Chota Pathan won the first and second races, respectively.

Marseille moved to four points alongside Racing Lens, Lille, Monaco and Toulouse while champions PSG, who beat Montpellier 5-2 on Saturday, are the only side with two wins and sit on top with six points. 
Sunday’s clash between Lorient and Olympique Lyonnais, both opening-weekend winners, was called off because of the poor state of the pitch at the Stade du Moustoir. 
Marseille, who brought on new signing Alexis Sanchez at half-time for his debut, were ahead after 38 minutes as another newcomer, Nuno Tavares, scored with a header but Pierre Lees-Melous’ superb strike just after the hour mark was reward for Brest who might well have gone on to win the match at the Stade Francis-Le Ble. 
Toulouse enjoyed their first win back in Ligue 1 after promotion with a 3-0 victory at Troyes while Racing Lens drew away at Ajaccio earlier on Sunday. 
Clermont came from two goals down to beat Stade Reims 4-2 and leave them bottom of the standings. 
Nice, who gave Kasper Schmeichel his debut after signing the Danish goalkeeper from Leicester City, were held 1-1 at home by Racing Strasbourg. 
Auxerre, back in the top flight after a decades absence, were 2-0 up in 10 minutes against Angers through Julien Jeanvier and a Cedric Hountondji own goal but let their chance of a first win of the campaign slip as Lois Diony reduced the deficit and then, after Lassine Sinayoko was sent off, Amine Salama equalised 13 minutes from time.

3,Halep clinches third WTA Canadian crown,"TORONTO: Simona Halep kept control against unpredictable Beatriz Haddad Maia on Sunday, beating the Brazilian 6-3,...","TORONTO: Simona Halep kept control against unpredictable Beatriz Haddad Maia on Sunday, beating the Brazilian 6-3, 2-6, 6-3 to win a third WTA Masters 1000 title in Canada.
The former world number one from Romania added the trophy in Toronto to those she captured in Montreal in 2016 and 2018.
She needed two and a quarter hours to deny the South American left-hander the upset victory.
Halep shrugged of nine double-faults and broke Haddad Maia five times from 10 chances as she became the third player with at least nine WTA 1000 titles, after Serena Williams (13) and Victoria Azarenka (10).
Halep, who was playing in her ninth final at the elite level as Haddad Maia tackled her first, won her 38th match of the season and claimed her biggest success since the Rome trophy in May, 2020.
After a year outside of the world’s top-10 she is projected to rise to sixth this week with the start of the US Open approaching on Aug 29.
Haddad Maia, enjoying a breakout season that included grasscourt titles at Birmingham and Nottingham in June, had toppled world number one Iga Swiatek on her way to the final.
She struck first with a break on the way to a quick 3-0 lead. But Halep, a two-time Grand Slam champion, quickly responded, winning the opening set as she spun off six straight games to claim the opener 6-3, in 50 minutes.
Haddad Maia answered in the opening game of the second set with a break, consolidating through a double break for 4-0 before Halep stopped the rot to hold for 1-4.
The Brazilian delivered a huge serve on set point three games later to square the contest at a set each.
But Halep came out ahead after they traded three breaks of serve in the final set, wrapping it up on her second match point as Haddad Maia fired a service return into the net.
CARRENO BUSTA HALTS HURKACZ FINALS WIN
In Montreal, Pablo Carreno Busta seized his first ATP Masters title on Sunday, spoiling Hubert Hurkacz’s perfect record in ATP finals with a  Montreal Masters triumph.
Carreno Busta became the first unseeded  winner in Canada in two decades.
The 23rd-ranked Spaniard beat eighth-seeded Hurkacz 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 to become the first unseeded winner in Canada in two decades.
Carreno Busta notched his seventh ATP title, but his first in an elite Masters 1000 event in his first opportunity.
Poland’s Hurkacz had been  unbeaten in five finals, Carreno Busta putting the first blemish on that  record in just over an hour and three quarters.
He survived 18  aces from Hurkacz to become the first Canadian champion ranked outside  the Top 20 since number 43 Andrei Pavel in 2001 at Montreal.
Carreno Busta is the third Spanish winner after five-time champion Rafael Nadal and Manuel Orantes in 1975.
The first two sets were mirror images with Hurkacz breaking in the sixth game on his way to winning the opener.
In  the second Carreno Busta, who is projected to rise to 14th in the  world, claimed a break in the second game and held his margin to leave  the match hanging at one set each.
Two breaks in the final set  sealed the win for Carreno Busta, who wrapped it up on his first match  point as he broke Hurkacz for the win.

Odean Smith improved on his career-best T20I bowling figures for the third time in four matches as the fast bowling all-rounder claimed three for 29.
That helped limit the Black Caps to 145-7 after captain Kane Williamson chose to bat first.
New Zealand had already wrapped up the series by margins of 13 and 90 runs in the first two matches.
West Indies’ platform for the comfortable win was established by openers Shamarh Brooks (56 not out) and Brandon King (53) in a 102-run opening stand.  
Leading the side in the absence of regular captain Nicholas Pooran, Rovman Powell sealed victory in style off the last ball of the 19th over as the home side reached 150 for two.
New Zealand struggled to establish any sort of batting momentum although Glen Phillips was again in prime form, top-scoring with 41 off 26 balls before falling to Smith at the start of the 17th over. Left-arm spinner Akeal Hosein claimed two for 28.

8,Musiala scores again as Bayern ease past Wolfsburg,BERLIN: Champions Bayern Munich made it two Bundesliga wins from two matches when they comfortably beat visitors VfL...,"BERLIN: Champions Bayern Munich made it two Bundesliga wins from two matches when they comfortably beat visitors VfL Wolfsburg 2-0 on Sunday with goals from Jamal Musiala and Thomas Mueller. 
The Bavarians, who have now scored eight goals in their first two league matches, were lethal in attack, especially in the first half, with Sadio Mane, Serge Gnabry, Mueller and the league’s leading scorer Musiala wreaking havoc in their opponents’ box. 
Mane also put the ball in the net twice more but his efforts were cancelled by VAR reviews for offside. 
“It was obviously not the big show of the first two matches [including Bayern’s 5-3 Super Cup win over RB Leipzig],” Mueller said. 
The Bavarians had crushed Eintracht Frankfurt 6-1 in their Bundesliga opener last week. 
“We struggled a bit in the first 10 minutes. Wolfsburg played a lot of long balls to get out of our pressing. We needed some time but got going and maybe we could have scored one or two more goals.” 
Wolfsburg roared out of the blocks and almost forced a Bayern own goal when Canadian Alphonso Davies hit the post from an attempted clearance. 
Bayern gradually took control and Germany international Musiala showed great skill and power to shrug off two markers, stay up and drill in for the lead in the 33rd minute. 
The 19-year-old Musiala, who declared himself eligible for Germany in 2021 despite playing for England as a junior, now has four goals in three competitive matches to start the season. 
The Wolves were soon reduced to desperate attempts at stopping the waves of Bayern attacks but Mueller, in his 417th Bundesliga game that lifted him to fourth on the all-time Bayern list, wrongfooted keeper Koen Casteels by stabbing in a Joshua Kimmich shot two minutes before the break. 
Wolfsburg, led by former Bayern coach Niko Kovac, rarely had a look-in and managed just one shot on target in the entire game even after Bayern took their foot off the gas in the second half. 
Elsewhere, Mainz 05 and Union Berlin split the points after a dour 0-0 draw at a two-thirds full Mewa Arena in 31-degree heat.

9,Anderson  says England excited by ‘Bazball’ ahead of  SA series,New coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes have orchestrated four thrilling Test wins in a row this summer.,"LONDON: England seamer James Anderson says his side now only know one way to play and will not deviate from their attacking brand of cricket even if they are under pressure in the three Test series against South Africa that starts at Lord’s on Wednesday.
New coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes have orchestrated four thrilling Test wins in a row this summer, chasing over 275 in the fourth innings on each occasion.
Those wins over New Zealand and India have come via their new Bazball style of relentlessly attacking with bat and ball, even when the side is seemingly in trouble.
The switch in fortunes comes after England had won just once in their previous 17 Tests before the new leadership group took over. 
“At the minute, Ben and Brendon have an idea of how they want us to play our cricket so we are buying into that and trying to play our way and we are absolutely loving doing it,” Anderson told reporters on Monday. 
“There might be times when we do come unstuck and moments when things don’t go our way, but I think the fact that we are buying into this and enjoying doing it is exciting for the whole group.”  
Anderson, who is England’s all-time leading Test wicket-taker with 657, turned 40 last month, but believes he still has plenty to offer the team. 
“I don’t feel old or like I’m slowing down or anything,” he said.  “The last few weeks I’ve been working hard at training, trying to work on my bowling again and keep that ticking over. 
“The last couple of days I’ve felt in great rhythm and hopefully I can show that on the field.”  
England will have the chance to climb the ICC Test Championship ladder from their current seventh position as they host table-topping South Africa, who have a number of injury concerns and a relatively inexperienced top six batting line-up that Anderson will be keen to get stuck into.

The Pakistan weightlifter had rewritten the record books at the Commonwealths in Birmingham earlier this month when he lifted a total of 405kg to take gold in the +109kg final but was a distant fourth at the Islamic Games in Konya on Monday.
His total of 378kg saw him miss out on a podium finish with Tokyo Olympic champion Akbar Djuraev of Uzbekistan taking gold with a lift totalling 446kg.

The 22-year-old paceman suffered a knee injury on the recent tour of Sri Lanka, a worrying setback with the Asia Cup — and a meeting with old rivals India — coming up at the end of the month.
Pakistan team bosses do not want to overload a fast bowler who has already played 97 times across all three formats since his international debut just four years ago. 
“We’re taking a couple of doctors with us to take care of Shaheen and want him to play a game against Netherlands to see if he’s fit and ready for the Asia Cup,” Pakistan skipper Babar Azam said.
“But we have 11 trump cards. Each of them can be match winners on their day. I have faith in every one of them, whether batters or bowlers.” The series in Rotterdam was postponed due to Covid in 2020.
It forms part of the 13-nation Super League from where the top seven teams plus hosts India will qualify for the 2023 World Cup.
Pakistan are currently third with 90 points, having beaten a formidable Australia 2-1 in their last ODI series at home.
Failure to make the top seven would mean having to negotiate a perilous route through a qualifying competition.
“There are important Super League points at stake which we can’t lose,” said Babar, who may be stunned to find Europe baking in a heatwave.
“I think the conditions will be similar to England. The weather will be cooler so we have practiced with the air conditioning on indoors, perhaps that helps simulate the conditions,” he said Thursday on the team’s departure for Europe.
The two teams have only played three ODIs — all in multi-national events at the 1996 (Pakistan) and 2003 (South Africa) World Cups and 2002 Champions Trophy (Sri Lanka). Pakistan won all three.
After qualifying for the Twenty20 World Cup to be played in Australia later this year, the Netherlands are seeking a huge lift in their 50-over fortunes.
They are placed last in the Super League, having won only two of their 16 matches with one no-result and 13 defeats.
Those two wins — against Ireland — followed 12 straight losses in series against Afghanistan, New Zealand, West Indies and England.
England also smashed a world record total of 498-4 against them in June.
But new skipper Scott Edwards believes playing against bigger nations has helped his young team. 
“ODI cricket is still a benchmark for Associates,” said Edwards, who replaced Pieter Seelaar as skipper in June. 
“We have got a lot of young cricketers coming through who have got exposure against England and New Zealand. I am excited for the next two, three years. 
“We play Pakistan which is another opportunity to face world-class bowlers and batters and that is a huge preparation for us to fine-tune our skills for the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia. 
“It’s been an awesome summer for the players for this opportunity to play these bigger nations. There is a little bit of shame that we haven’t got some wins on the board.” 
Pakistan have dropped out of form fast bowler Hasan Ali who is replaced by rookie pacer Naseem Shah while Shahnawaz Dahani, Haris Rauf and Mohammad Wasim Junior are the other quicks in the squad.
The Netherlands, meanwhile, have recalled 38-year-old all-rounder Wesley Barresi after a three-year absence.
After the opening game on Tuesday, the sides meet again on Thursday and Sunday.

12,‘Mind-blowing’ England impress Procter,LONDON: South Africa great Mike Procter hopes England’s “mind-blowing” approach to Test cricket under captain...,"LONDON: South Africa great Mike Procter hopes England’s “mind-blowing” approach to Test cricket under captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum is a sign of things to come as they prepare to face his native Proteas in a three-match series.
England had won just one of their 17 previous Tests before their new red-ball leadership duo took charge this season.
But they have since become a transformed team, with a perfect record of four wins in as many matches heading into Wednesday’s first Test against South Africa at Lord’s.
That record includes a 3-0 series win over world champions New Zealand, where England chased down targets of 277, 299 and 296.
England then made light work of a seemingly stiff pursuit of 378 in the Covid-delayed fifth Test against India at Edgbaston. 
“Mind-blowing, to be honest,” Procter told AFP in London. 
“Watching on television, the way England have played has been mind-blowing, it really is.” 
An outstanding all-rounder, renowned for both his dynamic fast bowling and aggressive batting, the 75-year-old Procter played in just seven Tests before his international career was cut short by South Africa’s apartheid-enforced exile from the world game.
‘BREATH OF FRESH AIR’ 
But having spent a large part of his career playing for Gloucestershire in the hard-nosed environment of 1970s English county cricket, Procter has been struck by England’s efforts to “dilute” the fear of defeat. 
“Looking back over all the years of Test cricket the initial attitude has always been, ‘Let’s make sure we don’t lose’, then it’s, ‘If we can win, we win’,” he said. 
“This England team have changed all that. Of course, losing still matters but it’s about going for the victory. It’s been a breath of fresh air and I hope it rubs off on other teams.” He added:  “That fear of losing hasn’t been dispersed, but when you dilute it the way England hierarchy have, you are going to get some absorbing Test matches. 
“Sure, they are going to come unstuck. There’s no doubt it’s going to happen, but I think they’ve got the character to pull through. If they continue playing the way they are, they can only get to the top.” 
Procter, however, believes South Africa could prove a match for England.
Since opener Dean Elgar became captain of the Test side in March 2021, the Proteas have won seven out of nine matches.
They boast an impressive pace attack, although doubts remain over whether Kagiso Rabada will be fit to play at Lord’s following an ankle injury, with Duanne Olivier already ruled out of the entire series by a hip problem.
But the likes of Anrich Nortje and towering left-armer Marco Jansen could still pose problems for England. 
“South Africa have beaten India (at home in January), they’ve beaten New Zealand when they batted first on a green-top (in Christchurch in March),” said Procter. “The batters are really starting to apply themselves.  
“South Africa are punching above their weight, but so are England. We’ve got two sides who are playing above themselves, it’s going to be a fascinating series.”

The ambitious “Where the Game Grows” plan released on Monday aims to double the number of children aged five to 12 playing the game to 210,000 over the next five years, with girls making up 60,000 of that tally.
Another of the targets is to get cricket back into the Olympics for the first time since 1900 — if that goal has not already been achieved at the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.
Cricket has been shortlisted for possible inclusion at the 2028 Olympics along eight other sports and the ICC will make a presentation to organisers later this month.
The host city can include any sport but needs the approval of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
Women’s T20 cricket made its Commonwealth Games debut in Birmingham last month with Australia beating India by nine runs in the final to claim the inaugural gold medal.
Brisbane has plans to rebuild the city’s Gabba cricket ground as a 50,000- seater Olympic Stadium to host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2032 Games.
The inclusion of cricket in the 2032 Olympics and Paralympics is part of the “sustainable future” strand of the plan, which also aims to improve fan experience, expand the grassroots and continue Australia’s success on the world stage.
Cricket Australia has set a target of at least three ICC event triumphs over the next five years for both men’s and women’s national teams. 
“This strategy contains both a vision and a clear plan for how we can achieve bold, transformative change while also meeting our core responsibilities,” said CA chief executive Nick Hockley.

The 36-year-old Nadal won the Australian Open and French Open titles earlier this year to take his men’s record tally of Grand Slam singles triumphs to 22.
But he was forced to withdraw from Wimbledon with an abdominal injury before his scheduled semi-final against Nick Kyrgios.
Nadal is making his return this week at the Cincinnati Masters as he prepares for the US Open, but will not make a first Davis Cup appearance since winning the tournament for the fifth time with Spain in 2019.
Spain will instead be looking to teenage sensation Carlos Alcaraz for inspiration.
Sergi Bruguera’s team will face Canada, Serbia and South Korea in Group B which is being staged in Valencia from Sept 13-

The top two in each of the four groups will progress to the knock-out phase in Malaga in November.
Zverev has not played since suffering a horrible ankle injury during his Roland Garros semi-final against Nadal in June.

New Zealand, beaten in the T20 World Cup final by Australia last year, suffered an eight-wicket defeat in Kingston on Sunday to be denied a series sweep against West Indies.
However, the Black Caps gained plenty from their last T20 tour before the World Cup starts in October, welcoming back a number of rested key players.Phillips said New Zealand were spoiled for choice in their attack and their spinners could prove damaging in Australia despite wickets that traditionally offer more for pace bowlers.
“Massively so, especially our finger spinners,” he told reporters.
“Obviously, Ish (Sodhi) being able to turn the ball both ways really helps and having a wrist spinner in the side ... is absolute gold.
“But the way that Michael Bracewell and obviously (Mitchell) Santner do their thing it really helps to be able to have that extra balance.
“Going into Aussie (Australia), that is going to be crucial with the bigger boundaries as well.”  
Phillips said the West Indies had been a useful preview for what to expect in Australia for the Oct. 16-Nov.13 World Cup.
“We’ve had the ball hold a little bit more especially with that new ball when it grips a little bit so I think it can actually play very similar to the way Aussie will, especially getting later on into the tournament,” he said. 
“So (we’re) trying to take these experiences and use them as much as possible.”

16,UAE T20 league organisers hoping to minimise schedule clashes,The money on offer at International League T20 has caused some consternation in Australia.,"NEW DELHI: Organisers of a new Twenty20 league in the United Arab Emirates are working with their counterparts in Australia and South Africa to minimise the impact of scheduling clashes with their competitions, a top official has told Reuters.
The International League T20 (ILT20), which launches in January, will be the second most lucrative Twenty20 tournament after the trend-setting Indian Premier League (IPL) in terms of player remuneration.
The inaugural edition of the six-team competition, however, coincides with another new Twenty20 league in South Africa, Cricket Australia (CA)’s Big Bash League and the Bangladesh Premier League.
Mubashshir Usmani, general secretary of the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB), said the Jan. 6 to Feb. 12 window for the tournament had been selected because it presented “optimal playing conditions in the UAE”. 
“While this window suits our purpose, we are closely working with different boards toward minimising date clashes,” he added.
The money on offer at ILT20 has caused some consternation in Australia.
It has prompted Cricket Australia (CA) to enter negotiation with its top players to retain them for the Big Bash League, which is scheduled to run between Dec. 13 and Feb. 12.
Media reports in Australia said CA might block Chris Lynn, who was among the first of list of marquee names released by ILT20 last week, from joining the league by denying the big-hitting batsman the necessary clearance.
“We are working with Cricket Australia, in fact we are in touch with all the relevant cricket boards, to minimise any major clashes,” Usmani said.
“We do want Australian as well as any other available players to be involved with the league.”  
Among the other marquee players announced by the ILT20 were England internationals Moeen Ali, Dawid Malan and Chris Jordan as well as West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell and Afghan bowler Mujeeb-ur-Rahman. Usmani said the franchises had been empowered to sign overseas players directly, although the ECB were ready to help. 
“Our team has been working alongside players, players’ agents and various boards to seek and secure the necessary approvals for those identified to participate in the league’s inaugural edition,” he said.
Although the franchises are likely to be mostly made up of players from outside the Emirates, two local players must 
feature in every starting team.
Usmani said ILT20 was “special” as it afforded players from the UAE, and other associate nations, “an incomparable experience” of sharing the dressing room with top players in “one of the most attractive destinations in the world”.
The owners of the Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Capitals teams in the IPL have purchased ILT20 franchises.

17,Alaba free-kick gives Real winning start to title defence,MADRID: David Alaba scored with a stunning free-kick immediately after coming on as a substitute as reigning...,"MADRID: David Alaba scored with a stunning free-kick immediately after coming on as a substitute as reigning champions Real Madrid came from behind to beat Almeria 2-1 in their opening game of the season in La Liga on Sunday. 
Carlo Ancelotti’s side trailed to an early goal by Largie Ramazani away against their promoted opponents, but Lucas Vazquez equalised just after the hour mark. 
The winner arrived with 15 minutes remaining at Almeria’s Power Horse Stadium, as Alaba strode onto the pitch and curled a free-kick in off the upright after Luka Modric had been fouled just outside the box. 
Real were made to work hard for the points against an Almeria side who won last season’s second-tier title to return to La Liga after a seven-year absence. 
“We had lots of shots on goal but once we got the first goal it made things much easier for us,” said Ancelotti. “I am happy with the way the game went. We were not spectacular but there were lots of things to take into account, like the game on Wednesday and the heat.” 
Ancelotti kept his word and made five changes to the starting 11 that won both the Champions League and the UEFA Super Cup, including handing debuts to new signings Antonio Rudiger and Aurelien Tchouameni. 
But the gamble looked to have backfired when striker Ramazani opened the scoring for Almeria after ghosting behind Rudiger in the sixth minute. 
Vinicius Jr had several chances to equalise but goalkeeper Fernando Martinez made at least three crucial stops from close range strikes by the Brazilian. 
Real piled on the pressure after the break when Ancelotti sent on veterans Modric and Eden Hazard from the bench in place of young French midfielders Eduardo Camavinga and Tchouameni, who struggled to make an impact. 
Vazquez scored the equaliser from a rebound after another individual effort from Vinicius in the 61st minute before Alaba scored the winner. 
Earlier, Japan star Takefusa Kubo marked his Real Sociedad debut by scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win at Cadiz. 
Carlos Soler’s penalty gave Valencia a 1-0 win over promoted Girona in their first La Liga outing under new coach Gennaro Gattuso.
