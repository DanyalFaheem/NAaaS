0,5 police officials suspended over man’s ‘suicide’ in Peshawar lock-up,Deceased's father accuses police personnel of murdering his son inside the lock-up.,"PESHAWAR: The station house officer of the Michni Gate police station here and four other cops have been suspended after a suspect arrested on murder charge allegedly committed suicide inside the police station’s lock-up on Monday.
The incident sparked protest from the family members of the deceased as they placed the body on the Warsak Road in Pir Bala area of the city, accusing the police of murdering him. The protesters also chanted slogans against the police. The police said that the suspect, identified as Ziaur Rehman, a resident of Shagai Hindkian area on the outskirts of the provincial capital, was taken into custody some days ago on charges of murdering his wife in June.
On Monday, the suspect, the police claimed tore a pillow cover and hanged him with it in the lock-up. 
The police shifted the body to the Khyber Medical College for autopsy. Afterwards it was handed over to the family. 
The family members of the deceased later took the body to the Warsak Road and staged a demonstration there.
Following the incident, SHO Michni Gate Kamran Marwat and four other personnel were suspended for negligence. An inquiry has also been ordered into the incident.
On the other hand, Gohar Ali, father of the deceased, accused the police personnel of murdering his son inside the lock-up.
Talking to reporters during the protest, Mr Ali said that the SHO Michni Gate had detained his son from Islamabad, and that they kept looking for him for five days in different police stations. He accused the SHO of taking Rs1 million from their rivals and murdering his son in the police lock-up.
“The SHO even asked me for Rs100,000 bribe, but I refused,” he said.
Gohar Ali said his daughter-in-law had committed suicide and was not murdered. The protesters also demanded registration of FIR against the SHO. The police officials assured the family of lodging FIR against the SHO and transparent investigation into the case.
It is to mention here that wife of the deceased had died in June this year, and Ziaur Rehman had told the Michni Gate police station officials that his wife had committed suicide by hanging when he was out of home for work. 
He had told the police officials that when he returned home from work, large number of women were gathered in his house and they told him that his wife had ended her life by hanging. He had told the police that he had married his wife three months ago.
However, on Aug 8, parents of the deceased women lodged cases against their son-in-law and his parents for the murder of the woman. The police had registered FIR under section 302 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Another police official claimed that a brother of the deceased man had died in an accident on the day of his (Ziaur Rehman) wedding, and afterwards the family made the life hell for the woman accusing her of brining bad luck to them.
“Three months later they killed her and covered it up as suicide,” the official said.

8,10-day polio drive launched in six districts amid tight security,"Vaccine to be administered to 1,058,067 children during the campaign","PESHAWAR: The authorities in violence-stricken North Waziristan tribal district made tight security arrangements as polio vaccination campaign started in six high-risk districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday.
All 14 polio cases, reported in the country this year, belonged to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Health Minister Taimur Khan Jhagra and Chief Secretary Dr Shahzad Khan Bangash inaugurated the drive targeting 1,058,067 children for oral polio vaccines (OPV) while 994,583 to be given fractional dose of inactivated polio vaccine (fIPV) to boost their immunity against the virus. The campaign for OPV will continue for 10 days.
The district health officer of North Waziristan, Dr Wazir Khan Safi, told Dawn that they had put in place high security arrangements for the protection of the health workers in view of attacks, which resulted in the death of two persons and injuries to another.

Vaccine to be administered to 1,058,067 children during the campaign

“We are constantly in contact with the district administration, police, provincial and federal governments to ensure that the target children receive drops and stay safe from the childhood ailment,” he said.
North Waziristan is home to 13 polio cases of the 14 reported countrywide this year so far. One case has been detected in Lakki Marwat district. “The enhanced security has emboldened the vaccinators,” said Dr Wazir Khan.
He said that previously many children missed vaccination due to fake finger marking. “Now our vaccinators wouldn’t mark fingers of the children without vaccinating them,” he added.
In Peshawar, both health minister and chief secretary, who also co-chaired a meeting of task force on polio on Monday, vowed to stamp out poliovirus from the region and underlined the need for tailored strategies to cater to ground challenges.
“Emergence of polio cases in the province should serve as wakeup call to initiate remedial measures on war footing,” said the minister. He urged the health teams to bring to spotlight real issues and challenges such as fake finger marking and missed children so that those could be resolved.
The chief secretary thanked technical partners and all line departments, specially army and police, for their sacrifices and all out support for polio eradication. “Of late, we have seen plethora of challenges in interrupting virus circulation in the province, yet we are determined to overcome those obstacle to succeed in fulfilment of our goal,” he said.
Mr Bangash lauded incentives being given to the health workers in hotspot districts but ordered disciplinary action against under-performing workers across the board along with real time data reflecting the true picture of missed children.
He said that good quality campaigns were important to stop virus circulation in addition to report refusals to solve the issues hampering eradication of the virus.
Earlier, Additional Secretary Health (Polio) Asif Raheem gave presentation on the preparedness of the campaign and said that the drive had been started earlier in view of detection of virus from environmental sites in Nowshera, Swat, Peshawar and Bannu districts.
“Fake finger marking, missed children and low routine immunisation coverage are the biggest challenges. We have deployed monitors to hold accountable the workers showing laxity in their work,” he said.
He said that the fIPV plus OPV campaign would be carried out in Bannu, Lakki Marwat, North Waziristan, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank and South Waziristan.
In Lakki Marwat, around 1,000 policemen have been deployed to guard polio teams during the drive commenced on Monday.
An official said that police had made foolproof security arrangements for the protection of vaccinators to enable them to immunise the target population against the crippling disease without facing any trouble.
He said that the cops accompanied the teams during their field activities to administer anti-polio vaccine to children under the age of five.
“The law enforcers have also been deployed at fixed centres and with transit teams,” he said, adding that polio workers guarded by policemen completed the first day activity successfully.

Railway Road leads to Khanpur and Taxila and has over 100 small and large villages and localities on both sides of it. A number of important institutions, including Telephone Industries of Pakistan, National Radio Telecommunication 
Corporation, Pak-Austria Fachhochschule Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology, Khanpur Dam, a couple of industrial units and Buddhist sites, are also situated along the 28-kilometre road.
It also connects Hazara Motorway from Chechian Interchange. 
Following heavy rain in upper parts of Hazara and surroundings of the Haripur city the soka having a number of small and large tributaries gets heavily flooded and water starts flowing over the road in the absence of a bridge, making it difficult and risky for the motorists to cross.
Traffic remains suspended for long whenever there is heavy showers.
The residents of Haripur have criticised the local politicians for failing to construct a bridge on the nullah.
“Hassle-free and unrestricted road travel is the fundamental right of every citizen, but our elected representatives have failed to address the main complaint of their electorates,” Bashir Ahmed, a local resident, deplored.
He said Omar Ayub Khan and his cousins and sitting MPAs Akbar Ayub and Arshad Ayub did not feel the need to build a 
small bridge on the soka. 
He said the lawmakers had also promised building either a bridge or level-crossing on the railway track situated barely 500 yards away from the soka point.
Abdul Latif, another resident, said Sardar Mushtaq Khan and Babar Nawaz Khan of PML-N and Dr Raja Amir Zaman of PTI and his late father, Raja Sikandar Zaman also could not build a bridge on the water channel.
He said though construction of central jail bypass road had eased suffering of motorists to some extent, most drivers still preferred this shortest route to using the GT and Hattar roads to again hit the Railway Road, which took two extra miles.
When contacted, Asad Khan Alizai, a senior official at the district finance office, said the Railway Road was the domain of National Highway Authority, which had prepared a feasibility plan for construction of a culvert on the rainwater course. 
The officer concerned at the NHA’s Abbottabad office could not be approached for comments.
