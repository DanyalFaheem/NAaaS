1,"Notices to governor, PU VC on plea against SCS appointments","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday issued notices to the Punjab governor, being chancellor of the Punjab...","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday issued notices to the Punjab governor, being chancellor of the Punjab University and its vice chancellor on a petition challenging appointment of ‘influential’ candidates as professor of School of Communication Studies (SCS).  
Associate Professor Dr Shabbir Sarwar filed the petition through his counsel Safdar Shaheen Pirzada.
The counsel said Sawera Mujeeb Shami, the daughter of a senior journalist, Dr Mian Hannan Ahmad, a brother of SCS senior official, and Dr Lubna Zaheer, recommended by a PML-N senator, had been appointed as professors in violation of rules and regulations.
He alleged favouritism, misuse of authority, violation of rules and regulations in the selection process i.e. from the advertisement to the issuance of appointment notification.
He pointed out that only six days (four working days) were given to the candidates to submit applications for the post of professor of communication studies after the appearance of a corrigendum advertisement to minimise the competition for the job, while the university would give 60 days to apply for the post of professor as per its years-old practice and regulations.
The counsel submitted that the meeting to recommend the names of the panel of foreign experts/referees was never convened, in violation of university rules and regulations.  
He said the list of experts was prepared by the SCS director, whose brother was also an applicant, and he was finally appointed.
He said for the second seat, the vice chancellor, while misusing his authority, sent cases for evaluation to those foreign referees who were recommended by Dr Ayesha Ashfaq, wife of the host of Mr Shami’s talk show on a private TV channel.  
He said both foreign referees were PhD and post-PhD supervisors of Dr Ayesha, who was PhD supervisor of candidate Dr Sawera Shami.
Advocate Pirzada said Dr Ayesha jointly published research work with candidate Dr Sawera as well as both the foreign referees, which is a clear case of conflict of interest.
He contended that the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan did not award even a six-month foreign scholarship to a candidate in case the foreign referee was the supervisor of his/her local supervisor.  
The counsel said the petitioner had been ignored despite standing first in terms of first author research publications and 
professional experience, among all the candidates.  
He asked the court to set aside the impugned appointments for being made in an illegal manner.
After hearing the arguments of the petitioner’s counsel, Justice Shakeel Ahmad sought replies from the respondents for a date to be fixed later by the registrar office.

Of these officers, 24 were the deputy superintendents of police (DSPs) while others were SSPs and SPs. 
The large-scale transfers/postings of nearly 97 police officers within two days have kicked off a new debate in the police circles that term the moves as political victimisation. 
On the other hand, the inspector general of police (IGP) has reappointed those SPs who were removed from their posts from Lahore on Sunday in the wake of the May 25 Azadi March of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). They were made officers on special duty (OSDs) on the complaints of the PTI leadership with directions that they should not be posted anywhere in the province. Some police circles consider the move risky as reposting of the officers may offend the ruling elite. 
The IGP has reportedly conveyed to the Punjab government that any action against the police officers on political grounds might cause unrest among the force. 
He posted Akhlaqullah Khan as Sargodha Investigations SP, Waqar Azeem, awaiting posting, as Gujranwala Saddar Division SP and Rizwan Tariq as SP Gujranwala Civil Lines Division against vacancies. These police officers were earlier serving in Lahore as divisional SPs. 
The IGP also cancelled the transfer order of Lahore Cantt Operations Hamza Amanullah, a day after his appointment and posted him as Saddar Division Operations SP. According to Sunday’s notification, Mr Hamza has replaced Essa Sukhera. 
Nadeem Hussain, awaiting posting, has been posted as CTD investigations SSP, Lahore PC Battalion Commander Riffat Haidar Bukhari has been posted as Lahore headquarters traffic SP, Rana Tahir Rehman Khan has been posted as Lahore PC Battalion Commander, SP Dr Anoosh Masood Chaudhry has been transferred and posted as Special Protection Unit deputy director, Bahawalpur CTD SP Mazhar Iqabal has been posted as Rawalpindi investigations SSP etc.

13,Policeman sacked in Faisalabad for pointing pistol at PTI’s women,"PTI’s Fawad Chaudhry defends departmental action against cop, says ""black sheep"" in Punjab police deserve no respect.","LAHORE: An official of Faisalabad police was dismissed from service on Monday for pointing a pistol at women protesters during the Azadi March staged by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on May 25.
The incident got highlighted after PTI top leadership shared a picture on social media showing the then Sargodha Road station house officer (SHO), sub inspector Abid Jutt, pointing a gun at the party’s women workers who were part of an Islamabad-bound rally held in Faisalabad.
An official said the Faisalabad police high-ups had launched a probe into the incident on the PTI’s demand to take a strict departmental action against the policeman.
He said the Faisalabad SSP Operations, who was inquiry officer (IO), summoned the suspect, giving him an opportunity to defend his position.  
During the course of inquiry, he said, Jutt failed to justify his action that was declared illegal and unwarranted by the IO under the police rules.
The IO recommended dismissal of the former SHO from service.  
In the light of the recommendation, the Faisalabad police high-ups dismissed Jutt from service, the official said.
PTI’s former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry defended the departmental action against Jutt.

 





 
In his tweet on Monday, Fawad said “black sheep” in Punjab police deserved no respect and SI’s illegal act of pointing pistol at women and children could not be defended.

14,"CM changes portfolios of four ministers, one adviser",PTI’s social media guru gets PITB’s charge,"LAHORE:  Chief Minister Parvez Elahi on Monday made changes in four ministers’  and an adviser’s portfolios to create room for more ministers. Initially  an MPA and a special assistant have been assigned portfolios.
A significant change is in the portfolio of Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB)  which has been given to former premier Imran Khan’s focal person on  digital media Dr Arslan Khalid.  
After the fall of PTI government in April this year, Dr Khalid allegedly ran a social media campaign against the establishment. Law enforcement agencies had raided his house in Wapda Town and reportedly took away some laptops and cell phones.  
Mr  Elahi has withdrawn primary and secondary healthcare department  portfolio from Dr Yasmin Rashid and allowed her to continue holding the  specialised healthcare and medical education department.

PTI’s social media guru gets PITB’s charge  

Dr Rashid  is also holding an important portfolio of PTI central Punjab president  and had been predominantly involved in July 17 by-election. Currently, she is also busy in preparing for the National  Assembly seat by-election in Nankana, where party chairman Imran Khan  himself is contesting. 
The primary and secondary healthcare  department has been given to MPA from Multan Dr Akhtar Malik. Dr Malik  was in former governor Chaudhry Sarwar’s group and had continued  struggling for the health department during the Buzdar government’s  three-and-a-half-year term.
Former law minister Basharat Raja was  given cooperative and public prosecution departments as minister. Mr  Raja, who was originally PML-Q senior member and was asked by Mr Elahi  to join PTI and contest general election 2018, has been given additional  portfolios of parliamentary affairs and environment protection. The  public prosecution portfolio has, however, been withdrawn.  
Minister  Khurram Shehzad, who was earlier given law and parliamentary affairs portfolios, has been stripped of parliamentary  affairs job.
Minister Raja Yasir Humayun, who served as  higher education and PITB minister in the Buzdar dispensation and was  given same portfolios in the Parvez Elahi cabinet – has been stripped of  PITB portfolio.
The PITB portfolio has now been given to Special  Assistant to Chief Minister Dr Arslan Khalid. It merits mentioning that  Dr Khalid had recently made headlines after recording of his purported  telephonic conversation with Bushra Bibi was leaked on social media. In  the alleged conversation, the wife of former PM Imran Khan can be heard  giving instructions to Khalid on running trends on social media against  opponents of her husband.
Adviser retired Brig Muhammad Musadiq  Abbasi, who was given anti-corruption establishment portfolio at the  time of formation of Elahi cabinet, has also been given public  prosecution department under his control.
The CM office has sent chief minister’s order to the chief secretary for issuance of formal notification.
CHIEF  SECRETARY: Meanwhile, it is learnt, Chief Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal  and Chief Minister Parvez Elahi’s relations have apparently returned to  normalcy and the federal government too has allowed him to continue  working as chief secretary.  
Mr Kamran Afzal had written a letter  to the federal government on Aug 6 for withdrawal of his services from  Punjab explaining that it was no more possible for him to continue on  his present assignment.  
The chief minister was initially annoyed  with the chief secretary for his alleged involvement in sending police  on the floor to protect Hamza Shehbaz while he was getting elected as  chief minister on April 16 – with the support of PTI’s 25 turncoats.  
Later,  the civil administration under Afzal’s watch had besieged the Governor  House and did not allow Governor Omer Sarfraz Cheema to enter the  premises to ensure that Hamza Shehbaz take oath from National Assembly  Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf. 
Mr Elahi after assuming the office  of the chief minister had accepted Afzal as chief secretary but did not  listen to him while taking administrative action including the posting  of Punjab Assembly secretary Muhammad Khan Bhatti as principal secretary  to chief minister.
Initially, the federal government had  instructed the chief secretary to continue working in Punjab and look  after law and order during Ashura and his request would be considered  soon afterwards.
The chief secretary had stopped going to his  office after Ashura and eventually was seen sitting with the chief  minister at Pakistan’s 75th Independence Day event at Hazuri Bagh on  Sunday. It was a pleasant surprise for the civil bureaucracy when chief  secretary Afzal attended his office after several days.

Initially, the police claimed to have killed a robber and injured another in an encounter but the situation later got clear when it appeared that they were not having any criminal record.
The incident sparked agitation among the relatives of the deceased who was later identified as Mohammad Shoaib, a resident of Shahdara, and his cousin Ghazanfar.
Another man who got injured in the firing was identified as Patras Masih. Both the injured were shifted to hospital.  
Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi took notice of the incident, called the IG police and directed him to hold an impartial investigation.

Sharing details of the incident, a police official said Shoaib and his cousin Ghazanfar came on a motorbike at the Lakshmi Chowk where they intercepted Patras Masih and held him hostage at gunpoint.
He said the motorcyclists had accused Patras of kidnapping their relative girl. They had also filed a complaint with the Naulakha police to lodge a case against him.
Meanwhile, both sides exchanged hot words and one of the motorcyclists opened fire and injured Patras, he said adding that on hearing gunfire a Dolphin Squad rushed to the spot.  
As they witnessed two armed motorcyclists holding a gun and a man lying injured, one of the police personnel signalled them to stop the bike.
The police official claimed that the suspects opened fire on the squad and as soon as they returned the fire, both of them got bullet injuries.
Later, one of them died on the spot while the other injured seriously, he said adding that the Dolphin Squad initially reported to the police high-ups that ‘one robber was killed and his accomplice injured in police encounter’.
He said later inquiries confirmed that the motorcyclists had no criminal record and the relatives of the deceased person declared it criminal negligence on the part of Dolphin personnel.
To a question, the police official said Shoaib was a police constable and he had been dismissed from service following the allegations of misconduct proved against him in departmental inquiries.
