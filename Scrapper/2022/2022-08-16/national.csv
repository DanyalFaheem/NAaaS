• Assembly passes two bills amid lack of quorum
• Soomro de-notified by ECP
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly session on Monday was dominated by empty chairs as lack of quorum marred the proceedings in which the federal government was censured for ‘Independence Day extravaganza’ amid economic crunch and devastation caused by the floods.
The first sitting of the last parliamentary year of the present assembly saw a verbal altercation between Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and Grand Democratic Alliance’s (GDA) Saira Bano. The opposition lawmaker objected to the pomp and show on Independence Day at a time when ‘the people of Balochistan were drowning in floods’.
She regretted the message sent to the people of Balo­ch­is­tan by spending millions of rupees on lighting and decoration. The amount should have been deposited in the flood relief account set up by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, suggested Ms Bano.
Highlighting the economic hardships faced by the people, the GDA member also pointed out an incident in Fai­sal­abad’s Dijkot village where a man hanged himself after mur­dering his two daughters for being unable to pay the house rent.
However, her speech was interrupted by the speaker when she objected to the use of the term zinda qoum (vibrant nation).
“Do not talk like this. The 220 million people [are] form a vibrant nation. You are committing an excess by calling the Pakistani people a dead nation,” said Mr Ashraf. When the speaker refused to allow her to continue the speech, she pointed out a lack of quorum, forcing the speaker to order a headcount.
Later, the speaker prorogued the session, which had begun on July 27, after declaring the house not in order due to lack of quorum for which the presence of a minimum of 86 members (one-fourth of the total 342-member house) was required.
Earlier, speaking on points of order, Maulana Abdul Akbar Chitrali of Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and Muhammad Jamaluddin of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) also castigated the government for organising a musical event on Aug 14. The two lawmakers objected to the dancing of young girls and children during a ceremony in the presence of the prime minister.
Before the session was prorogued, the assembly passed the Pakistan Tobacco Board (Amendment) Bill 2022 and the Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions Bill 2022 aimed at providing a mechanism to carry out commercial transactions under inter-governmental framework to promote, attract and encourage foreign states to have economic and business relations with Pakistan.
In a separate development, the Election Commission of Pakistan on Monday de-notified Muhammad Mian Soomro as member of the National Assembly.
The seat of the PTI lawmaker was declared vacant on Aug 10 by the speaker due to his forty days’ consecutive absence from the sittings of the House.

1,12 more die in Balochistan amid heavy rains,"CM says entire province facing crisis; PM Shehbaz orders BISP to provide Rs50,000 to each affected family.","QUETTA: Heavy rains and flash floods continued to wreak havoc in Balochistan as 12 more people lost their lives in Musakhail and Washuk areas on Monday while many others were swept away in hill torrents and still missing.
Floods washed away another dam in Musakhail area. Two Levies officials were swept away in flash flood while returning from Washuk in their vehicle. Their bodies were later recovered.
Train service has been suspended between Quetta and the rest of the country as the main track between Sibi and Dera Murad Jamali has been washed away in floodwater.
Officials said Musakhail, Nasirabad, Washuk, Dera Bugti, Kohlu, Barkhan, Zhob, Sibi and Harnai districts had been receiving heavy downpour since Sunday evening. This caused massive destruction in Musakhail as floods in seasonal rivers and streams washed away several villages and rendered hundreds of people homeless.

CM says entire province facing crisis; PM orders BISP to provide Rs50,000 to each affected family

The Musakhail deputy commissioner said that over 12 people were swept away in floodwater after the breaking of Andarpose dam. He said that so far eight bodies had been recovered by rescue teams. Two children were killed in Rarasham area when the roof of their house caved in.
The officials said the road network and communication system were badly affected in Musakhail while power supply was suspended in the district. A village in Tilli tehsil was inundated due to breach of a protective dyke which forced the area people to leave their homes.
“Mal Ghshkori and Hambi villages were also affected as another protective dyke was breached,” the Sibi deputy commissioner told Dawn, adding that 60 houses were damaged in the two villages.
Presiding over a meeting to review the flood situation, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo said the entire province was passing through a very critical situation as torrential rains and flash floods caused massive destruction in almost all the 34 districts, washing away dams, bridges and road structure, besides heavy human losses.
The chief minister attended a meeting of the Relief Coordination Com­mittee, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad, through video link. Mr Bizenjo briefed the meeting on the devastation cau­­sed by floods and said the entire province was affected by this natural calamity.
PM Sharif directed the Bena­zir Income Support Prog­ramme to provide Rs50,000 each as relief to the flood-affected families.

2,OBITUARY: Population planning exponent Nafis Sadik dies in New York,She had been ill for quite some time and had not been seen in diplomatic circles in New York for the past few years.,"


 
ISLAMABAD: Dr Nafis Sadik of Pakistan, a guiding force to the world in maternal and child health as well as family planning, passed away in New York on Sunday.
She had been ill for quite some time and had not been seen in diplomatic circles in New York for the past few years.
In a statement, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Execu­ti­­ve Director Dr Na­talia Kanem mourned her passing and paid rich tribute to her, describing her as a proud champion of choice and a tireless advocate for women’s health, rights and empowerment.
Dr Maleeha Lodhi, a former permanent representative of Pakistan to the United Nations, also mourned her demise, terming her a passionate advocate of women’s rights.
Dr Sadik joined UNFPA in 1971, and after her retirement in 2000, she served as special advi­ser to the United Nations secretary-general and his special envoy for HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific. Before joining the United Nations, Dr Sadik, an obstetrician-gynecologist by train­­ing, was director-general of the Pakis­tan Central Family Planning Cou­ncil, the UNFPA statement said.
Dr Sadik was born in Jaunpur in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. She was the daughter of Iffat Ara and Mohammad Shoaib, who was finance minister in the Ayub Khan cabinet during the 1960s.
Nafis Sadik was educated at Kolkata’s Loreto College and received her Doctor of Medicine degree from Karachi’s Dow Medical College. She served her internship in gynaecology and obstetrics at City Hospital, in Baltimore, Maryland.
She completed further studies at the Johns Hopkins University and held the post of research fellow in physiology at Queens University, in Ontario (Canada).
Dr Sadik began her professional life as a physician, practising obstetrics and gynaecology in rural communities across Pakistan.
The Pakistan government appointed her director general of the Central Family Planning Council during the 1960s.
When she was appointed executive director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in 1987, Dr Sadik became one of the highest-ranking women in the UN hierarchy and the first woman in the world body’s history to lead one of its major voluntarily funded programmes.
Her contribution to improving the health of women and children across the world has brought, and is continuing to bring her, many international awards and honours.
She continued her distinguished career by lending support and sharing her expertise with several boards of directors.
Dr Sadik championed the concept that women’s health and well-being were best approached from the broader angle of reproductive and sexual health, within the social and economic context of women’s lives.
She had consistently called attention to the importance of addressing the needs of women by involving them directly, as well as men.
Leadership in family planning
She was the first female recipient of the Hugh Moore Award in 1976, named after a pioneer in the US credited with calling attention to the population crisis. She was cited for her leadership in the field of family planning, as well as for her leadership in encouraging other women to find careers in the population field.
The impact made by Dr Sadik on population planning during her 14 year tenure as UNFPA’s executive director cannot be overemphasised. She led the world’s largest source of multilateral assistance to population planning programmes.
The UNFPA’s influence on population policy and family welfare is arguably stronger than that of any other agency, largely because it speaks on behalf of all nations, a UN citation stated.
Her contribution to improving the health of women and children across the globe brought her many international awards and honours.
She was a member of the Asso­ciation of Pakistani Physicians in the United States. She was elected to the 1988 Fellowship ad eundem of the Royal College of Obstet­ricians and Gynaecologists in the United Kingdom.
Dr Sadik was Secretary General of the International Conference on Population and Development at Cairo in 1994.
According to the citation, the conference brought about enormous changes in population planning strategies.
The conference saw a change in the global consensus that put human rights, especially women’s rights, at the heart of the population debate.
Nafis Sadik made major contributions to research on population, family planning and reproductive health. She wrote numerous articles for leading journals and edited a number of important books.
Her husband, Azhar Sadik, had passed away several years ago and she is survived by five children.

3,Mehdi Shah appointed GB governor,Shah has remained associated with the PPP since his teenage years.,"GILGIT: President Dr Arif Alvi on Monday approved the appointment of Syed Mehdi Shah as the Gilgit-Baltistan governor, on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) loyalist Raja Jalal Hussain Maqpoon had tendered his resignation from the office in June, which was accepted by the president. Through a statement, the Presidency said the appointment of Syed Mehdi Shah was made under Section 33(3) of the Gilgit-Baltistan Order 2018 on the advice of the prime minister.
Meanwhile, the offices of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh governors were still lying vacant since the PTI leaders holding these posts resigned after the election of Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister.
According to sources, opposition parties in GB, including PPP, PML-N and JUI-F, had decided to appoint a PPP leader as the region’s governor, as the party held the second largest majority in the GB Assembly. The names of Mr Shah, Bashir Ahmed Khan and Muhammad Ali Akhtar had been sent to the PPP leadership for selecting one of them as the governor.
As the party finalised the name of Mr Shah, Prime Minister Sharif sent a summary to President Alvi for the appointment.
Hailing from Skardu, Mr Shah, 65, was a PPP stalwart. He was elected as the first chief minister of GB from 2010 to 2014 when the post was created under the GB Self-Governance Order 2009 during the PPP regime. He was earlier elected as a member of the GB Assembly from Skardu in 2009, and has also served as the PPP’s GB president from 2008 to 2017.
Shah has remained associated with the PPP since his teenage years, and has been the party’s central executive committee member for five years.
He was said to have close relations with former president and PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, slain former premier Benazir Bhutto and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.

4,Demand for judicial probe into Harnai shooting,ANP lawmakers table privilege motion in Balochistan Assembly.,"

AWAMI National Party Provincial President Asghar Khan Achakzai addresses protesters outside Quetta Press Club on Monday. The protest was held against the killing of a party worker in Balochistan’s Harnai area.—PPI

 
QUETTA: The Awami National Party (ANP), a coalition partner in the Balochistan Awami Party-led provincial government, and some opposition members, while condemning the killing of a man in Harnai, on Monday demanded formation of a judicial commission, headed by a senior judge of the high court, to probe the matter.
ANP parliamentary leader in Balochistan Assembly Mohammad Asghar Achakzai moved a joint privilege motion on the matter on behalf of Zmarak Khan, Malik Naeem Bazai and Shaheena Kakar in the assembly session, which was presided over by Deputy Speaker Sardar Babar Khan Musakhail.
Mr Achakzai said people were holding peaceful protest in Khost area against the opening of fire by security forces that killed ANP worker Khaliq Dad dead and injured over a dozen others. He alleged police and local administration were not registering an FIR against those who fired on the protesters.
People in Harnai along with the body were protesting against the firing incident, he added.

ANP lawmakers table privilege motion in Balochistan Assembly

As part of a conspiracy, the ANP leader claimed, Balochistan was being pushed into the fire. He demanded that a judicial commission, headed by a high court judge, should be constituted to conduct judicial inquiry into the firing incident and an FIR should be registered against the personnel of security forces who were involved in firing.
While taking the floor, Minister Zmarak Khan Piralizai condemned the firing incident and said that despite the casualties of ANP workers, the party would not give up its stand and would continue its peaceful struggle as followers of Bacha Khan who always gave lessons of peace. He demanded an inquiry into the incident through a judicial commission, pointing out that holding peaceful protest was people’s right that could not be denied.
Also, Hazara Democratic Party Chairman and Balochistan Sports Minister Abdul Khaliq Hazara supported the privilege motion by demanding judicial inquiry. Similarly, Health Minister Syed Ehsan Shah and Agriculture Minister Asadullah Baloch while condemning the shooting also demanded a judicial commission to probe the incident.
Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party legislator Nasrullah Khan Barech strongly protested over the action and demanded that the deputy speaker give his ruling as the debate on the motion had been completed.
However, the deputy speaker disposed of the adjournment saying that without the government version of the motion no ruling could be given on it. Mr Musakhail said Adviser to Chief Minister on Home and Tribal Affairs Mir Ziaullah Langove should be summoned to apprise the members of the government’s stand on the motion.
Since Mr Langove was not present in the house, the deputy speaker did not give ruling and disposed of the adjournment motion, inviting the ire of Mr Barech, Asghar Khan Achakzai, Zamarak Khan, Naeem Bazai and Shaheena Kakar.

5,‘Terrorist’ killed in Mirali operation,PESHAWAR: Security forces killed one alleged terrorist during an intelligence-based operation in North ...,"PESHAWAR: Security forces killed one alleged terrorist during an intelligence-based operation in North Waziristan’s Mirali area, said an official statement on Monday.
An intense fire exchange took place between troops and terrorists during which one terrorist was killed, said the military’s media wing, Inter-services Public Relations (ISPR). Weapon and ammunition was also recovered from the killed terrorist. The statement did not carry name of the terrorist killed during the encounter.
The terrorist remained actively involved in terrorist activities against security forces and killing of innocent citizens, it added. He was also involved in target killing of Qari Sami in North Waziristan district.
Locals appreciated the operation and expressed their full support to eliminate the menace of terrorism from the area. Qari Sami, a local leader of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl), was killed along with his friend last month. Locals had staged a sit-in protest against the JUI-F leader’s killing.
All roads in the district were blocked and people had boycotted official functions and stopped visiting offices in protest against the deadly attack. The protest was put off for two weeks after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif sent a committee comprising leaders of different political parties for talks with the protesters.

7,Pemra denies role in suspension of ARY News,SHC orders chairman to issue circular that it has no objection if cable operators restore the channel.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Monday directed the Pakistan Elect­ronic Media Regulatory Aut­hority (Pemra) to issue a circular that it has not suspended the transmission of ARY News and has no objection if cable operators restore the channel at the same position as it was operating earlier.
The bench comprising Justice Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan said that contempt application against Pemra chairman Mohammad Saleem Baig was disposed of subject to the issuance of circular during the course of day.
The management of the channel through its lawyer moved a contempt application against Pemra chief for not complying with an earlier order passed on a lawsuit to restore the transmission of the plaintiff.
When the matter came up for hearing, the Pemra chairman said the regulatory authority had not suspended the transmissions of the news channel and if such transmissions were not being aired, it might be on the part of cable operators.

SHC orders chairman to issue circular about no objection to restoration of channel

At this juncture, the counsel for channel argued that the alleged contemnor could not be absolved of his responsibility resulting in suspension of channel’s transmission.
He submitted that to affirm the position of Pemra, let the regulatory authority issue a circular addressed to the registrar of SHC with copy to the cable operators that Pemra would not object if they restore the channel to the position of Aug 7.
The lawyer for Pemra contended that the issuance of circular would not construe that the defendant has in anyway admitted the position of the plaintiff and added that Pemra chairman would adhere to any SHC order and he had not made any willful contempt.
The lawyer for the news channel argued that the SHC had already passed an order on Aug 10 that no final orders against the channel be acted upon unless directions were issued by the court. The counsel for Pemra undertook that any such orders would only be given effect once this court passed such order.
It may be recalled that on Aug 13, the SHC had also suspended a notice issued by the ministry of interior cancelling the security clearance of the channel till Aug 17.

9,Ogra notifies 3pc cut in RLNG price for August,The international spot market remains a ‘no-go area’ for Pakistani importers.,"ISLAMABAD: The Oil and Gas Regulatory Auth­ority (Ogra) has notified an almost three per cent reduction in the price of re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) for August as the international spot market remained a ‘no-go area’ for Pakistani importers and the average cost of cargos under long-term contract slightly came down with oil price cut.
According to a notification issued by Ogra on Monday, the average basket price for supply of imported RLNG to two gas companies — SSGC and SNGPL — has dropped by 2.67pc and 2.95pc, respectively. The sale price for SSGCL was notified at $16.95 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) and that for SNGPL at $15.7mmBtu, respectively.
This was on top of 15-16pc drop in the price to $16 per unit at transmission stage in July from $19.07 and $18.8 per unit for the two gas companies in June. The RLNG price at distribution stage in August dropped by 2.92pc to $16.95 per mmBtu in from $17.46 for SNGPL and by 2.68pc to $17.48 from $17.96 for SSGCL.
The notification showed that a total of six cargos were bought from Qatar — three at 13.37pc of Brent or $14.87 per mmBtu and three at 10.2pc of Brent or $11.35.
Another cargo from a separate long-term contract with Pakistan LNG Ltd was imported at 12.1pc of Brent or $13.5 per mmBtu.
As such, the average RLNG consumer price at distribution stage is down by about $0.5 per mmBtu in August, compared to July for both companies.
It may be noted that LNG’s basket price in May had touched a record $22-24 per mmBtu owing to a string of spot cargos procured by the new coalition government in first month in office to meet energy shortages.
Since then, repeated efforts to import more gas through spot tenders have remained futile owing to tight supply conditions and record prices in the international market following Russia-Ukraine war. As such, all the seven cargos in August and eight in July were available to Pakistan under long-term contracts, mostly with Qatar, except one from another supplier.
Mainly because of expensive spot imports in June, the average LNG-based power generation cost amounted to Rs28.4 per kWh (unit) — the second most expensive source of power generation after furnace oil at Rs36.2 per unit. As a consequence, fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for electricity increased by almost Rs10 per unit in August.
The average sale price for Lahore-based SNGPL had stood at $21.83 per mmBtu in May, up 40pc from $15.616 in April. Likewise, the average RLNG sale price for Karachi-based SSGC had stood at $23.79 per mm­Btu in May against $16.91 in April, showing an increase of about 41pc.
