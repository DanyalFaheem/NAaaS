0,Clashes in Kenya as Ruto declared president-elect after disputed count,"Ruto vows to work with ""all leaders"", says there is ""no room for vengeance"".","NAIROBI: William Ruto was declared the victor of Kenya’s hard-fought presidential poll on  Monday, but the outcome sparked a split in the election commission and some violent protests in his defeated rival’s strongholds.
Ruto won with 50.49 percent of the vote on Aug 9, narrowly ahead of Raila Odinga on 48.85pc, Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman Wafula Chebukati announced after an anxious days-long wait for results.
With tensions running high after the disputed outcome, the 55-year-old president-elect vowed to work with  “all leaders”.
“There is no room for vengeance,” said Ruto.  “I am acutely aware that our country is at a stage where we need all hands on deck.” Correspondents reported that police fired live rounds as protests erupted in a Nairobi slum that is an Odinga stronghold.
Police also fired tear gas in his lakeside bastion of Kisumu where demonstrators threw stones and erected roadblocks with large chunks of rock. “We were cheated,” Isaac Onyango, 24, said on a street sealed off by two large bonfires and broken rock.
“The government must listen to us. They must redo the election. Raila Odinga must be president. We will keep protesting until the Kenyan Supreme Court listens to us.” The dispute is likely to further damage the reputation of the IEBC after it had faced stinging criticism over its handling of the 2017 election which was annulled by the country’s top court in a historic first for Africa.
Four out of seven IEBC commissioners rejected the outcome of Tuesday’s vote, with vice chair Juliana Cherera describing the process as  “opaque”.
But Chebukati, who was also in charge of the IEBC in 2017, insisted he had carried out his duties according to the law of the land despite facing  “intimidation and harassment”.
The dispute will test Kenya’s stability after previous elections in the East African political and economic powerhouse were blighted by claims of rigging and vicious bouts of deadly violence.
The country of about 50 million people is already struggling with soaring prices, a crippling drought, endemic corruption and growing disenchantment with the political elite.
It was first time lucky for the incumbent deputy president, a shadowy rags-to-riches businessman who had characterised the vote as a battle between ordinary  “hustlers” and the  “dynasties” who have dominated Kenya since independence from Britain in 1963.
He will succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta, 60, the son of Kenya’s first post-independence leader, who has served two terms and under the constitution was not allowed to run again. Ruto had been promised Kenyatta’s backing for the top job only to see his boss throw his support behind former foe Odinga, leaving him out in the cold. It was a bitter blow for 77-year-old Odinga, who has failed in his fifth attempt at the top job despite having the weight of the ruling party machinery behind him.
He has yet to make any comment on the result, but his running mate Martha Karua said on Twitter:  “It is not over till it is over”.
With memories of previous post-poll violence still fresh, both Odinga and Ruto had pledged to accept the outcome of a free and fair election, and air their grievances in court rather than on the streets.
Polling day had passed off generally peacefully. But power transfers are fraught in Kenya, and how Odinga handles defeat will be anxiously watched by the country’s foreign partners.
No presidential ballot has gone uncontested in Kenya since 2002, and a Supreme Court challenge by Odinga is seen as almost certain.
If there is no court petition, Ruto will take the oath of office in two weeks’ time, becoming Kenya’s fifth president since independence. Kenya’s months-long campaign saw vitriolic mudslinging on the hustings and widespread disinformation swirling on social media.
While polling day was largely peaceful, turnout was historically low at around 65 percent of the 22 million registered voters, with disillusionment over corruption by power-hungry elites prompting many Kenyans to stay home.
Any challenge to results must be made within seven days to the Supreme Court, the country’s highest judicial body. The court has a 14-day deadline to issue a ruling, and if it orders an annulment, a new vote must be held within 60 days.

1,Bangladeshi activists brief UN rights chief on ‘police state’,DHAKA: Bangladeshi activists said on Monday they briefed the visiting UN human rights chief on gross violations...,"DHAKA: Bangladeshi activists said on Monday they briefed the visiting UN human rights chief on gross violations including extrajudicial killings and disappearances under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
Michelle Bachelet is the first UN rights chief to visit Bangladesh, and is also due to visit camps housing hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who fled a 2017 military onslaught in Myanmar. She met with rights activists in Dhaka on Monday.
“We said (Bangladesh) is now a police state, not a people’s state,” said Sanjida Islam Tulee, a sister of an opposition official allegedly abducted by the notorious elite Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) in 2013 who never returned.
“We said more than 600 people have become victims of enforced disappearance by the state agencies,” she said, adding that they also spoke about the independence of the country’s judiciary.
Tulee is a coordinator of Mayer Daak (The Call of the Mothers), which represents hundreds of victims of disappearances and their families, and those killed in allegedly staged police encounters.
In December, the United States imposed sanctions on the RAB as well as seven top security officers, including the national police chief, over gross human rights violations.
Activists say that since then, the situation has impro­ved, nearly halting extrajudicial killings and disappearances.
The government denies the allegations of disappearances and extrajudicial killings, with one minister saying that some of those who went missing in fact fled Bangladesh.
Activists also raised strong concerns about Bangladesh’s digital security laws, enacted in 2018, which international rights groups say have been used to silence dissent, curb freedom of expression and target journalists. Bachelet met three ministers on Sunday.
They told her about how Bangladesh has suffered from terrorism and violence, that the media is free, and that there has been progress in reviewing the digital security law, the foreign ministry said in a statement.
They  “highlighted the Government’s sincere efforts to protect and promote human rights of the people”, it added.
Bangladesh also sought Bachelet’s help to repatriate Rohingya refugees to Myanmar.
Foreign Minister M.A. Momen said their presence in Bangladesh  “bears the risk of the spread of radicalism, transnational crimes etc., and thus may hamper regional stability”, according to his ministry’s statement. There was no comment from Bachelet’s office.
The 70-year-old, a former Chilean president, is due to step down from her UN role at the end of the month.

2,Israeli police kill Palestinian in east Jerusalem raid,Victim's father says his son was shot in the head at point-blank range and was left bleeding for 40 minutes.,"JERUSALEM: Israeli security forces shot dead a Palestinian man they said had tried to stab an officer during a home raid searching for weapons in east Jerusalem early on Monday.
The man, identified by Palestinians as Mohammed al-Shaham, 21, was  “neutralised” and died in an Israeli military hospital, police said. The man’s father, Ibrahim al-Shaham, said that his son was shot in the head at point-blank range and was left bleeding for 40 minutes.
According to al-Shaham, police knocked on their door at 3:30am and  “we didn’t manage to make it to the door, Mohammed got there first, and the door exploded”.
“They started shooting inside the house, the first shot was in Mohammed’s head,” he said, adding that the officers left him bleeding before arresting him and taking him away.
Jerusalem Border Police launched the raid to locate weapons in the town of Kafr Aqab, which is part of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem but located on the West Bank side of the security barrier.
Al-Shaham said that one of the officers had told him that they got the wrong house. Police denied those claims, saying  “this was the right house and this was the suspect,” although no weapons were seized.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation’s new secretary general, Hussein al-Sheikh, called for  “an immediate and urgent international investigation” into what he labelled a  “criminal execution”. On Sunday, eight Israeli and US citizens were wounded when a Palestinian gunman opened fire on a bus just outside Jerusalem’s Old City.
That shooting came a week after the end of a deadly three-day conflict between Israel and Islamic Jihad militants in the Palestinian coastal enclave of Gaza.

3,Drunken policeman loses 400 investigation papers,"TOKYO: A Japanese police officer got drunk, fell asleep on the street and lost investigation documents containing ...","TOKYO: A Japanese police officer got drunk, fell asleep on the street and lost investigation documents containing the personal details of around 400 people including a criminal suspect, police and local media said.
The 49-year-old officer in the western Hyogo region lost a bag containing the documents sometime between 11pm on Friday and 5am on Saturday, a police official said on Monday. 
The documents contained names and addresses, he said, without elaborating.
According to major Japanese media outlets citing police officials, the officer in question went out drinking with his colleagues and fell asleep while walking home with the bag.
When he woke up near a train station, he could not find the bag containing the documents, which included information about 400 people, the reports said.
It is not the first time officials have been left red-faced over data breaches after drinking sessions. In June, authorities in Amagasaki said a contractor lost a bag containing a USB memory stick with personal data on all 460,000 residents after the person went out for drinks and fell asleep outdoors on the way home.

4,"Rushdie attack suspect ‘changed’ by Lebanon visit, says mother",Describes her son as “a moody introvert” increasingly fixated with Islam after the visit to see his estranged father.,"LONDON: The accused attacker of British author Salman Rushdie was transformed by a trip to Lebanon in 2018, when he became more religious and less outgoing, his mother has said.
Lebanese-born Silvana Fardos, of Fairview, New Jersey, described her 24-year-old son Hadi Matar as  “a moody introvert” increasingly fixated with Islam after the visit to see his estranged father.
“One time he argued with me asking why I encouraged him to get an education instead of focusing on religion,” she told the website of Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper.
“He was angry that I did not introduce him to Islam from a young age,” she said in an interview.
Matar was arrested at the scene of the attack on Rushdie, 75, at a literary event in upstate New York on Friday. 
He pleaded not guilty the following day to attempted murder and assault with a weapon charges and is being held without bail.
Prosecutors have described a planned, premeditated assault on Rushdie, who was stabbed approximately 10 times. Police have provided no information about the suspect’s background or his possible motive.
Fardos said she was  “shell shocked” to receive a call from one of her twin 14-year-old daughters telling her that the FBI were at the family’s home and her son was allegedly responsible.
“I just cannot believe he was capable of doing something like this. He was very quiet, everyone loved him,” she said.
Fardos said federal agents had removed Matar’s computer, his PlayStation, books and other items including knives and a sharpener. Her son  “changed a lot” after his trip to Lebanon, she said.
“I was expecting him to come back motivated, to complete school, to get his degree and a job, but instead he locked himself in the basement,” she said.
“I couldn’t tell you much about his life after that because he has isolated me since 2018,” and also said little to the rest of his family for months. “He sleeps during the day and wakes and eats during the night,” she said.
Fardos, a teaching assistant and translator, said she was born a Muslim, but is not religious and does not care about politics — and had never even heard of Rushdie. “I had no knowledge that my son ever read his book,” she said.
Matar was born in the US and grew up in California. His parents divorced in 2004, his father Hassan Matar returning to Lebanon, while Fardos moved to New Jersey, according to the Mail.

5,China conducts fresh drills around Taiwan as US lawmakers visit Taipei,"BEIJING: China staged fresh military drills around Taiwan on Monday, slamming a new visit by United States lawmakers...","BEIJING: China staged fresh military drills around Taiwan on Monday, slamming a new visit by United States lawmakers to the island days after a similar trip by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi triggered a furious response from Beijing.
The unannounced two-day trip by senior members of Congress prompted China to renew its rhetoric that it would  “prepare for war” over Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing’s leaders claim and have vowed to one day seize.
The five-member congressional delegation — led by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts — met with President Tsai Ing-wen on Monday, according to Washington’s de facto embassy in Taipei.
“The delegation had an opportunity to exchange views with Taiwan counterparts on a wide range of issues of importance to both the United States and Taiwan,” it said.
Tsai told the lawmakers she wants  “to maintain a stable status quo across the Taiwan Strait” and  “jointly maintain the prosperity and stability of the Indo-Pacific region”, her office said in a statement.
She said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine demonstrated  “the threat that authoritarian states pose to the world order”, 
according to her office, and also thanked Washington for its support in the face of Chinese military threats.
The bipartisan trip sparked another bellicose response from Beijing, which said it had carried out a fresh round of  “combat readiness patrol and combat drills in the sea and airspace around Taiwan island” on Monday.
“The Chinese People’s Liberation Army continues to train and prepare for war, resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely crush any form of ‘Taiwan independence’ separatism and foreign interference attempts,” 
Wu Qian, a spokesman for China’s defence ministry, said.
“We warn the US and the DPP authorities: ‘Using Taiwan to contain China’ is doomed to failure,” he added, referring to Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party.
In a defiant response, Taiwan’s defence ministry vowed to face the latest drills  “calmly and seriously and defend national security”.
“Apart from expressing condemnation (of China’s drills), the Ministry of National Defence will comprehensively grasp the movements in the sea and airspace around the Taiwan Strait,” the ministry said.
It added that its forces had detected 30 Chinese planes and five ships operating around the strait on Monday. Of those, 15 planes crossed the median line — an unofficial demarcation that Beijing does not recognise.
Monday’s drills followed days of huge exercises around Taiwan in the wake of Pelosi’s visit, which saw Beijing send warships, missiles and jets into the waters and skies near the island.
Taipei condemned those drills and missile tests as preparation for an invasion.
China’s Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan but says it will use force if necessary to take the island and bristles at any perceived treatment of it as a sovereign nation state. That decades-old threat was reiterated in a white paper published last week, when China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said it would  “not renounce the use of force” against its neighbour and reserved  “the option of taking all necessary measures”.

6,Russia unveils model of new space station,Says new space station will be launched in two phases.,"MOSCOW: Russia’s space agency on Monday unveiled for the first time a physical model of what a planned new Russian-built space station will look like, suggesting Moscow is serious about abandoning the International Space Station (ISS) and going it alone.
Russia, in the throes of what some Kremlin hardliners believe is an historic rupture with the West sparked by sanctions imposed over what Moscow calls its  “special military operation” in Ukraine, is rushing to reduce its dependency on Western nations and forge ahead on its own or cooperate with countries like China and Iran.
The West, which has accused Russia of prosecuting an unprovoked imperial-style war of aggression against Ukraine, has hit the Russian economy with sanctions designed to starve Moscow of technology, know-how and funds.
Russia’s national space agency Roskosmos presented a model of the planned space station, dubbed  “ROSS” by Russian state media, on Monday at  “Army-2022”, a military-industrial exhibition outside Moscow.
Yuri Borisov, whom President Vladimir Putin appointed last month to head Roskosmos, has said Russia will quit the ISS after 2024 and is working to develop its own orbital station.
Launched in 1998, the ISS has been continuously occupied since November 2000 under a US-Russian-led partnership that also includes Canada, Japan and 11 European countries.
Nasa, which is keen to keep the ISS operating until 2030, says it has not yet received official confirmation of Russia’s planned withdrawal and had previously understood that Moscow would continue to participate until 2028.
Roskosmos said in a statement that the new space station would be launched in two phases, without giving dates.
The first phase would see a four-module space station start operating. That would later be followed by a further two modules and a service platform, it said. That would be enough, when completed, to accommodate up to four cosmonauts as well as scientific equipment.

7,Modi says India aims to become developed nation in 25 years,"NEW DELHI: India will aim to become a developed nation within 25 years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a...","NEW DELHI: India will aim to become a developed nation within 25 years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a national day address on Monday, with policies to support domestic production in power, defence and digital technology.
Speaking from the 17th century Red Fort in Delhi as India celebrates its 75th year of independence from British colonial rule, Modi exhorted youth to  “aim big” and give their best years for the cause of the country.
“We must turn India into a developed country in the next 25 years, in our lifetime,” said the 71-year-old Modi, wearing a turban in the colours of the Indian flag, in his 75-minute-speech in Hindi.
“It’s a big resolution, and we should work towards it with all our might.”  The World Bank currently categorises India as a lower-middle income economy — meant for countries with a gross national income per capita of between $1,086 and $4,255. High income countries, like the United States, have a per capita income of $13,205 or more.
India is the world’s sixth-largest economy and is expected to grow at over 7pc in the current fiscal year ending in March 2023 — the fastest among major economies.
Many experts say India’s economy could expand to become the world’s third-largest by 2050 after the United States and China, although per capita income, currently around $2,100, may remain low compared to many countries.
With about 1.4 billion people, India is expected to surpass China as the world’s most populous country next year.
Countries like the United States already see India as a future challenger to China’s dominating influence in Asia and beyond. 
US President Joe Biden on Sunday congratulated India for its national day and said the United States and India were  “indispensable partners” that would continue to work together to address global challenges in the years ahead.

It said the accident happened on Sunday when several people working on a construction site ignored barriers and warning signs on the beach and went swimming in the sea in the Belhorod-Dnistrovskyi district.
“In the water, as a result of an explosion of an unknown object, three men aged 25, 32 and 53 years old ... were killed,” the police said in a written statement. It added that another man and a woman had been wounded.
This summer Ukrainian authorities closed sea beaches because of mines or artillery shells because of the war with Russia and shelling by Russian forces.
Ukraine’s military also planted mines along the coast in case of a Russian amphibious assault after Moscow’s Feb 24 invasion, cordoning off beach entrances with red and white tape to ensure civilians don’t get hurt.

The Medicine and Healt­hcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said in a statement said it had approved the vaccine for adult booster doses  “after it was found to meet the UK regulator’s standards of safety, quality and effectiveness”. It was the 
first such  “bivalent” Covid-19 vaccine to be approved by the British regulator.
The MHRA’s chief executive June Raine said data from a clinical trial had shown it prompted a  “strong immune response” against the original virus and Omicron and would provide a  “sharpened tool in our armoury” as the virus kept evolving.
Moderna’s CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement that the US biotech company was  “delighted” by the decision,  “the first autho­ri­zation of an Omicron-containing bivalent vaccine”.
While vaccines have helped lower hospitalisations and deaths from Covid, which first emerged in China in late 2019, the current jabs are mainly aimed at the earlier strains of the disease.

10,"Japan PM makes donation to war dead shrine, cabinet members visit",The Yasukuni Shrine is seen as a symbol of Japan’s past military aggression.,"TOKYO: Japanese Prime Mini­ster Fumio Kishida sent an offering to a controversial Tokyo shrine for war dead visited by members of his cabinet on Monday, the 77th anniversary of Japan’s World War Two surrender, moves set to anger South Korea and China.
With the Yasukuni Shrine seen as a symbol of Japan’s past military aggression, Japan’s ties with China are already particularly strained this year after it conducted unprecedented military exercises around Taiwan following the visit there by US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this month.
During the drills, several missiles fell in waters inside Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone.
The commemoration at Yasukuni, a site that honours 14 Japanese wartime leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal, as well as war dead, leaves Kishida facing a tricky balancing act.
On the dovish side of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), he must avoid irking international neighbours and partners while still keeping the more right-wing members of the party happy, particularly after the killing of party kingpin Shinzo Abe last month.
Kishida sent an offering to the shrine without visiting, Kyodo news agency reported. He sent offerings to Yasukuni during festivals last year and this spring.
Footage on broadcaster NHK showed the shrine being visited early on Monday by several cabinet ministers, including Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi. Earlier the site was visited by Koichi Hagiuda, the head of the LDP’s policy research council and a key ally of slain former prime minister Shinzo Abe.
“I am not aware of whether the Prime Minister will visit Yasukuni Shrine or not, and I believe that he will make the appropriate decision,” chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a news conference on Monday.
“It is natural for any country to pay respect to those who gave their lives for their country,” Matsuno said.  “Japan will continue to strengthen its relations with its neighbours, including China and South Korea.”
A group of lawmakers that normally visit en masse on Aug 15 said last week they would not do so due to a recent surge in coronavirus cases.
Kishida avoided paying his respects in person on the anniversary of the war’s end while he was a cabinet minister and LDP official, but has sent offerings to the two Yasukuni festivals that have taken place since he took office last October. He, as well as Emperor Naruhito, will attend a separate, secular ceremony later in the day.

Crewed by volunteers wearing Roman tunics, the expedition is part of a European Union-funded project to raise awareness of the region’s Roman past.
Based on the remains of Roman shipwrecks discovered in the German town of Mainz, the Friedrich-Alexander University rebuilt a fourth-century Roman Danube ship made of oak.
“Living Danube Limes” is a transnational project with 10 Danube countries co-operating to make the former Roman  “Limes” — the frontier line of the Roman Empire that takes its name from the Latin word for boundary — a new common cultural bond in Central and South-Eastern Europe.
