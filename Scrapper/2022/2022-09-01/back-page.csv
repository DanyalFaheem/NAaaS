0,Taipei vows to hit back if Chinese troops enter Taiwan,Defence officials say China’s intention to make strait separating two sides its “inner sea” will lead to instability in region.,"TAIPEI: Taiwan said on Wednesday it would exercise its right to self-defence and counter-attack if Chinese armed forces entered its territory, as Beijing increased military activities near the democratically governed island.
Beijing has held military exercises around the island in recent weeks in reaction to a visit to Taipei by US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Taiwanese defence officials said China’s “high intensity” military patrols near Taiwan continued and Beijing’s intention to make the strait separating the two sides its “inner sea” would become the main source of instability in the region.
“For aircraft and ships that entered our sea and air territory of 12 nautical miles, the national army will exercise right to self-defence and counter-attack without exception,” Lin Wen-Huang, a senior Taiwanese military official, told reporters at a news briefing.
Taiwan has complained of Chinese drones repeatedly flying close to its small groups of islands near China’s coast.
The military will exercise the same right to counter-attack Chinese drones that did not heed warnings to leave Taiwanese territory after posing threats, Lin added.
Taiwan fired warning shots at a Chinese drone for the first time on Tuesday shortly after President Tsai Ing-wen ordered the military to take “strong countermeasures” against what she termed Chinese provocations.
Taiwan’s army said its forces again fired warning shots and flares on Wednesday at drones buzzing islets in its Kinmen chain, which are situated just offshore from the Chinese cities of Xiamen and Quanzhou.
The drones then flew back to Xiamen, it added.
‘Playing up nervousness’
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, in a regular press briefing, reiterated Beijing’s position that Taiwan belonged to China.
“Firstly I need to tell you, Taiwan is a province of China, it has no so-called defence ministry. The Taiwan authorities are playing up their nervousness, this is meaningless,” he said.
Earlier in the week, the ministry had dismissed complaints from Taiwan about drone harassment as “not worth fussing about”.
In the same briefing, Ma Cheng-Kun, a director at the National Defence University military academy, said China might further move to reject passage of foreign naval ships through the strait without its permission.
“After the new military normal status has been consolidated, then the risk of collision will increase if foreign naval ships insist on the rights of navigation and freedom,” he said.
US warships and those from allied nations such as Britain and Canada have routinely sailed through the Taiwan strait in recent years, including two US Navy warships last week.
Taiwan’s armed forces are well-equipped, but dwarfed by China’s. President Tsai is overseeing a modernisation programme and has made increasing defence spending a priority.
China has not ruled out using force to bring the island under its control.

1,Aleppo airport hit by Israeli strikes: Syria,"Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says four Israeli missiles targeted runway, depots at the airport.","DAMASCUS: Several Israeli strikes hit Aleppo airport in northern Syria on Wednesday, the official SANA news agency said, also reporting material damage.
“At around 2000 hours (1700 GMT), the Israeli enemy targeted Aleppo international airport with missile fire, causing some material damage at the heart of the facility,” the agency said.
It made no mention of casualties. SANA had earlier reported “the sound of explosions” in the area.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a wide network of sources on the ground for its information, confirmed there had been an attack. It said four Israeli missiles had targeted the runway and depots at the airport believed to contain missiles supplied by Iran.

The observatory did not report any casualties, but said the strikes had triggered explosions and fires. SANA also said that anti-aircraft defences had intercepted “enemy” missiles above the capital Damascus. State television said the missiles were Israeli.
Last Thursday, SANA reported two civilians wounded in a series of Israeli air strikes on the western Hama and Tartus regions.
The observatory said they were among the heaviest Israeli raids so far against Iranian-aligned militias in Syria.
Since civil war erupted in Syria in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of air strikes against its northern neighbour, targeting government troops as well as allied Iran-backed forces and Hezbollah fighters.
While Israel rarely comments on individual strikes, it has acknowledged carrying out hundreds of them.
The Israeli military has defended such action as necessary to prevent arch-enemy Iran from gaining a foothold on its doorstep.

2,The US-trained pilot turned ‘Taliban asset’,Edris Momand was trained by US to fly sophisticated machines but later handed his helicopter to Taliban.,"

During the war in Afghanistan, the US handpicked a few Afghan military pilots and trained them to fly sophisticated machines — most of which were manufactured by the US itself — and target the Taliban.
Mohammad Edris Momand was a part of the group.
But when the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul was imminent, Mr Momand ditched the Afghan military and flew his helicopter to hand it over to the Taliban.
“Some people may not be happy with me, but I tell them the country is like a mother and no one should betray it,” Momand said in an interview to BBC News.
“My aim was to protect an asset that belongs to Afghanistan.”
He had joined the Afghan military in 2009 and went to the US for a four-year training at the American Military Academy.
Talking to BBC News, Mr Momand said he was ‘very happy and excited’ when he was selected for the training.
After his training, he initially flew Russian-built Mi-17 helicopters. However, in 2018, he was part of a group of pilots that was selected to fly US-manufactured Black Hawk.
Turning to the enemy
Recalling the events of 14 August, the day the Taliban took over Kabul, Mr Momand said that the situation was tense as the Taliban were nearing Kabul.
The capital’s airport was under the control of the US military and the Air Force commander had ordered all the pilots to fly out to Uzbekistan, he told BBC.
Angered at the directives, Mr Momand decided not to obey them.
“My commander was urging me to betray my country, why should I obey such an order?”
He said that after consulting his father, he flew the helicopter, but not to Uzbekistan, but to his village in Kunar province which was already under the Taliban’s control.
However, the endeavour was not that simple. He first had to ditch the crew —a four-member crew is standard for every Black Hawk — as he had no faith in them.
“Every Black Hawk has a four-member crew. I knew I couldn’t trust them with my plan. I was sure they wouldn’t agree. They would have endangered my life and even destroyed the helicopter.”

3,Pressure on ‘polluting nations’ to help Pakistan cope,"Countries like Pakistan that have contributed the least to global warming are often battered by the worst impacts, observers say.","PARIS: Rich carbon polluters should feel “moral pressure” to help fund climate-vulnerable nations wracked by weather extremes such as Pakistan, which is responsible for less than 0.5pc of global emissions, diplomats and scientists said on Wednesday.
“This is not a freak accident,” said Nabeel Munir, Pakistan’s ambassador to Seoul and chair of the largest negotiating bloc of developing nations at UN climate negotiations.
“The science proves the frequency and the impact of these disasters is only going to increase and we have to be prepared for that.” The human and economic impact is already staggering and “this is an ongoing disaster; the rains are still going on”, he said.
Countries like Pakistan that have contributed the least to global warming are often battered by the worst impacts, observers say.
The issue will be thrown into sharp relief with Pakistan fronting the important G77+China bloc — representing more than a hundred nations and a significant proportion of the global population — as it reels from weather disasters.
Read: International responsibility
Pakistan has contributed less than 0.5 percent of heat-trapping emissions pumped into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution, said Kristina Dahl, principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The US is responsible for 25 percent.
Recall that in March, a blistering hot spell began to develop across parts of South Asia, with Pakistan registering record temperatures.
Scientists from the World Weather Attribution climate group estimated that climate change had made the heatwave 30 times more likely.
Quickly melting glaciers can saturate the landscape and cause glacial lake outburst floods, unleashing torrents of ice, rock and water.
That can lead to a “compound effect where we’ve got higher than average river levels, on top of higher than average rainfall”, said Helen Griffith, a researcher of hydrology and environmental science at the University of Reading.

4,Two Pakistanis detained in  Saudi Arabia’s ‘biggest drug bust’,Raid on Riyadh warehouse results in record seizure of 46m amphetamine pills that were reportedly smuggled in a shipment of flour.,"

Riyadh: Two Pakistani citizens were among eight people arrested by Saudi authorities in a raid on a warehouse resulting in the record seizure of 46 million amphetamine pills that were reportedly smuggled in a shipment of flour.
The Saudi state-run SPA news agency reported that the security forces tracked the shipment as it arrived at the Riyadh Dry Port and was moved to a warehouse. Subsequently, the authorities raided the warehouse and detained six Syrian citizens along with two Pakistani nationals.
The General Directorate of Narcotics Control (GDNC) did not name the amphetamine, but Saudi Arabia is the largest market for tablets bearing the captagon logo.
Captagon — typically a mix of amphetamine, caffeine and various fillers — is reportedly one of the most popular drugs among affluent youths in the Gulf, according to the report.
A spokesperson for the GDNC quoted by BBC News stated that the shipment of 46,916,480 amphetamine tablets seized in Riyadh was the “biggest operation of its kind to smuggle this amount of narcotics into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in one operation”.
According to the report, he stressed that security personnel were determined to combat and foil the activities of criminal networks targeting the country and its citizens, and that all people involved faced deterrent penalties.

5,Trump team ‘may have moved secret papers’ amid probe,Justice Deparment says it has evidence papers were concealed from FBI when it tried to retrieve them from Trump’s Florida estate.,"WASHINGTON: The US Justice Department said on Tuesday it had evidence that classified documents were deliberately concealed from the Federal Bureau of Investigation when it tried to retrieve them in June from former president Donald Trump’s Florida estate, prompting its unprecedented search of his home.
In a 54-page filing, prosecutors laid out their evidence of obstruction of justice, alleging publicly for the first time that Trump aides both falsely certified in June that the former president had returned all the government records he had stored in his home after leaving the White House last year.
It also revealed that Trump’s lawyers “explicitly prohibited government personnel from opening or looking inside any of the boxes” inside a storage room when FBI agents first travelled to his Palm Beach Mar-a-Lago resort in June to retrieve the records.
“The government also developed evi­dence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the storage room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the governments investigation,” the department said in a filing in district court in Florida.
It released a photograph of some of the records found inside Trump’s home bearing classification markings, some of which refer to clandestine human sources.
The Justice Department’s filings come ahead of a Thursday court hearing before judge Aileen Cannon in West Palm Beach. She is weighing Trump’s request to appoint a special master who would conduct a privilege review of the documents seized from Mar-a-Lago on Aug. 8, many of which are labelled as classified.
A special master is an independent third party sometimes appointed by a court in sensitive cases to review materials potentially covered by attorney-client privilege to ensure investigators do not improperly view them.
A special master was appointed, for instance, in the searches of the homes and offices of two of Trump’s former attorneys: Rudy Giuliani and Michael Cohen.
In Trump’s initial request to the court, his attorneys claimed that the former president wanted to protect materials that were subject to a legal doctrine known as executive privilege, which can shield some presidential communications.
Legal experts called that argument into question, saying it was illogical for a former president to claim he wanted to assert executive privilege against the executive branch itself.
Donald Trump’s legal team later narrowed its request, asking for a privilege review without explicitly referring to executive privilege.
The Justice Department said on Tuesday it opposed the appointment of a special master.
Trump, prosecutors argued, lacks standing in the case because the records “do not belong to him”.
The Aug 8 search of Trump’s home was a significant escalation of one of several federal and state investigations Trump is facing.
‘Classificaton markings’
In a redacted affidavit underpinning the search released publicly by the department last week, an unidentified FBI agent said the agency reviewed and identified 184 documents “bearing classification markings” after Trump in January returned 15 boxes of government records sought by the US National Archives.
After the National Archives discovered the classified material, some of which pertained to intelligence-gathering and clandestine human sources, it referred the matter to the FBI.
