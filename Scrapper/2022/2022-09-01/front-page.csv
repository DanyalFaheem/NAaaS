SWAT / MANSEHRA / ISLAMABAD: Prime Min­ister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday visited flood-hit areas in Khyber Pakhtun­khwa and announced Rs10 billion in funds to rehabilitate the calamity-hit areas, even as a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) painted a grim picture of the health and humanitarian crises simmering across the country.
During his visit to Kalam and other parts of Swat, the premier met the flood survivors and addressed a gathering in Kalam and Kanju wherein he promised all-out help by the federal government in overcoming the crisis.

About the Rs10bn package, PM Sharif said the federal government, the Nat­ional Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), and the provincial administration would ensure transparency and immediate disbursement of money in the affected areas.
According to the PM, the federal government had allocated an amount of Rs28 billion which was being disbursed among the affected through the NDMA and the Benazir Income Support Programme. He added every affected family was being given a cash amount of R25,000 whereas each family was entitled to Rs1 million compensation if they had lost a loved one in the floods.
“The cash support announced by the federal government is no substitute for the loss of lives…but it is the responsibility of the government to provide maximum comfort in this hour of grief,” the premier added. At least 5,000km of roads were damaged in the country due to flooding as per the latest reports, according to PM Sharif.

During his address in the Pattan area of Lower Kohistan, the prime minister said thanked the United Nations and other nations for extending support to Pakistan in this hour of need. “The friendly countries…stood with us in this critical time [and] pledged financial assistance for reconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure and population affected by the calamity,” he added.
‘Restore power supply’
In a meeting following his visit to KP, PM Sharif directed authorities concerned to restore the power supply and repair damaged roads in the flood-hit areas within two days with the help of the Frontier Works Organisation.
“Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the authorities concerned to rehabilitate the flood-hit roads and communications infrastructure by Friday and asked the Power Division to submit a report on work for power supply restoration since August 25,” the Prime Minister’s Office said.
He also instructed for the revival of road connectivity between Kalam and Swat by next week and the repairing of Balochistan’s power transmission network within the next 48 hours.
Editorial: Looming shortages
The prime minister instructed Power Minister Khurram Dastgir to visit Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to monitor the restoration of power transmission lines and submit a report by 10am today (Thursday).
116 districts affected by floods
The WHO in its report said that at least 888 health facilities were damaged in rain-induced floods that have affected 116 out of 154 districts across the country. It further said that over 1,000 people were killed while as many as 15,000 were injured in floods. Over 33 million people have been affected out of which 6.4 million people, including 421,000 people displaced by floods, were in dire need of humanitarian aid, the WHO added.
“As of August 28, 888 health facilities have been damaged in Pakistan of which 180 of them are completely damaged,” it stated. The health body stated that Pakistan was already battling multiple outbreaks, including Covid, and added that the “current situation will highly likely increase the spread of disease especially if/when response capacities are hindered”.

“Ongoing disease outbreaks in Pakistan, including acute watery diarrhoea, dengue fever, malaria, polio, and Covid-19 are being further aggravated, particularly in camps and [areas] where water and sanitation facilities have been damaged,” the report stated.
“WHO has also diverted mobile medical camps, including those responding to Covid-19 teams, to affected districts, delivered 1.7 million aqua tabs to ensure access to clean water, and provided sample collection kits to ensure clinical testing of samples to ensure early detection of infectious diseases,” the report stated.
Meanwhile, speaking to BBC News, British High Commissioner to Pakistan Christian Turner linked these floods to climate change. “…The evidence I am seeing on the ground is that this level of impact is unprecedented. This is not just a bad monsoon season. It is a whole lot more and I think it’s the era of climate catastrophe in which were are now in,” he added.
Defence Day ceremony postponed
Separately, the army postponed the Defence Day ceremony at the General Headquarters to express solidarity with the flood victims. ISPR chief Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar said that the Pakistan Armed Forces shall continue serving our brothers and sisters struck by unprecedented floods.

1,Court tells Imran to ‘rethink’ reply in contempt case,"Even a word from leaders with such a huge following can create risks for their intended targets, observes IHC CJ","

PTI chairman Imran Khan arrives to appear before the Islamabad High Court on Wednesday.—Mohammad Asim / White Star

 
ISLAMABAD: Finding Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman Imran Khan’s reply in the contempt proceedings against him ‘unsatisfactory’, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday observed it was not a reply of a leader of his stature but provided another opportunity to him to furnish an appropriate and well-thought-out response.
A five-judge bench, headed by IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah and also comprising Justice Moh­sin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Mian­gul Hassan Aurangzeb, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Justice Babar Sattar, reminded Advocate Hamid Khan, counsel for the ex-premier, to be mindful while drafting the reply that the high court was bound by the apex court convictions in contempt proceedings against Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leaders Talal Chaudhry, Daniyal Aziz and Nihal Hashmi in 2018 and a separate case against Dr Fidaus Ashiq Awan in 2020.
The IHC had taken up the contempt case against Mr Khan over his intimidating remarks against Additional District and Sessions Judge Zeba Chaudhry at a public rally in Islamabad’s F-9 Park on Aug 20.
Attired in white shalwar kameez suit with a rosary in his left hand, Mr Khan sat quietly in the courtroom along with his party leaders Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Asad Umar, Shibli Faraz and Faisal Javed. Police had cordoned off the entire court premises and no one except with special passes were allowed to enter the premises.

Even a word from leaders with such a huge following can create risks for their intended targets, observes IHC CJ

The IHC chief justice reminded the counsel that district court judges were not less important than the high court or apex court judges, as the masses access the district judiciary, besides the environment in which the subordinate judiciary works was commendable.
“District courts represent the trust and confidence of the ordinary people,” Justice Minallah observed, also reminding the counsel that the gravity of the contempt case must be realized by his client also dropping hints to show some remorse for the uncharitable remarks against the district judicial officer.
Justice Aurangzeb, at the hearing, remarked that the CJ had given many openings to Mr Khan, also reminding his counsel that the case could have been closed the same day had appropriate reply been filed.
“We are not inclined to discharge the notice having found the reply by Imran Khan to be unsatisfactory, though the reply had pleaded to discharge the show-cause notice in the contempt case,” said a two-page order.
With the consent of the parties, the high court also appointed the Pakistan Bar Council, senior counsel Munir A. Malik and Makhdoom Ali Khan as amici curiae to assist the court with a direction that the counsel for Mr Khan would provide copies of the supplementary reply he would file in advance to Attorney General for Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf – the prosecutor general in the case – as well as the amici curiae.
The case will be taken up again on Sept 8.
The court also assured the parties that contempt proceedings would be kept transparent, as even Amnesty International representatives have been allowed to watch the proceedings.
Justice Minallah reminded the counsel that every word uttered by political leaders with huge following had the “potential of creating and presenting clear threat” to the persons against whom such statements were made.
Referring to the allegations of torture on PTI leader Shahbaz Gill, the chief justice remarked that the controversial statement was made despite the fact that the acting chief justice was already seized with the matter. “Was such a statement justified,” the CJ wondered.
Justice Minallah questioned whether the Adiyala Jail superintendent, who was under the authority of the Punjab government, accept the judicial custody of a prisoner if he was badly tortured?
The court also referred to enforced disappearances as ‘the worst-ever torture’, the case of a missing Baloch student from Islamabad and the Jan 22, 2021 letter by the UN rapporteur to the state of Pakistan in which the incidents meted out to journalists such as Matiullah Jan, Asad Toor, and Absar Alam were mentioned. “This court has been referring the cases of torture to the federal government for the last three years and had these matters be taken up by the government with the same zeal and zest, the situation would have been different today,” the chief justice deplored.
Explaining why contempt matters were serious in nature, Justice Minallah said the courts were there to serve the people, but any “obstruction in the administration of justice” became a serious matter. About a smear campaign against the opening of courts at midnight, the chief justice said the courts were opened to prevent the repetition of Oct 12, 1999 when the PML-N government was sacked in a military coup.
“We never respond to such allegations but the courts are available 24 hours for the weak and our only concern is to uphold civilian supremacy and the Constitution,” the chief justice observed.
He deplored how some political leaders abused social media and recalled that even his private picture with a Supreme Court judge went viral and someone accused himself of “receiving a flat as a gift”. But such matters did not affect the high court judges even if hundreds of thousands of political activists surrounded the court, the chief justice said, adding that if the political leaders did not uphold the dignity, respect and prestige of the judiciary, there would be a chaos.
The chief justice also observed change would come only if every institution functioned within the confines of the Constitution. While pointing towards the AGP, Justice Minallah said it was regrettable that the present government was filing terrorism and sedition cases against opponents, and also suggesting to enforce Police Order in the federal capital.

2,"Petrol raised by Rs2, diesel up Rs3","Hike attributed primarily to exch­ange rate fluctuation, increase in the petroleum levy in line with commitment with IMF.","ISLAMABAD: The government raised prices of all petroleum products for the next fortnight despite a decline in global oil rates, mainly because of the exch­ange rate fluctuation and an increase in the petroleum levy in line with commitment with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
According to a late-night notification issued by the finance ministry, the per-litre price of petrol has been increased by Rs2.07, high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs2.99, kerosene by Rs10.92, and that of light diesel oil (LDO) by Rs9.79.
“In the fortnightly review of petroleum products’ pri­ces, the government has considered the recommendation to make partial increase in the prices of petroleum products in line with change in the international oil prices and fluctuation in the exchange rate,” the ministry said, adding that “petroleum levy has been kept at minimum in order to provide relief to the consumers”.
The new ex-depot prices for the Sept 1-15 period are: petrol at Rs235.98, HSD at Rs247.43, kerosene at Rs210.32, and LDO at Rs201.54 per litre.
In the previous fuel price announcement on Aug 16, the government raised the rates of petrol and LDO but reduced those of HSD and kerosene.
The rate of petrol was increased by Rs6.72 and that of LDO by 43 paise per litre, whereas the prices of HSD and kerosene were cut by 51 paise and Rs1.67 per litre, respectively.
On July 14, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced a reduction of Rs18 to 40 per litre in fuel prices after global rates went down. That was the first time the coalition government reduced petroleum prices after it came to power in the second week of April.
The government started raising fuel prices from the last week of May to fulfil IMF conditions for resuming a bailout package.
Between May 26 and July 1, the petrol price rose by 66pc (or Rs99 per litre), HSD by 92pc (Rs132.39), kerosene by 95pc, LDO by 80pc (Rs100.59).
The price hike has been the main issue between Pakistan and the IMF as part of an agreement to withdraw subsidies in oil and power sectors to reduce the fiscal deficit.
Ousted prime minister Imran Khan had given the subsidy in his last days in power to cool down public sentiments in the face of double-digit inflation, a move the IMF said deviated from the terms of the 2019 deal.
The petroleum development levy (PDL) came to an end on March 1 price revision as international prices went up and the PTI government decided to not only reduce petroleum prices by Rs10 per litre but freeze it for the next four months, i.e. until the end of June.
Under the IMF deal, the government has to gradually increase the PDL on oil products to a maximum of Rs50 per litre to collect Rs855bn during the current fiscal year.
At present, GST is zero on all four fuel products against the normal tax rate of 17pc. However, the government is currently charging a PDL of Rs15 to Rs25 per litre on various products. It is also charging a customs duty of about Rs20 per litre on petrol and HSD.

3,"Indian imports only after consulting stakeholders, says Miftah",ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said on Wednesday the government would take a decision on allowing imports...,"ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said on Wednesday the government would take a decision on allowing imports from India in the aftermath of floods after looking at supplies and taking coalition partners and stakeholders on board.
Separately, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) exempted relief goods imports from duties and taxes to help flood victims, many of whom have been displaced and are sweltering in the summer heat with sporadic food aid and little access to water.
“More than one international agency has approa­ched the government to allow them to bring food items from India through the land border [of Wagah],” Mr Ismail tweeted on Wednes­day. “The government will take the decision to allow imports or not based on supply shortage position, after consulting its coalition partners and key stakeholders.”
The coalition government is currently looking into all options, including allowing vegetable imports from India, to alleviate the suffering of the millions of people affected by the floods.
Pakistan has already allowed the trade of pharmaceutical products and surgical instruments with India.
Trade ties between Pakistan and India have largely been frozen since the latter revoked held Kashmir’s special constitutional status in August 2019.
In November last year, the PTI government allowed the import and transportation of 50,000 tonnes of wheat and life-saving medicines from India to Afghanistan through the Wagah border on humanitarian grounds.
On Monday, Mr Ismail told a TV channel that “we need to consider getting some vegetables over the land border”.
“We have to do it because of the kind of prices and shortages we are experiencing... Inflation has broken people’s backs,” he said.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has criticised the government for trying to resume trade with India on the pretext of floods, with party leader Fawad Chaudhry wondering how the government could start trade with India ignoring the atrocities on the people of occupied Kashmir.
‘No decision on Indian imports’
On Wednesday, Commerce Minister Naveed Qamar accused the PTI of doing politics over the government’s intention to import tomatoes and onions from neighbouring countries.
“It’s time to support and work in coordination to alleviate the flood impact,” Mr Qamar told reporters in a presser in Islamabad, alongside Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman and Minister of State for Law and Justice Shahadat Awan.
The prices of essential food items had shot up due to supply chain disruptions, he said, insisting that it was difficult for citizens to purchase expensive food items.
“We politicians can afford to buy at higher rates,” he said, advising PTI leaders to support government initiatives for extending relief to flood-hit people, especially in Sindh and Balochistan.
Earlier, during a meeting of the Senate’s Standing Committee on Commerce, Mr Qamar clarified that for now the government had decided to import onions and tomatoes from Iran and Afghanistan. He was replying to Senator Palwasha Khan, who had asked whether the government was considering importing the staples from India.
“No decision has been taken yet about importing onions and tomatoes from India,” he stressed. “The decision on imports from India will be taken after consultation with all stakeholders. No permission has been granted yet.”
However, the commerce minister informed the committee that the government would facilitate private companies in importing these items from Iran and Afghanistan. Currently, importers are buying tomatoes and onions from Afghanistan.
He told committee members that floods had badly damaged crops and the country could face food shortages from next month. Standing crops had been damaged while new ones could not be planted because the fields were submerged, he said, noting that vegetable prices had been on the rise as a result.
Meanwhile, the FBR said in a statement the prime minister had ordered urgent relief measures to ensure an uninterrupted supply of relief goods for flood victims.
The duty exemption — subject to certification by the National Disaster Management Authority and the relevant provincial disaster management authority — will also apply to goods being sent as donations by foreign governments, organisations and individual donors.

4,‘Pakistan doesn’t have to choose between US and China’,"Derek Chollet says US worried by Islamabad’s path as nations entering into deals with China don’t ""end up well"".","• Secretary of State’s aide says US worried by Islamabad’s path as nations entering into deals with China ‘don’t end up well’
WASHINGTON: The United States doesn’t ask Pakis­tan to choose between it and China, but rather wants cou­ntries “to be able to have a choice”. However, Washington is worried that nations entering into relationships with China “are not going to end up well”, said Derek Chollet, a senior adviser to the US Secretary of State.
In an interview with Dawn, Counselor Chollet said Washing­ton was not “afraid of competing with China, but would like to have a fair competition”.



 
He stressed that the US had honest differences with both India and Pakistan, but wanted to maintain and diversify its strong relationship with Islamabad.
Mr Chollet also spoke about former prime minister Imran Khan’s allegations of US involvement in toppling his government, pointing out that those claims were completely baseless.
Asked if the US was upset with the former premier and those allegations make him a less liked politician in the States, Mr Chollet said: “All I can say is that there is nothing to the allegations. Those were not true.”
“What we want to stay focused on is where we are going in the US-Pakistan relationship, to reflect on all that we have achieved in 75 years but also all that we must achieve in the coming 75 years.”
The US official also underlined Washington’s concerns about the current floods in Pakistan, pointing out that the Biden administration already announced $30 million in assistance and was willing to do more.
“These horrific floods are something that we have not seen since 2010. And by some accounts, it is worse than the floods of 2010,” he said. “It is a climate cataclysm that we are seeing in Pakistan. It is just devastating.”
The US, he said, was committed to “doing our part with our partners in the international community to help Pakistan respond to this terrible natural disaster.”
The US would also work with the United Nations to raise $160m for the flood victims, he added.
Responding to a question about his statement that the US was not afraid of having a fair competition with China, he said: “Pakistan has a close relationship with China, has for many years. The US again, is not asking countries to choose between the US and China. We just want countries to be able to have a choice.”
Reminded that in the past, this relationship was more linked to US security concerns about the region, Mr Chollet said: “We are interested in diversifying the relationship even further. We already have a fairly strong and robust business relationship. But I think that is something that we are interested in growing further.”
Asked if Pakistan still had strategic value for the US, he said: “Oh, absolutely. I mean, Pakistan is one of the world’s largest Muslim countries. It has the fifth or sixth largest population. It is a critically important country to the US.”
“And that is why we are committed as we project forward over the next 75 years, to find ways that we can deepen this partnership and achieve so many of the shared interests and goals that we have.”
On a question about why sometimes people in Pakistan feel that India gets an unfair advantage — for instance, Washington allows it to purchase cheap oil from Russia while preventing Pakistan from doing so — Mr Chollet said: “Our relationship with each country stands on its own. And we have much that we share with both countries,” he said. “We do have honest differences with both countries. What matters is how we work through those differences.”
“Our perspective in terms of working with Pakistan is we are going to work through those differences in the spirit of partnership, and cooperation and try to keep an eye on all that we share. We both are going to remain true to our interests and our values. But we see much that we share together.”
Do US concerns about China make India a more valuable ally? To this, he said: “These relationships, we do not see them as conjoined. They are separate relationships. And we have separate sets of goals, ambitions, and challenges with both countries.”
However, he agreed that the US had a concern about China globally. “In South Asia and in East Asia, in Southeast Asia, all around the world, China is playing a role that in many cases is not consistent with what we think our interests are,” he said.
The US, he said, committed to finding ways to work with China on shared interests, for example, on climate change, but the Chinese pulled out of these discussions.
Asked if Pakistan could also face a Sri Lanka-like situation because of the Chinese loans, he said: “What we are worried about is that countries — whether in South Asia or all around the world — entering into relationships with China are not going to end up well.”
“And so, we want to be very candid with countries about the choices that they make. And again, the critical thing, it is not for the US to decide, these are choices.”
