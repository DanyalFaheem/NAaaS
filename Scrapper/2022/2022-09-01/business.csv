0,Tax revenue rises to Rs489bn in August,"Gross collection increases from Rs462bn during August last year to Rs526bn, an increase of 14pc.","ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Wednesday announced that its net collection grew by over 9 per cent to Rs489 billion in August, exceeding the Rs483bn target set for the month. 
The revenue collection in the first two months of the current fiscal year stood at Rs948bn against the target of Rs926bn, an increase of 2.37pc.
An official announcement said these figures would further improve after the book adjustments have been taken into account. These collections are the highest-ever in August.
It further said this outstanding revenue performance is a reflection of the board’s resolve to build on its growth trajectory despite import compression and floods.
On the other hand, the gross collection increased from Rs462bn during August last year to Rs526bn, showing an increase of 14pc. Likewise, the refunds disbursed during August were Rs37bn compared to Rs14.3bn paid last year, an increase of 161pc.
This is reflective of FBR’s strong commitment to fast-track refunds and thereby prevent liquidity shortages in the industry. The significant revenue increase in August is largely the outcome of various policy and revenue measures introduced by the government in the Finance Act 2022.
Unlike in the past, there is a visible focus on taxing the affluent. Owing to this paradigm shift, the growth in domestic income tax is almost 38pc which is a remarkable shift towards direct taxation. Likewise, there is a significant upsurge in advance tax collected during August, which is a 72pc increase from the corresponding period of the previous year.
Furthermore, the net collection under income tax jumped 33pc to Rs165bn in August against Rs124bn last year. The sales tax collection is Rs218bn this year against Rs223bn last year, indicating a decline of 2.24pc.
The net collection from customs duty stood at Rs82bn in August against Rs77bn in the same month last year, showing a marginal increase of 6.49pc. The collection from federal excise duty was Rs24bn against Rs23bn last year, an increase of 4.34pc.

1,"KE’s July tariff cut by Rs3.48, but Discos allowed Rs4.34 hike",No decision taken on KE’s request for a Rs14.53 per unit increase under quarterly tariff adjustment for April-June.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Wednesday cleared Rs4.34 per unit additional fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) and about Rs3.48 per unit reduction in FCA for K-Electric consumers for power consumed in July.
However, the regulator did not decide on KE’s other request for a Rs14.53 per unit increase under quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA) for April-June. Under the uniform tariff policy applicable across the country, these QTA costs are usually not passed to consumer bills and settled against tariff differential subsidy in the budget. However, the final decision is made by the federal government.
The two separate public hearings were conducted by Nepra chairman Tauseef H. Farooqui and members Rafique A. Shaikh and Maqsood Anwar Khan.
The regulator concluded that FCA for KE would be Rs3.63-Rs4.10 per unit against KE’s petition for Rs3.48 per unit cut in fuel cost for electricity consumed in July. A final decision would be notified after detailed verification of fuel cost invoices and related parameters. This will reduce KE’s revenue collection by more than Rs6.5bn in September.
It was explained that the major reason for the reduction in KE’s fuel cost when compared to June was a decline in global fuel prices. The price of power purchased from the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) in July dropped by 31pc when compared to June while the price of RLNG decreased by 16pc. In the same period, furnace oil prices increased by 4pc.
On the other hand, the regulator worked out an increase of Rs4.34 per unit in FCA for all other Discos instead of Rs4.69 per unit demanded by CPPA. During the hearing, the CPPA officers told the regulator that they would challenge a decision of the Lahore High Court against the collection of FCA because it involved Rs133bn without which the power companies would not be able to provide a smooth power supply.
The CPPA on behalf of ex-Wapda Discos had sought an additional FCA of Rs4.69 per unit to generate about Rs65bn in supplementary revenue on account of a higher cost of electricity consumed in July. The additional FCA for July is almost 53pc lower than that of a record Rs9.90 per unit in June because of a substantial increase in the share of cheaper domestic fuels, particularly priceless hydropower generation and inexpensive nuclear power.
The biggest contribution to the overall power grid came from hydropower. Its share showed a significant increase to 35pc in July compared to 24pc in June and May. Hydropower has no fuel cost. The lower availability of expensive imported RLNG also came as a blessing in disguise to consumers.
The CPPA claimed that the consumers were charged a reference fuel cost of Rs6.29 per unit in July, but the actual cost turned out to be Rs10.98 per unit, hence an additional charge of about Rs4.69 per unit to consumers. The revised electricity rates, once notified, would be charged to all consumers in the next billing month (September) except to those using less than 50 units per month.
Data showed that the 64pc share of domestic fuel sources in overall power generation in July was significantly higher at 51.58pc in June which was slightly lower than 54pc in May. The share of domestic fuel-based power generation had stood at 50pc in April and 45pc in March.
After hydropower, the second highest contribution of about 15pc to the overall power supply came from imported RLNG-based power plants in July, which was significantly lower than 24.43pc in June and 23pc in May. With the revival of 1,100MW K-2 Nuclear Power Plant after a month-long closure for refuelling, the share of nuclear power also increased to 14.2pc in July from 9pc in June. Nuclear power contributed 13pc share in May and 17.37pc in April.
The share of coal-based power plants was slightly lower at 12.74pc in July compared to 13.6pc in June and May. The coal-based generation has come down from 16.74pc in April and 25pc in March because of low coal stocks amid financial limitations of power producers and higher global prices.
The share of domestic gas in power generation stood almost unchanged at 10.36pc in July against 11pc in June and 10pc in May and April. The residual fuel oil-based generation stood at 6.2pc in July, significantly lower than 10.48pc in June because of improved production from nuclear and hydropower.
The cost of power generation from domestic gas increased to Rs9.96 per unit in July when compared to Rs8.9 per unit in June but was still lower than Rs10.12 per unit in May. Gas-based power cost was Rs8.4 per unit in April and Rs7.75 per unit in March.
Three renewable energy sources — wind, bagasse and solar — together contributed about 4.45pc power supply in July compared to 7pc in June and 6.5pc in May. Wind and solar have no fuel cost, while that of bagasse has been calculated at Rs5.98 per unit – unchanged.

2,"Amreli Steels, Bolan Castings suspend production",Amreli Steels Ltd blames unprecedented monsoon rains and flash floods across the country for its decision to shut down production.,"KARACHI: A day after Indus Motor Company Ltd and Millat Tractor Ltd announced production shutdowns owing to parts shortages and delivery disruptions caused by flood devastation across the country, two more companies have declared their inability to keep operating their plants amid unfavourable economic conditions.
The country’s largest producer of steel bars, Amreli Steels Ltd, said on Wednesday it’s decided to shut down its plants for 20 days owing to low demand of steel rebars in the country. It blamed unprecedented monsoon rains and flash floods across the country for its decision to shut down production.
As a result, the company will carry out no manufacturing from Aug 31 to Sept 19. “The resumption of operations or further extension in production suspension (as the case may be) will be communicated accordingly,” it said.  
Separately, Bolan Castings Ltd — a subsidiary of Millat Tractors Ltd that manufactures and sells casting for tractors and automotive parts — told investors on Wednesday it’s decided to “temporarily halt” production from Sept 1 to 13.
“In view of the devastating flood, the road and farm infrastructure of the country has been badly damaged due to which the tractors’ deliveries have been adversely affected. This has, in turn, drastically reduced the demand for our tractors’ castings,” it said.

3,‘Complaints’ about non-acceptance of flood donations baseless: SBP,Says banks are accepting donations in the CM Flood Relief Fund through all possible channels.,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Wednesday the complaints against banks for not accepting donations for flood victims are misleading.
A press statement by the central bank referred to “a few complaints” doing the rounds on social media platforms regarding the “non-acceptance of donations” from the general public in the CM Flood Relief Funds set up by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.
“In this context, upon enquiry of (the) SBP, concerned banks have informed that such complaints are baseless as they are accepting donations in the CM Flood Relief Fund through all possible channels, including over-the-counter cash transactions, online transfers and both international and local credit card transfers),” the SBP said.
Reports alluding to a deliberate attempt by the federal government to stop donations gathered pace on Aug 30 when Muzzammil Aslam, PTI’s spokesperson on the economy and finance, posted on his Twitter timeline an “as-received” message.
“Some friends abroad have reported that their credit card donations transactions were not taking place, last evening. On raising the issue with the respective Credit Card companies, it was revealed that the government of Pakistan had blocked their operation for some period of the duration of the Telethon.
“Perhaps they did not want IK to collect an impressive figure. Actually, they are playing with the lives of the beneficiaries of these donations. Very sad and frustrating action. Please clarify the situation,” he wrote.
Mr Aslam’s tweets received immediate censure from a number of Twitter users who accused the PTI spokesman on the economy and finance of not knowing how payment gateways work.
“How in the world can a government block credit cards of people in a foreign country? Do you guys have no shame?” wrote Twitter user @JiyaEss.
Lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii wondered aloud how the government could pull off such a trick. “Like @Mastercard and @Visa cards weren’t working because the @GovtofPakistan refused to receive their payments?” he asked, rhetorically.
The SBP said the relevant banks have also confirmed that transactions are taking place in these flood relief bank accounts on a daily basis. 
It asked the donors facing any problem to lodge their complaints with the relevant banks or approach the SBP directly at cpd.helpdesk@sbp.org.pk.

4,Oil prices fall on recession fears,LONDON: Oil prices extended their slide on Wednesday on investor worries about the ailing state of the global...,"LONDON: Oil prices extended their slide on Wednesday on investor worries about the ailing state of the global economy, bearish oil demand signals from Opec+ and increased restrictions to curb Covid-19 in China.
Brent crude futures for October, due to expire on Wednesday, were down $2.71 at $96.60 a barrel following Tuesday’s $5.78 loss. The more active November contract was down $1.26, or 1.3 per cent, at $96.58 a barrel.
US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down $1.31, or 1.4pc, to $90.33 a barrel by 10:43 a.m. EST (1543 GMT), after sliding $5.37 in the previous session on recession fears.
Both contracts fell by more than 3% in earlier trade.
“The latest signs of stuttering growth are contracting Chinese factory activity in August and the slower-than-expected expansion of the country’s service sector,” Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said.
“Additionally, both the Fed and the ECB are thought to hike interest rates significantly next month, probably by as much as 0.75pc — and all these make equity investors run for the exit. Oil duly follows, at least for the time being.”

5,No wheat shortage amid crop damage in Sindh: Passco,Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation official says loss of wheat estimated to be Rs4bn.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Standing Committee on National Food Security and Research was assured on Wednesday that there will be no shortage of wheat in the country despite the loss of stocked grain in Sindh in the wake of heavy rains and floods in the country.
The Managing Director of Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (Passco), Saeed Ahmad Nawaz, presented details to the committee on the loss and damage of stocked wheat in Sindh and Balochistan, and said that the loss of wheat has been estimated to be Rs4 billion.
He explained that in Khairpur, 26,956 tonnes of wheat were damaged, while in Hyderabad, 564 tonnes of wheat were damaged due to a flash flood. Out of the stock of 22,00,000 lakh and 66,000 tonnes, Passco has lost 52,670 tonnes of wheat in Sindh.
The Ministry of National Food Security and Research (MNFSR) Secretary Zafar Hassan disclosed that the ministry has finalised the minimum support price for wheat for 2022-23 and has shared it with the prime minister. He said that the cost of production of wheat has been estimated to be Rs2,495 per maund.
The Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Industries and Production informed the committee that there is no shortage of fertilisers in the country. A government-to-government agreement has been signed with Iran to import 300,000 tonnes of DAP on a barter basis. He stated that Pakistan will supply Iran with rice and fertiliser. The government will also import 200,000 tonnes of DAP from China, he explained.
MNA Rao Muhammad Ajmal Khan, who chaired the meeting, directed that the prices of fertilisers should be monitored properly by the relevant authorities.
Mr Ajmal feared that due to the flood situation, the area under wheat cultivation during the coming rabi season would be reduced by 20 per cent. He estimates that the flood waters will recede and the rehabilitation process will take at least two months.
Agriculture, livestock losses 
The impact of the worst-ever flooding in Pakistan has been severe on agriculture in Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab, with data shared by the provinces with the MNFSR showing an estimated loss and damage of Rs298 billion.

According...","KARACHI: The stock market opened on a depressing note on Wednesday owing to rising political infighting.
According to Arif Habib Ltd, the benchmark index witnessed a range-bound session because investors remained on the sidelines while waiting for clarity on the political front.
However, value buying took place in the cement sector during the last trading hour, which helped the index close in the green zone.
The rupee extended its overnight gains against the dollar and appreciated 0.63pc on a day-on-day basis to close at 218.75. The approval of the loan tranche worth $1.17 billion by the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) seems to have arrested the steep fall in the local currency.
