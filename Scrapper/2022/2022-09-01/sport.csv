The hosts claimed a comfortable five-wicket victory in Townsville on Sunday in the first series between the teams in Australia since 2004. 
After being sent in to bat, Zimbabwe were unable to repeat their respectable performance from game one, crumbling for 96 all out in 27.5 overs. In reply, Australia peeled off 100-2 in 14.4 overs before a modest weekday crowd.
“Pretty clinical today,” Starc said in the post-match news conference.
“Some guys are coming off some cricket, others are coming off a few weeks of no matches. I think everyone’s finding a nice rhythm.”  The left-armer recorded figures of 3-24 and bowled with pace to clean up Zimbabwe’s top-order. The unfancied tourists never recovered after losing 25-3 inside the first powerplay, including the wicket of Sunday’s top-scorer, Wesley Madhevere, trapped lbw for nought.
Zimbabwe’s stated strategy of attacking the Australian bowlers unraveled when Sikandar Raza (17) and skipper Regis Chakabva (10) heaved needlessly, offering catching practice while the side was in a precarious position.
The only resistance came from Sean Williams, returning from an elbow injury, who top-scored with 29 before leg-spinner Zampa (3-21) induced an edge.
When the left-hander departed, Zimbabwe were reeling at 83-7 but the end came swiftly as Zampa combined with seamer Cameron Green to send the lower-order packing.
Two overs after the innings break, seamer Richard Ngarava accounted for both of the Australia openers.
David Warner (13) was caught low to the ground by Brad Evans at third man, and three balls later captain Aaron Finch failed to get out of single digits, caught on one by Raza in the slips.
Without the burden of scoreboard pressure, Steve Smith (47 not out) and Alex Carey (26 not out) batted fluently to chase down the remaining runs nearly four hours before the scheduled end-of-play.
The third and final match will be played in Townsville on Saturday.

1,"South Africa’s new T20 competition gets name, auction date",CAPE TOWN: South Africa’s new Twenty20 competition is to be called SA20 with the six teams having already begun ...,"CAPE TOWN: South Africa’s new Twenty20 competition is to be called SA20 with the six teams having already begun the process of recruiting and a player auction to finalise the squads to be held later this month, the league announced on Wednesday.
The league’s commissioner, former South Africa captain Graeme Smith, said teams would be allowed to field a maximum of four foreigners per match when the competition gets underway next year.
It is to start on Jan. 23, as South Africa make a belated entry into the increasingly lucrative T20 market, and will run for a month.
The six franchises, based in Cape Town, Durban, Johannes­burg, Paarl, Port Elizabeth and Pretoria, were all bought by owners from the Indian Premier League and Smith said they would be able to pick their teams from a “quality list” when a player auction is held on Sept. 19.
“We’ve got an extensive list of international players that we’re sorting out for the auction. We’re still finalising some of the auction details and we’re sorting out the player registration because of the large number of players,” Smith said.
“There has been an element of pre-signing that has been taking place and the teams have a purse of $2 million that already includes the pre-signed players.”   
“A lot of work has gone into it and we’re very excited with what we’ve done and what we can create going forward,” he added.
England internationals Moeen Ali, Jos Buttler, Sam Curran and Liam Livingstone have already been signed along with West Indians Jason Holder and Kyle Mayers.
The start of SA20 clashes with the latter stages of Australia’s Big Bash League, but Smith said agreements are in place for BBL players who have signed for SA20 to leave and play in South Africa.
“They have a different structure this season, so the players in our league who have signed up will be there up until the early days of January so that they will be available,” Smith told a virtual news conference.
“They’ll be released to come and play here, from where they’ll be fully available for the South African league.”

2,"Kohli, belligerent Suryakumar steer India to T20 Asia Cup Super Four stage",India beat Hong Kong by 40 runs.,"DUBAI: Star batsman Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav hit half-centuries to help India move into the T20 Asia Cup Super Four stage with a 40-run win over Hong Kong here at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday.
Kohli made 59 while Suryakumar smashed 68 off 26 balls as the pair put on an unbeaten stand of 98 to steer India to 192-2 after being put in to bat first in the T20 tournament.
Hong Kong were limited to 152-5 in reply as India registered their second successive victory to join Afghanistan in the next round of the six-nation tournament, which acts as a tune-up to the T20 World Cup in October-November.
But it was Suryakumar’s batting blitz that stood out as the number four blasted his way to a 22-ball fifty and finished the innings with four sixes in the final over.
Hong Kong, who made the main draw after winning all three of their matches in the qualifiers in Oman, had largely kept India in check before losing their way once Suryakumar started teeing off.
The 33-year-old Kohli, who is going through an extended batting slump and made 35 in his team’s opening win over Pakistan, also got going to complete his 31st half-century in his 101st T20 International.
Skipper Rohit Sharma started cautiously before clubbing Hong Kong medium-pace bowler Haroon Arshad for two sixes and a four in a 22-run third over.
Spinner Ehsan Khan slowed the scoring and seamer Ayush Shukla reaped the benefits in the next over as he took down Rohit with a slow off-cutter. He made 21.
Kohli walked in to loud cheers from a sparse Indian crowd but struggled to play freely against a disciplined bowling attack which kept the runs down.
Kohli finally opened up to get a boundary with a straight drive off leg-spinner Mohammad Ghazanfar and soon found some rhythm as he hit three sixes in his 44-ball knock.
KL Rahul and Kohli kept the score ticking with singles and twos with occasional boundaries to put on 56 runs before Ghazanfar broke through with the wicket of Rahul (36).
Left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh struck early for India with the wicket of Yasim Murtaza but Babar Hayat countered with some attacking shots.
Skipper Nizakat Khan fell to a direct throw from Ravindra Jadeja, who then removed Hayat for 41 with his left-arm spin.
Kinchit Shah (30) and Zeeshan Ali (26 not out) also played useful knocks to reduce the margin of defeat.
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will battle it out for a Super Four spot from Group B in a do-or-die match on Thursday after Afghanistan moved clear with two wins.

NEW YORK: Emma Raducanu’s US Open title defence ended at the first hurdle on Tuesday while Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina and twice US Open winner Naomi Osaka were also ousted in the opening round. 
British teenager Raducanu made a dream run to the title as a qualifier last year but her return to court at Flushing Meadows was less memorable as she fell 6-3, 6-3 to Frenchwoman Alize Cornet. 
“Obviously really disappointing. Really sad to leave here. It’s probably my favourite tournament,” Raducanu said. “In a way I’m happy because it’s a clean slate... The target will be off my back slightly.” 
Rybakina became the latest top seed to exit the tournament after suffering a shock 6-4, 6-4 defeat by French qualifier Clara Burel while Osaka, unseeded this year, lost 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 to Australian open finalist Danielle Collins. 
Four-time major winner and former world number one Osaka has won just twice on tour since April. 
“I tried as hard as I could. I wanted to play without my back being in pain. I only really started serving two days ago,” said Osaka. 
World number one Iga Swiatek cruised into the second round after crushing Italy’s Jasmine Paolini 6-3, 6-0, but two-time US Open winner Venus Williams bowed out after losing 6-1 7-6 to Alison van Uytvanck of Belgium. 
Swiatek next faces 2017 champion Sloane Stephens, who fought back from a set down to beat Greet Minnen 1-6, 6-3, 6-3, while fourth seed Paula Badosa survived an early scare to beat Lesia Tsurenko 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3. 
Also going through to a politically-charged clash were three-time runner-up Victoria Azar­enka of Belarus and Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine.  
Kostyuk is a vocal critic of the presence of Russian and Belarusian players on tour and only last week, Azarenka was axed from an exhibition on the eve of the US Open aimed at raising money for Ukraine. 
Kostyuk, 20, said she turned down the chance to play in protest at the presence of Azarenka and the 33-year-old Belarusian was swiftly dumped from the event. 
Belarus is a close ally of Russia and has allowed Moscow to use its territory to launch attacks into Ukraine during the ongoing war. 
Former world number one Karolina Pliskova overcame Magda Linette 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (10-8) in a match where there was little to separate the two players until the final set tiebreak. 
American eighth seed Jessica Pegula beat Viktorija Golubic 6-2, 6-2 while twice Grand slam champion Garbine Muguruza also advanced in straight sets beating Clara Tauson 6-3, 7-6 (7-5). 
Joining them in the second round was sixth-seeded Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka after her 6-1, 6-3 win over Catherine Harrison. 
But Sofia Kenin, the 2020 Australian Open champion, was knocked out in straight sets by Wimbledon quarter-finalist Jule Niemeier who came away with a 7-6 (3-7), 6-4 victory. 
NADAL SURVIVES SCARE 
In the men’s draw, Rafael Nadal, returning to Flushing Meadows for the first time since winning the 2019 title, overcame an early scare to see off 21-year-old Australian wildcard Rinky Hijikata 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-3. 
World number three Nadal, who is chasing a 23rd Grand Slam title and third of 2022, arrived at the tournament having played just one match since an abdominal injury forced him to forfeit his Wimbledon semi-final. 
“I’m very happy to be here. It’s a long time that I played here. I thought that maybe I’d never be back,” said 36-year-old Nadal, who next faces Fabio Fognini, the Italian who famously defeated him from two sets down in the third round in 2015. 
Fognini was the third Italian to play a five-setter on Tuesday, mounting a comeback from two sets down to beat Aslan Karatsev 1-6, 5-7, 6-4, 6-1 6-4. 
His compatriot Lorenzo Musetti fought back from 2-5 down in the final set to beat Belgian David Goffin 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (11-9) in a match that lasted 4-1/2 hours, the longest match of the tournament so far. 
Italian 11th seed Jannik Sinner’s first-round match lasted over 3-1/2 hours as he outlasted Germany’s Daniel Altmaier 5-7, 6-2, 6-1, 3-6, 6-1. Third seed Carlos Alcaraz, who became the youngest man to reach the quarter-final in New York a year ago, advanced after his Argentine opponent Sebastian Baez retired when the Spanish teenager was leading 7-5, 7-5, 2-0. 
Britain’s Cameron Norrie, the seventh seed, raced past France’s Benoit Paire 6-0, 7-6 (7-1), 6-0 and eighth seed Hubert Hurkacz had no problems dispatching Oscar Otte, who did not have a single break point opportunity in a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 defeat. 
Russian ninth seed Andrey Rublev blew a two-set lead against Laslo Djere and was made to work hard for his 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 6-4 victory. 
Argentine 14th seed Diego Schwartzman advanced to the second round after his American opponent Jack Sock retired with an injury while leading 6-3, 7-5, 0-6, 0-1 and Canadian 19th seed Denis Shapovalov earned a hard-fought 2-6, 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 victory over Marc-Andrea Huesler of Switzerland. 
Americans John Isner and Brandon Nakashima advanced with straight sets wins over Federico Delbonis and Pavel Kotov, respectively but Sam Querrey, playing in his last tournament before retirement, made a first round exit, after losing 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (10-8), 6-3 to Belarusian Ilya Ivashka.

The hosts levelled the series at 1-1 with a dominant innings and 85-run win inside three days in the second Test at Old Trafford.
Captain Ben Stokes scored 103 — his first Test century as skipper — and wicket-keeper Ben Foakes 113 not out.
England’s victory followed South Africa’s almost as crushing innings and 12-run win in the first Test at Lord’s.
That is the only defeat England have suffered while winning all the other five of their six matches since Stokes replaced Joe Root as permanent red-ball captain at the start of the season.
Barring late injuries and the fact they have not added a second specialist spinner to their squad in addition to Somerset left-armer Jack Leach, it now looks likely England will deploy the same XI that won in Manchester when the third Test at the Oval in south London starts on Thursday, September 8.
That would leave uncapped batsman Harry Brook still waiting for his Test debut.
Pacemen Craig Overton and Matthew Potts will struggle to force their way into a seam attack where Ollie Robinson marked his return to Test cricket with match figures of 5-91 at Old Trafford.
Squad: Zak Crawley, Alex Lees, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes (captain), Ben Foakes (wicket-keeper), Stuart Broad, Jack Leach, Ollie Robinson, James Anderson, Harry Brook, Craig Overton, Matthew Potts.

5,‘Quality’ Afghanistan ready for Asia Cup heavyweights,"“We are showing that Afghanistan have quality batsmen, quality bowlers and quality fielders,” says skipper Mohammad Nabi.","SHARJAH: Skipper Mohammad Nabi said Afghanistan is ready for the big guns after they became the first team to qualify for the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup following victories over Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
“As a team in this Asia Cup we are showing that Afghanistan have quality batsmen, quality bowlers and quality fielders,” said all-rounder Nabi after Afghanistan thrashed Bangladesh by seven wickets on Tuesday.
“In these two games we showed we can chase totals. Earlier opposition used to say that Afghanistan cannot chase.
“But we were quite good (in the two chases), were not under pressure and had proper balance and hopefully we do well in the next round against big teams,” added the 37-year-old.
Afghanistan’s victory over Bangladesh in Sharjah put them into the next round of the six-nation Twenty20 tournament.
Najibullah Zadran smashed six sixes in his 17-ball unbeaten 43 chasing down a target of 128 with nine balls to spare, accompanied by Ibrahim Zadran (42).
The two stood out after spinners Mujeeb-ur-Rahman and Rashid Khan took three wickets each to flatten the fancied Bangladesh batting in a tournament which acts as a tune-up to the T20 World Cup in October-November in Australia.
Fast bowler Fazalhaq Farooqi starred in his team’s opening win against Sri Lanka last week with figures of 3-11 and Nabi said the team has covered all the bases going to the Super Four where they are expected to meet India and Pakistan.
“We are not targeting anyone, we are just playing proper cricket,” said Nabi.
Since overcoming the odds to compete in the 2010 World T20 in England, the Afghan team, which was awarded Test status in 2017, has managed to qualify for all the major international tournaments.
The one-time nomads — many of whom were born or brought up in exile — have changed bases from Sharjah and Dubai to cities around India and Abu Dhabi.
“From the last 15 years most of the times we have played in Dubai and Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, we know the conditions better,” said Nabi.
“Sometimes in Sharjah a low total is tough to chase, that’s why in a low chase the batsmen didn’t throw away early wickets and at the end we targeted the bowlers and won the game.” 
Players including Rashid, Nabi and Mujeeb have sharpened their skills while playing cricket around the world including in the Indian Premier League (IPL).
Nabi praised the 21-year-old Mujeeb, a spinner who rattled Bangladesh with an opening spell of 3-9 in his first three overs, for his bowling in the powerplay, the first six overs when only two fielders are allowed outside the inner circle.
“He has always bowled brilliantly in the first six overs,” said Nabi.
“He is a mystery bowler and bowls in the top leagues and against top opposition. He is a good spinner.” 
The team is coached by former England batsman Jonathan Trott and ex-Pakistan fast bowler Umar Gul recently joined the team as bowling coach.
This new coaching team has received wide praise from the cricketing fraternity with former India fast bowler Irfan Pathan tweeting that “Afghanistan is playing some quality cricket”.
“They are on the move and teams should be wary, India or Pakistan,” former India batsman Ajay Jadeja said on Indian website cricbuzz.
“When you play these guys in the Super Four, I won’t be surprised if they knock one of the big teams off, because they have that firepower.”

In the first match, Sindh registered their second consecutive win of the event when they defeated Northern by 10 runs, thanks to opener Saim Ayub’s brilliant 52-ball 92.
Left-handed Saim smashed seven sixes and six fours to help Sindh set a demanding 191-run target for Northern. He added 39 and an innings-defining 85 with Omair Bin Yousuf (18 off 15) and Saud Shakeel (20 off 18) respectively after his opening partner Sharjeel Khan (eight) was cleaned up in the first over.
Experienced all-rounder Sohail Tanvir was Northern’s pick of the bowlers with three for 28.
Left-arm pacer Mir Hamza provided Sindh a solid start by removing Northern openers Hasan Nawaz and Ali Imran in back-to-back overs. As Nasir Nawaz (39 off 21) and Zeeshan Malik (29 off 31) were on course to stage a recovery, leg-spinner Zahid Mehmood cleaned up the former.
All-rounder Mubasir Khan and Sohail gave Northern fans some hope as they added 45 runs at a run-rate of 11 but fell in the 18th and 19th overs. Mubasir scored 33 off 25 (four fours, one six) and Sohail made 21 off 14 (two sixes) before he became Hamza’s third victim. Hamza returned three for 33 and Sohail took 2-38.
Saim earned the man-of-the-match award for his fabulous knock.
Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa began their title defence with an 18-run win over Central Punjab. This was Central Punjab’s second defeat in as many days.
Tayyab Tahir’s second consecutive fifty for Central Punjab went in vain.
Right-handed Tayyab scored a breezy 72 off 45 (five fours, three sixes) in his side’s unsuccessful pursuit of 166. It was the 57-run stand for the third wicket with Qasim Akram that gave Central Punjab a chance but it ended in the 12th over.
After Qasim’s departure who was bowled by fast bowler Arshad Iqbal, Tayyab never got a reliable partner as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bowlers picked up wickets at regular intervals.
Fast bowler Imran Khan Senior, named man-of-the-match, claimed four wickets for 27, Mohammad Imran picked up two for 19 and Asif Afridi took two for 24.
With their number eleven player Faheem Ashraf absent hurt, Central Punjab ended at 147-9 with five balls to spare.
Earlier after captain Khalid Usman elected to bat first, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa totalled made 165 for six off the stipulated overs with Kamran Ghulam top-scoring with a 32-ball 39.
It was, overall, a consolidated batting performance with Adil Amin scoring 24 off 17, Mohammad Sarwar Afridi making a 21-ball 30 not out and Khalid smashing 22 off 10.
Summarised scores:
SINDH 190-7 in 20 overs (Saim Ayub 92, Saad Khan 26 not out, Saud Shakeel 20; Sohail Tanvir 3-28); NORTHERN 180-7 in 20 overs (Nasir Nawaz 39, Mubasir Khan 33, Zeeshan Malik 29; Mir Hamza 3-33, Sohail Khan 2-38).
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA 165-6 in 20 overs (Kamran Ghulam 39, Mohammad Sarwar Afridi 30 not out, Adil Amin 24, Khalid Usman 22; Ali Asfand 2-22); CENTRAL PUNJAB 147-9 in 19.1 overs (Tayyab Tahir 72, Ahmed Shehzad 26; Imran Khan Sr 4-27, Mohammad Imran 2-19, Asif Afridi 2-24).

New Zealand Cricket bosses lamented the retirement from the Black Caps of the 36-year-old all-rounder after he was drafted to play for the Adelaide Strikers.
Zimbabwe-born De Grandhomme scored 1,432 runs in 29 Tests, also playing 45 One-day games and 41 Twenty20 Internationals.
De Grandhomme follows key quick bowler Boult, who also asked to be released from his central contract and signed for Melbourne Stars in the BBL, one of the lucrative T20 tournaments worldwide that has sprung up.
Between them they have played over 100 Test matches and were two of the 20 centrally contracted players for the forthcoming season, including October’s T20 World Cup in Australia.
The 33-year-old Boult kept his spot in New Zealand’s squad for September’s One-day Internationals against Australia but New Zealand Cricket has said contracted players get priority in future selection.
Being under contract to New Zealand Cricket meant De Grandhomme and Boult had been ineligible to play in the BBL, which starts in December.
Bryan Stronach, head of high performance at New Zealand Cricket, said De Grandhomme was a loss.
“He’s a dynamic player, he has his power-hitting, but he is an all-rounder and his accuracy with the ball is quite phenomenal,” he said.
Stronach is confident that other Black Caps will not follow the example of Boult and De Grandhomme.
“We don’t think there is going to be a mass exodus or anything like that,” he told reporters, adding that their exit  “creates opportunities” for up-and-coming players.

Argentina forward Dybala brought up his goal century in the Italian top flight after netting twice in the first 32 minutes at the Stadio Olimpico to put unbeaten Roma on 10 points from their first four games.
Roma, who also scored just after the hour through Roger Ibanez’s header from a Lorenzo Pellegrini corner, are two points ahead of third-placed AC Milan after the champions were held to a drab goalless draw at Sassuolo.
“I really wanted to get a goal, and thankfully it happened here in front of our fans so I’m really happy,” Dybala told DAZN, who added that it was  “too early to talk” of a title challenge.
When asked which was his favourite of his 100 goals in Italy’s top flight, Dybala broke out into a wide grin and said:  “The next one.”
Dybala’s goals came thanks to good work from Tammy Abraham, who sent the 28-year-old on his way to opening his Roma account in the 18th minute with a looping flick onto which his strike partner charged before rifling home.
The pair linked up again for Roma’s second, this time Abraham forcing a good save from Michele Di Gregorio before Dybala showed a more aggressive side to his game by beating the Monza defenders to the ball and bundling it home.
Inter are hot on Roma’s heels after bouncing back from their weekend defeat at Lazio despite having to do without star striker Romelu Lukaku.
Belgium’s Lukaku will miss Saturday’s Milan derby and most likely Inter’s Champions League opener against Bayern Munich next week.
But Joaquin Correa tapped the hosts ahead in the 12th minute and Nicolo Barella doubled their lead with a stunning volley seven minutes before half-time.
Substitute Lautaro Martinez drilled home his third of the season with 14 minutes remaining to make sure Cremonese, who scored late through David Okereke, stayed second-bottom and stuck on zero points.
Milan had Mike Maignan to thank for their unbeaten record staying intact, the France goalkeeper diving brilliantly to his right to keep out Domenico Berardi’s penalty midway through the first half.
“We lacked a bit of lucidity and cutting edge in certain situations and that is what we need to work on tomorrow,” Milan defender Simon Kjaer told DAZN in the aftermath of his first appearance after nine months out with a serious knee injury.
The 33-year-old lasted 79 minutes and will be hoping to stay fit for the World Cup starting in November in Qatar where his national side Denmark will face France, Tunisia and Australia in Group D.
“It’s been a lot of hard work and a lot of sacrifice. I’m very happy to get back on the pitch and lend a hand to my team,” Kjaer added.
Sassuolo sit 10th on five points but will be concerned over the condition of talisman Berardi after the Italy winger was carried to the dressing rooms not long after half-time with what coach Alessio Dionisi said was a muscle problem.

BERLIN: German Cup holders RB Leipzig began their defence of the trophy with a commanding 8-0 victory over fourth-division side Teutonia Ottensen after Timo Werner grabbed a first half hat-trick on Tuesday.
The match was moved to Leipzig’s stadium after the pitch at Dessau’s Paul Greifzu stadium was left unplayable after being sprayed with chemicals by unknown culprits.
Werner, who struggled in his final season with Chelsea, looked back to his best as he made clever runs and found space in the box to score three times while he also assisted Andre Silva to give Leipzig a 4-0 halftime lead.
Leipzig dominated possession while Ottensen failed to register a single shot on target in the game.
The second half was also one-way traffic as Silva scored his second while Emil Forsberg and Christopher Nkunku got on the scoresheet. Dani Olmo completed the rout with a goal in the 90th minute as Leipzig advanced to the next round.

On a wet track and sprinting into the wind (two metres per second), Richardson won in 11.29 seconds, just 0.01sec ahead of the Jamaican double Olympic champion Thompson-Herah.
It marked a major triumph for the 22-year-old Richardson -- the 11th fastest woman of all time over the distance with a best of 10.85sec -- after she failed to qualify for the world championships team at the US Trials in June.
It made for an American double in the sprints as Marvin Bracy, who won the silver at the world championships in Eugene in July, took the men’s 100m in 10.17sec, ahead of Kenya’s African champion Ferdinand Omanyala who clocked 10.18sec.

Tuchel’s side blew the lead at St Mary’s after Raheem Sterling put them ahead midway through the first half.
England forward Sterling bagged his third goal in two games with a close-range strike in the 23rd minute.
But Chelsea had squandered a host of chances before Sterling’s opener and, not for the first time in Tuchel’s reign, their profligate finishing came back to haunt them.
Romeo Lavia equalised in the 28th minute with his first goal for Southampton, curling home from the edge of the area after Chelsea failed to clear a corner.
Adam Armstrong put Southampton ahead on the stroke of half-time as he took Romain Perraud’s pass and drilled a deflected shot past Chelsea keeper Edouard Mendy.
Chelsea, beaten 3-0 at Leeds United in their previous away fixture, were unable to muster a response as they slipped to a second defeat from their last three games.
“Soft, soft, soft defending. There is no need to give shots away. Just toughen up as a team and show a different mentality,” Tuchel said.
With just two wins from their first five matches, the Blues are already five points behind leaders Arsenal, who have a game in hand.
Despite a significant close-season spending spree, which is set to continue with several more signings mooted before Thursday’s transfer deadline, Chelsea are struggling to find any sustained momentum at present.
While it is too early to write them out of the title race, Tuchel will be concerned by his team’s latest sloppy display — with key mistakes at both ends of the pitch — having already criticised them publicly after the Leeds loss.
“It is too easy to put us off balance, to beat us, to confuse us. It is too easy. It happened against Leeds. We need to understand why and find solutions,” Tuchel said.
“We lose concentration, we lose our plan and lose consistency. I don’t understand why we have so many injuries.
“In a match where you are in the lead there is no need to give away half-chances. To have no answers in the second half was disappointing.”
Everton’s wait for a first win this season goes on after Luis Sinisterra’s first league goal for Leeds earned a 1-1 draw at Elland Road.
Frank Lampard’s team went ahead when Alex Iwobi’s incisive pass was flicked through the legs of Diego Llorente by Anthony Gordon, whose clinical finish capped a superb move in the 17th minute.
But Colombia winger Sinisterra marked his first start for Jesse Marsch’s men in memorable fashion with a composed finish from Brenden Aaronson’s pass in the 55th minute.
Fulham ended Brighton & Hove Albion’s unbeaten start to the season with a 2-1 win at Craven Cottage that lifted them to sixth place.
Fourth-placed Brighton had won three of their first four games, but Marco Silva’s promoted side broke the deadlock in the 48th minute through Aleksandar Mitrovic’s fifth goal this season.
Neeskens Kebano provided the pass and Serbia striker Mitrovic tapped in at the far post for his 100th league goal for the Cottagers.
Fulham doubled their lead seven minutes later as Brighton defender Lewis Dunk diverted Andreas Pereira’s cross into his own net.
Alexis Mac Allister converted a 60th minute penalty for Brighton after Pervis Estupinan fouled Bobby De Cordova-Reid.
Yoane Wissa’s late leveller rescued Brentford in their 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace.
Wilfried Zaha showed why Arsenal and Chelsea have been linked with him as the Ivory Coast forward gave Palace the lead with a brilliant strike from the edge of the area after 59 minutes.
But Wissa was left unmarked to equalise with a close-range header in the 88th minute.

13,RedBird partners with Yankees owners to complete AC Milan takeover,MILAN: US investment firm RedBird Capital has joined forces with the owners of the New York Yankees to complete the...,"MILAN: US investment firm RedBird Capital has joined forces with the owners of the New York Yankees to complete the 1.2 billion euro ($1.2 billion) acquisition of Italian champions AC Milan, it said in a statement on Wednesday.
Yankee Global Enterprises (YGE), owner of the New York baseball team, will take a minority equity stake in the former European champions Milan as part of the deal to acquire the club from US private equity group Elliott.
Elliott had been expected to keep a stake in Milan but will exit under the terms of the agreement, a source close to the deal said.
The same source said Elliott will provide RedBird with a vendor loan of up to 600 million euros to complete the acquisition and will have the power to appoint two board directors.
“We will support our talented players, coaches and staff to deliver  success on the pitch,” said RedBird’s founder Gerry Cardinale in the  statement. 
“We will look to leverage our global sports and media network, our  analytics expertise, our track record in sports stadium developments and  hospitality to deliver one goal — maintaining Milan’s place at the  summit of European and world football.”
RedBird said it had a longstanding relationship with the Yankees and the Steinbrenner family, with whom it is a co-owner of the Yankees Entertainment Sports (YES) Network, a regional sports broadcast network.
Milan are seeking to build on the success of last season when they won the Italian Serie A title for the first time in 11 years.
Milan were a dominant force in European football under the previous ownership of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi but won the Cham­pions League for the last time in 2007.
RedBird is already an investor in Fenway Sports Group, the owner of Premier League side Liverpool. RedBird also has a controlling stake in French football club Toulouse.
Italian football teams have become a popular target for overseas investors, attracted by cheaper valuations compared with those of England’s Premier League and rivals in major European leagues.
Elliott took over the club in 2018 when Chinese businessman Li Yonghong failed to meet some obligations linked to a financing package for the purchase of the team from Berlusconi the year before.
