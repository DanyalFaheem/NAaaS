Mr Khattak led the procession from his hometown Nowshera. From Peshawar, it was the provincial health minister, Taimur Saleem Jhagra, who led the rally. Minister for Information Technology Atif Khan led party supporters from Mardan whereas Education Minister Shahram Khan Taraki headed out from Swabi.  

Motorway police seem helpless to manage traffic  

Other rallies from different districts including Hazara, Malakand, Peshawar and southern districts left via Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway and Grand Trunk Road, gathering at Hakla interchange, from where Parvez Khattak led the march into Islamabad.  
Even though it was planned that Chief Minister Mahmood Khan would lead a major rally from the province, he was not seen or heard from till the filing of this report.  
An official told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the chief minister was not seen leading any of the rallies from the province till the Hazara Expressway intersection on the motorway between Peshawar and Islamabad.  
“Initially, it was planned that the chief minister would join the procession from Malakand division at Karnal Sher Khan interchange in Swabi and lead it onwards from there but he was not seen there,” he said.  
Witnesses reported excitement among the PTI supporters, saying there were songs and dances, with cavalcades comprising hundreds of vehicles full of party followers, chanting slogans and cheers. There was a large number of women among them, with protesters coming from as far as the remote northern district of Chitral.  
Travellers on motorway, however, said that the PTI rallies violated all traffic rules, causing blockades at some places, vehicles and motorcycles — not allowed on motorway — crossing road dividers to force traffic flow only in the direction of Islamabad. Chaotic scenes and traffic jams were seen, amidst use of pressure horns and supporters shouting from bus tops.  
The motorway police, they said, were completely helpless against the press and flow of such a huge crowd. At some places, PTI supporters had stopped buses on roadside, calling on people to join them for free ride to the capital.

6,Budding artists advised to focus on quality music,Veteran musician ST Sunny says Pashto folk singers have great talent,"

Samuel Thakur Dass

 
PESHAWAR: Veteran music composer ST Sunny has advised young artists to focus on quality stuff if they want to reclaim the past glory of rhythmical traditions be it folk, film or pop music.
Born on July 23, 1944 in Peshawar Kohati Gate area, Samuel Thakur Dass alias ST Sunny did his graduation from Edwardes College Peshawar and developed a penchant for music.
“Owing to my passion, my father Thakur Dass, a lawyer by profession, allowed me to learn the basic intricacies of music from a teacher. After 15 years, I was able to play harmonium and some notes of classical music,” he told this scribe.

Veteran musician ST Sunny says Pashto folk singers have great talent

He said that in the golden era of Pashto film industry, he was given the opportunity to compose music for Pashto movie ‘Baaz Au Shahbaz’ released in 1974 and its songs proved a milestone. Soon he became the most sought after musician for radio, TV, stage and film.
“I don’t have a record of my works but I can safely say that my compositions exceed 10,000 including Urdu, Hindko and Punjabi in addition to Pashto. Pashtun audience catapulted my image in the world of music. Long ago, I have shifted to Lahore but my heart throbbed with Peshwarites. I would advise young artists to remain focused on the quality of music contents as it used to be the strength of Pashto cinema,” said the musician.
Talking about past glory of pollywood, he said that quality music was among the perquisites for a super hit flick. 
He said that musicians were trained to produce playback music contents that suited the situation and mood of the film overall disposition and anything below that would never fit into scheme of things.
Mr Sunny said that he had even sung for few Pashto movies but his forte was composition for other top black icons including Hidayatullah, Khial Mohammad, Gulnar Begum and Kishwar Sultana because their voices would guarantee the ‘on screen’ success of the movies.
The veteran musician drifted away from the music world in late 90s when Pashto cinema was blurred by what he dubbed as ‘vulgarity, violence and obscenity’ however he said that quality composition could revive the silver screen if budding artists devoted attention to notes of strength.
“I still believe if given a chance, I can craft sound images for playback singers as Pashto music scene has large space for new experiments. With horizons of new digital world, voices could do wonders. Pashto folk singers have great talent,” he said.

8,PHC allows bail to suspects in polling station trespass case,"The suspects allegedly trespassed on a female polling station, broke ballot boxes during the LG elections in Buner.","PESHAWAR: A Peshawar High Court bench has granted bail to two suspects arrested under the anti-terrorism law for allegedly trespassing on a female polling station, breaking ballot boxes and tearing off ballot papers during local government elections in Buner.  
A single-member bench consisting of Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan accepted a joint bail petition filed by the suspects named Amjid Ali and Javed Afsar on condition of furnishing two sureties of Rs500,000 each.  
The petitioners were charged in an FIR registered at Totalai police station, Buner on December 19, 2021, under Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act, Section 10 and 17 of Elections Act and sections 186, 353, 452, 427, 147, 149, 337 A (i)(ii) and 34 of Pakistan Penal Code.  
The complainant in the FIR was presiding officer of the polling station, Fazal Wadud.  
The complainant stated that he was on duty at the polling station set up at Government Middle School Dokara, Buner, during the local government elections on December 19. He stated that at around 5pm, the closing hour of voting, he asked the security staff to close the main entrance and not to allow more voters in. He alleged that around 30 to 31 persons entered the station by scaling the boundary walls and attacked him. He alleged that the attackers broke the ballot boxes and tore off the ballot papers. The complainant had also named the two petitioners stating that they were among the attackers.  

Petitioners were charged under different sections of law including ATA  

He alleged that the attackers belonged to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and they suspected that he (complainant) had been hindering the voting process.  
The bench observed that that the record would reveal that all the sections of law for which the petitioners were charged were either bailable or the same did not fall within the prohibitory clauses of Section 497 of Code of Criminal Procedure, where grant of bail was a rule and refusal thereof was an exception.  
The bench further observed that as far as Section 7 of ATA was concerned, it was for the trial court to determine as to whether the petitioners were having any intention to spread fear and terror among the public at large so as to attract the said provision. It added that as per the contents of the FIR, there was a quarrel between the supporters of two rival political parties at the polling station so that section of law alone could not be considered as a ground for the refusal of bail.  
The petitioners’ counsel Sher Mohammad Khan contended that his clients were falsely charged in the FIR. He stated that neither direct independent, reliable nor any circumstantial evidence against the petitioners were available so as to connect them with the commission of the offence.  
Following the occurrence, the complainant had also entered into compromise with the suspects on intervention of a jirga. However, few days ago an anti- terrorism court had rejected bail petition of the petitioners observing that they were charged for commission of non-compoundable offences.

9,LRH becomes launching pad for doctors to get lucrative jobs,Work experience in Lady Reading Hospital helps medics and managers to get better positions in other MTIs,"PESHAWAR: Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, the oldest health facility of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has become a launching pad for doctors and managers, who are leaving for more lucrative positions elsewhere owing after getting experience here. 
LRH, one of the four hospitals in the province that got the status of medical teaching institutions when the government passed a law to grant financial and administrative autonomy to them, has been a favourite place of posting for the new doctors and financial and administrative managers to get handsome salaries and improve their profiles for future postings. 
“Since January 2021, 85 new faculties have joined the hospital, primarily as assistant professors and one associate professor. They included three new adult cardiac surgeons and one paediatric cardiac surgeon,” Prof Nausherwan Burki, the chairman of LRH Board of Governors, told Dawn. 
When asked as to why most of the senior professors left LRH after enforcement of Medical Teaching Institution Reforms Act 2015, he said that those who sought early retirement were not at ease in the new system under which the employees were recruited on contractual basis and their promotion was linked to performance. 

Work experience in Lady Reading Hospital helps medics and managers to get better positions in other MTIs 

He said that most of them left the hospital because they realised they did not meet the promotion criteria and their time was up. He added that more doctors were being recruited as compared to the few, who left the hospital.  
“Doctors and other staffers are coming. They are also going to other hospitals because of their work experience in LRH, one of the famous health facilities in the country. We have brought several consultants from abroad, many of them have now left and joined other hospitals,” said Prof Burki. 
MTIRA 2015, which covers 11 hospitals and affiliated medical and dental colleges in the province, has however benefitted its managerial staff as well as the doctors. 
Dr Khalid Masud, a former director of LRH, quit his position to be appointed on the same post at medical teaching institution in Bannu for more perks and privileges because of his experience in the biggest medical facility. Later, he resigned and joined medical teaching institution in Swabi for more benefit. Lastly, he landed in Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences Islamabad when the government extended the same law there.
Abid Rehman, a human resource manager at LRH, also got posted in PIMS because of his experience. 
Dr Khalid said that he got experience regarding MTIRA due to which he had no problem in getting better salary and perks in other hospitals. “It is a great honour to be part of LRH,” he told Dawn. 
He said that enforcement of MTIRA proved a blessing for the people as well as staff, who were able to get better positions on the basis of their work experience in LRH. 
However, many senior faculty members, who got retired prematurely, said that MTIRA was fraught with issues that forced them to leave. 
“We are civil servants and are governed under the government’s rule while the controllers of MTIRA want to treat us as MTI employees. Therefore, many of us sought early retirement as MTIRA don’t suit us,” a senior professor said.
He said that any faculty member, who worked in LRH, was readily accepted by private hospital because of his experience.
The 2000-bed health facility has 400-bed accident and emergency department where doctors get postgraduate degree in emergency medicines in addition to catering to critically-ill and injured patients.
The emergency department of the hospital has now been acclaimed as a facility offering state-of-the-art services to victims of bomb attacks. 
The low-level managers in the hospital have also been quitting due to their appointments in other MTIs.
