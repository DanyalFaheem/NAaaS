0,Haris looks to make up for lost opportunity in Australia ODIs,The three-match One-day International begins with the first game on Tuesday.,"LAHORE: For someone who’d once bowled with Australia’s feared three-pronged bowling attack of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood during a nets session, missing out on making his Test debut against them must have felt like a blow. 
But Haris Rauf is backing himself to perform in the three-match One-day International against Australia which begins with the first game on Tuesday. 
None of Cummins, Starc or Hazlewood, with whom Haris bowled during a training session for New South Wales during the start of his burgeoning career, are part of the Australia’s limited-overs squad, which will also play one Twenty20 International to conclude their first tour of Pakistan since 1998. 
Haris would’ve gone face-to-face against the trio had he featured in the recently-concluded three-match Test series which Australia won 1-0. But after a bout of Covid-19 ruled him out of the opening Test, he wasn’t considered for the remaining two Tests. 
“It is my dream to play Test cricket,” Haris told reporters during an online news conference on Sunday. “But unfortunately, I got Covid and had to sit out. When I returned from isolation, the team selection was made according to the conditions and I feel those who played did their best. I’ll take my chances when they come.” 
For now, Haris’ chance will come in the ODIs where Australia are set to be without several regular players. Alongside their frontline pacers, David Warner and Glenn Maxwell are not in the squad. Batter Steven Smith was also ruled out with injury. 
“Australia still have players who have considerable domestic experience in Australia, including playing in the Big Bash League as well the Sheffield Shield,” said Haris. “But we will try to utilize our home conditions and give them a tough time. We expect a good series.” 
Reflecting on Pakistan’s Twenty20 World Cup semi-final loss to eventual champions Australia last year as well as the thumping defeat to Australia in the series-deciding Test in Lahore this week, Haris said that it’s part of the game. 
“During the T20 World Cup, we beat several top teams in our run to the semis,” he said. “We gave our all then as well as the Test series. In a game, one team loses and the other wins. Now we’re preparing for the ODIs and will try to play good cricket.” 
Having played just eight ODIs, the 28-year-old said the arrival of former Australian pacer Shaun Tait as Pakistan’s bowling coach had helped the fast bowlers. “He’s trying to improve our bowling, especially in the death overs,” he said. 
Both teams held training sessions at the Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday with players practicing both under the sun and floodlights and Australian spinner Adam Zampa looked forward to an exciting ODI series even though he admitted his side faced a “difficult challenge” due to the absences.
“It’s going to be a difficult challenge,” Zampa told reporters during an online news conference earlier in the day. “But when this happens, it helps build depth [in the side].” 
Zampa, who played a key role for Australia in their T20 World Cup triumph, informed is due to take a three-month break with his wife due to give birth in June and he’s looking to make the most of the opportunity he has in Pakistan. 
“It’s pretty rare for a cricketer these days to get three months off, so I’m really going to make the most of it,” Zampa said. 
With his performances, Zampa has cemented his status as one of Australia’s most important white-ball players. But he’s not taking his new role for granted. 
“I feel like I don’t have to look over my shoulder too much with selection,” Zampa said. “When you’re younger, you naturally probably look over your shoulder, you doubt yourself a lot more. 
“[Captain] Aaron Finch has helped me massively with my game. He backs me in when I’m out there, and he lets me run my own show with my bowling, and has been really good with his own ideas as well. 
“I’ve been in this team for six years now. You never want to use the word comfortable, but I definitely back myself in a lot more these days. I can go out there and maybe experiment and put things on the line for the team to try to do my role.”

1,West Indies crush England by 10 wickets to clinch series victory,A stunning result for the home team after being outplayed in the first two drawn Tests.,"ST. GEORGE’S: West Indies clinched the Botham-Richards Trophy with an emphatic 10-wicket victory over England in the deciding Test of the series on day four at the Grenada National Stadium on Sunday. 
Chasing a token target of 28 in their second innings after earlier dismissing England for 120, West Indies reached it without loss, captain Kraigg Brathwaite hitting the winning runs to seal a 1-0 series triumph. Brathwaite was 20 not out and John Campbell undefeated on six. 
It was a stunning result for the home team after being outplayed in the first two drawn Tests, and ensured another barren England trip to the Caribbean. 
England have only one series win in the West Indies in the past half-century, a 3-0 victory in 2003-04. 
With the ecstatic home fans dancing in the stands, the England players shook hands with Brathwaite and fellow opener John Campbell. 
Brathwaite acknowledged that what he described as a “remarkable” series could have gone either way if not for his team’s dominance on day three on Saturday. 
“Yesterday was a really remarkable day for us, to show the fight and attitude we had from the get-go, it’s key to carry that forward,” he said. “We can’t take it for granted. It’s easy to be happy with a series win and relax but I don’t think we can relax. We’ve got to stay hungry.” 


WEST INDIES players celebrate with the trophy after their series victory over England.—AFP

 
When England resumed on 103-8, they were already on the brink of defeat with a lead of only 10 runs with just two wickets in hand in their second innings. The visitors lasted another 11 overs in the opening session with Kemar Roach (2-10) taking both England wickets — Chris Woakes (19) and Jack Leach (four). 
It took almost 45 minutes for West Indies to break up England’s ninth-wicket partnership, with a stunning reaction catch from Jason Holder doing the job. Woakes middled Roach’s first ball as it went down the leg side and Holder flung out a hand and plucked the ball out of the air at leg gully. Saqib Mahmood, who hit a defiant 49 in the first innings, was three not out. 
West Indies medium-pacer Kyle Mayers started the day with an incredible 5-9 from 13 overs, a maiden five-for, but went for five in his first over on Sunday and finished with 5-18 from 17 overs. The batting all-rounder was unwanted for the first two Tests both draws and he replaced spinner Veerasammy Permaul with the aim of strengthening the batting. 
However, it was wicketkeeper-batsman Joshua da Silva who was named man of the match for his undefeated 100 in West Indies’ first innings. 
“The emotion is still there — 100%. I’ve dreamt of this moment and hopefully it isn’t the last time I win this award,” he said. “I wanted to trust my tailenders — all the credit goes to them. I can’t thank them enough. It is because of them that I’ve won this award.” 
The result is likely to extend the debate over Joe Root’s suitability as England captain, despite his superb batting form with two centuries in the series. 
After England’s latest defeat, and a 4-0 Ashes humiliation in Australia, Root indicated he still wants to stay on as captain. 
“I think I made it quite clear at the start of this game and throughout this tour I’m very passionate about trying to take this team forward,” Root told BT Sport. “I will control what I can. I dont think it’s ever in your hands. I feel like the group are very much behind me, were doing a lot of really good things and we just need to turn that into results now.” 
Root did elaborate though on the disappointment of his team’s performance in this critical fixture on a surface which was very different from the placid pitches at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium and Kensington Oval. 
“Yesterday was really a frustrating day, such an important day in the series and we just didn’t manage it as well as we could have and as we showed in the first two matches,” he explained. “After a difficult winter it’s frustrating after believing that we were making some strides forward. 
“I just don’t think we read the surface as well as we should have individually,” Root added in dealing with England’s double batting failure at this venue. “We have made some strides but there’s still a lot of learning that needs to be done. It’s not going to happen overnight and we are going to have to keep working hard.” 
West Indies enjoyed their first test series win at home since 2019. That was when England last visited. 
West Indies had an intimidating 93-run lead on the first innings after making England bat. England scored 204 and 120, and West Indies 297 and 28-0. 
In assessing his team’s ability to once again turn back an England challenge on home soil, Brathwaite acknowledged that appreciating West Indies’ excellent home record against these opponents was important in the preparation for the series. 
“At the camp ahead of this series we recognised that this has always been one of our best series at home and we had to fight hard to maintain that record. We put in a lot of work to get ready for this,” he asserted. 
“There are a lot of guys in our team whom you can see are willing to learn and when you have seniors like Kemar Roach and Jason Holder continuously leading the way they are great examples to follow.”

2,"South Africa break Indian hearts as England, Windies reach semis","“I think we can feel sure that the girls have given their all, knowing the importance of the game,” India's Mithali Raj says.","WELLINGTON: Aust­ralia will play the West Indies and South Africa will play England in the semi-finals of the Women’s Cricket World Cup after the makeup of the top four was finally decided on Sunday on the last ball of the last match in the league stage. 
Mignon du Preez hit the winning run from the final ball of the final over of the final match to finish on 52 not out and lead South Africa to a three-wicket win over India. In doing so, South Africa snuffed out India’s semi-final hopes in the cruelest of circumstances. 
Du Preez was caught in the deep with three runs required and two balls remaining, in a moment which seemed to swing the match in India’s favour. She was walking from the field when the umpires consulted the television official and determined that Deepti Sharma, who was bowling the last over from which seven runs were needed, had over-stepped. 
The decision reprieved du Preez, gave South Africa a run, another ball and a free hit and they took the opportunity to clinch a win that crushed India’s hopes of reaching the final for the second consecutive tournament. 
“I think we can feel sure that the girls have given their all, knowing the importance of the game today,” India captain Mithali Raj said. “It will probably take some time to settle the emotions. It was just a good game from both sides. I mean it went to the last ball and it’s good for the sport but for the India team it ends our campaign.” 
South Africa’s win also secured a semi-final place for the West Indies who were powerless spectators to the events of the final day. After completing the league matches, they were in third place with seven points behind unbeaten Australia and South Africa who both had qualified. 
The West Indies would have been denied a semi-final place if India had won but South Africa’s win kept their tournament alive. 
Earlier on Sunday, defending champions England eased into the semifinals with a 100-run win over Bangladesh. 
Sophia Dunkley made 67 and Nat Sciver 40 as England posted 234-6 as they batted first after winning the toss. Their spinners then shackled Bangladesh who were unable to threaten the total and were bowled out for 134 in the 48th over. 
The pitch at the Basin Reserve in Wellington was slow, which suited spin bowlers but made batting tricky. Dunkley surmounted the conditions more than any other batter, taking her 67 runs from 72 balls with eight boundaries. 
“It definitely wasn’t an easy pitch to get in on,” Dunkley said. “I thought the Bangladesh bowlers started really well, bowled really well. But me and Amy Jones (31) just tried to get in there, dig in there and get a partnership to carry us through to the end.”
Left-armer Sophie Ecclestone bowled superbly to lead England’s defence of their total, taking 3-15 from her 10 overs. Charlie Dean took 3-31 and Freya Davies 2-36 as England continued a steady improvement throughout the tournament to claim its place among the semi-finalists. 
England lost their first three matches in New Zealand and struggled to find their best form but came into the last day of the eight-team round-robin in a three-way contest for two remaining semi-final places. 
“It says a lot about this group, the way we’ve turned things round. Not getting too down, we were on the wrong end of a few close ones,” England captain Heather Knight said. “We’re really pleased. Obviously the job was to come here and get the two points and qualify for the semi-finals. 
“I had one eye on the net run rate and one eye looking after the bowlers and trying to freshen a few of them up for the semi-final... but the main thing was getting the win”. 
India set South Africa a more challenging total, reaching 274-7 as they batted first at Hagley Oval in Christchurch. 
Smitri Mandhana made 71 and set the tone of the innings with her opening partner Shafali Verma who made 53 from 46 balls. Mithali Raj made 68 and Harmanpreet Kaur 48. 
South Africa then pulled off the second-highest successful run chase at a World Cup. Laura Wolfaardt, the leading scorer at the tournament, made 80 to set the platform for the innings. But it fell to du Preez, who has been short of runs in recent matches, to guide her team home. 
“It means the world,” du Preez said. “It’s been a tough few weeks when I havent contributed the way I would like. But to do it when it matters and take the momentum to the semifinal, I’d take that every day of the week.” 
The outcome triggered wild celebration in the West Indies dressing room but they face a mammoth task against top-ranked Australia on Wednesday. England will meet South Africa on Thursday in Christchurch. 
Brief scores:
England beat Bangladesh by 100 runs.ENGLAND 234-6 in 50 overs (S. Dunkley 67, N. Sciver 40; Khatun 2-46); BANGLADESH 134 all out in 48 overs (L. Mondal 30; Ecclestone 3-15, Dean 3-31).

Rinderknech was unable to convert his sole break point in the first set and lost the momentum altogether after the tiebreak, as the 10th-ranked Pole won the first four games of the second set of their second-round clash. 
Reigning US Open champion Medvedev never faced a break and proved too nimble for three-time Grand Slam winner Murray, dropping just two of his first-serve points in the second set as he won 6-4, 6-2 and will face Spain’s Pedro Martinez next. 
“Playing against Andy is never easy,” said Russian Medvedev, who is on a quest to regain his number-one ranking. “Managed to serve well, and I think that was one of the keys today.” 
World number five Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece punched his ticket into the third round after seeing off big-hitting American J.J. Wolf 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-1.

5,Eriksen scores on Denmark return as England win,PARIS: Denmark’s Christian Eriksen made an emotional goal-scoring return to international football on Saturday as...,"PARIS: Denmark’s Christian Eriksen made an emotional goal-scoring return to international football on Saturday as England, Germany and Spain carved out friendly victories.
Eriksen found the net two minutes after coming on with a powerful drive in a 4-2 defeat against fellow World Cup qualifiers Netherlands in Amsterdam.
It was his first national team appearance since suffering a cardiac arrest in Denmark’s opening game of the European Championships against Finland in Copenhagen last June.
On Saturday, to the resounding applause of fans and even Dutch manager Louis van Gaal, the 30-year-old came off the bench and raised his hands to the sky in thanks.
His goal was 37th in 110 appearances. It was fitting he scored in the Amsterdam Arena, the home of Ajax.
Eriksen came through the ranks at the Dutch side, making 162 appearances for the club and winning five trophies, including three consecutive league titles between 2011 and 2013.
Meanwhile, Harry Kane converted a late penalty to close in on the all-time England goal-scoring record and secure a 2-1 win over Switzerland who will also be at the World Cup in Qatar in November.
Kane netted from the spot to reach 49 England goals, moving him ahead of Gary Lineker and into a second place tie with Bobby Charlton.
Only Wayne Rooney, with 53 goals, has scored more times for England.
Breel Embolo put Switzerland ahead at Wembley after 22 minutes in a first half dominated by the visitors before Luke Shaw’s equaliser in first-half injury time. Kane restored order with his 78th-minute winner.
“You have to be ready for any chance at any moment. Penalties are a great way of getting on the scoresheet, I practice and work on them a lot,” said Kane.
Chelsea pair Kai Havertz and Timo Werner both hit the net as Germany eased past Israel 2-0 in Sinsheim.
After the Premier League pair scored first-half goals, Germany’s stand-in captain Thomas Mueller and Israel sub Yonatan Cohen both failed to convert late penalty attempts.
Germany head coach Hansi Flick has now won his first eight internationals to extend his record start.
Spain, World Cup winners in 2010, had to work hard to carve out a 2-1 win against Albania in Barcelona, the team’s first game in Catalonia since 2004.
Ferran Torres opened the scoring for Spain in the 75th minute at Espanyol’s RCDE Stadium with Myrto Uzuni equalising 10 minutes later.
However, Dani Olmo saved Spain’s blushes with a last-minute winner as Spain secured an eighth win in eight matches against Albania.
Top-ranked Belgium led twice in Dublin but were still held 2-2 by Ireland.
Playing without the influential Kevin de Bruyne, who has been rested for the international window, Belgium took the lead after 12 minutes through Michy Batshuayi who brushed past Seamus Coleman to beat Caoimhin Kelleher in the Irish goal.
Ireland, who missed qualification for the World Cup after finishing third in their group behind Serbia and Portugal, levelled in the 36th minute through Chiedozie Ogbene.
Belgium were back in front just before the hour mark thanks to a Hans Vanaken header.
However, substitute Alan Browne grabbed his side’s second equaliser with a powerful 86th-minute header.
In Doha, 2018 World Cup runners-up Croatia were held to a 1-1 draw by Slovenia.
Andrej Kramaric, who plays in Germany with Hoffenheim, gave Croatia the lead in the 39th minute but Jaka Bijol levelled in stoppage time for Slovenia.

There were air flares, hand glides, head spins and jackhammers. At last, Pakistan’s breakdancers had the chance to revel in an international competition. 
The arrival of Red Bull BC One to Pakistan for the first time here on Saturday was hailed by the country’s breaking community as a watershed moment. Performing largely underground for the last decade, barring for a few events during the year, it offered a chance for the country’s top talents to showcase their skills on a global platform. 
One of those talents, Syed Shariq Habib Shah — who goes by the stage-name Masoom, will get a chance to compete at the global level. With his victory in the BC One Pakistan qualifier here at the Arts Council, Shariq secured the ticket to the world final in New York where he will go up against the top breakers in the world. 
“It’s a big chance … not only for me but for Pakistan as well,” Shariq told Dawn. “It’s a chance for me to show the world that we have a breaking community in Pakistan and it will only help it grow.” 
It comes at an opportune moment too. Just over a year ago, breaking became an Olympic sport and is set to make its debut at the 2024 Games in Paris. The world’s top 16 men and women breakdancers — B-Boys and B-Girls as they are known — will slug it out for an Olympic medal. But for a culture that’s just a decade old in Pakistan, the Games are coming too soon. 
Pakistan isn’t yet a member of the World Dance Sport Federation. A dance sport federation doesn’t even exist in the country at this point in time. It’s just a community right now, 400-strong and limited to Karachi. But it’s not that the community hasn’t tried for an Olympic breakthrough. 
“Once it was announced that breaking will be part of the Olympics, the community got together and tried to set up a federation,” added Shariq. “We reached out to the Pakistan Olympic Association but there is a long list of criterion that has to be fulfilled to set it up. Right now, it doesn’t look like happening.” 
Qualification events for the Olympics are already underway. And Dwayne Griffin Lucas, one of the pioneers of Pakistan’s breakdancing community, says without a federation sending Pakistan’s entries to qualifying events isn’t possible. 
“We didn’t get any support in getting the federation up and running,” a rueful Lucas told Dawn on the sidelines of the BC One, where he was the host — the emcee in breaking jargon. “The list of demands to set it up and get it registered with the POA and the Pakistan Sports Board is just too much.” 
For now, Lucas, who was behind one of the first professional dance crews in the country, said building the community and spreading the breaking culture was key. The arrival of international breaking stars Gibrahimer Beomont, who goes by the name Lil G, of Venezuela and Fabiano Carvalho Lopes, known as Neguin, of Brazil as judges for BC One Pakistan was inspiring for local breakers. They also held workshops prior to Saturday’s qualifier event. 
“What I’ve seen here is that the community exists but it’s just the start,” Beomont, who is taking part in qualifying events for the Olympics, told Dawn. “They just need to keep at it.” 
Lopes, who’s now more into mentoring new talent, said Pakistan’s breakers needed to keep performing for that ultimate breakthrough. 
“They’re on the right path,” he told Dawn. “It’s only recently that the breaking scene has hit off in Pakistan so they have to keep going. Of course, now with breakdancing going to the Olympics, it’s another platform for new talent to perform.” 
It’s a platform that is more relevant to Pakistan. “For a long time, breaking was just dance form to many in Pakistan,” explained Lucas. “Now it offers more ... an Olympic medal.” 
But breaking’s spot at the Olympics might not last long. For now, it isn’t guaranteed a spot at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles after not being included in the initial 28 sports for the Games in six years. 
WDSF, though, is pushing for its inclusion with a final decision due midway through next year. Pakistan’s breaking community will keep pushing too in its bid to set up a federation. 
“We haven’t given up on our plans of setting it up,” vowed Lucas. “It will take time but eventually we will get there. It took us three years just to convince BC One to come to Pakistan. And when Shariq goes to the world final and raises the Pakistan flag, people will sit up and take notice. That is what we hope will help us move forward.”
