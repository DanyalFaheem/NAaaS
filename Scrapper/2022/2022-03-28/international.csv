Hawkins, the 50-year-old drummer for the Grammy award-winning rock group, passed away in a hotel in Bogota shortly before the group was set to perform at the Festival Estereo Picnic on the city’s outskirts, according to a statement from the mayor’s office.
Colombian investigators said preliminary post-mortem tests found several drugs in the musician’s system, but did not specify whether the mix caused his death.
“The urine toxicology tests performed on Taylor Hawkins’ body preliminarily found 10 types of substances,” including THC — which is found in marijuana — tricyclic anti-depressants, benzodiazepines and opioids, investigators said in a statement.
Forensic doctors were working  “to achieve full clarity of the facts that led to (Hawkins’) death,” they added.

South Africa’s first democratic, black president was arrested on August 5, 1962, and later jailed for 27 years.
The reserve price at the Saturday night auction in Cape Town was 900,000 rand ($61,800), but the non-fungible tokens or NFT,  “sold for 1.9 million ($130,550) via a buyer online,” Ahren Posthumus, CEO of the digital auctioneer Momint said on Sunday.
The buyer was a foreigner, based in the United Arab Emirates.
“Proceeds for the Mandela NFT will go to Liliesleaf museum, to keep their doors open and stay afloat,” Posthumus said.
Liliesleaf shuttered its doors in September 2021 due to financial difficulties.
Selling art as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, uses the same technology as crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin. The buyer receives a verified digital token, which proves the artwork is an original.
“This is really a unique and novel way of generating income,” Liliesleaf Farm museum founder, Nicholas Wolpe said.
The original document, dated 1961, now yellowed, with gnarled edges and bearing staple holes on one side, is handwritten in both English and Afrikaans.

Abdul Qader al-Mortada added on Twitter that the deal, under the auspices of the United Nations, includes 1,400 Houthi prisoners in return for 823 prisoners including 16 Saudis, three Sudanese prisoners, the brother of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and former defence minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi.
He also said the deal awaits an exchange of lists of prisoners on Tuesday.
A senior official at the UN envoy’s office in Yemen said no final deal had been reached between the parties on lists for the prisoner exchange and that discussions were ongoing.
On Saturday, the Houthis said they were suspending missile and drone strikes on Saudi Arabia for three days, in a peace initiative it said could be a lasting commitment if the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen stopped air strikes and lifted port restrictions.
They also expressed readiness to release all prisoners, including Hadi’s brother.

“There has been no change in the positions of the Azeri army in the village of Farrukh, which is part of the sovereign territories of our country,” the Azeri defence ministry said.
Moscow on Saturday accused Azerbaijan of violating a 2020 peace agreement by entering the zone and striking positions of Nagorno-Karabakh army with drones, although Azerbaijan refuted Russia’s version of events. On Sunday, the Russian defence ministry said that after negotiations Azerbaijan had withdrawn its forces from the area.

The Southeast Asian country has been in chaos since a putsch in February 2021, with more than 1,700 people killed in crackdowns on dissent, according to a local monitoring group. 
Across Myanmar “People’s Defence Force” fighters — often armed with homemade or rudimentary weapons — clash regularly with junta troops, with some analysts suggesting the military has struggled to respond effectively to their hit-and-run tactics. 
Fighting has also flared with more established ethnic rebel groups along the Thai and Chinese borders. 
Presiding over the annual parade that showcased tanks, truck-mounted missiles, artillery and troops on horseback, Min Aung Hlaing told about 8,000 assembled security personnel that the army would not let up. 
The military will “no longer negotiate... and annihilate until the end” groups fighting to overturn its rule, he said ahead of the Armed Forces Day procession in army-built capital Naypyidaw. 
Jets flew overhead trailing the yellow, red and green of the national flag, while state media showed women lining the streets leading to the parade ground to give flowers and place garlands on the marching soldiers. 
In commercial hub Yangon, around a dozen anti-junta flash-mob protesters set off flares and shouted slogans, according to footage posted on social media. 
Others on social media called for residents to switch off their lights at home in a national “power strike” on Sunday evening. 
Armed Forces Day commemorates the start of local resistance to the Japanese occupation during World War II, and usually features a military parade attended by foreign officers and diplomats. 
Last year, as new junta chief Min Aung Hlaing inspected the parade, troops brutalised those protesting the coup that had ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s government.

The rare wooden  “Ngil” mask, used in ceremonies by the Fang ethnic people of Gabon, smashed its estimate of 300,000-400,000 euros at the auction in the southern French city of Montpellier.
“It’s a case of receiving stolen goods,” a man describing himself as a member of the Gabonese community in Montpellier exclaimed from the back of the auction room, surrounded by half a dozen compatriots.
“We’ll file a complaint. Our ancestors, my ancestors, from the Fang community, we will recover this object”, the protester added, describing the mask as a  “colonial ill-gotten gain”.
Auctioneer Jean-Christophe Giuseppi said the auction was  “entirely legal”, as far as he was aware.

6,"10,700 tonnes of Indian wheat reaches Afghanistan through Wagah","Last month, Pakistan decided to facilitate entry of Afghan trucks via Torkham, ensuring trouble-free movement of trucks.","LAHORE: Afghanistan has collected 10,700 tonnes of wheat from India so far, using Pakistan’s territory through Lahore’s Wagah border.
The remaining 39,300 tonnes are likely to be collected by Afghanistan under humanitarian assistance by the end of next month, according to official sources.
“Five convoys of Afghan trucks collected wheat consignments at Attari from Indian authorities and returned to Afghanistan via Wagah and Torkham borders. All these convoys collected five consignments of almost 10,700 tonnes of the total 50,000 tonnes as pledged to be given to Afghanistan by India on humanitarian grounds,” a senior official told Dawn on Sunday.
“The fifth convoy of 39 Afghan trucks returned to Afghanistan after collecting 2,000 tonnes wheat from Indian authorities on Friday,” the official said.
As India had pledged giving wheat to Afghanistan, Pakistan announced last month that it would facilitate entry of Afghan trucks into its territory via Torkham, ensuring trouble-free movement of trucks right from Torkham to Wagah, collection of wheat from India and smooth operations of wheat loaded trucks without customs duty. Therefore, the first fleet of 41 Afghan trucks collected the first consignment of 2,500 tonnes of wheat from India on Feb 22.
Similarly, the second fleet comprising 36 Afghan trucks received the second consignment of 2,000 tonnes of wheat on March 5. Likewise, another fleet of 40 trucks reached Wagah on March 10 night, collected around 2,200 tonnes wheat and returned to Afghanistan on March 11. The 4th and 5th convoys also collected 4,000 tonnes wheat till March 25th.Under the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) devised jointly by the respective Pakistani authorities (Customs, Immigration, Security etc), the information related to number of trucks, their registration numbers and tracking devices, drivers’ names, their identity cards, passports, police record / character certificates etc is mandatory to be shared by Afghanistan with Pakistan and India before entering their territories.
While being allowed at Torkham, the truck drivers are issued travel authorisation certificate by the authorities who, through email, send the same to authorities at the Wagah border. After carrying wheat, the drivers are liable to submit / return the same to authorities at Torkham.
Similarly, the Afghan convoys are being given police security from Torkham to Wagah and vice versa. “Likewise, the checking of trucks, drivers and other issues are also being performed by the authorities at Torkham as well as Wagah under the SOPs,” said another official source while discussing the SOPs devised by the government regarding operation of Afghan trucks for the collection of Indian wheat.

7,Oscars back in Hollywood as ‘CODA’ seeks top prize,"HOLLYWOOD: The Oscars returned to Hollywood on Sun­day, as nominees from top contending films including  ...","HOLLYWOOD: The Oscars returned to Hollywood on Sun­day, as nominees from top contending films including  “CODA,”  “The Power of the Dog” and  “Belfast” gather in a futuristic, glittering ballroom for the movie industry’s biggest night.
After a year away from the Dolby Theatre due to the pandemic, the 94th Academy Awards are back in the heart of Tinseltown, where A-listers who have passed strict Covid-19 testing protocols will walk the red carpet in their finest gowns and tuxedos once again.
Dark, psychological Western  “The Power of the Dog” had looked set to earn Netflix its much-coveted first best-picture statuette, but the race has been flung wide open in recent weeks.
“CODA” — an uplifting drama from Apple+ TV about an eccentric deaf family, and their musical daughter who can hear — has surged in popularity, and is now tipped by many industry insiders as the favorite. Either would be a historic first best-picture win for a streaming service.
Kenneth Branagh’s childhood-inspired  “Belfast” cannot be ruled out — even if its director is one of several nominees whose presence at the Oscars was thrown into doubt by a positive Covid test last week.
“It’s a two- or three-horse race,” said Variety film awards editor Clayton Davis.
“People have had a very rough last two years. And ‘CODA’ is positive, it’s feel-good. And I think voters are in a feel-good mood.” Jane Campion’s  “The Power of the Dog” has earned praise but is also polarizing — a handicap, as Academy voters are asked to rank all 10 best picture nominees.
“CODA,” which began life as an indie drama, benefits from being perceived as  “the underdog,” one voter said on condition of anonymity.
“Some Academy members I speak to are still reluctant to vote for a Netflix film as a best picture. But then here comes Apple, a streaming service as well,” said the voter, noting the  “twist of irony.”
In a year when big-budget blockbusters finally hit reopened movie theaters and rival streamers amped up their libraries with star-packed new films, the acting categories are being contested by some of the biggest names in the business.
Will Smith is the strong favorite for best actor for his turn as the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams in  “King Richard.” Hollywood Reporter awards columnist Scott Feinberg called the best actress race  “truly one where any of the five nominees could win,” but said Jessica Chastain’s portrayal of a real-life televangelist in  “The Eyes of Tammy Faye” was the  “likeliest” to strike Oscars gold.
Davis agreed that was the  “smart money,” but said there was  “a lot of love for Penelope Cruz,” who could spring an upset for Spanish drama  “Parallel Mothers.” Kristen Stewart, Nicole Kidman and Olivia Colman are also vying for the statuette.
Troy Kotsur — one of several deaf actors in  “CODA” — and former Broadway dancer Ariana DeBose of  “West Side Story” are favorites in the supporting categories.
Campion is well-placed to become the third woman to win best director — just a year after Chloe Zhao became the second for her  “Nomadland” — and sci-fi epic  “Dune” could win the most Oscars overall due to its dominance in technical categories.
It remains to be seen if Covid will mar the ceremony — while Branagh’s attendance remains up in the air, another popular possible winner will definitely be absent.
Lin-Manuel Miranda could complete the coveted EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony) with a win for best original song for his ballad from  “Encanto,” but announced he would not attend  “out of caution” after his wife tested positive.
The ceremony will take place beneath sweeping, fluorescent blue arches and thousands of sparkling crystals and LEDs, described by designer David Korins as a  “fun and electric and exciting... picture of the future.” But television network ABC will hope for a return to the higher ratings of years past.
The 2021 gala was watched by a paltry 10 million viewers — a 56 percent decline from 2020, which was already a record low.
Efforts to win back viewers include a new  “fan favorite” prize voted for by the public — introduced after popular blockbusters such as  “Spider Man: No Way Home” and Bond flick  “No Time To Die” received only a handful of nominations.

8,Shanghai to lock down in phases to rein in Covid-19,The metropolis of 25m has in recent days become the leading hotspot in a nationwide outbreak that began to gain pace in March.,"SHANGHAI: Shanghai will launch a phased lockdown to curb an Omicron-fuelled Covid-19 outbreak that has hit China with its highest caseloads since the early days of the pandemic, the city government said on Sunday.
China’s biggest city will lock down its eastern half from Monday until Friday, officials said, followed by a similar lockdown of its western side beginning on April 1.
The metropolis of 25 million has in recent days become the leading hotspot in a nationwide outbreak that began to gain pace in early March.
Although recent case numbers remain insignificant in a global context, they are China’s highest since the first weeks of the pandemic, which first emerged in the city of Wuhan in late 2019.
China’s National Health Commission on Sunday reported more than 4,500 new domestically transmitted cases, down by more than 1,000 from the previous day but still far higher than the double-digit daily tallies usually seen over the past two years.
Millions of residents in affected areas across the country have been subjected to citywide lockdowns.
Shanghai, however, had thus far avoided a full lockdown, with officials saying it was imperative to keep the eastern Chinese port and financial hub running, for the good of both the national and global economies.
But with case counts climbing, the city government said in a public notice that the two-part lockdown was being implemented  “to curb the spread of the epidemic, ensure the safety and health of the people” and root out cases of infection  “as soon as possible”.
The city’s sprawling eastern half, known as Pudong, which includes the main international airport and financial district, would be locked down for testing beginning Monday morning and ending April 1.
On April 1, the city’s western half, known as Puxi and featuring the historic Bund riverfront, will lock down until April 5, the government added.
Residents were told to stay indoors during the lockdowns, and all business employees and government personnel not involved in the supply of essential services were advised to work from home.
Those involved with providing vital services such as gas, electricity, transport, sanitation and the supply of food would be exempt from the stay-at-home order.
The announcement said buses, taxis and the city’s extensive subway system would cease operations, but made no mention of activity at its massive port, or any impact on air travel or rail service in and out of Shanghai.
On Saturday, a member of the city’s pandemic task force had vowed Shanghai would not shut down.
“If Shanghai, this city of ours, came to a complete halt, there would be many international cargo ships floating in the East China Sea,” said Wu Fan, a medical expert on the task force, during a daily virus press briefing held by the city government.
“This would impact the entire national economy and the global economy.” China’s government had previously kept the virus under control nationally through strict zero-tolerance measures including mass lockdowns of entire cities and provinces for even small numbers of cases.
But authorities have wat­ched nervously as a deadly Hong Kong Omicron surge sparked panic buying and claimed a high toll of unvaccinated elderly in the southern Chinese city.

9,‘Independents’ dominate in Palestinian local elections,"RAMALLAH: Independent candidates dominated the Palestinian local elections, winning 64 percent of seats, up from ...","RAMALLAH: Independent candidates dominated the Palestinian local elections, winning 64 percent of seats, up from just 37 percent five years ago, according to official results released on Sunday.
But with established parties infiltrating independent lists, analysts were not immediately able to say how far the results from Saturday’s vote truly amounted to more diverse representation. 
The polls came after Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas called off last year’s planned presidential and legislative elections, after Israel barred voting from taking place in annexed east Jerusalem.
But the real reason for Abbas’ 11th hour postponement was widely believed to be a likely legislative landslide for Hamas, the Islamist rivals to his secular Fatah movement.
Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, officially boycotted Saturday’s municipal elections due to that postponement, but still fielded independents, according to analysts. Fatah resorted to the same tactic, but as a damage limitation exercise, according to Jehad Harb, a Palestinian political analyst.
“There is frustration from Palestinian citizens” towards the Palestinian political establishment, Harb said.
Abbas on Sunday nonetheless claimed victory, saying the results demonstrated  “renewed confidence” in Fatah.
In the city of Jericho, a traditional Fatah stronghold, all five lists competing were independents.
Among the winners elsewhere was Islam al-Tawil, who was arrested by Israeli forces last week. He was elected as mayor of Al-Bireh as head of a an independent list named Al-Bireh Unites Us. The Central Election Commission certified a final turnout of 53.7 percent. Held in 50 towns and cities, Saturday’s vote was the second phase of municipal polls after a first round of voting in December in 154 West Bank villages. There was no voting in Gaza.
No legislative or presidential elections have been held in the Palestinian territories for more than 15 years.

10,Macron warns against ‘escalation’ after Biden brands Putin ‘butcher’,Says he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise the evacuation of civilians from port city Mariupol.,"KYIV: France’s President Emma­nuel Macron warned on Sunday against a verbal  “escalation” of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a  “butcher” who  “cannot remain in power”.
The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden’s comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.
Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.
The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as  “achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means.”  “If we want to do that, we can’t escalate either in words or actions.” Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.
Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.
Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia’s assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.
About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.
In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” the US leader said, before the White Hou­se clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change. The Kremlin snapped back, saying  “a head of state should stay sober”.
‘Going to die anyway’
Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were  “narrowing down the window of opportunity” for bilateral relations. “Biden is weak, sick and unhappy,” said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.
Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country’s military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.
But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.
In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.
Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.
“If a bomb drops, we’re going to die anyway,” she said.  “We are getting a little used to explosions.” Others have found ways to cope with the shelling.
Tamara Osypchuk, 72, said she wrote poetry to calm herself in her apartment in the devastated Ukrainian town of Irpin when the bombs rained down.
“The explosions were very strong. Like a volcano is exploding, as if the earth explodes,” she said as she rested on a chair at an evacuation centre on the outskirts of Kyiv.
“I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration.” Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.
Ukraine’s determined fighters continue to hold back Russia’s far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

It was the second deadly nationalist attack carried out by Arabs in an Israeli city in less than a week. On Tuesday, a lone attacker inspired by the militant Islamic State group killed four people in a stabbing rampage in southern Israel before he was killed by passersby.
Israeli officials said the two men were Arab citizens from northern Israel. 
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett rushed to the scene.
while Foreign Minister Yair Lapid briefed his counterparts from the US and four Arab countries, who condemned the attack. 
Camera footage circulating on Israeli media showed two bearded men appearing to open fire in the city of Hadera before they are shot. 
An Israeli official said two members of a border police unit who were in a restaurant near the attack, ran out and killed the shooters.

12,Thousands protest in Madrid against abortion,"Carrying signs that read  “Abortion is not right” and chanting  “More respect for life”, demonstrators walked through Madrid.","MADRID: Thousands of people marched though Madrid on Sunday to protest against abortion, as Spain’s leftist government prepares a law to guarantee access to the procedure at public hospitals.
Carrying signs that read  “Abortion is not right” and chanting  “More respect for life”, demonstrators walked through the centre of the Spanish capital to Cibeles square in central Madrid where a manifesto was read aloud.
“There are other alternatives. After an abortion there is always trauma but that is not talked about, “said Yolanda Torosio, a 44-year-old secretary who attended the protest with her daughter.
The protest was organised by the  “Yes to Life” platform which estimated that some 20,000 people took part. The central government’s representative in Madrid put the number of marchers at about 9,000.
The crowd included parents pushing strollers, retired couples and groups of youths, some carrying Spanish flags.
While Spain decriminalised abortion in 1985, women in the predominantly Catholic country still face obstacles when choosing to terminate a pregnancy since many doctors refuse to care out the procedure.
According to the OMC Spanish doctors’ association,  “most” obstetrician-gynaecologists who work in the public sector consider themselves  “conscientious objectors” and refuse to carry out abortions.
As a result women in some regions must travel hundreds of kilometres for an abortion because there is no private clinic nearby and the local hospital will not perform them.
Socialist Prime Pedro Sanchez’s government is preparing a law to ensure that all public hospitals perform abortions, and wants to ban protests outside of abortion clinics as  “harassment”.
IT also wants to modify the law so minors of 16 and 17 can terminate a pregnancy without their parents’ consent, as is the case in Britain and France. Polls show a majority of Spaniards are in favour of keeping the country’s existing abortion laws, which allow the procedure on demand in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy.

It was a dream come true....,"SAO JORGE: Fatima Viveiros was a little girl when she decided to become a volcanologist. It was a dream come true. Now aged 44, she is putting her skills to use to protect her home.
The lush mid-Atlantic volcanic island of Sao Jorge, where she grew up, has been rattled by more than 14,000 small earthquakes for seven days.
Viveiros and other experts fear the tremors, which have had magnitudes of up to 3.3, could trigger a volcanic eruption for the first time since 1808, or a powerful earthquake.
“My home is located on an active volcanic system,” said Viveiros, who works for the region’s CIVISA seismo-volcanic surveillance centre.
“When (something happens) in our home we must be a little cold-blooded so our feelings don’t affect our thinking,” she added.  “But the feelings are there because it’s my home, my people.”  Viveiros was carrying a yellow machine on her back to measure soil gases on Sao Jorge, an island in the Azores archipelago, an autonomous region of Portugal.
Soil gases, such as CO2 and sulphur, are indicators of volcanic activity, and Viveiros and her team have been battling Sao Jorge’s rain and strong winds for days to dig for answers. So far, the levels remain normal.
Sao Jorge’s sudden increase in seismic activity is reminiscent of the earthquakes detected before the eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano on Spain’s La Palma island last year, some 1,400 km southeast of the Azores.
Over 85 days, that eruption destroyed thousands of properties and crops.
Viveiros travelled to La Palma at the time to support the Canary Islands Volcanology Institute and monitor soil gases there, and said Sao Jorge’s volcanic system was similar to the one on the Spanish island.

14,Nationwide protests if Afghan girls’ schools stay shut: activists,"“We call on the leaders of the Islamic Emirate to open girls’ schools within one week,” activist Halima Nasari says.","KABUL: Women’s rights activists pledged on Sunday to launch a wave of protests across Afghanistan if the Taliban fail to reopen girls’ secondary schools within a week.
Thousands of secondary school girls had flocked to classes on Wednesday after the hardline Islamists reopened their institutions for the first time since seizing power last August.
But officials ordered the schools shut again just hours into the day, triggering international outrage.
“We call on the leaders of the Islamic Emirate to open girls’ schools within one week,” activist Halima Nasari read from a statement issued by four women’s rights groups at a press conference in Kabul.
“If the girls’ schools remain closed even after one week, we will open them ourselves and stage demonstrations throughout the country until our demands are met.” The Taliban should be building more schools for girls in rural areas rather than shutting existing facilities, said the statement, which comes after several women’s activists were detained in recent months.
“The people can no longer tolerate such oppression. We do not accept any excuse from the authorities,” it said.
On Saturday, about two dozen schoolgirls and women staged a protest in Kabul demanding the reopening of the schools.
“Women, teachers and girls should come out on the streets and protest,” said student Zarghuna Ibrahimi, 16, who attended the press conference.
“The international community should support us.” The education ministry has so far not given a clear reason for its policy reversal, but senior Taliban leader Suhail Shaheel said that some  “practical issues” were still to be resolved before reopening the schools.
Separate days at parks
Since storming back to power the Taliban have rolled back two decades of gains made by Afghanistan’s women, who have been squeezed out of many government jobs, barred from travelling alone.
The Taliban had promised a softer version of the harsh Islamist rule that characterised their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001.
But many restrictions have still crept back, often implemented locally at the whim of regional officials.
Some Afghan women initially resisted the curbs, holding small protests where they demanded the right to education and work.
But the Taliban soon rounded up the ringleaders, holding them incommunicado while denying that they had been detained. Since their release, most have gone silent.
On Sunday, the Ministry for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice ordered that men and women should not visit parks in Kabul on the same days.
Women are now permitted to visit parks on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, while the remaining days were reserved for men, a ministry notification said.
“It is not the Islamic Emirate’s order but our God’s order that men and women who are strangers to each other should not gather at one place,” Mohammad Yahya Aref, an official at the ministry, said.
“This way women will be able to enjoy their time and freedom. No man will be there to trouble them,” he said, adding that religious police were already implementing the order.

15,Iraq building Syria wall to keep out  IS fighters,BAGHDAD: Iraq is building a concrete wall along part of its border with Syria to stop fighters of the militant...,"BAGHDAD: Iraq is building a concrete wall along part of its border with Syria to stop fighters of the militant Islamic State group from infiltrating, an Iraqi military source said on Sunday.
In the  “first stage” of construction, a wall around  “a dozen kilometres (seven miles) long and 3.5 metres (11 feet) high was built in Nineveh province”, in the Sinjar area of northwest Iraq, a senior officer said.
Iraq, which shares a more than 600-kilometre long border with Syria, seeks to  “put a stop to the infiltration of IS members” into its territory, the source added, without specifying how long the wall would eventually run.
Iraq in 2018 said it had begun building a fence along the Syrian border for the same reason.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said the wall’s construction was carried out in an area facing the town of Al-Shaddadi, in the south of Syria’s Hasakeh province.
In January in the Kurdish-controlled province, IS fighters attacked a prison to free fellow jihadists, sparking days of clashes that left hundreds dead.
Many prisoners are thought to have escaped, with some crossing to neighbouring Turkey or Turkish-held territory in Syria’s north, the Observatory said.
IS overran large swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014, declaring a  “caliphate” before Baghdad proclaimed victory in late 2017 after a grinding campaign.
But a low-level jihadist insurgency has persisted, flaring up particularly in rural and mountainous areas between Iraq’s autonomous Kurdistan region and northern outskirts of the capital.
