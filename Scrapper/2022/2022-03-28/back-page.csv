0,"Hours after truce, coalition air strikes hit Yemen",UN chief condemns surge in violence as the war enters its eighth year.,"RIYADH: The Saudi-led coalition launched air strikes on Sunday on Yemen hours after Houthi rebels announced a three-day truce, with the UN chief condemning a surge in violence as the war enters its eighth year. 
The raids targeted Sanaa, the rebel-held capital, according to Saudi Arabia’s Al Ekhbariya TV, which tweeted “the start of air strikes on Houthi camps and strongholds in Sanaa” at around midnight. 
The attacks came shortly after the Iran-backed Houthis announced a three-day truce and offered peace talks on condition that the Saudis stop their air strikes and blockade of Yemen and remove “foreign forces”. 
On Friday, the rebels fired drones and missiles at 16 targets in Saudi Arabia, turning an oil plant near Jeddah’s Formula One track into a raging inferno as aghast drivers looked on. 
The office of the UN’s special envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, tweeted on Sunday that he is “engaging with all sides and continues his efforts towards a truce during Ramadan”, the Muslim holy month which begins in April.

“He reiterates his call for de-escalation and welcomes all steps by the parties in that direction,” it added. 
The coalition has not yet responded to the Houthis’ truce announcement.
The flurry of attacks and diplomacy came as Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, on Saturday marked seven years since the Saudi-led military intervention against the Houthis, who seized Sanaa in 2014. 
The conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people directly or indirectly and displaced millions, creating what the United Nations calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. 
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday condemned the sudden rise in hostilities. He said eight civilians, including five children and two women, were reportedly killed in retaliatory strikes on Sanaa following Friday’s rebel attacks. 
The UN staff compound in the city was also damaged, his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. 
Yemen ‘forgotten’ 
“The Secretary-General strongly condemns the recent escalation of the conflict in Yemen,” the statement said, adding that Guterres is “deeply concerned” about reports of coalition attacks on the lifeline port of Hodeida. He urged the warring parties to “immediately de-escalate” and reach a “negotiated settlement” with Grundberg’s help. 
Thousands of people demonstrated in Sanaa on Saturday, holding placards and chanting, to denounce the Saudi-led intervention which included nine countries when it was launched on March 26, 2015. 
Today, it is largely just Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser extent, the United Arab Emirates, which says it has withdrawn troops from Yemen but remains an active player, training militias on the ground. 
The coalition’s intervention has reversed the Houthis’ advances in the south and east of the country but has been unable to push them out of the north, including Sanaa.

1,"With eye to China investment, Taliban now preserve Buddhas",Mes Aynak valley believed to have the world’s largest deposit of copper.,"MES AYNAK: The ancient Buddha statues sit in serene meditation in the caves carved into the russet cliffs of rural Afghanistan. Hundreds of meters below lies what is believed to be the world’s largest deposit of copper. 
Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers are pinning their hopes on Beijing to turn that rich vein into revenue to salvage the cash-starved country amid crippling international sanctions. 
The fighters standing guard by the rocky hillside may once have considered destroying the terracotta Buddhas. Two decades ago when the hardline Taliban were first in power, they sparked world outrage by blowing up gigantic Buddha statues in another part of the country, calling them pagan symbols that must be purged.

But now they are intent on preserving the relics of the Mes Aynak copper mine. Doing so is key to unlocking billions in Chinese investment, said Hakumullah Mubariz, the Taliban head of security at the site, peering into the remnants of a monastery built by first-century Buddhist monks. “Protecting them is very important to us and the Chinese,” he said. 

Mes Aynak valley believed to have the world’s largest deposit of copper

Previously, Mubariz commanded a Taliban combat unit in the surrounding mountains battling with US-backed Afghan forces. When those troops capitulated last year, his men rushed to secure the site. “We knew it would be important for the country,” he said. 
The Taliban’s spectacular reversal illustrates the powerful allure of Afghanistan’s untapped mining sector. Successive authorities have seen the country’s mineral riches, estimated to be worth $1 trillion, as the key to a prosperous future, but none have been able to develop them amid the continual war and violence. Now, multiple countries, including Iran, Russia and Turkey are looking to invest, filling the vacuum left in the wake of the chaotic US withdrawal. 
But Beijing is the most assertive. At Mes Aynak, it could become the first major power to take on a large-scale project in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, potentially redrawing Asia's geopolitical map. 
Top priority 
In 2008, the administration of Hamid Karzai signed a 30-year contract with a Chinese joint venture called MCC to extract high-grade copper from Mes Aynak. Studies show the site holds up to 12 million tonnes of the mineral. 
But the project got tied up in logistical and contract problems, and it never got past some initial test shafts before it ground to a halt when Chinese staff left in 2014 because of continued violence. 
Mere months after the Taliban seized Kabul in August, consolidating power over the country, the group’s newly installed acting Minister for Mining and Petroleum Shahbuddin Dilawar urged his staff to re-engage Chinese state-run companies. 
Ziad Rashidi, the ministry’s director of foreign relations, approached the consortium made up by MCC, China Metallurgical Group Corporation and Jiangxi Copper Ltd. Dilawar has had two virtual meetings with MCC in the last six months, according to company and ministry officials. He urged them to return to the mine, terms unchanged from the 2008 contract. 
A technical committee from MCC is due in Kabul in the coming weeks to address the remaining obstacles. Relocating the artifacts is key. But MCC is also seeking to renegotiate terms, particularly to reduce taxes and slash the 19.5 per cent royalty rate by nearly half, the percentage owed to the government per tonne of copper sold. 
Chinese companies see the current situation as ideal for them. There is a lack of international competitors and a lot of support from the government side, Rashidi said. 
China’s ambassador to Afghanistan has said talks are ongoing, but nothing more.
Acquiring rare minerals is key for Beijing to maintain its standing as a global manufacturing powerhouse. While stopping short of recognising the Taliban government, China has stood out from the international community by calling for the unfreezing of Afghan assets and has kept its diplomatic mission running in Kabul. 
For Afghanistan, the contract at Mes Aynak could bring in $250-300 million per year to state revenues, a 17pc increase, as well as $800m in fees over the contracts length, according to government and company officials. That’s a significant sum as the country grapples with widespread poverty, exacerbated by financial shortfalls after the Biden administration froze Afghan assets and international organisations halted donor funds. Some has since resumed. 
At Mes Aynak, a 2,000-year-old Buddhist city sits uncomfortably alongside a potential economic engine. Afghanistan’s tumultuous modern history has gotten in the way of both exploring the archaeology and developing the mines.

2,‘Q’ tells PML-N needs more time for consultations,Wants all govt allies to make a collective decision on no-trust.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakis­tan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q), a key ally of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) at the Centre and in Punjab, on Sunday sought more time for consultations before making a final decision on the issue of no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan, stating that it wanted all the allies to make a collective decision.
“We will try to come out with our decision in a day or two,” declared PML-Q leader and federal Minister for Housing and Works Tariq Bashir Cheema while talking to reporters after a meeting of the PML-N delegation with PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain.
The meeting between the leaders of the two parties was held exactly at the time when Prime Minister Imran Khan was delivering his speech at Parade Ground and hours after the announcement by Jamhoori Watan Party (JWP) chief Shahzain Bugti to quit the ruling coalition.

Wants all govt allies to make a collective decision on no-trust

“Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), the other two allies of the government, have their own issues. We also have some issues. But since we are smaller parties, it is our desire that we all make a collective decision regarding support to the opposition so that we can have a strong defence line,” said Mr Cheema.
“There will be more consultations and we will try to make the decision within a day or two,” declared Mr Cheema in response to a query of a reporter regarding the delay in decision-making by the party.
Speaking on the occasion, PML-N’s Khawaja Saad Rafique said they had come to meet Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and the PML-Q leaders as “they know the affairs of state in a better way”.
Recalling the time when the Chaudhrys were also part of the PML-N, Mr Rafique said that he had worked with the Chaudhrys under one flag in the past. He said the two sides had agreed to continue consultative process.
In reply to a question, Mr Rafique denied reports in some media circles that PML-N’s supreme leader Nawaz Sharif had rejected the idea of offering the Pun­jab chief minister’s office to Chaudhry Parvez Elahi.
When asked as to what offer the PML-N had given to the Chaudhrys, Mr Rafique said the opposition had not submitted the no-trust resolution for any “political bargain or give and take”. He said they had come to the PML-Q leadership to convince them that it had become necessary to send the present government packing in the wake of the prevailing political and economic situation.
The PML-N leader alleged that the PTI government had ruined the country’s economy and had failed to deliver. He regretted that instead of talking about performance, Prime Minister Imran Khan was still using abusive language against the opposition.
On Saturday, a government team led by Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in a last ditch effort to woo the allies had met the PML-Q leadership in Lahore.
After the meeting, a PML-Q leader had claimed that Mr Qureshi had given his words that Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar would be asked to resign in a day or two, and that Chaudhry Parvez Elahi was the PTI government’s preferred choice for his replacement.
After some news channels quoted sources as saying that Mr Buzdar had prepared a summary to dissolve the Punjab Assembly, a PML-Q leader claimed: “The Punjab Assembly will not be dissolved, but a change of leader of the house is on the cards.”
He claimed that the PML-Q had told the government team to make a formal annou­ncement regarding Mr Elahi as the candidate for the CM before going for vote.
A PML-Q spokesman later said the government team assured them that they would inform Prime Minister Khan about the entire situation. Later, a PML-Q delegation headed by Chaudhry Parvez Elahi called on PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari and discussed the prevailing political situation.

3,PM’s aide Shahzain Bugti parts ways with coalition,Bilawal says no-trust is test of institutions’ neutrality,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) coalition government on Sunday suffered another setback when Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Reconciliation and Harmony in Balochistan Shahzain Bugti announced quitting the cabinet ahead of the crucial National Assembly vote on the opposition’s no- confidence resolution against Imran Khan.
Mr Bugti, the lone member of Jamhoori Watan Party (JWP) from Balochistan, made the announcement during a news conference after meeting Pakis­tan Peoples Party (PPP) Chair­man Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
Citing reasons for his decision to leave the ruling coalition, Mr Bugti alleged that the federal government did not release the required funds for Balochistan, which were necessary to maintain peace in and development of the province.

Bilawal says no-trust is test of institutions’ neutrality 

“You [PM] couldn’t allocate Rs4 billion for the province. Do you consider the province your last priority?” he asked. The JWP chief said they had been seeking the money to provide stipends to the students and for development of health infrastructure in the province where, he regretted, there was not even blood banks in many areas.
Mr Bugti, who had been included in the federal cabinet in July with the task of holding talks with disgruntled Baloch people, claimed that due to his efforts he had managed to control “insurgency” in Balochistan, but due to “negligence” of the federal government, the insurgency had started again in the province during the last two weeks.
“The federal government gave us hope that things will improve but people have been disappointed,” said Mr Bugti, alleging that the government had failed to deliver in Balochistan.
“We are standing by the Pakis­tan Democratic Movement (PDM) and will do whatever we can,” he said, without realising that the PPP was not part of the opposition alliance.
The JWP leader said Imran Khan had after coming to power stated that his focus would be on the country’s less-developed areas, including south Punjab, Balochistan and some areas of Sindh, but he failed to do so.
Mr Bugti also criticised the prime minister for targeting the opposition in his speeches. He asked the prime minister to produce evidence of corruption against the opposition leaders instead of calling them corrupt and thieves.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Bhutto-Zardari termed Mr Bugti’s decision “timely and courageous”. He said Imran Khan had “betrayed” his allies the same way as he had done with people and the opposition. He was of the view that as long as true representatives of people did not come forward, people’s problems could not be solved.
He said that issues of Balochistan were very complicated and people of Balochistan had not got justice in the past.
Answering questions, the PPP chairman said that all the allies of the PTI government had made their decisions and now it was up to them to decide the timing of their announcement.
He recalled that Asif Zardari as the president of the country and the supreme commander of Pakistan Army had apologised to the people of Balochistan over the past mistakes.
He said Imran Khan had lost his majority already and it was too late now for him to make any announcement. He said the pressure tactics and threats of imposition of emergency or governor’s rule would not work now. He said that attacks on the Parliament Lodges and Sindh House were all signs of a desperate man. 
“Those on the losing side use violence to disrupt peace. Imran cannot release a single notification or advice, let alone impose governor’s rule or declare an emergency. The opposition is not taking this threat seriously,” he said while responding to questions regarding imposition of governor’s rule in Sindh. 
In response to a question about the neutrality of institutions, the PPP chairman said he hoped that “neutrality” was maintained, stating that “no-confidence is the test of neutrality”. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari also lashed out at Imran Khan for targeting the judiciary in his recent speech. He said that at a time when the whole environment had been polarised, “it is the credibility of our chief justice that the opposition and government’s representatives are in the court”. 
“We believe that the decision taken by the chief justice and the Supreme Court will be for the benefit of the country. It is the chief justice’s authority to form a bench as per his wish,” he added.

4,New Ukraine peace talks to begin in Turkey today,Ukraine’s intelligence chief says Putin may seek to impose a separation line between country's occupied and unoccupied regions.,"KYIV: Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are to sit down for a fresh round of talks next week in an attempt to end the war in Ukraine that the UN estimates has killed at least 1,100 civilians and sent more than 3.8 million fleeing to other countries.
Kyiv said the negotiations would start on Monday in Turkey, while Russia’s lead negotiator said they would begin on Tuesday without confirming the location.
The prospect of fresh talks comes after the Russian army said last week that it would focus on eastern Ukraine, which some interpreted as a scaling back of Russian objections, although US President Joe Biden cast doubt on a strategy change.
France’s President Emma­nuel Macron on Sunday warned against an escalation “in words and action”, after Biden on Saturday branded Russian President Vladimir Putin a “butcher” who “cannot remain in power”.
The Kremlin reacted in fury to Biden’s comments, saying it narrowed the window for bilateral relations, with the West and Moscow already at loggerheads over crushing sanctions imposed against Russia for invading Ukraine on Feb 24.
Rounds of diplomatic efforts and the sanctions have so far failed to get Putin to halt his war, despite the Russians appearing to run into tactical and logistical problems.
Ukraine’s intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said Putin might be considering a Korean scenario, by seeking to “impose a separation line between the occupied and unoccupied regions of our country”.
“After a failure to capture Kyiv and remove Ukraine’s government, Putin is changing his main operational directions. These are south and east,” he wrote on Facebook.
“In fact, it will be an attempt to set up South and North Koreas in Ukraine,” Budanov added.
Russia may try to establish a quasi-state of occupied zones with its own currency, he assessed, but he vowed that Ukrainian counter-offe­n­sive will foil those plans.
Russia has de facto control over the self-proclaimed Don­etsk and Lugansk republics in the country’s eastern Donbas region. The head of Ukraine’s Lugansk separatist region said it may hold a referendum on becoming part of Russia — a move imm­ediately slammed by Kyiv.
Russian troops have also been besieging Mariupol as taking the strategic port city would give Moscow an unbroken control stretching from the Donbas to the Crimea peninsula, which it annexed in 2014.
Mariupol residents have recounted harrowing scenes of destruction and death.
Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

5,EU envoy in Tehran amid hopes to salvage nuclear deal,"US State Secretary Antony Blinken says US, Israel won’t allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.","TEHRAN: A leading European Union diplomat held talks in Tehran on Sunday, Iran’s state-run media reported, amid hopes that an agreement to restore Iran’s tattered nuclear deal with world powers could be completed. 
The meetings between the EU’s envoy, Enrique Mora, and top Iranian officials come at a sensitive moment for talks to revive the deal, as the glimmers of a resolution to some of the thorniest issues in the negotiations have emerged. 
The report on the talks in Tehran gave scant detail, saying only that the diplomats discussed the latest on the nuclear agreement, with Iran’s top nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani repeating that Iran believed a deal was within reach if America was realistic in its demands. 

Blinken says US, Israel won’t allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons

Nuclear talks broke off earlier this month as last-minute wrangles in Vienna coincided with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and financial sanctions imposed by the West on Moscow. 
In a visible sign that shared regional anxiety over a renewed nuclear deal was growing, the Israeli government hastily arranged an unprecedented summit of top diplomats from Arab countries that have normalised ties with Israel along with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. 
“We are both committed, both determined that Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon,” Blinken said alongside Israel’s foreign minister, seeking to reassure his jittery counterparts before the gathering. 
Speaking alongside his Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid, Blinken said the US believes restoring the agreement was “the best way to put Iran’s programme back in the box that it was in but has escaped” after the US withdrew from the deal under former president Donald Trump in 2018.
Remarks on Sunday by the US special envoy for Iran, Robert Malley, underscored the US limitations that have frustrated allies. He declined to discuss details of the nuclear negotiations, but reiterated that America had failed to secure a broader deal with Iran that would restrict its ballistic missiles programme and curb its regional military policies. 
It would have been better, but (the nuclear deal) was not intended to, it wasn’t able to address the other issues, Malley told the Doha Forum, a Middle East policy conference in Qatar. Many in the region view the IRGC in the same way we do. ... But we know this is not a deal that’s going to address that.” 
However, Malley was quick to stress that no matter what happens to the Guard’s terrorism designation, separate sanctions over its ballistic missile development and alleged human rights violations would remain.
