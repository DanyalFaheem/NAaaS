0,Sindh heritage suffering from monumental neglect,Minister says there is an acute shortage of staff in the archaeology dept due to a ban on recruitment since 2013.,"KARACHI: The architectural heritage in the city seems to be at stake as the unauthorised demolition and illegal construction works at buildings and monuments from the colonial period continue mainly due to lacunae in the heritage law as well as shortage of staff. 
Sources told Dawn on Sunday that the meagre strength of staff at the directorate general of antiquities, archaeology, archives, culture and tourism department and a lethargic attitude of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) were the other two causes for failure in preservation and prevention of the city’s historical architectural heritage. 
They said that there were over 3,500 protected buildings and sites across the province, including 1,750 in Karachi alone, while only 10 staffers in Karachi and as many in the interior of Sindh were deputed to keep an eye on the unauthorised demolition and illegal construction, which was mostly done by influential owners and builders. 
The sources said that the heritage department had received just Rs15 million funds for preservation of protected buildings, which were in highly dilapidated condition. 

Only 10 staffers responsible for city’s 1,750 protected sites; no building can be razed without  NOC of SBCA

They said that the department selected three protected buildings in the city for renovation and preservation and approached the owners for an agreement for the work on the buildings. 
The sources said that the owners extended threats to the department officials against renovation work saying that the department was not supposed to carry out any work in their private buildings no matter they were declared protected. 
They said that one of the owners served the department with a legal notice, while the two others moved the Sindh High Court through constitutional petitions against the decision to renovate the protected buildings. 
SBCA’s responsibility 
The sources said that there were no inspectors in the heritage department to check unauthorised demolition or construction at the protected sites as there was no provision of any such posts in the department. 
They said that it was primarily the responsibility of the SBCA to monitor the protected buildings and ensure that no demolition or construction work was carried out at the heritage sites.  They recalled that the absence of inspectors in the heritage department was brought to the notice of the then chief secretary three years ago, but to no avail.  
The chief secretary told the archaeology department that it was the job of the SBCA under building laws to monitor demolition and construction activities in the province, they added. 
The sources said that the demolition and construction of any building, including the protected ones, could not be carried out in the province without obtaining a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the SBCA, which had staff deputed in every part of the city to monitor demolition and construction activities. 
Culture and Heritage Minister Syed Sardar Shah told Dawn that there was an acute shortage of required staff in the archaeology department as there had been a ban on recruitment since 2013. 
The sources said that 90 per cent of the protected building in the province belonged to private parties, while the remaining ones were owned by the federal, provincial and local governments. 
They said that the state of architectural heritage in Karachi had undergone massive changes since 1947. Attempts were being made to construct concrete high-rises on the sites of protected buildings, which stood proudly displaying their diverse architectural features. 
They said that the protected sites and buildings occupied large areas of land, sometimes much larger than the allotted plots of land in what were now some of the most elite or expensive areas of the city.  
The sources said that most of the protected buildings were concentrated in Saddar, Civil Lines and Cantonment Board Karachi remit where plots were very expensive because of their value and buildings and structures could be built on such sites after razing the protected buildings.

1,Crackdown on ‘remnants’ of Lyari gangs planned,"According to investigators, Arshad Pappu has disclosed that over a dozen members of the gang are active in old city areas.","KARACHI: The March 22 targeted killing of a dismissed policeman facing trial in the Arshad Pappu murder case has forced law enforcement agencies to step up their action against what they called remnants of Lyari gang warfare, it emerged on Sunday.
Investigators grilling a son of Arshad Pappu, who was arrested for the targeted killing of ex-SHO Chand Khan Niazi, said that he disclosed that over a dozen members of the Arshad Pappu gang were active in old city areas.
Some social activist of the city’s oldest neighbourhood also pointed out that many Lyari gangsters had invested their ill-gotten money in the lucrative business of illegal construction of high-rise building in the area through their frontmen but it seemed that authorities concerned had turned a blind eye towards them.

Residents say gangsters invested ill-gotten money in construction business thru frontmen

Rivalry between gangs
“In the aftermath of two targeted killing incidents of former SHOs Javed Baloch and Chand Khan Niazi by rival groups, it has been decided to speed up the hunt for the killers, their aides and facilitators,” DIG-South Sharjeel Kharal told Dawn.
“Since these incidents are a direct result of the rivalry between Uzair Baloch and Arshad Pappu gangs, it has been decided to keep a close eye on their activities so that peace of Lyari cannot be disturbed,” he said.
Both Baloch and Niazi were booked, arrested and then enlarged on bail for their alleged involvement in kidnapping and murder of Arshad Pappu, his brother and an aide in 2013. 
They were targeted upon returning home after attending a court hearing in the Arshad Pappu murder case with an interval of three months in December and March.
A couple of days after the murder, police and Rangers had claimed to have arrested Alam Baloch, a son of Arshad Pappu, for his alleged involvement in the murder of Chand Khan Niazi. They said he was riding a motorbike and his pillion-passenger, who is still at large, carried out the shooting.
While the investigators suspected involvement of the same gang in the December 2021 murder case of Javed Baloch, the son of Arshad Pappu denied his involvement in the case.
The DIG said during initial investigation Pappu’s son revealed that there were 15 ‘remnants’ of his father’s gang were active in old city area. 
“Concerted efforts are under way to take them to task,” the DIG said, adding that the motorbike used in the murder of Niazi was also recovered.
Residents concerned
Concerned over the recent incidents that came as grim reminder of the violence that the residents of Lyari had endured before, social activists in the area said that certain elements of the gang warfare had invested their illegal money in construction of high-rises through their front-men. 
They said there was a mushroom growth of high-rise buildings in Lyari, which were being constructed in violation of all building codes and approved layout plans.
They believe that the issue was not only linked to civic problems but also related to the law and order of Lyari.
They demanded immediate attention of the authorities, particularly the Sindh government, before these issues become a contributory factor to law and order in the old city neighbourhoods.

2,"FIR ordered against SBCA officials, builder over illegal construction",KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has ordered registration of a case against a builder and officials of the Sindh...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has ordered registration of a case against a builder and officials of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) over illegal and unauthorised construction in Nazimabad.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi came down hard on the SBCA and observed that only because of the criminal negligence of its officials, the builder had committed gross illegality while raising construction. 
The said officials should not be let scot-free for repeating the same, the court observed.
The bench directed the director general of the SBCA to take strict disciplinary action against the delinquent officers and lodge an FIR against the builder as well as SBCA officials for their involvement in raising illegal and unauthorised construction.
It also sought a compliance report from the SBCA chief within six weeks.
When the bench took up a petition against construction of a multi-storey building in violation of relevant laws, the deputy director-SBCA (district central) filed a compliance report in the light of the court’s earlier order to demolish the building.
It was submitted in the report that the SBCA officials along with police reached the plot in question to demolish the building, but found it fully occupied and no action for demolition could be taken.
It further stated that the ejection notice had been issued to the occupants of the building for their peaceful eviction.
The SBCA report also maintained that the construction of the building in question was started in August 2019 and completed in December 2020 and produced the list of SBCA officials posted there during illegal construction.
Despite the letters sent by the SBCA, the utilities agencies had not yet disconnected the connections of the building, it added.
The petition was filed in 2019 against the construction of a multi-storey building in Block 5-E, Nazimabad in violation of the Karachi Buildings and Town Planning Regulations, 2002 and without approved building plan.

3,Memorial planned for frontline health professionals who died from Covid-19,KARACHI: In a move to pay tribute to the healthcare professionals died in the line of duty during the Covid-19...,"KARACHI: In a move to pay tribute to the healthcare professionals died in the line of duty during the Covid-19 pandemic, a memorial would be built in Clifton area, officials and health fraternity members said on Sunday. 
On the occasion of the ground-breaking ceremony of the memorial, Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab called it a good gesture both from the local administration and medical science professionals. 
It is the brainchild of renowned gastroenterologist and physician Dr Saad Khalid Niaz, who surrendered his presidential award to the government in protest. He announced to establishing the memorial after the services of the healthcare workers, who served during the pandemic, were not recognised. 
Addressing the ceremony, Mr Wahab said that unfortunately ‘only cricketers and those with guns’ were considered as heroes in Pakistan while the services of unsung heroes like medical professionals, teachers and social workers were hardly recognised in the country. 
“The nations who ignore sacrifices of their real heroes never progress in this world. We hardly talk about scores of those heroes who live among us like doctors, paramedics, nurses, teachers and social workers like Abdus Sattar Edhi and others.” 
He said the memorial would be built in the Clifton area with the support of Getz Pharma on a piece of land provided by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation. The pharmaceutical company, he said, had agreed to bear the expenses of the memorial, which amounted to Rs45 million. 
Although the federal government had not provided any compensation to the heirs of the healthcare providers died during the pandemic, he said, he would try to arrange a financial package for them as soon as possible. 
“Similarly, an endowment fund as per suggestion of Dr Saad Khalid Niaz can also be established to fulfil educational needs of the children of the martyred healthcare providers. The Sindh government can provide the seed money in this regard,” he announced. 
Dr Niaz in his address said he had decided to return his presidential award to the Government of Pakistan after the authorities in the centre selected only two doctors among 126 people for the presidential awards. He said healthcare providers, including doctors, paramedics, nurses and technicians, were the real heroes who sacrificed their lives against an enemy that was invisible and far more lethal than modern weapons of mass destruction. 
“As per our information, around 232 doctors and 32 healthcare providers have so far sacrificed their lives due to Covid-19 in Pakistan. But none of those were honoured by the government. Not a single penny was paid to them as martyrs. Nothing was done for the education of their children,” he said.

4,Murad says healthcare services improved due to public-private partnership,KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Sunday said that public-private partnership in the health ...,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Sunday said that public-private partnership in the health sector had enabled the provincial government to reach every nook and corner of the province, particularly the rural areas.
“The Indus Hospital & Health Network (IHHN) is our valuable and most hardworking partner and we are planning to extend this partnership further,” he said while speaking at the closing ceremony of the sixth biennial ICON 2022 organised by the hospital here at a local hotel. 
Mr Shah said: “Over the years, I have had a special bond with the Indus hospital and always endeavoured to contribute towards this remarkable institution.” 
He said throughout the ups and downs, especially the Covid-19 pandemic, he was able to work closely with Indus Hospital and its leadership. 
The CM said he was informed of the astronomical numbers that the ICON 2022 conference was able to engage over 8,000 people from across the globe. 
Looking towards the future, Mr Shah said he proposed to Indus hospital founder and CEO Dr Abdul Bari Khan to further strengthen the partnership with the Sindh government for the next conference. 
“As we take pride in Indus as a flagship institution of Sindh, serving the entire nation, I strongly feel that this conference should be seen as a true embodiment of the Sindh government and Indus’ partnership to be showcased across the region; in fact the globe,” he said. 
The CM assured the IHHN that they would receive all the support from his government for the moot as well as for any other efforts.

5,"This week 50 years ago: Resumption of classes, suggested new provinces and seahorse babies",THE protests held by students and their teachers sparked by the premature retirement of the city’s teacher...,"THE protests held by students and their teachers sparked by the premature retirement of the city’s teacher community resulted in successful negotiations, to a reasonable extent, with the authorities. To refresh memory, the students as an act of remonstration had ‘occupied’ some colleges or boycotted classes. But things had now begun to look up. On March 29, 1972 the students in most of the educational institutions in Karachi resumed classes following assurances and appeals for ‘academic peace’ by members of the National and Provincial assemblies from the Sindh capital who assured sympathetic consideration of their demands. 
But things had not quite returned to normal entirely. The students of the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) continued to boycott classes in support of their demand for reinstatement of Dr I A Mukhtar (the first dean and director of IBA); and the students of Jamia Millia, Malir, carried on with their occupation of the college for the fourth day in protest against the non-acceptance of their demands by the management of the college — they, however, conducted regular classes which were taken by their senior fellows. NED University, too, remained in the hands of the pupils and had been closed by the government until April 2. The students of Government College Nazimabad attended classes but kept the control of the principal’s room.
This was an issue that was affecting a single sector of the city: education. Something else on a much larger scale was being discussed that week as well. On March 30, Vice-President, Pakistan Muslim League (Qayyum group), Nabi Bakhsh Zehri strongly urged the new creation of Karachi and Multan-Bahawalpur as two new provinces in line with the nationalities’ concept advanced on a linguistic, cultural and ethnic basis. Such a step, he told a press conference, would help eliminate the chauvinistic old and new trends and recognise the legitimate aspirations of the Saraeki speaking people of Multan and Bahawalpur. Besides, in his view, the carving out of Multan and Bahawalpur from Punjab would curtail the perpetual Punjabi majority in West Pakistan and facilitate the process of equal representation in the proposed upper house of the National Assembly. Mr Zehri explained that the population of Karachi was either Urdu speaking or understood Urdu well, therefore it was culturally and linguistically different from the rest of the people in Sindh.
Now, from serious matters to a relatively lighter subject! April 1 is oftentimes thought to be a day for pranksters. That was not the case in 1972. On April 1, the three pregnant male seahorses in the Clifton Aquarium gave birth to over 200 sea-ponies. The babies were expected to see the light of day in early February. The males of the three couples had been carrying the eggs in their pouches for more than three months now. Seahorses are a prolific species: a pair can give birth to 30 to 70 babies at a time, and one can raise hundreds of seahorses from a single pair. The ones born on April 1 were teeny-weeny creatures, perfectly formed. “Their mamas and papas did not fuss around them as the young ones could feed themselves from the moment of their birth,” a report published in this newspaper claimed.

6,Freedom fighter Sooriya Badshah remembered,HYDERABAD: Activists of Pakistan Muslim League-Functional on Sunday lamented that freedom fighter Sooriya ...,"HYDERABAD: Activists of Pakistan Muslim League-Functional on Sunday lamented that freedom fighter Sooriya Badshah’s day was never observed at government level and his heroic life and supreme sacrifice had not been made part of syllabus so far. 
The activists, who gathered outside local press club here to pay homage to Pir Pagara Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi-II lovingly called Sooriya Badshah by his followers, said that Sooriya Badshah was executed by British colonial regime on March 20, 1943 in Hyderabad central jail in punishment for his armed struggle for freedom from the colonial rulers. 
The party’s district general secretary Rafiq Magsi, who led the activists, said: “We have shown disloyalty to Sooriya Badshah as he has not so far been given status of a national hero”.
He said that the colonial regime not only ended Sooriya Badshah’s life to crush struggle for freedom but also disappeared his body; its whereabouts were still not known. His body remained missing till this day. Had Sooriya Badshah not fought against the colonial regime, people would have remained under subjugation till this day, he said.
He said that the nations who forgot their heroes could never live long. Pir Pagara’s family had served Pakistan, stood by Pakistan army and always fought against enemies to safeguard this country, he said.
He regretted that the day of Sooriya Badshah was never observed at government level and his heroic story had not been included in syllabus so far. PPP government had always tried to cover up martyrdom of Sooriya Badshah, he said. 
He said that PPP and other political parties owed everything to the supreme sacrifice of Sooriya Badshah. The parties were looting Sindh and minting money and the so-called leaders had destroyed Pakistan and Sindh, he said and vowed to emulate Sooriya Badshah’s life.

7,"SHO, PPP woman leader booked in custodial death case to end 38-hour sit-in",MITHI: Members of the Meghwar community who had started their protest sit-in here on Friday morning over the death ...,"MITHI: Members of the Meghwar community who had started their protest sit-in here on Friday morning over the death of a youth, Bhag Chand, 27, in the lock-up of Mithi police station, succeeded in getting their demands accepted on Saturday night. They ended their 38-hour protest after an FIR against Mithi SHO Mohammad Soomar Mangrio, some of his unnamed subordinates and Pakistan Peoples Party’s district women wing leader Samtra Manjiani was registered as per the desire of the aggrieved family. 
The FIR was lodged by Bhag Chand’s uncle Jay Ram, who claimed that his nephew was detained many days ago on the false allegation of theft at the behest of Ms Manjiani. He alleged that Bhag Chand had been subjected to intense torture in the lock-up and his arrest was shown only on Thursday, when he descended into near-death condition. 
As soon as the police informed his family about the suspect’s death late on Thursday night, a large number of enraged Meghwar community members gathered at the police station accusing the SHO and his subordinates of having murdered Bhag Chand. They took the body to a place near the police station and held a sit-in demanding FIR against the suspects. 
Judicial Magistrate Nisar Ahmed was first to hear the aggrieved protesters and order recording of their statement.
The protesters, however, refused to end their sit-in and perform last rites of the victim until the suspects were arrested. Civil society activists also joined in the protest to express solidarity with the bereaved family. 
PPP leaders, including Engineer Gianchand Tharani, Sushil Malani, Nandlal Malhi and others visited the police station and assured the protesters of their full cooperation in ensuring a fair investigation into the incident. 
At one stage during the course of the protest, police tried to use force against some protesters, who lit bonfire and put up barricades at some places. However, no major disturbances took place.  
As the sit-in continued and more members of the Meghwar community started sit-in at two other places in Mithi on Saturday, PPP MPA Faqir Sher Mohammad Bilalani, Tharparkar Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Nawaz Soho and SSP Hassan Sardar Niazi held negotiations with representatives of the protesters.
The talks lasted many hours and finally the protesters’ demand of FIR against the SHO, Samtra Manjiani and other suspects was accepted. The Meghwars were also assured of all the suspects’ arrest. They ended the sit-in and took away Bhag Chand’s body for last rites on late Saturday evening after the suspects were booked under Sections 302 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Meanwhile, Special Assistant to the CM on Human Rights MPA Surendar Valasai has expressed grief over the custodial death and acknowledged that an FIR as per the bereaved family’s desire had been registered.
In a statement, he said the Sindh government would ensure protection of human rights across the province, adding that the investigation of this particular case would be assigned to an officer of the bereaved family’s choice.
Mr Valasai said no one found involved in extrajudicial killings would be spared.

They said at the programme held in Balhreji village near Moenjodaro that they would hold the festival on a regular basis to remember the towering personality of Pirzado and learn from his life. 
The festival organised by Anwar Pirzado Academy in collaboration with Sindh culture department was inaugurated a day before by a panel of writers, poets, politicians and artists, including Mahtab Akber Rashdi, Prof Saleem Memon, Jami Chandio, Adal Soomro, Mohammad Ali Pathan, Bedal Masroor and Dr Mohammad Hassan Pirzado. 
Ms Rashdi, chairperson of Sindh Graduates Association (SGA), said that Pirzado was a man of multiple traits who accomplished many great tasks in his life. He was a righteous journalist, a dedicated writer and poet, she said. 
He was member of the team which explored Indus River and travelled through it from its point of origination to the end on boats and wrote extensively on what the team found out during this expedition, she said. 
She said that Pirzado spread light of education in his village and advocated equal opportunities for the village women to enable them to partake of society’s progress.
Jami Chandio, writer, said about Pirzado’s book on poetry and thought of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai, that Pirzado was a true follower of Bhitai who had explained various aspects of Bhitai’s poetry in an easy and effective manner. He was keenly interested in defining Bhitai’s poetry from progressive point of view which he did successfully in his book, he said. 
Saleem Memon, former professor of Karachi University, said that Pirzado was an institution embodied. He accomplished many a difficult task in the field of literary research, journalism and in archaeological exploration with matchless confidence and perseverance, he said. 
Adal Soomro, former secretary of Sindhi Adabi Sangat, said that people like Pirzado were born in centuries. He was a selfless man who served society and people. Pirzado remained associated with Dawn and The Star till 1983 and his contributions to both papers were marvelous, said the speakers.
Three newly published books of Pirzado were also launched at the festival in which several publishing houses had set up stalls. 
In a separate event, a book titled Moenjodaro: choond kahaaniyu (Moenjodaro: selected stories) compiled by Jahangir Abbasi was launched at Arts Council Larkana under the aegis of Stupa Adabi Fourm on Sunday. It was presided over by senior story writer Saleem Korai. 
The speakers Akhtar Janweri, Ghulam Mustafa Shar, Sarwar Saif, Prof Mukhtiar Samo, Mohammad Qasim Daud and others said the book was unique as it included 21 stories which were all written either in the backdrop of Moenjodaro or mentioned Priest King, dancing girl, sutpa, and great bath of Moenjodaro. 
They said the stories in the book were written by seasoned Sindhi writers like Ayaz Qadri, Agha Saleem, Siraj, Zeb Sindhi, Manzoor Kohyar and others, which Jahangir Abbasi had gathered in his book. 
It was the first fiction book in which five thousand year old ruined city had been mentioned in an effective manner. It would certainly enrich Sindhi literature, they said.

11,Fishermen return home after years in Indian jail,All of them were arrested at Sir Creek in December of 2016.,"KARACHI: Seated on some chairs placed for them on the footpath outside the Edhi Foundation’s centre at Kharadar, the family members of the six Pakistani fishermen reaching Karachi after being handed over to authorities at Wagah last month, had their eyes fixed on the road on Sunday. Many of them carried plastic bags full of rose petals, many carried garlands.
The returning fishermen, all hailing from Keti Bandar in Thatta, were Ali Hassan, Ali Akbar, Ali Nawaz, Wazir Ali, Didar Ali and Hamza Ali. 
All of them were arrested at Sir Creek in December of 2016. Their families waiting to receive them in Karachi said that there were some five fishing boats that were taken away by the Indian coast guard along with all the 26 men on them. Over the years, 20 of them have returned. And the remaining six returned on Sunday.
Shaukat Ali, brother of Hamza Ali, who returned this time, told Dawn that he was also one of the men arrested with the others in 2016. “I myself only returned three months ago. When I got my release orders, I felt very sad to learn that my brother had not got his. I didn’t want to leave him behind in India but I had no other choice,” said Shaukat, who looked relieved to know that his brother was among the ones returning this time.
The aged Mohammad Ramzan had come to receive his paternal grandson Ali Akbar and his maternal grandson Ali Nawaz. As many as nine earning members of his family had been arrested along with the same batch picked up in 2016. All except the two grandsons had returned so far. So he was also relieved to have them back.
Didar Hussain, another one of the fishermen returning, was going to meet his son Rizwan for the first time. His wife was three-month pregnant when he was arrested. 
“During this while I became father to a son and I also lost my own father,” Didar told Dawn. He also said that he won’t be returning to Keti Bandar as his family has moved to Rehri Goth in Karachi now after his father’s passing.
The youngest of the returning fishermen was 19-year-old Wazir Ali. He was just 14 when he was caught. His father Sher Ali had also come to Karachi to receive him. While he was away, his younger brother also fell ill and died. His father when hugging him on his return also carried the burden of informing him about that loss.
All the Pakistani fishermen had terrible stories to tell of being beaten, of being kept hungry for up to four days in the Indian jails.
Besides their families, the returning fishermen were also received by Ahmed Edhi of the Edhi Foundation, who brought them to Karachi and also handed each of the men cash envelopes of Rs5,000. 
Shaukat Hussain of the Fishermen Cooperative Society also handed them cash envelopes of Rs20,000 each. 
Saeed Baloch of the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum (PFF) was also present. The PFF has been taking care of the fishermen’s families in their absence, providing them with food rations while their earning members are away from home. 
There are still 116 Pakistani fishermen languishing in Indian jails after the return of these fishermen.

A Met official said that currently the winds blowing from Balochistan side bordering Iran were actually causing such hot and dry weather conditions in the city. “And this is quite normal in late March and April,” he added. 
“We expect that the same weather conditions may prevail in April when the people will be fasting in the holy month of Ramazan with the temperatures ranging between 37 °C and 40 °C. In these weather conditions air normally comes to stop in the daytime and starts blowing later in the evening.” 
With the passage of time, the humidity would increase and that would raise the feel-like temperature as well, he warned.

Quiad’s grand-nephew Liaquat Merchant was asked to speak about Allama Iqbal and Senator Walid Iqbal, the grandson of Allama Iqbal, was asked to talk about the Quaid-i-Azam by moderator Ikram Sehgal. 
Mr Merchant initiated that if the Quaid-i-Azam is Pakistan’s founding father, Allama Iqbal is the country’s ideological father. 
“What is the connection between Jinnah and Iqbal? Well, Iqbal inspired people. He also inspired Jinnah, who had gone to England. But, Iqbal persuaded him to come back to India by sending the letter to him on June 21, 1937. Iqbal said that he was the man here to whom the Muslims of India could look up for guidance. Sadly, Allama Iqbal died in 1938,” he said. 

Quaid-i-Azam’s grand-nephew and Allama Iqbal’s grandson discuss connection between two great leaders

“But Pakistan has two national heroes, Allama Iqbal and Jinnah, who needed to be idealised and looked up. All Pakistanis owe a debt of gratitude to Iqbal and Jinnah,” he said.
Senator Walid Iqbal shared some of his late father Justice Javid Iqbal’s memories of meeting with the Quaid. 
He said that his father was 10-11 years old when he met Jinnah and asked him if he was also a poet like his father. “Jinnah answered no, he wasn’t. Then upon asking what he intended to do in life, Jinnah found him silent and had turned to Allama Iqbal to ask him why the boy had no answer. That’s when my grandfather told Jinnah that his son was waiting for him to tell what his aim in life should be,” he said. 
“At that time, hardly anyone knew Jinnah in Punjab. And from that one meeting, I can tell how much my father respected Jinnah,” he added. 
“There is another story that my father told us. My grandfather had told him that Pundit Nehru was coming and he didn’t have the strength to get out of the bed and receive Nehru, so he sent him instead. My father asked Allama Iqbal who was Nehru? He was informed that like Mr Jinnah is the leader of the Muslims, Pundit Nehru is the leader of the Hindus. 
“He said that he was waiting for the guest in his veranda as Nehru got out of his car. My father greeted him with Assalam-o-Alaikum to which he replied with Namashkaar. Then he remembers that Nehru sat cross-legged on the floor before Allama Iqbal and asked him to take a seat on the sofa. But he refused, saying that his level was on the floor before Allama Iqbal. And he said that he had come to ask after his health. 
“But during the conversation, he said that ‘Dr Iqbal, who knows about Mohammad Ali Jinnah over here. You are the real leader of the Muslims.’ When Allama Iqbal heard this, his face was flushed with anger and said to Nehru: ‘This is how you have come to ask for my health. I am a soldier of Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Please, leave my home. And he said this because he had found that personality in Jinnah that articulated the description of a leader. He had decided that this man would lead the Muslims of the subcontinent,” he said.

Judge Javed Ali Korejo of the Consumer Protection Court (East) also imposed a fine of Rs50,000 on the dealer for providing inaccurate services to Muhammad Akbar.
The judge ordered the defendant to pay Rs500,000 “compensation and damages on account of mental agony” within 30 days.
The judge also ordered the dealer, Sheikh Hani Saboor, to hand over the original registration file of a sold-out car to Mr Akbar within 30 days. 
Mr Akbar had taken the F.J International Society Motor’s proprietor Saboor to court under the Sindh Consumer Protection Act stating that he had purchased an unregistered Toyota Vitz car of 2019 model against a total sum of Rs2.5m from the defendant. 
While the defendant handed him the possession of the four-wheeler upon full payment, he did not deliver the original file of the vehicle despite several requests and finally he refused to give such documents, he submitted. 
Mr Akbar said he approached the car dealers’ association to lodge a complaint against the defendant, but the association did not entertain his requests. Henceforth, a legal notice was sent to the defendant, who did not bother to respond to it, he added.
