Fasana-i-Ajaib, or, literally, the tale of curiosities, is an Urdu dastan. A dastan is a longish, highly imaginative tale packed with unusual events, love affairs and battles, not to mention supernatural characters --- genies, fairies, dwarfs and sorcerers. As a prose narrative, a dastan can be described as what is usually called a ‘nested story’, or a tale with many subplots and layers of stories within a main story. 
The ‘hero’ of a dastan is usually a king or prince, a romantic at one moment with several beauties by his side, and the next a macho who can defeat scores of warriors at once. At the same time, he is utterly religious and usually divine help arrives for him whenever he is in trouble ---- and, alas, he is often in trouble, usually of his own making. 
What makes Fasana-i-Ajaib unique is its language: ornate and laden with similes, metaphors and metonyms. Weaved in a highly decorative language, the book gave birth to a new literary style, known as Urdu’s Lucknow School of prose. Though today, we may not have a very high opinion of the book and its flowery language, when Fasana-i-Ajaib was first published in 1843 (though penned in 1824), it took the subcontinent by storm and soon it became a symbol of Lucknow’s representative literary piece, writes Rasheed Hasan Khan. 
Surprisingly, many male characters of Fasana-i-Ajaib are deprived of common sense and make silly mistakes in everyday affairs. Even the hero of the tale, Prince Jaan-i-Alam, is too naive to be a prince and lacks worldly wisdom. Rasheed Hasan Khan says this is a reflection of Lucknow’s actual state of affairs as princes there totally lacked the qualities rulers must possess and most of them loved to be engaged in festivities and revelries. In fact, the elites of Lucknow in those days were notorious for their lasciviousness. On the other hand, the female characters in this dastan are much more sensible and active, which also reflects the general character of Lucknow society about two centuries ago. 
But Fasana-i-Ajaib is not only a book or tale; it is neither merely a window into Lucknow’s penchant for an ornamental language. Rather, it is a mirror reflecting Lucknow’s culture that favoured embellishment in everything, be it a literary style or a general way of life. Delicacy, sophistication and elegance were the watchwords in Lucknow society where Fasana-i-Ajaib was created, albeit in the end the zest for elaborately decorating everything may betray a lack of sophistication. Fasana-i-Ajaib was not popular only in its own days, but still it is considered one of the most reprinted classical works of Urdu literature. Only Bagh-o-Bahar, the famous classical Urdu tale by Mir Amman Dehlvi, has run into more editions than Fasana-i-Ajaib. 
Rajab Ali Baig Suroor Lukhnavi, the author of Fasana-i-Ajaib, claimed to have written, in the shape of Fasana-i-Ajaib, a befitting reply to Bagh-o-Bahar, the icon of lovely, flowing and comparatively simple Urdu prose that Delhi School is known for. This heightened the ongoing literary feud between Lucknow and Delhi. Delhi was hallmarking Urdu language and literature and took pride in its status as political and cultural capital, despite being almost totally rendered powerless by the British colonialists. Poets and writers who had migrated from Delhi to Lucknow in search of greener pastures could never shed their sense of superiority and would call the local intellectuals of Lucknow ‘Poorab Wallas’, a mildly pejorative term to underline Lucknow’s rustic hence uncouth tastes and gaudy standards in art, literature and language. 
The Lucknow’s assertion of political independence from Delhi at the behest of the British was not new and Lucknow had declared itself a ‘kingdom’ during Nawab Ghaziuddin Hyder’s reign, but its desire to equal or surpass Delhi in every field exacerbated literary rivalries between the poets and writers of Delhi and Lucknow. And Fasana-i-Ajaib worked as a catalyst in this cultural and literary battle. Eventually, a battle of books, so to speak, broke out and a series of claims, counterclaims and rejoinders were brought about not only in poetry and discussions but full-scale books were also written from both sides. 
Suroor in his preface to Fasana-i-Ajaib not only boasted of Lucknow’s grandeur, affluence and exquisite standards in every field, he scoffed at Mir Amman’s prose, which, so thought Suroor, was too simple and plain to be taken seriously. 
He thought the pretentious and embellished language that he was writing was truly standard Urdu, a claim that today hardly anybody would endorse. 
Rajab Ali Baig Suroor was born in Lucknow in 1785 or 1786, says Nayyar Masood and Jameel Jalibi agrees to it. Suroor’s exact date of death is not known but Haneef Naqvi has reckoned that Suroor died between March 15 and April 12, 1869.

1,Maryam says PM has only one card left: resignation,GUJRAT: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz vice president Maryam Nawaz on Sunday ruled out a US-backed or international...,"GUJRAT: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz vice president Maryam Nawaz on Sunday ruled out a US-backed or international conspiracy behind the move to oust Prime Minister Imran Khan, stressing that he had only one card left — resignation. 
She asserted that it was none other than PTI lawmakers who had shown their distrust of Mr Khan’s policies and capabilities in running the country.
Reminding Mr Khan of the remarks he made after meeting former US president Donald Trump, she said: “You told the people how jubilant you were after meeting Trump as if you had won the World Cup, and now when President Joe Biden did not even make a phone call, you have started linking the no-trust move and public wrath with a conspiracy being hatched by the United States and other international powers.”
She expressed these views while addressing a news conference in Gujranwala along with Hamza Shehbaz and then speaking to a public meeting after the PM’s speech in Islamabad. They reached near Gujranwala early on Sunday morning while leading the party’s march from Lahore to Islamabad, where the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) organised a massive rally.
Stressing that the ruling PTI had lost 15 out of 16 by-elections in the recent past, Ms Nawaz asked: “Was that an American conspiracy as well?”
“Imran Khan has been left with only one card now — he should resign from the PM office instead of clinging to power,” she said and asked the premier to quit politics, as it “has no room for you in future”.
She said Mr Khan would have to be accountable for his mega corruption scams, as the masses had been robbed of billions of rupees through sugar, medicine, flour, fertiliser, energy and other such scandals.
“Why are you trying to escape by not responding to the queries of the election commission and instead levelling baseless accusations on the chief election commissioner of being Nawaz Sharif’s man? Why are you escaping from the foreign funding case?” she asked the premier.
She thundered that the prime minister had wasted at least Rs12 billion of the taxpayers’ money on running a malicious campaign against the PML-N, whose leaders were sent behind bars. However, she said, the entire leadership was not proven guilty. 
Cold response
Ms Nawaz also reminded the prime minister of his cold response to the victims of the Hazara community in Quetta violence and Murree’s tragic incident. “You told the people of Hazara that you could not be blackmailed but now you are bowing your head to the parties and politicians with few seats in parliament to stay in power,” she said.
Challenging the claims about a huge turnout at the PTI event, the PML-N leader said the PM was using the religious card, the state machinery and taxpayers’ money to save his government.
She said the PDM’s march should be named Raddul Fasaad (the elimination of discord) as the country might not have seen such a state of affairs in the past 75 years. She also took a swipe at Mr Khan for taunting Mr Bilawal for “not learning Urdu in 15 years” and calling Maulana Fazlur Rehman “diesel”. In fact Mr Khan should be named diesel for rocketing prices of the product in his tenure, she said.
Rousing reception
On the occasion, Leader of the Opposition in Punjab Assembly Hamza Shehbaz said the PML-N had faced “brutal political victimisation” throughout its history, but it did not see towards the umpire’s finger and relied only on public support. 
And that’s the reason, he said, the PML-N’s march against the price hike had been given a rousing reception from Lahore to Gujranwala.
Asked whether the PML-N would offer the Punjab chief minister’s slot to a coalition partner of the PTI government, Mr Hamza said: “Seats don’t matter when it comes to saving the country.”

2,"Rescued from ‘black hole’, Harnai miners cherish their miraculous survival",As many as 444 miners have died in accidents across Balochistan over the last few years.,"

HARNAI: Miners and rescuers gather in Tor Ghar.—Dawn

 
QUETTA: “No doubt our survival is a miracle since we had plunged 1,300 feet deep and went without food and water for five days. Allah has indeed given us a fresh lease of life,” says Muhammad Omer, a coal miner in his 30s. 
He was admitted to Quetta’s Civil Hospital after being rescued from a collapsed mine, along with five of his co-workers. 
The six were trapped inside the mine in Tor Ghar area of Harnai district on March 22 after a methane gas blast. Three workers were rescued within 24 hours while the three others remained trapped at a forbidding depth of 1300 feet for five days.
After the powerful blast, the only way out choked up as the owner had not felt the need for an emergency exit. 
“We were stuck in a black hole where nothing was visible. The mouth of the mine got blocked. We had nothing to eat and drink. 
“I don’t know how we were able to breathe,” Muhammad said, trying to hold back tears of joy.  
“Every moment was pushing us towards death, but Allah decided to give us more time, enabling rescue teams to reach us. They managed to take us out from the black hole alive.”
The condition of one of the rescued miners is critical. He is facing difficulty breathing. “He will be stable soon as he is under constant watch,” Dr Wasim Baig, spokesman for the hospital, told Dawn.
The Chief Inspector of Mines, Abdul Ghani Mashwani,  said rescue teams faced difficulties due to the presence of poisonous methane gas.
“Through a pipe, we had arra­nged oxygen for them through an alternative way,” he said. 
Four teams spent days and nights to make sure the miners got out alive. 
Repeated calls to the owner of the mine for obtaining his version went unanswered.
It was the second accident at this particular mine over the last three years. “In 2019 the mine closed after a methane gas blast, claiming several lives,” Syed Zafar Bukhari, the provincial secretary for mines, told Dawn. 
He said the owner restarted work in the mine after acquittal from the court.
Balochistan is rich in mineral resources like oil and gas, gold, silver, copper, iron, marble, chromite coal. 
Coal mining started in the province before Partition. Some of the largest coal fields are in Quetta, Mach, Marwar, Harnai and Loralai. 
The history of tragedies is also very old. Gas explosions are frequent as neither the authorities nor owners care two hoots about the workers’ safety.
In 2011, at least 43 miners were killed in a PMDC-owned facility in Sorrange after the Pakistan Mineral Development Cor­poration carried out a blast at a depth of 4,500 feet to extract coal. 
“The use of explosives is not allowed in coal mines,” Sultan Muhammad, secretary general of the Central Mines Labour Federation, said. 
Over 400 workers and engineers were killed in 1892 in Khost Zardalo area of Harnai when the East India Company ordered a blast in a mine. 
The son of Mr Penmen, a senior official of the East India Company, also died in the blast.
According to Syed Zafar Bukhari, the provincial secretary, it is mandatory to check the presence of methane in a mine before allowing workers to enter it for extracting coal. But the owners do not implement safety measures.
He said most accidents occurred due to accumulation of methane gas inside mines.
Over 400 deaths
As many as 444 miners have died in accidents across Balochistan over the last few years.
“Over the last three months alone, 39 miners lost their lives,” Sultan Muhammad, the mine workers federation secretary general, said. 
He alleged that most of the mines were being run illegally, but the authorities do not close them “thanks to corruption”. 
Sultan alleged that most of the contractors neither build escape routes nor do they provide ventilator systems.
Officials put the numbers of coal mines around 1,600 while unofficial sources claim the number of legal and illegal coal mines is over 20,000 in the province.
According to the secretary, mines and mineral development, lease for only 160 mine leases were granted in the province. He conceded the existence of illegal mines as owners use their political clout.

3,Alyani urges Bizenjo-led Balochistan govt to improve performance,Says the BAP will soon make a decision about the no-trust move against the prime minister.,"QUETTA: Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) president and former chief minister Jam Kamal Khan Alyani has advised the Balochistan’s coalition government headed by Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo to take measures for improving governance in the province, claiming that it was not satisfactory.
Speaking to the media here on Sunday, he said the party would soon take its decision about the no-trust motion moved by the opposition against Prime Minister Imran Khan.
BAP leader Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi said that the party would take its decision on the no-confidence mo­tion against the prime minister after keeping all aspects into consideration. BAP’s parliamentary leader Nawabzada Mir Khalid Khan Magsi is in contact with everyone in Islamabad regarding this issue, he added.
Mr Alyani held the federal government responsible for his ouster from power, saying that if the Centre had addressed things correctly six months ago, BAP would have stood with it as a strong ally.
Referring to the removal of Mr Buledi from the Balochistan cabinet, he said the party leadership would take up this issue with CM Bizenjo. 
He said the provincial government should take the BAP leadership into confidence on all issues. “I personally have no grievances with CM Bizenjo and the cabinet,” the former chief minister added.
Mr Alyani was of the opinion that it was the BAP government and not of any individual. The party leadership should be taken on board on all issues, he added.
“The provincial government should take things seriously, ensure its presence in Quetta, listen to problems of the people and focus on development,” he said.
The former chief minister raised questions of many decisions of the Bizenjo-led provincial government, saying that it should pay attention to the problems of the people.

4,"Pakistan, Iran discuss border fencing",Officials review details of mapping surveys in high-level meeting.,"CHAGAI: Civilian and security officials from Pakistan and Iran discussed border mapping on Saturday during a follow-up meeting that came after Pakistan’s surveyor general visited the neighbouring country earlier this month. 
Official sources privy to the meeting told Dawn on Sunday that a two-point agenda came under discussion during the meeting, attended by a six-member Iranian delegation headed by the country’s director general of border affairs. 
The eight-member Pakistani delegation comprised officials from the army, Frontier Corps, the Survey of Pakistan mapping agency and Chagai Deputy Commissioner Mansoor Ahmed Baloch. 
The follow-up meeting was held in Taftan, a town near the two countries’ border in Chagai district. 

Officials review details of mapping surveys in a high-level meeting 

A high-ranking officer, who attended the meeting and did not want to be named, told Dawn that the discussion was aimed at successfully completing fencing along the border. 
The participants noted that a few border pillars disappeared in some parts and the issue needed to be identified and validated for fencing. “It should be clear that there’s no dispute on border fencing between Iran and Pakistan. In fact, the Iranian authorities welcomed border fencing while terming it a significant step to ensure security on both sides,” he said.  
The details of previous joint surveys were presented in the meeting and the clarification of technical aspects of conduct modalities were discussed in detail. 
It was agreed that aerial and ground mark of border pillars would be carried out to make detailed maps of the border zone. A four-kilometre strip — two kilometres on each side — would be mapped as per the protocol. 
The officials also agreed that the 909-kilometre Pak-Iran border would be divided into four sections and each side would map two sections, with monitoring from both countries. It was also decided that each side would prepare a detailed plan and get it approved from their higher authorities concerned. 
Meanwhile, Chagai’s deputy commissioner informed his Iranian counterpart about the problems being faced by local residents due to prolonged closure of Rahdari Gate from the Iranian side. Deputy Commissioner Baloch told Dawn that the gate was the only way for people who visit their relatives after getting a 15-day special permission to travel a limited area of both countries.

6,NCOC marks two years of its successful fight against Covid-19,"Earlier this month, SAPM Dr Faisal Sultan had said that the govt had started deliberations to close the NCOC.","ISLAMABAD: The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Sunday marked two years of its establishment and celebrated its achievements to control the spread of Covid-19 in the country. 
The NCOC used social media to make this announcement. 

 





 
Earlier this month, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Health Dr Faisal Sultan said that the government had started deliberations to finally close the NCOC. He said the responsibility to deal with the Covid-19 related data would be passed on to the National Institute of Health’s Centres for Disease Control (CDC). 
The NCOC was established on March 27, 2020. It has a major role to keep the nation updated on the Covid-19 related figures. The NCOC holds daily meetings, which are attended by Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar, SAPM on Health Dr Faisal Sultan and National Coordinator Major General Muhammad Zafar Iqbal. Moreover, it has representation of all the provinces and administrative units. 
The NCOC data is shared after every eight hours and updated at least once in a day. 
A senior officer of the Ministry of National Health Services, requesting not to be quoted, said that through its free media campaigns the NCOC saved around Rs50 billion of the national exchequer. He further said that the NCOC ran 40 campaigns and its efforts were appreciated by Bill Gates, World Health Organisation (WHO) and a number of other organisations. 
Meanwhile, the data of the NCOC showed that as many as 310 infections and five deaths by Covid-19 were reported in the country in the past 24 hours. The national positivity rate of Covid-19 was 0.96 per cent. The number of patients on critical care was 428. 
On Saturday, Dr Sultan announced that 75pc vaccine eligible population (age 12 years and over) has been fully vaccinated. 
The coronavirus strain behind Covid-19 was first detected in China in December 2019 and then started spreading to other countries. After many Covid-19 cases were in neighbouring countries, Pakistan closed its borders and took a number of steps to stop the transmission. The first case of Covid-19 was reported in the country in the last week of February, 2020.  
On March 13, the first meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC), composed of the top civil and military leadership, was held to discuss the crisis which was later declared a pandemic by WHO.  
Prime Minister Imran Khan chaired a meeting of the NSC and directed the authorities concerned to devise a comprehensive strategy to prevent the spread of the disease. However, lockdown in the country was announced on March 16, 2020, and many businesses, including construction industry, educational institutions, restaurants, marriage halls, were closed. Since the start of the pandemic, Pakistan has witnessed its five waves.
