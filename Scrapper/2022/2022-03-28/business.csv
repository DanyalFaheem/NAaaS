0,Is internet access a basic human right?,"""Digital Pakistan relies heavily on the access to mobile broadband across the country,"" says Ericsson-Pakistan’s country manager.","

Aamir Ahsan Khan Country Manager, Ericsson-Pakistan

 
Ericsson-Pakistan’s country manager Aamir Ahsan Khan is one of those persons who strongly believe that “limitless connectivity” for everyone can change lives for the better, redefine businesses and pioneer a sustainable future.
“I think connectivity should be treated as a basic need to bridge the existing digital divide across social, economic, gender and regional lines,” he argues in an interview with Dawn. “Connectivity and technology must be used as enablers. Digital Pakistan relies heavily on the access to mobile broadband across Pakistan, from villages to cities alike.”
Pakistan has come a long way since the establishment of the Pakistan Posts & Telegraph Department in 1949, which, he says, laid the foundation for the nation’s focus on connectivity to bridge society and business. In recent years, Pakistan has seen a dramatic increase in mobile broadband penetration and strong growth driven by further adoption of 4G and eventually 5G services is predicted.
According to a recent report, Unlocking Pakistan’s Digital Potential, Pakistan’s digital transformation can help it unlock up to Rs9.7 trillion in annual economic value by 2030 or equivalent to about 19 per cent of the country’s GDP in 2020.

The policy focus should be more on providing the right speed to our consumers and the right amount of spectrum to our operators to serve the growing demand

With the government working on a new policy to roll out 5G telecommunication technology sooner than later, the question is: Is Pakistan ready for this as consumers face serious challenges of inadequate quality and slowing mobile internet speed because of the congested networks of the mobile operators who are starved for spectrum to improve their service quality?
Mr Khan says the Covid pandemic has forced us to move forward towards the digitisation of the economy. There has been tremendous growth in digital banking and e-commerce has thrived in the last two years. 
“Pakistan has actually benefitted whenever it has moved forward in technology. On 5G telecommunication technology readiness, there are two opinions: one, the country should wait for the right time before getting ready and updating technology; the other is that first, we update technology and then convert our ecosystem onto it,” Mr Khan says. 
“When we deployed 3G/4G telecommunication technology in 2014, we were thrilled to see e-commerce develop in Pakistan in conjunction with the app economy and online businesses. With a young and vibrant population, mobile users in Pakistan have immediately proven to be tech-savvy with demand for data services doubling in traffic each year.
“In my view, the policy focus should be more on providing right speed to our consumers and the right amount of spectrum to our operators to serve growing demand. The government is working on a policy to introduce 5G technology, but it must also work on freeing up 4G frequency simultaneously for mobile telecommunication operators.”
He thinks that we need to assess the needs of our country based on our use-cases while making a decision. “For example, we should know if our agriculture and industry can be served with 4G, or do we need to update our technology to 5G or a combination of both before moving ahead.”
In Pakistan, Ericsson is in a ‘managed services business’, working for three mobile telecommunication operators — Jazz, Zong and Telenor. Besides, it offers IT managed services and mobile financial services platforms, as well as supplies microwave equipment for radio transmission.
The Swedish technology giant has recently injected equity of $31 million in its Pakistan operations as part of its long-term commitment to the country.
“We are expanding our footprints in Pakistan and expanding our operations from here to other regions,” Mr Khan points out.
Like most, Mr Khan knows that in spite of advancements in recent years, Pakistan still has scope for spectrum development.
“Spectrum in the telecoms business is like a highway, more spectrum is like a broader highway which can support better mobile broadband speeds and network quality,” he explains. 
Mr Khan believes that the increase in mobile broadband is directly linked to an increase in GDP. “Our analysis shows that a 10pc increase in mobile broadband access raises GDP by 1-1.25pc. In the case of markets like Pakistan, the ratio is 1.85pc. Looking at the long-term benefit on GDP rather than the short term gain from license fees has been proven to be a much better strategy.”
While 5G can solve several issues in the long run, he adds, “we should also look at alternative spectrum solutions simultaneously.” According to him, Ericsson has the capabilities to support operators monetising into new revenue streams. “Moreover, we must think about increasing fiberisation. Our 5G readiness and ecosystem development are dependent upon fiberisation. However, now the latest microwave offerings are also sufficient to cater for 90pc of the demands of 4G/5G networks.”
To a question on IT education quality in Pakistan, he says companies should offer training programmes, invest time and energy for developing quality human potential. “The gap between the industry and academia must be bridged to address the challenge of employability of IT graduates. Companies should encourage their trained graduates as they are our society and country’s future.”

1,Risks of volatile oil market,Unfortunately the workings of the recent petroleum price cut were based on $85-95 per barrel oil and exchange rate at Rs178.,"Prime Minister Imran Khan’s relief package on petroleum products and electricity has come at the most difficult moment. Amid volatile international supplies and prices, its financing is getting tough, the budgetary hole is widening and suppliers are struggling to secure diesel when harvest is at its peak, not only in Pakistan but across many countries — from Vietnam to India and from Indonesia to Bangladesh.
The supply situation is worsened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the US-directed gas and oil supply adjustments by European countries. Thriving on windfall profits, the producers are least bothered to increase production, leaving the oil market to fund managers and hedge funds to make a killing on the paper market. Europe is ready to pay anything with its deep pockets for whatever is available in the Middle East to make up for the Russian oil and gas replacement.
That leaves smaller importers like Pakistan at the mercy of speculative market players and exponential premiums. This is making the domestic oil industry nervous at a time when it was already suffering from financial challenges. Imagine that the market leader and state-run Pakistan State Oil (PSO) is sitting on a heap of almost Rs500 billion receivables and yet it has to go an extra mile to scale up imports beyond its normal responsibility. 

Unfortunately the workings of the recent petroleum price cut were based on $85-95 per barrel oil and exchange rate at Rs178. The situation changed as prices went beyond $120 and the exchange rate over Rs180

However, the market is getting so unnatural and dirty that even PSO did not get even a single bidder for diesel cargo in the first half of April in the spot market as long term supplier Kuwait Petroleum expressed its inability to provide additional cargo. In the second round, a spot trader came up with a bid for a premium at $10.5 which is a record. The situation with other importers is no better. The next tender may be available even at a higher premium. 
In recent weeks, PSO market share in diesel has increased by 3 per cent to 53pc and that of petrol by another 2pc to 43pc as some private firms appear shunning their supply obligations. In fact, the market share of only four firms — PSO, Shell, Attock Petroleum and Total-Parco Pakistan — has gone up to 84pc from about 77pc early this year. This meant about a 7pc cut in the combined market share of 30 something other oil marketing companies (OMC). But this has a cost.
The question then arises that if the country has to bank on just four companies to meet fuel and strategic goals, what is the economic justification for 35 OMCs and almost the same number of more in the pipeline, notwithstanding unusual conditions. “Are they in the oil market just to operate when everything is hunky-dory and earn windfall profits?” asks a former petroleum secretary advocating mergers and consolidation. 
The prime minister had announced a Rs10 per litre cut in petroleum prices and a price cap for four months amid the rising global trend. This led to the creation of price differential claims (PDCs). Unfortunately though, all these workings were based on $85-95 per barrel and exchange rate at Rs178. The situation changed as prices went beyond $120 and the exchange rate over Rs180.
To its credit, the government has moved swiftly and has already transferred about Rs20bn into a special account of PSO to make payments to OMCs against their PDCs. The OMCs are now filing their PDCs and would pass through the swift and time-bound approval and payment mechanism.
The government had initially approved Rs20bn along with a procedure for payments to OMCs and refineries on account of PDCs to avoid a shortage of petroleum products in the country. However, the Pakistan State Oil (PSO) pointed out that the procedure prepared by the regulator in consultation with ministries of finance and energy and approved by the Economic Coordination Committee was faulty and would result in product shortages. 
It pointed out that PDC was arising on account of the sale of petroleum products while the reimbursement mechanism was based on the procurement of petroleum products. “OMCs will be at a loss if PDC reimbursement is based on procurement rather than sales and private OMCs may shy away from the market and stop selling products in the market,” PSO pointed out. 
It highlighted that consumers would only benefit from the PDC or discount on petroleum items when the product is sold by OMCs and “mere procurement will not be sufficient” as companies would tend to hold back sales to earn inventory gains in times of price increase and not to procure in times of price decline — thus leading to a shortage during peak harvesting season.
PDC at the rate of Rs2.28 per litre on the sale of diesel was calculated on February 28 when crude price stood around $100 per barrel but later increased to Rs25 and Rs32 per litre for petrol and diesel respectively as the Arabian crude price increased to $118 per barrel. The amount of PDC thus increased to Rs31.73bn including Rs2.6bn of outstanding PDC of November 1-4. Therefore, another Rs11.73bn has been approved.
On the other hand, the five refineries had stuck up amounts of about Rs23bn on account of outstanding unadjusted input sales tax. The oil industry on a whole has been facing working capital challenges because of large defaults of major OMCs and the resultant reluctance of the banks to increase their credit lines in line with higher international oil prices. 
Diesel stocks at present are at a reasonable level of 20-27 days cover. Supplies already line up apparently indicate no shortage issues until mid-May. Like LNG import defaults, the key concern for diesel, however, also remains in case of a default by any supplier to go for higher premiums being offered by bigger importers like European clients.

2,Behind the rupee’s humiliation,"Unless export of workforce rises again to half a million a year, constantly high growth in remittances cannot be guaranteed.","In the last two weeks, (between March 11 and March 25), the rupee lost more than 1.8 per cent value against the US dollar in the interbank market. During these two weeks, the local currency crossed the psychological barriers of 180 and 181 to a dollar for the first time. It finally settled closed at 181.78 per US unit on March 25 from 178.51 on March 11.
The central bank watched the rapid decline in the rupee’s value from the sidelines. It did not intervene to stop the slide. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) left the exchange rates to remain market-driven not only as a matter of principle amidst the ongoing International Monetary Fund’s review of Pakistan as part of the process before releasing a new tranche of the loan. It also had not enough forex reserves to quell the dollar’s growing demand pressure originating from external debt servicing, import payments and forex outflows on account of divestment of portfolio funds— from both the debt and equity markets. 

Unless export of workforce rises again to half a million a year, constantly high growth in remittances cannot be guaranteed

Pakistan’s liquid forex reserves held by the SBP, constantly falling since August 2021, touched a new low of $14.962 billion on March 18 from the peak of $20.074bn back in August, according to the central bank’s report released on March 24. Total liquid forex reserves (i.e. the sum of the reserves of SBP and all the commercial banks) stood around $21.44bn on March 18, down from an all-time high of $27.068bn at end-August 2021. 
Nearly $15bn worth of the central bank’s forex reserves is hardly enough to cover one and a half months of merchandise imports, leaving no option for it except to refrain from intervening in the market at times when the rupee begins a new round of slide. In about nine months of 2021-22 (between July 1, 2021, and March 25, 2022), the rupee has lost 15.4pc value against the greenback. At the end of 2020-21, on June 30, the US dollar was worth only Rs157.54.
At the root of the recent rupee’s fall lie both structural and cyclical weakening of the current account (C/A) deficit. Pakistan’s C/A problems are structural because the country is far less competitive in foreign trade than the majority of its main trading partners. It keeps its trade deficit large — often equal to its total export earnings and sometimes even larger. 
And, it is cyclical because the country has been trying to become more competitive in foreign trade and making a series of efforts to support the export sector. But a disturbing aspect of Pakistan’s C/A deficit and consequent decline in the rupee value is that, unlike other countries that have been on this path Pakistan is taking a much longer time in the natural correction of this cyclical exchange rate depreciation. 
Sadly, the country is also progressing far slower than other nations in correcting structural issues of its foreign trade, in particular, and lingering issues of its C/A and balance of payments, in general. 
The PTI government had come into power with tall promises of breaking “the shackles of foreign indebtedness” — the root cause of most external sector and fiscal issues. But it failed to deliver.
Editorial: We are almost back to the point where the previous PML-N set-up had left the economy
The stock of external debt on the Pakistan government alone stood at $64.141bn at the end of June 2018, just two and a half months before PTI came into power. In the next three and a half years, i.e. at the end of December 2021, this stock of debt swelled to $83.9bn, according to the latest SBP stats.
The net addition of $19.759bn worth of the government’s external debt in just three and a half years cannot be overlooked in analysing fiscal and external sector issues. Growing stocks of external debt mean larger external debt servicing and consequent pressure on forex reserves and the rupee’s health. Besides, providing for the external debt servicing in rupee terms leaves little fiscal space for development expenses. 

Pakistan’s liquid forex reserves held by the SBP, constantly falling since August 2021, touched a new low of $14.962 billion on March 18 from the peak of $20.074bn back in August

It is true that the PTI government has addressed structural issues facing the remittances sector and overseas Pakistanis now send back home much larger amounts of remittances ($30bn a year) than in 2018 ($19.6bn). But, on the other hand, the goods’ trade deficit has also become too large at the same time. Back in 2017-18, the trade deficit for the entire year was $37.6bn. Against this, the deficit in just eight months of 2021-22 stood at $31.9bn, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. The full year trade deficit looks set to reach close to $48bn or $4bn per month on average.
A $4bn monthly cannot be compensated with $2.5bn average monthly remittances — even if we presume that the remittances continue. In future, the C/A management will require more serious efforts to accelerate export earnings, decelerate growth in imports of finished goods particularly luxury items. 
And it will also require persistent efforts to ensure double-digit growth in remittances which seems a far cry given the fact that for about the past three years demand for Pakistani workers abroad has been on the decline. In 2019, 625,876 Pakistanis had left abroad for jobs. The number tanked to 225,213 in 2020 before rising to 288,280 in 2021 — partly reflecting the effects of Covid-19 triggered travel bans across the globe. In the Jan-Feb period of 2022, 134,134 Pakistanis have gotten overseas jobs, according to the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment.
Unless export of workforce rises again to half a million a year, constantly high growth in remittances cannot be guaranteed. But is that possible? Only time will tell.

3,Volatility of prices amid uncertain crop size,"This season, wheat procurement in Punjab, which starts next week, is going to be a novel experience for many reasons.","This season, wheat procurement in Punjab, which starts next week, is going to be a novel experience for many reasons. For the first time in procurement history, four different rates of the commodity will be operating in the field. Crop size is uncertain, at least so far, and would force every buyer into a frantic jostling to meet its target first — at the cost of others. 
Last year’s historically highest rate will naturally incentivise farmers, who can afford, to delay the sale for potentially better rates later. This is going to be the context in which fresh wheat trade season opens in Punjab next week.       
As far as rate confusion is concerned, the provincial government can only blame itself — and would pay the cost. Of late, after persisting with a rate of Rs1,950 per maund right till harvesting, it did increase it to Rs2,200; thus robbing itself of possible benefits of better rates leading to better acreage and better yield. So, the official procurement rate is Rs2,200 per maunds. 

Punjab will be selling wheat at Rs1,600 and Rs1,950 per maund in one window and purchasing the same quantity at a rate of Rs2,200 in the next window

However, the government is still releasing official wheat (of last year’s procurement) at the rate of Rs1,950 per maund: it would be selling at Rs1,950 per maund and purchasing the quantity at the rate of Rs2,200 at the same time — thus keeping a window ajar for those who can manage sale-purchase, without commodity actually changing hands, to mint a windfall.  
Things do not stop here. The Punjab government has introduced yet another, even lower, rate under the Ramazan package and is providing some 150,000 tonnes at the rate of Rs1,600 per maunds, and rigging the market further.
Practically speaking, Punjab would be selling wheat at Rs1,600 and Rs1,950 per maund in one window and purchasing the same quantity at a rate of Rs2,200 in the next window. Given the capacity of the provincial government to keep these different rate streams going in separate ways, their overlapping is a distinct possibility, even probability. A fourth rate of Rs2,400 per maund is operating in the open market as well.  
The same rates are reflected in the staple market — incentivising convergence of different rate streams into the higher slab at the cost of the common man. Flour from the officially released wheat is selling at Rs55 per kilogramme — Rs550 per 10kg bag. Flour made of Ramazan package would be selling in the market at a rate of Rs45 per kilogram (Rs450 per 10Kg). The millers are selling 15kg packing, made of open market wheat at the rate of Rs70 to Rs73 per kilogramme — from Rs1,050 to Rs1,100 for different brands. 
Under these market realities, an uncertain crop size is adding to volatility. Punjab started the season with high hopes, unilaterally adding one million tonnes to the federal target of 20.90m tonnes and pledging to yield 21.90m tonnes. Its hopes, however, were dampened when it lost almost 500,000 acres in area — 16.70m acres last year to 16.20 million acres this season. 
Fertiliser was the next shock: its availability dipped at crucial times, price spiralled higher and higher throughout the season and its application suffered. Statistical realities tell the story. The phosphatic fertiliser (DAP), the most essential nutrient, saw its usage sliding by a whopping 40 per cent (2.2m tonnes last season to 1.5m tonnes this season), as its price spiralled out of 90pc (small) farmers’ fiscal reach — from Rs4,500 per bag to over Rs10,000 per bag within a matter of weeks.
Urea took its turn when its price ran to the north and supply to the south. Its price topped Rs2,500 per bag in the middle of the supply crisis. The National Fertiliser Development Centre measured the monthly deficit: 102,000 tonnes (November), 129,000 tonnes (December), 178,000 tonnes (January) and 168,000 tonnes during February. 
During January 2022, nitrogen offtake decreased by 10.5pc as compared to the same period of last year. Phosphate and potash offtake, however, increased by 6.4pc and 16.4pc respectively. 
In a nutshell, lost acreage, unfavourable weather conditions (high temperature), shortage and high prices of fertiliser, irrigation supplies shortage and rust disease prevalence because of conducive weather conditions left a question mark hanging over the crop size. 
Amid fears, the first provincial crop survey rekindled hopes when it measured crop size of 2.50m tonnes (1.4 million tonnes less than the projected 21.9m tonnes) and also said that high temperatures during March have forced the crop to early maturity. Punjab, at one point (during February), was calculating the crop size to be a little less than 19m tonnes. 
The survey came as a relief to the department but also created an emergency of quickly moving for procurement to deal with early maturity. The provincial Food Department immediately set a target of 3.5m tonnes and started dispatching gunny bags to South Punjab, where crop first hits the provincial market. 
The market watchers, however, fear deeper confusion in trade during the next few weeks. They blame various wheat rates for causing confusion and corruption, leading to hoarding and the government resorting to administrative measures to get to its target. 
Should that happen, as early clues point out — the food department has cast deputy commissioners in charge of the campaign in their respective districts — the millers would be waiting for their turn. If the millers are unable to purchase between 1.5m to 2m tonnes, the departmental stocks would have to supplement them. 
However, if last year’s highest-ever rates become an incentive for hoarders and farmers to hold back wheat, everyone would be in trouble. Meanwhile, the common man, already reeling under high inflation and killer rates of the staple is holding his breath, waiting to see what next season would mean for it.

4,Cutting off your nose to spite your face,Exporting to Pakistan impacts Indian economy much less than importing from India ...,"There is a mix of patriotism and pragmatism when talking to businessmen and traders about normalising trade ties with India. 
“China has become expensive because of the imposition of the environmental protection law in every factory,” says one small trader. “It is better to route through third parties such as Dubai, Malaysia, Hong Kong and purchase from India than directly through China.”
His responses regarding imports are mixed, tempered with a fervent hatred of the neighbouring country which he refers to as the dushman mulk.
“Informal imports from India have decreased. People prefer non-Indian products unless the margins justify it. Do you think American goods are not available in Iran despite the sanctions? But importers act in fear of whistleblowers as there is an incentive for competitors in the market to rat out their rivals. Big companies, such as multinationals, have shifted away from Indian raw materials because they need official channels rather than risk losing their containers,” he says.

Exporting to Pakistan impacts Indian economy much less than importing from India benefits Pakistan ­— even if it is a hard pill, it has to be swallowed

Another trader compares Dubai to a world market. “It is very hard to prove who is importing from where. People import from all over the world, change the labels and the tags and sell to Pakistan. Who is to say what comes from where,” he says adding that Israeli goods are available in the local market as well.
The real beneficiaries, it seems, are the customs officials. “There are checks at customs to determine the country of origin through documents — this has resulted in an increase in bribes to customs officials,” says the importer, stating as a fact that containers cannot be accessed by importers without underhand dealings, regardless of the country of origin.
However, politics and history do not allow for formal trade, especially currently.
“The government is so unstable that I don’t think anything can happen right away. Opposition parties, PML and PPP, have always been in favour of Pakistan-India trade so I expect this to be one of their priority items: normalising trade with India,” says Dr Manzoor Ahmed, a former ambassador to the World Trade Organisation.
“Trade is already taking place, why increase its cost — don’t see it as benefiting India, view it as benefitting Pakistan,” he said. In a recent article, he had explained that extra costs include those of repacking, stuffing and de-stuffing, port charges and preparing new bills of lading and expenses for the intermediaries.
“We are short of cotton,” says Chairman Businessmen Group and former president of Karachi Chambers of Commerce & Industry, Zubair Motiwala. “Previously, we used to import from the Wagah border and it was just like importing from Sialkot or Lahore to Karachi. For Punjab it was next door, even inventory was not required.”
“So many raw materials are sourced from India. Even after the ban, we had to ultimately allow pharmaceutical raw materials. We are unnecessarily paying more at a time when the cost of logistics is already at an all-time high. A vessel that was $1,500 per container is now at $7,000. Not trading with India is hurting Pakistan’s economy,” he laments.
Exports are on an upward trend. If Pakistan aims for lofty goals such as the doubling of textile exports over the next three years, it will need to procure an adequate amount of raw materials. And India is a source of cotton and chemicals that are used in value-added processes.
“Food inflation has always been controlled through the Wagah border,” adds Dr Ahmed. “Not to mention, we have a surplus crop of potatoes – nine million tonnes instead of the about 5m tonnes we require. In the past we could export the surplus to India.”
Notwithstanding statements by Mian Muhammad Mansha and Advisor to PM on commerce Abdul Razak Dawood, the facts are as follows: 1) Pakistan imports from India continue through third-party countries, though it is hard to estimate the scale of informal trade. 2) Politics supersede economic sense
India’s exports are more than 10 times Pakistan’s exports. Exporting to Pakistan impacts its economy much less than importing from India benefits Pakistan, as a hard a pill as it is, has to be swallowed. And yet, the rhetoric on the ground forbids pressure on the foreign exchange and food inflation to decrease.

5,Social sector lag a cog in sustainable growth,The social sector approach of growth policy hinges on human development and human welfare.,"It is widely recognised that developed social infrastructure is the key to reaching a high level of sustainable growth but the sector has often not been either accorded the right priority or suffers from faulty programme design, or ineffective implementation, or in some cases it is a combination of all of these factors. 
The social sector approach of growth policy hinges on human development and human welfare.
The issue of social sector development in Pakistan has cropped up in the seventh review under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) credit facility following a sharp cut in federal development spending. The IMF mission is seeking assurance from Pakistan that the sector would remain untouched by the cut in the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP). Towards that end, it has sought precise project details that would be affected by the cut.
The Fund staff has also expressed its concern that economic growth may be affected due to slashing of PSDP by one third or Rs300 billion from the budgeted Rs900bn to Rs600bn.

The State Bank’s first quarterly report for 2021-22 notes that the reversal in the movement of the labour force from the industrial sector to the agriculture sector ought to be a concern of policymakers

Dr Pervez Hoodbhoy says Pakistan’s economic weaknesses stem from, among other major factors, a hopelessly under-skilled workforce. That’s why he adds, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor’s (CPEC) new infrastructure led to insignificant industrialisation. Pakistan has the world’s second-highest number (22 million) of out-of-school children and has always underspent on education, says another noted analyst.
No less worrying is the emerging trend of the declining share of value-added production in total national output as pointed out by the State Bank’s first quarterly report for 2021-22. It notes that the reversal in the movement of the labour force from the industrial sector to agriculture sector ought to be a concern of policymakers. “From an economic standpoint, value-added per person is predominantly higher in the non-agriculture sector than in the agriculture sector in developing countries.”
According to the Labour Force Survey of 2018-19, employment in the agriculture sector rose from 38.5pc in 2017-18 to 39.2pc of the total employed labour force in 2018-19. Simultaneously, employment in manufacturing dropped from 16.1pc to 15pc and industry as a whole from 23.7pc to 23pc but it remained constant at 37.8pc in the service sector. Employment, however, improved from 7.6pc to 8pc in the construction industry.
Since then these variable adverse trends have largely been strengthened. For example, in the past three months, construction activity has slowed down mainly due to a steep surge in the cost of construction material. The demand for steel has dropped by 20-25pc.
Much of the responsibility of social sector development lies with the provinces which are required to produce more budget surpluses to help the federation achieve the annual consolidated fiscal deficit target. And the process for evolving more meaningful horizontal distribution of resources for the development of economically backward regions has been frozen by the deadlock at the National Finance Commission.  
It may be recalled that financial globalisation had set in a process of de-industrialisation resulting in stagnant exports and rising imports in many countries including Pakistan while burdening them with enormous foreign debts. More than 80 per cent of the new global debts burden came in 2021 from emerging markets, where total debt is approaching $100 trillion, said the Institute of International Finance’s annual global debt monitor report released on February 23. The PTI government has not been able to walk the talk on industrial growth.
The lack of the required level of social sector and physical infrastructure development is stifling the rapid and balanced industrial development due to which risks to economic growth are mounting from both domestic and external factors. No doubt the growth of large scale manufacturing industries’ output, primarily from existing capacity, has increased by 7.6pc in July-January 2021-22 compared to the previous fiscal year. 
And the current account deficit also shrank by 78.46pc in February to $545m from a whopping $2.531bn in January mainly due to a sharp decrease in imports in January and February. It has not stopped the free fall of the rupee contributing significantly to high imported inflation. 
Coming back to the issue of social sector development our policymakers may look at what the Chinese are doing. On March 6, Premier Li Keqiang said China is firmly committed to sustained and sound economic and social development. The key tasks in the Government Work Report made public on March 19 says protective measures would be made to boost domestic demand, unlock consumption potential and increase effective investment. A stable supply of affordable electricity and coal will be ensured. The Chinese government will make every effort to ensure and improve people’s livelihood.
We may learn from the Indian experience where inclusive growth has been a priority since the country’s independence. A study titled ‘Has social sector development catalysed inclusiveness of India’s economic growth?’ during the period from 1985-6 to 2015-16 is an eye-opener. The research found that two of the three components, — expenditure incurred on the welfare of underprivileged classes and expenditure on rural development show negative relation with inclusiveness. The third component is the expenditure incurred on social security and welfare.
And the probable reasons identified for the existing state of affairs in India are leakages in the process of cash disbursement, corruption, lack of proper management and effective monitoring and shortcomings in the implementation of the schemes. More puzzling is the lack of public awareness of the programmes.
Remedies suggested by the authors of the report include modifying programme design, expanding the community base with strong community participation, undertaking social mobilisation through advocacy and reinforcing information and communication to promote awareness. The whole ground of the policy framework must be clearly monitored for effective implementation.

6,Policies vs packages,Think of policy as a framework similar to that of a cricket match...,"Cost-benefit studies at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) concerning subsidy and relief packages reforms tend to show that these reforms rarely have a rational economic justification, either in terms of economic efficiency or in terms of equity. But rationality all too often does not determine policy. 
There exist two extremes of the management of self-interest within any society. The first is the idealised competitive market model of Adam Smith in which self-interest produces a globally efficient outcome. The second is war, where individuals and groups compete violently for their share of the resource base of the economy. 
Whereas the competitive market is productive, war is totally unproductive since it destroys wealth and creates none. In between these extremes lies various mixtures of productive and unproductive activity. 
As noted above, unproductive activity emerges from “rent-seeking”, that is, the process of using time, effort and resources to secure a bigger share of the resource base for the rent-seeking individual or group.

Think of policy as a framework similar to that of a cricket match — it never changes during play or even every few games but only after much data and evidence

Subsidies are effectively rents and thus attract rent-seekers who create a “special interest state”. To tackle subsidies effectively, it is argued, one has to tackle rent-seeking behaviour. But according to some, one can never destroy rent-seeking since it is rooted in human self-interest, a motivation that is genetically powerful and unlikely to be changed dramatically. 
The response to this gloomy view is that rent-seeking is indeed highly unlikely to go away. But rent-seekers have to have rents to capture, and if the rents are not there they will be thwarted in their aims. The classic means, in view of PIDE, is dissipating rents is to liberalise markets so that they become competitive, thus reducing rents. Further, research by PIDE argues that the social packages often result in continuous dependency in long term and thus an economy remains uncompetitive and needs relief for survival. 
Against this, if the rents accrue to those in power, as is all too often the case, then government itself has no incentive to dissipate rents. Rents and rent-seeking become perpetual, and this, no doubt, explains why so many corrupt societies survive.  
The answer then appears to lie in much grander realms, namely the whole process of generating participatory democracy such that (a) governments substitute some criterion of social welfare maximisation as their goal, and (b) those previously excluded from rent capture secure a “voice” to counterbalance those who remain dedicated to capturing rent: rent dissipation through countervailing power.
Ultimately, then, whatever the specific policies for subsidy reform, they are unlikely to work unless the much broader conditions of participatory democracy are in place.
The policy is all about choices and trade-offs. For instance, a choice can be made between announcing subsidies/packages and providing a better business environment. Subsidies and relief packages have certain short term advantages but on the other hand, a better business environment can create employment opportunities. 
Thus a trade-off involved is short term consumption smoothing/benefits versus the opportunity to make society capable of surviving on its own. From every aspect, a competitive society is highly desirable as compared to a society relying heavily on special treatments. Another aspect of a policy, according to Dr Nadeem Ul Haque, is that a policy must be clear, learning all the time and slow to change. It should be learning and evolutionary.
PIDE emphasises that policymakers, must not keep on changing policies and rules over and over again. Dr Haque in his tweet depicted policy as a framework that sets up a cricket match. It never changes during play or even every few games policy changes are slow to come after much data and evidence.
To shed light on the role of the government in an economy, PIDE has conducted research and many webinars. In the view of PIDE, the role of a government is to provide the policy to consumers, investors and producers to operate in. It sets the rules, the legal framework, the basis for government monitoring, providing maximum room for economic actors to act and shape the economy as they will. 
A study by PIDE showed a concerning level of government involvement of around 67 per cent in the economy. The ever-increasing involvement of the government in the market suffocates the business environment, space for private investment and productive activities. 
The need of the time is to bring rationality and economic justification to every policy and reform. The choices must be clear and priorities should be set straight. The subsidies and reliefs given to any segment of the economy must be abolished.
However, the government may choose to gradually eliminate special treatments or involvement within the economy. The gradual route has several advantages: the beneficiaries have time to adjust and “death by a thousand cuts” is usually preferred to sudden shocks. In such a way a competitive environment can be achieved that is based on self-reliance, sustainability and maximum participation of private economic agents in productive activities.

7,Data points,Trust is earned,"Trust is earned
If you’re a new manager, here’s a gentle reminder: people are hired because they are experts in their field or show potential to do great work. This doesn’t mean you hand over your team member a laptop on day one and then become the absent manager. It means that, once you’ve laid out your expectations for a project, you’re not looking over their shoulder to make sure it’s actually getting done. You should trust that they have the competency to do the work and that you can rely on them. You (or your predecessor) hired them for a reason. Trust them to do their job, and in doing so, you’ll instil confidence and build mutual respect. They will feel comfortable coming to you when things go wrong or they need your help.

Pakistan’s energy mix
The world’s energy mix is dominated by fossil fuels, particularly oil (33pc), coal (24pc) and natural gas (27pc), despite the increasing need to shift towards cleaner fuels for environmental safety and depleting world oil reserves. Pakistan’s energy mix is diversified in comparison to the global mix of fuels. Though fossil fuels dominate Pakistan’s mix as well, it consists of a fair share of hydel energy (8pc). Moreover, Pakistan has lately been relying on imported LNG for meeting its energy demand whose share has increased to a prominent 11pc in the total fuel mix of the country. Energy is the engine of all Sectors of the economy. Its consumption needs are directly related to the GDP growth of a country. Pakistan’s GDP contracted by approximately 0.4pc in 2019-20, owing to the unprecedented outbreak of the pandemic (about 1.2pc growth in 2018-19). The country’s primary energy supplies (forms of energy converted to final energy) comprise oil, gas, coal, nuclear electricity and hydroelectricity 
net generation, while final energy products (converted from primary energy supplies) consist of gasoline, diesel, purified coal, purified gas, electricity and mechanical energy.

12,Reko Diq — dealing against a tight deadline,"""It would be stupid to expect global mining giants to write off fines because of the goodness of their hearts,"" legal expert says.","AVOIDING the mistakes made earlier, the government will hopefully set its priorities right in the context of the Reko Diq project. Before sealing the deal with Barrick Gold, the world second biggest precious metals company, it seems prudent to first have on board the most credible guarantors, the people of Balochistan, through their representatives in national and provincial assemblies and their designated group of technical and legal experts.
Responding to a Dawn query in this regard, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin said: “The draft of the framework agreement was shared with all the relevant stakeholders. Moreover, the deal with Barrick Gold will only be sealed after clearance from the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the national and Balochistan assemblies.”
Defending the decision, which some experts found hasty, he said: “We had to sign the framework because Tethyan Copper Company [a joint venture company of Barrick Gold and Antofagasta Minerals] had given us reprieve from courts till March 31.”
Recently, Pakistan reached an out-of-court settlement with two foreign mineral companies to write off their financial claims against the government in exchange for reconstitution of the project for the development of Reko Diq mines on the basis of an equal partnership. The government claimed it was able to dodge a hefty $11 billion penalty through this negotiated settlement. 

The out-of-court settlement is good news for the country, but the govt’s hand might have been a bit forced by the March 31 time bar

The federal and Balochistan governments and two companies, Antofagasta PLC and Barrick Gold Corporation, earlier this month agreed on a framework to revive Reko Diq project and a pathway for the exit of one firm. Antofagasta consented to withdraw all claims and move away if Pakistan initiates the payment process of $900 million before the turn of the current month against the court award of $3.7bn. 
An informed source in Islamabad active in mining circles told Dawn that Pakistan has pledged to divert the signing bonus of $900m with Barrick Gold for the mining deal to Antofagasta to ease it out.
This piece of information was indirectly confirmed by the finance minister while answering the query on the motivation, haste and timing of the deal in the midst of the ongoing political turmoil. 
“We had reasons to do it now, and it was not to appease anyone. By March 31, we were obligated to open a conditional standby letter of credit (SBLC) in favour of Antofagasta for $900m. Funds will now be released once the legalisation process is complete,” Mr Tarin said. 
Further details of the deal have yet to surface, but, according to the available information, the federal and Balochistan governments will collectively hold a 50 per cent stake in the project and Barrick Gold will keep the other half. The federal government will pool in $1bn for 50pc stakes, covering also for Balochistan government for the initial $2bn investment in the project. In addition, the government of Balochistan will get 2pc royalty from the sales proceeds.
On the question of the funding requirement of $1bn, the minister said the group of state-owned enterprises participating in the project would furnish the pledged amount.
The National Party, a mainstream political party of the restive province, instantly opposed the deal, terming it “anti-people and anti-Balochistan”. 
A senior economist, who wished not to be named, said: “you can’t blame the people of Balochistan for having suspicions. This is what happens when you sell wheat to Balochistan at the international price and buy their gas at a fraction of the price you pay to Qatar.”
Continuing, he said government functionaries in the relevant department in Balochistan and in Islamabad know how the TCC in the 2000s tried to buy its way through when challenged for the breach of the Reko Diq contract.
A former commerce secretary conceded that the burden of turning the case upside down, with Pakistan being penalised in international arbitration court, falls on the recklessness of over-confident government functionaries.
A legal expert, who followed the arbitration process from close quarters and have been critical of the government’s lack of capacity to deal with commercial disputes, said the new mining deal ought to be weaker than the earlier one.  “A deal negotiated in desperation can’t possibly be the best,” he argued. 
“The devil is in the details. It would be stupid to expect global mining giants to write off big fines because of the goodness of their hearts. They must have extracted big concessions from Pakistan against guaranteed returns manifold more than what they have decided to forego. The government should make the key deal public for proper scrutiny by legal and technical experts,” he stressed. 
“It’s an old habit of the rulers to bend backwards to accommodate overseas investors. I am keen to find out tax holidays and other concessions rolled out this time round,” he remarked.
“The deal might not be ideal, but, if finalised, it will open many doors for foreign investment in Pakistan. Global investors did take note of the green signal to Barrick in Pakistan. I expect a rush of mining companies if things move ahead smoothly,” said a mineral mining expert though he regretted the exclusion of private Pakistani mining companies from the Reko Diq deal.
“Had the local mining companies given a chance to be part of the project, they could have ensured greater transparency and swift movement of the project. The state-owned enterprises [Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum and Government Holdings Pakistan] have no experience in mineral mining and may falter,” he argued.
The effort to develop mineral reserves in Balochistan, initiated in 1992, did not go much beyond some feasibility reports that confirmed underground riches. The cost of this lingering 30-year exercise, mired in controversies, was steep as it stained the country’s image, cost it heavy in penalties and blunted the thrust towards developing the vast mineral sector for the benefit of the most impoverished people in the richest province of the country. 
PS: All attempts to reach Barrick Gold executives for a comment did not succeed.
