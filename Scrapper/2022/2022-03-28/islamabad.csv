0,JUI-F issued another show-cause notice,Islamabad admin says a case will be registered against the organisers for violating the terms and conditions of the NOC.,"ISLAMABAD: The capital administration issued another show-cause notice to the organisers of the JUI-F public gathering, informing them that a case would be registered against them over violation of terms and conditions of the NOC. 
However, the capital administration issued a conditional NOC to the PML-N for a public gathering on March 28 in H-9 in response to a request from the party’s Islamabad chapter President Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry submitted on March 24.
The officials said it was the second show-cause notice to the organisers of the gathering. 
The first notice was served on them on March 24 over violation of the terms and conditions of the NOC by setting up stage on Srinagar Highway and blocking the road.
The notice was issued from the office of the deputy commissioner, Hamza Shafqaat, to the emir of JUI-F Islamabad Maulana Abdul Majeed Hazarvi and secretary general Mufti Abdullah.
In reply to the notice on Mach 25, Mufti Abdullah assured the administration that Srinagar Highway would not be blocked, the show cause notice said, adding that the Islamabad High Court had also directed that the state, through the district magistrate and law enforcement agencies, would ensure compliance of the conditional permissions/NOC and proceed against violators as per law.
The organisers have clearly violated the terms and conditions of the NOC by holding a rally on March 27, and have announced that they will continue it for an indefinite time, the notice said.
It said the organisers have parked vehicles on Srinagar Highway which were causing hindrance to traffic.
“Hence, you are being served this notice to show cause and to remedy your action otherwise FIR shall be registered against you and NOC to hold further rallies shall not be issued in violation of terms and conditions of existing NOC,” the show-cause notice said, adding that “your reply to this show cause must reach this office within 24 hours.”
The officials said the organisers had violated the terms and conditions twice.

1,PTI supporters believe Imran being victimised for independent foreign policy,"""Though this public gathering is historic, there is no outcome,"" says one participant.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI)’s Sunday public gathering attracted a large number of middle and lower middle class people who were of the view that Prime Minister Imran Khan was being victimised for upholding Islamic values and for his independent foreign policy. 
The participants at the public gathering titled Amr Bil Maroof (enjoin the good), seemed impressed by some of the decisions and action of Imran Khan related to religion. 
However, the public gathering could not attract much participation of the elite class, youngsters and women which was seen in the party’s sit-in in 2014. 
“We are very impressed by his [PM] bold stance against Islamophobia and America and western countries. Imran Khan arranged two OIC meetings in Islamabad. But like former prime minister Zulifikar Ali Bhutto, he is being victimised by foreign agents, and corrupt opposition leaders are trying to remove him,” said Akseer Jan, a participant of the gathering, who came all the way from Mardan. 

Public gathering’s atmosphere remained charged; enthusiastic participants raised slogans in support of prime minister

Another participation, Wajid Hussain, said Mr Bhutto was targeted for his attempts to make an Islamic bloc and unite all Muslim countries. “Now Imran Khan is facing the same treatment,” he said, adding that Imran Khan was the leader of the Islamic world. 
The participants believed that it was because of “international conspiracy” that the prime minster was facing the challenge of no- confidence motion. 
When told that moving a no-confidence motion was a constitutional step, Zohaib Ali, another participant, said: “We know we are being targeted for the prime minister’s bold stance and for saying ‘absolutely no’.”
He said the no-confidence motion had given the PTI and its workers new enthusiasm and unity who were upset due to high inflation. 
Overall, the atmosphere at the meeting remained charged. Holding party flags, the workers danced on party songs and raised slogans in support of the prime minister. They also targeted Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman. 
When Imran Khan started his speech, the charged crowd were all ears as they expected to hear something surprising, as he had been stating that he would announce a big surprise in the rally that would turn the table on the opposition.
“Where is the surprise? Though this public gathering is historic, there is no outcome. I was expecting some breakthrough and breaking news, but we heard nothing new today,” said Mohammad Waseem, another participant.
It had been noticed that there was no serious security arrangements as people entered the venue from the Shakarparian side without any body search. However, aerial surveillance was conducted through a helicopter. 
Several PTI workers also climbed electricity poles and trees to get a better view of their leaders sitting on the stage.
Throughout the day, people reached Islamabad from various parts of the country.

The party. however, accused the Parks and horticulture Authority (PHA) of removing the party’s banners on Sunday night.
PML-N Metropolitan President and former mayor Sardar Naseem Khan told Dawn that the PHA had become a tool of the PTI and started removing banners of the PML-N from Murree Road.
“They are using such tactics after seeing their political defeat. Rawalpindi is the fort of Nawaz Sharif and we will accord a warm welcome to Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shahbaz,” he said.
Talking about the route of the rally, he said that the rally against inflation would enter the garrison city on the way to Islamabad.
“We have already informed the Commissioner Noorul Amin Mengal about the route. There is no need for permission and we have intimated the administration about the rally and its route,” he said.
He said that the “Inflation March” will reach Katcheri Chowk and move to Islamabad via Marrir Chowk, Kohati Bazaar, Shamsabad and Double Road.
People of Rawalpindi are waiting for the arrival of the PML-N leadership.
“Soon Imran’s government will be dismissed and Shahbaz Sharif will take over as the prime minister of Pakistan. Imran will be the first prime minister in the history of Pakistan who will be dismissed through a no-trust move,” he said.
The PHA officials said that in some areas, the authority had removed banners. They said they had removed banners of all political parties but the latter installed them again.
When contacted, PHA Director General Zaheer Anwar Jappa told Dawn that there was no direction to the staff to remove banners and posters.
“Political parties’ workers removed the banners of their opponents,” he said.
He said the PHA was not part of any political party and being a civic body it treated all parties equally.

Addressing a press conference, the minister said permission was given to the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) to hold public gathering in H-9 on Saturday and show-cause notice had already been issued to the organisers to vacate the venue. 
“Srinagar Highway would be kept open on the directives of the apex court,” he added.
He said stern action would be taken against those found involved in blocking roads and first information reports would be registered against them.
The minister said permission was given to Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) to hold a rally in H-9 on March 28.
He said holding rallies was the opposition’s constitutional right and expressed the hope that Jamiat-i-Ulema Islam (JUI-F) would avoid confrontation and vacate the venue as the PML-N had already been allowed to hold a public gathering there on March 28.
If someone tried to create hurdles, the administration would take action as per the directions of the court, he warned.
Taking jibes at Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for seeking prime minister’s resignation, he said the ‘Gang of Three’ would never succeed in their designs, adding that Imran Khan would emerge victorious.
The opposition did not know that Imran Khan would play till the last ball, he added.
The minister said the opposition was making efforts to buy conscience of members through looted money.
Terming Nawaz Sharif a fugitive, Mr Ahmed said Shehbaz Sharif was also trying to escape but was caught at the airport.
He said control room in the interior ministry would remain open round the clock for seven days and he would personally monitor the entire situation, adding that any untoward situation could be reported on phone numbers- 0519206660 and 0519218594.
He said the name of MNA Jam Abdul Karim had been put on the Exit Control List and directives were issued to arrest him as soon as he arrived from Dubai as he was nominated in murder of Nazim Jokhio.
He said anti-Pakistan elements wanted to sabotage the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s foreign ministers’ summit but our armed forces, Rangers, Frontier Constabulary and administration foiled their designs.
Replying to a question, the minister said he had advised Prime Minister Imran Khan to impose governor’s rule in Sindh and declare emergency, but he rejected his advice.
Keeping in view the immense popularity of Imran Khan, he said he asked the prime minister to go far early general elections after passing a poor-friendly and welfare-oriented budget for year 2022-23.
To another question, he said the army chief would complete his tenure.

Some of the slab engravings with images of women, flower patterns and calligraphy displayed at F-9 Park. — White Star

 
ISLAMABAD: The wonder of rock carvings is such that they withstand the storms of time, telling stories of the distant past, even after a thousand years. I cannot imagine how my markings on stones will be perceived.
Award-winning artist and activist Fauzia Minallah said this while talking to Dawn about her latest body of work that includes 18 slab engravings with images of women, flower patterns and calligraphy depicting verses from the poems of Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Fehmida Riaz and Kishwar Naheed, violence against women and environmental degradation.
Amid the tense political atmosphere in the capital city, a select gathering of art and nature lovers, under an old banyan tree in a secluded corner of the F-9 Park, was immersed in viewing Ms Minallah’s work. The tree has been saved along with other indigenous trees as a natural monument by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Capital Citizens Committee near Flying Club.
Dr Fauzia Saeed, former director general of Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA), opened the show titled Her Stories on Stone.
The artist recalled fond memories from Hazara, Peshawar, Gilgit, Mohenjodaro, Quetta, Lahore and Swat where she lived and spent most of her childhood. The rich and diverse heritage and natural monuments of these valleys, she said, is ingrained in her memories, shaped her life and inspired her work.
“It is a celebration of my childhood memories of playing in the ancient slate cemeteries of the Gangar Hills of Hazara, the rock carvings in Gilgit, and the Gandhara art at the Peshawar museum.
“For almost six months, I have been busy drilling holes in slabs of stone. Initially, I draw lines with chalk and compose the final image of thousands of dots with a drill. I am in love with dots. I have no time for networking or parties. It is hard physical labour but the whole creative process is worth it,” Ms Minallah said.
Fauzia is one of the few artists who has not only felt the impact of climate change and urban expansion on nature but has also organised protests for the protection of old trees as natural monuments of the capital.
“Displaying my work under an ancient tree is also a celebration of protecting the wonderful art of mother nature,” she said, adding that, “A tree is like a mother who gives birth, nurtures and protects her child from predators. The beauty of the tree is that it has aerial roots that grow back into the earth and over centuries become trunks. Both are facing brutality and catastrophe.”
She uses mixed media but derives inspiration from ancient Gandhara art found on slate tombs in the cemeteries of her home town Sirikot near Haripur.
Dr Saeed, admiring the artist’s work, devotion and activism, said: “Fauzia’s works have always inspired me. She is a down to earth artist and activist. Her social consciousness and sensitivity are her distinctive qualities deeply rooted in the soil. These qualities reflect in her work.”
Human rights defender Tahira Abdullah recited Kishwar Naheed’s famous poem Hum Gunehgar Aurtain (we the sinful women).
Through this new work, the artist aims to build a bridge between art and social movements working outside of the commercial gallery system with underprivileged classes and children by setting up Funkor Child Art Centre and promoting harmony and peace.

6,Need for dialogue to uphold universal values of peace: Swedish envoy,"ISLAMABAD: The issue of interfaith harmony applies to all countries.

We can always do more, which means that we need to try to bring together religious leaders, encourage dialogue among youth and uphold universal values of peace.
This was highlighted by Sweden’s special envoy to the Organisation of Islamabad Cooperation (OIC) Ulrika Sundberg, who also served as ambassador to Pakistan from 2009-12. She was in Islamabad as an observer to OIC and to suggest ideas to combat racism and other forms of intolerance and discrimination.
“Sweden has welcomed Muslim immigrants, Turks, Iraqis, Iranians, Somalis, Afghans, Syrians, who now make up 10 percent of the population. It is imperative to help the Muslim community in Sweden to be more organised for social inclusiveness,” she said.
Talking toDawn, she said that a priority concern at the OIC was the situation in Afghanistan and to find ways to avoid a humanitarian crisis there.
“Another major concern was what can we do to combat Islamophobia together, a concern that we all share and it is a question of how? Prime Minister Imran Khan made an important point that the responsibility to fight Islamophobia also rested with the member states of OIC. They have to explain to us what the concerns are.
“Islamophobia is something systemic which we take exception to and if we are wrong then it is a question of education,” she said, adding the OIC was a big success.
“Pakistanis doing the negotiations were smart, accommodating as far as possible the concerns. One of these concerns which keeps coming back and has been with us for the longest time, is what freedom of religion and belief mean?” she said.
Ms Sundberg met federal ministers and government officials during her visit. In her meeting with the minister for religious and interfaith harmony, she was told that the legislation on forced conversion was already tabled and she hoped it would be adopted soon. “Christians, Ahmadis and Hindus face problems but it is pleasing to see Sikhs getting attention, and the government is coming around to it,” she added.
The envoy expressed interest in learning more about the implementation of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
As rights of women is also a priority area, she hoped that women in Pakistan had access to finance, felt secure to take public transportation and at the work place, and had access to services in terms of child care.
Present in Pakistan after more than a decade, Ms Sundberg said she was struck by the difference. “There used to be a constellation of police pickets all over the place and security concerns were overriding,” she said.

8,Court vacates stay against freezing of capital administration’s accounts,ISLAMABAD: The district administration of Islamabad fears freezing of its bank accounts for the over Rs2 billion tax...,"ISLAMABAD: The district administration of Islamabad fears freezing of its bank accounts for the over Rs2 billion tax default after a stay order against the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has been withdrawn.
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) last week disposed of a petition filed by the Islamabad administration against freezing of the accounts by the FBR.
The FBR had frozen the accounts in the National Bank of Pakistan, F-8 branch, for non-remitting the Rs2.38 billion tax.
The capital administration had taken the stance that the action was uncalled for and without any justification because non-recovery of the Capital Value Tax (CVT) cannot be attributed to it as many defaulters had gone into litigation against the administration.
The district administration had filed the petition in the IHC and obtained the restraining order.
The FBR, on the other hand, filed comments objecting to the maintainability of the petition.
It stated that during the pendency of the petitions that challenged the CVT, the district administration stayed the recovery for which they were solely responsible.
It may be mentioned that private housing societies reportedly exchanged land with each without paying the CVT. In some cases, the sellers and purchasers initiated the process of transfer, got registered the entries into the land register and despite taking physical possession of the land did not deposit the CVT.
CVT was imposed through section 7 of the Finance Act 1989 which placed the responsibility of collecting it on the registering or attesting authority at the time of registering or attesting the transfer. According to the Federal Board of Revenue rules, CVT is payable by individuals, firms and companies which acquire an asset by purchase or a right to use for more than 20 years.
IHC Judge Arbab Mohammad Tahir noted that the challenge to demand for payment of CVT was finally decided by the Supreme Court in the case of M/s Pak Gulf Constructions Company.
The apex court had observed: “the sale, purchase, transfer and other similar transactions are undertaken between the petitioner company which is the owner of the immovable assets and buyer in whose favour the transfer takes place, therefore, it is only logical that the petitioner should be obligated to collect CVT from the purchaser and deposit it with the Federal Government.”
Justice Tahir noted that “the private entities engaged in sale, purchase, transfer and other similar transactions were held responsible to collect CVT from the purchasers and deposit it with the Federal Government being falling within the purview of sections 7(d) and (4) of the Finance Act, 1989 read with Rule 4 of Rules, 1990.”
Justice Tahir was of the view that the FBR was not at fault in this case of directing the National Bank of Pakistan to freeze the accounts of the Islamabad administration.
“Even otherwise, there is no error in the impugned order,” he ruled.
The question of law and facts of the instant case are akin to one decided earlier by this court.
However, counsel for the FBR, Syed Ishfaq Hussain Naqvi, said the Islamabad administration had assailed the assessment orders before the FBR’s commissioner.
Subsequently, the court disposed of the petition observing that since they had already an availed alternative remedy before the appropriate forum against the assessment orders, there left no need to comment on the merit of the case.-

He said that the main objective of IHRA is to regulate healthcare services and establishments in the federal capital.
The official said that managements of private laboratories will face action for not adopting regulations and appropriate treatment methods for the safe disposal of infectious waste in the federal capital. Action will also be taken against those laboratories in the federal capital which were not following proper procedure for disposal of waste right from handling, collecting, transporting, discarding, and marking till incineration to avoid minimal exposure to others, he said, adding, “Infectious waste produced at the labs and hospitals is a great threat to the public health and the environment and causes nosocomial infections if not managed well.”

“It has happened because a large number of people who were not residents of the federal capital were also vaccinated in the city. It has happened as it was more convenient for the citizens to be inoculated in Islamabad due to better arrangements and the number of vaccination centres,” District Health Officer Dr Zaeem Zia said while talking to Dawn.
“We have surpassed the figure of our target as a number of people, who were not residents of the city, have also been vaccinated,” he said.

This was said by speakers at the ‘Dialogue Pakistan 2022’, organised by Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (Pips). The aim of the event was initiating discussions related to politics, governance, transparency, peace and security in the country.
The primary responsibility, besides others, of the parliament is to be responsive to all crises related to economy, governance and politics but the existing one has failed to find a solution to the current political upheaval that is fast moving towards bringing political and economic instability in the country, participants of the event pointed out
Senior leader of Balochistan National Party and member of Balochistan Assembly Sana Ullah Baloch said that parliament should be responsible however the present parliament did not fulfill this criteria, adding parliament used to have its own code of conduct to fulfill its responsibilities in a crisis-like situation.
PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira said the masses and civil society would have to play their role and public pressure needed to be built on the institutions to ensure that they could function and deliver properly. He said that they would have to give space to the parliament by standing behind the institution. “At present, the space for the parliament is continuously shrinking,” he added.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister RaoofHasan in his remarks said that the concept of reconciliation without truth becomes irrelevant, adding that political parties did not want to bring an independent system of accountability that could hold responsible both the powerful and the common people without any discrimination. He said in the present system, the powerful elite did not want themselves to be held accountable. “There is no concept of rights without responsibility.”
Former national security advisor retired Lt Gen Nasser Khan Janjua said that the future of the region lies in connectivity and Pakistan can become a trade corridor of Asia by getting access to Central Asian states through Afghanistan. “Afghanistan is our partner for the future,” he said.
During the event, a ‘Charter of Peace’ was launched. It is a document laying down recommendations for countering radicalisation and extremism in Pakistan which been designed after several consultations with stakeholders including the religious and political leadership of the country.
Another report titled ‘How Youth in Pakistan View State, Society, Religion, and Politics’ was launched which includes views of over 700 university students surveyed by the institute from all across the country.
Dutch Ambassador Wouter Plompin his opening remarks at the launching of the report said that youth was part of the solution, given they were provided opportunities to think rationally. The concerns about single national curriculum (SNC) must be addressed to make the syllabus inclusive, he added.
