The Times of India quoted unnamed Indian Air Force officials as saying the MiG-21s have long past their retirement but must be replaced before being grounded.
The report did not specify what portion of India’s fighter-jet capability would be affected. 
The Wion news outlet said the air force has around 70 MiG-21s. The air force and defence ministry have been buying aircraft from Western makers in recent years.
A senior defence ministry official declined to confirm or deny the Times of India report, telling only that discussions on the future of the MiG-21 were underway, as sourcing of spare parts from Russia was increasingly difficult due to the war in Ukraine.
A defence ministry spokesman did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
The MiG-21, dubbed  “flying coffins” by the Indian press, has been the country’s key fighter jet since its introduction in 1963 but has been plagued by crashes in later years.
The jets have been a critical security asset in India’s military infrastructure, used for example to strike neighbouring rival Pakistan after an alleged suicide attack in the disputed Kashmir region in 2019.
Thursday’s crash of an air force MiG-21 Bison in the desert state of Rajasthan brings to six the number of MiG-21 crashes since last year, with five officers killed, according to official data and a source.
In 2012, then-Defence Minister A.K. Antony told parliament that more than half of India’s 872 MiG-21s had been lost to crashes over the previous four decades.

1,Kentucky flooding death toll rises to 25,"WASHINGTON: Devastating flooding in Kentucky killed 25 people and the toll is expected to rise, the southern US...","WASHINGTON: Devastating flooding in Kentucky killed 25 people and the toll is expected to rise, the southern US state’s governor said on Saturday as rescuers continued their search for survivors.
Torrential rain earlier this week caused unprecedented flash flooding in eastern Kentucky, a mountainous region already hard hit by grinding poverty as the coal industry that was the heart of its economy declines.
“We’ve got some tough news to share out of Eastern Kentucky today, where we are still in the search and rescue phase. Our death toll has risen to 25 lost, and that number is likely to increase,” tweeted Governor Andy Beshear.
“To everyone in Eastern Kentucky, we are going to be there for you today and in the weeks, months and years ahead. We will get through this together,” he added.
Beshear previously said hundreds of people had been rescued by boat since the flooding began Wednesday evening, while National Guard helicopters carried out dozens of aerial rescues.
But  “there are still so many people unaccounted for, and in this area, it’s going to be a hard task to get a firm number,” he told CNN on Saturday.
Some areas in eastern Kentucky had reported receiving more than eight inches (20 centimetres) of rain in a 24-hour period.
The water level of the North Fork of the Kentucky River at Whitesburg rose to a staggering 20 feet within hours, well above its previous record of 14.7 feet.
More rain ahead
The flooding turned many roads into rivers, and some houses in low-lying areas were almost completely submerged, with just their rooftops visible.
The weather offered a respite on Saturday, but more rain was expected the following day.
“As a cold front drags south, the area will remain mainly dry through today. The dry weather is expected to come to an end Sunday afternoon as a boundary lifts north back into the region,” the National Weather Service’s Jackson, Kentucky office tweeted.
Beshear said on CNN that the impending rain posed a challenge, and  “while we don’t think it’ll be historic rain, it’ll be hard.” The eastern Kentucky flooding is the latest in a series of extreme weather events that scientists say are an unmistakable sign of climate change.
Nearly 60 people were killed in western Kentucky by a tornado in December 2021 — a disaster that Beshear said offered lessons for current efforts on the other end of the state.
“We learned a lot of lessons in western Kentucky on those devastating tornados about seven months ago, so we are providing as much support as we can and we are moving fast from all over the state to help out,” he said.
President Joe Biden has issued a disaster declaration for the Kentucky flooding, allowing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts.

2,Outrage over Russian plan to hang ‘prisoners of war’,Russian embassy in Britain calls for fighters from the Azov regiment to face a  “humiliating” execution.,"KYIV: Ukrainian officials on Saturday denounced a call by Russia’s embassy in Britain for fighters from the Azov regiment to face a  “humiliating” execution.
The Russian tweet came as Moscow and Kyiv traded blame over a strike on a jail holding Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russian-controlled territory that killed around 50 people, reportedly including members of the Azov regiment.
“Azov militants deserve execution, but death not by firing squad but by hanging, because they’re not real soldiers. They deserve a humiliating death,” Moscow’s diplomatic mission wrote in an overnight Tweet.

 





 
The post — which Twitter said violated its rules on  “hateful conduct” — was accompanied by a video purportedly showing a couple in Russian-held Mariupol claiming they had been shelled by Ukrainian forces at the Azovstal metal plant during the fierce battle for the city.
“Russia is a terrorist state. In the 21st century, only savages and terrorists can talk at the diplomatic level about the fact that people deserve to be executed by hanging. Russia is a state sponsor of terrorism,” Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, wrote on Telegram.
“What more evidence is needed?”
Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of carrying out the deadly bombardment of the jail holding captured servicemen in Kremlin-controlled Olenivka.
Moscow said Ukraine targeted the facility in a bid to dissuade its troops from surrendering, while Kyiv accused Russia of carrying out a  “war crime” by striking the prison.
Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko tweeted  “there is no difference between Russian diplomats calling for execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war and Russian troops doing it in Olenivka. They are all accomplices in these war crimes and must be held accountable.”

 





 
Ukrainian forces, including members of Azov, in May ended a weeks-long siege of the vast Azovstal plant in Mariupol by agreeing to surrender.
Around 2,500 combatants were taken captive by Moscow’s forces after calling a halt to their resistance.
Azov regiment commander Mykyta Nadtochiy said in a video address:  “We consider the attack on Olenivka an act of public execution committed by Russia with complete impunity.” 
Those responsible for this act will be  “found wherever they are” and Ukraine as a state  “will ensure that they are punished justly,” he added.
The Azov regiment is a former volunteer battalion that has drawn controversy for its links to far-right figures. The group was formally incorporated into Ukraine’s National Guard in 2014 as it helped fight Kremlin-backed separatists in east Ukraine.
Azov fighters are a hate figure for Russia’s tightly-controlled state media and officials, who demonise them as  “neo-nazis”.
The Kremlin claims it launched its invasion of its pro-Western neighbour in February in part due to the need to  “denazify” the country.
Kyiv and its Western allies have roundly rejected the claim and say it was used as a pretext to fuel support inside Russia for the assault on Ukraine.

3,Britain’s trains disrupted in widespread rail strike,The 24-hour strike is the second significant industrial action this week on Britain’s rail network.,"LONDON: Around 5,000 train drivers across almost a quarter of Britain’s rail network went on strike on Saturday, as part of a campaign for higher pay after the country’s inflation rate hit its highest in 40 years.
The 24-hour strike organised by train drivers’ union ASLEF is the second significant industrial action this week on Britain’s rail network, after 40,000 members of the RMT and TSSA unions — which represent other rail staff — held a major strike on Wednesday.
Soaring inflation — consumer price inflation is currently 9.4pc — and patchy wage rises have exacerbated labour tensions across sectors including postal services, health, schools, airports and the judiciary.
The rail strike was expected to cause  “significant disruption” all day and on Sunday morning, according to Network Rail, which runs Britain’s rail infrastructure.
Almost all services on seven of the country’s 34 train operators were cancelled, including regional networks for southeast and eastern England as well as long-distance lines linking London with southwest England, northeast England and Edinburgh.

4,"Yemen’s ancient honey production a victim of war, climate change","TAEZ: For Yemeni beekeeper Mohammed Saif, honey production used to be a lucrative business but years of war and...","TAEZ: For Yemeni beekeeper Mohammed Saif, honey production used to be a lucrative business but years of war and climate change have taken the buzz out of the family hives.
The business, handed down from father to son,  “is slowly disappearing”, Saif said.  “The bees are being hit by strange phenomenons. Is it due to climate change or the effects of war? We really don’t know.” 
Yemen, one of the world’s most impoverished countries, has been gripped by a deadly conflict since 2014, pitting the Iran-backed Houthis against government forces supported by a Saudi-led military coalition.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in fighting or through illness and malnutrition over the past eight years, and the country’s infrastructure has been devastated. But a fragile UN-brokered truce has held since April, bringing some respite to the country and its war-weary population.
In the southwestern region of Taez, Saif recently took stock of his hives in a rugged valley surrounded by mountains. Before the war, Saif said, the family managed 300 hives, now only 80 are left.
Experts consider Yemeni honey some of the best in the world, including the prized Royal Sidr known for its therapeutic properties.
The United Nations says honey plays a  “vital role” in Yemen’s economy, with 100,000 households dependent on it for their livelihoods.
Bee ecosystems battered
But  “enormous losses have been inflicted on the industry since the outbreak of the conflict”, the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a report in June.
“Armed conflict and climate change are threatening the continuity of a 3,000-year-old practice,” the ICRC said.
“Successive waves of displacement to flee violence, the impact of weapon contamination on production areas, and the growing impact of climate change are pushing thousands of beekeepers into precarity, significantly reducing production.” Saif knows it all too well. “Last year in our village a missile struck a beekeeper’s hives. He lost everything,” he said.
“The war has had a very bad impact on us. The fighters have targeted many zones where bees are found,” he added.
The ICRC’s Bashir Omar said the conflict had limited the ability of beekeepers to freely roam the land whenever flowers were in bloom to collect the honey.
Landmines and active front lines are among the challenges they face. “To make matters worse, Yemen, like many conflict-affected countries, is disproportionately affected by climate change,” the ICRC report noted.
“Temperature rises in recent years, combined with severe alterations caused to the environment, are disturbing the bees’ ecosystem which is impacting the pollination process,” it said.
“With water tables falling and increased desertification, areas previously engaged in agricultural activities and beekeeping no longer sustain these livelihoods.” The ICRC is providing financial support and training this year to beekeepers, after a similar initiative in 2021 that helped nearly 4,000 of them.
Nabil al-Hakim, who sells Yemen’s celebrated yellow nectar in Taez shops, also recalled the golden days before the conflict ravaged his country.
“Before the war we could make a good living by selling honey... but honey has become rare and customers can no longer afford it,” he said.
“Before, I used to sell up to 25 five-litre jars a month. Now I can’t even sell one.”

5,US lottery player wins jackpot topping $1.3bn,The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are one in 303 million.,"WASHINGTON: A lucky US lottery player has won a Mega Millions jackpot worth more than $1.3 billion, one of the highest prizes ever, a US lottery official confirmed on Saturday.
The official Mega Millions site said a single ticket holder in the Midwestern state of Illinois — who has yet to be identified — had the six magic numbers and won a jackpot estimated at $1.337 billion. “We are thrilled to have witnessed one of the biggest jackpot wins in Mega Millions history,” Pat McDonald, lead director of the Mega Millions Consortium, said on the group’s website. 
“We’re eager to find out who won and look forward to congratulating the winner soon!” The grand prize had been steadily growing, fueling the dreams of would-be winners across the country, for more than three months. The prize had gone unclaimed in 29 previous drawings.
The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are one in 303 million — much higher than the one-in-a-million chance of being struck by lightning, according to US government data.
Friday’s total falls short of the world record of $1.586 billion, set in January 2016 by America’s other national lotto, the Powerball, though that sum was split among three winners. The second-highest prize ever — and the highest won by a single person — was in an October 2018 Mega Millions drawing for $1.5 billion.
The $1.337 billion figure for Friday’s drawing represents the total amount a winner would be entitled to if they accepted the prize split up over a 30-year annuity.
If the lucky person decided instead to take the winnings as a one-time cash payment, the total amount would decrease to $780.5 million, Mega Millions estimates.

6,US restoring Pakistan’s Category 1 safety rating,A Category 1 rating means the country’s civil aviation authority complies with US standards.,"WASHINGTON: The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) could upgrade Pakistan’s safety rating to Category 1, allowing direct flights from Pakistani airports, the US media reported on Saturday.
There have been no direct flights between the two countries since 2017 when the FAA downgraded Pakistan to Category 2 due to concerns over Pakistan’s aviation safety record.
Simple Flying, a niche news site focused on aviation, reported that the FAA will soon send its inspectors to Pakistan to assess the country’s airports and aircraft. The FAA is the largest transportation agency of the US government and regulates all aspects of civil aviation in the country.
“Should the country’s aviation sector pass the test, there is a good possibility Pakistan will receive a Category 1 rating,” Simple Flying reported.
Earlier this week, Head of Prime Minister’s Strategic Reforms Salman Sufi discussed the possibility of opening up direct flight access for Pakistan with US officials in Washington.
Briefing the Pakistani media after the meeting, Mr Sufi said that the US side “conveyed its readiness to have technical discussions with Civil Aviation Authority and other relevant departments and to undertake necessary visits for resumption of direct flights.”
“To facilitate Pakistani exporters of perishable items to the US, , we have also requested the US to appoint an inspector at Karachi port. This will ensure pre-clearance of mangoes and other food items so they can reach their destination in the US without any delays,” he said.
Simple Flying reported that if Pakistan received a Category 1 safety rating, “Pakistani carriers would be able to launch new direct routes to the US and establish code-sharing agreements with other airlines.” 
A Category 1 rating means the country’s civil aviation authority complies with US standards. This rating allows air carriers from that country to establish service to the United States and to carry the code of US carriers through code-sharing arrangements.  The FAA lowered Pakistan’s safety rating on July 15th, 2020 after determining it was not in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety standards under the FAA’s International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) programme.
With its Category 2 safety rating, Pakistani airlines have restricted access to US airspace and cannot establish new routes or code shares with US carriers.  The United States had given the green light for national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) to operate 12 direct charter flights a month before revoking its decision over safety concerns.

7,"Biden again tests positive for Covid, returns to isolation","His positive test is believed to be  “rebound” positivity experienced by some patients, according to the White House physician.","WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden again tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday, according to a statement from the White House physician, although he is experiencing no symptoms and feels  “quite well.” 
Biden, who tested positive for the disease nine days ago but then tested negative twice earlier this week, will resume isolation procedures, and his positive test is believed to be  “rebound” positivity experienced by some Covid patients, according to White House physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor.
Biden tweeted about his positive case, saying it can happen to a  “small minority of folks.” 
“I've got no symptoms but I am going to isolate for the safety of everyone around me. I’m still at work, and will be back on the road soon,” he tweeted.

 





 
The positive test jeopardizes a Tuesday trip to Michigan Biden had planned to tout the recent passage of legislation to boost the semiconductor industry, which the White House announced earlier on Saturday.
O’Connor said Biden, who is 79, tested negative for the last four days, and there is no plan to reinitiate treatment given his lack of symptoms.
Biden previously descr­ibed his experience with Covid as mild, saying he was able to continue working while in isolation and attributed his relative ease with the disease to vaccines and other treatments.
O’Connor had previously said Biden would be tested regularly to watch for a potential  “rebound” Covid-19 case, which can be experienced by some patients who have been treated with Paxlovid, the drug the president received.

8,Iran says Swede arrested for ‘espionage’,"TEHRAN: Iran said on Saturday it had arrested a Swedish national on allegations of espionage, while Sweden’s...","TEHRAN: Iran said on Saturday it had arrested a Swedish national on allegations of espionage, while Sweden’s foreign ministry said the case related to an arrest previously revealed in May.
The announcement comes amid diplomatic tensions between Tehran and Stockholm, after a Swedish court sentenced a former Iranian prison official to life for war crimes during mass executions in the Islamic republic in 1988.
Iran’s intelligence ministry said it had  “identified and arrested a national of the Kingdom of Sweden suspected of espionage”, without providing details on the suspect’s identity nor the date of their detention.
“In all the previous trips, the suspect... communicated with a number of European and non-European suspects who were under surveillance in Iran,” the Iranian statement read.
In early May, the Swedish foreign ministry said a Swede in his 30s had been arrested in Iran.
The ministry confirmed that Saturday’s announcement referred to the same case, adding:  “This is a previously known case that the foreign ministry is already working on.” 
The Iranian statement said that  “the suspect in question re-entered the country a few months ago 
after the arrest of another European spy” to collect information, adding the suspect had been taken into custody while leaving Iran.
The intelligence ministry said the suspect had visited Israel, the Islamic republic’s arch-enemy, before going to Iran.
It also alleged Sweden had  “supported several proxy spies” for Israel, including Ahmadreza Djalali, a Swedish-Iranian academic who has been sentenced to death in the Islamic republic.
Djalali’s sentence was issued in 2017 after he was convicted of passing information about two Iranian nuclear scientists to Israel’s Mossad spy agency that led to their assassinations. He was granted Swedish citizenship the following year.
His case was followed by the trial in Stockholm of Hamid Noury, a former official in Iran’s judiciary accused of war crimes over the killing of prisoners in Iran during the 1980s.
Noury received a life sentence from a Swedish court on July 14. Iran dismissed the verdict as  “political” and has called for his release.
Relations between to the two countries have been strained over the case, with Tehran recalling its ambassador to Sweden for consultations a week later.

9,US orders departure of personnel from Mali over attack fears,WASHINGTON: The United States has ordered non-emergency personnel and their families to leave Mali due to a...,"WASHINGTON: The United States has ordered non-emergency personnel and their families to leave Mali due to a heightened risk of attacks, the State Department said.
The US did not mention a specific threat to its employees, but said there was an increased danger of violence affecting Westerners in a country that has been plagued by jihadist attacks for years.
“On July 29, 2022, the Department ordered the departure of non-emergency US government employees and family members due to the heightened risk of terrorist attacks in areas frequented by Westerners,” the 
State Department said in an updated travel advisory on Mali.
“Terrorist and armed groups continue plotting kidnappings and attacks in Mali,” the advisory said, warning of attacks on places including  “night clubs, hotels, restaurants, places of worship (and) international diplomatic missions.” 
Jihadists first struck the north of Mali in 2012, joining a regional insurgency.
After being scattered the following year by French forces, they regrouped, in 2015 launching attacks in the ethnically volatile center and cross-border raids on Niger and Burkina Faso.
Earlier this month, Mali’s army said it had thwarted a new attack on a military camp in the center of the country, just days after a deadly suicide attack in a strategic garrison town near the capital.
It was the first time since 2012 that such coordinated attacks had taken place so close to Bamako.
Mali has been run by a military junta since August 2020, when colonels angered at failures to roll back the jihadists toppled the country’s elected president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.

Hussein Qawariq, 59, from the village of Awarta, was shot on Tuesday by Israeli forces manning a checkpoint in Huwara, near the West Bank city of Nablus, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The Israeli army said that soldiers  “spotted a suspect approaching them at a military post” and initially fired in the air after  “receiving no response”. “The suspect continued approaching the soldiers who responded with fire toward him. A hit was identified,” the army said.
Huwara mayor Wajih Odeh said Qawariq was  “mentally disabled”. He  “used to collect bottles and cans from the street and ask for money from businesses in the area”, he said.
Qawariq’s family too said he had a  “mental disorder,” Palestinian news agency WAFA reported. He succumbed to his wounds in the Rabin Medical Center in Israel, it added. The army said it was looking into the fatal shooting.
At least 54 Palestinians have been killed since late March, mostly in the West Bank. They have included suspected militants and also non-combatants, among them Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American dual national, who was covering an Israeli raid in Jenin.
Attacks on Israeli targets have killed 19 people over the same period, most of them civilians killed in attacks inside Israel. Three Israeli Arab attackers have also been killed.
