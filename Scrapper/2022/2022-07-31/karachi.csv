Muhammad Muzamil and Muhammad Umer were found guilty of attacking and injuring Constable Shafiullah with an unlicensed pistol during an encounter within the jurisdiction of the Pakistan Bazaar police station in June 2021.
On Saturday, the ATC-XX judge, who conducted the trial in the judicial complex inside the central prison, pronounced his verdict reserved after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides.
State prosecutor Iqbal Meo Rajput argued that a police party during routine patrolling got spy information about the presence of two accused near the Nishar-i-Haider Chowk. The police reached the spot upon which both the suspects tried to escape under the cover of firing. 
Their firing left Constable Shafiullah injured, he said, adding that the cops also returned fire and managed to arrest them. 
On the other, defence counsel Yousaf Khan and Hyder Farooq Jatoi submitted that their clients were innocent and they had allegedly been framed in the present case by the police under false and fabricated allegations. They pleaded to acquit them.
Separate cases were registered under Sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 324 (attempted murder), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code, Section 23(I)-A of the Sindh Arms Act, 2013 and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.

1,Violence breaks out in Scheme 33 goth over anti-encroachment drive,"Two cops, three residents suffer bullet wounds; city police chief orders probe.","KARACHI: At least five persons, including two policemen, suffered bullet injuries during an anti-encroachment operation in Ghazi Goth, an Scheme-33 locality near Safoora Goth, on Saturday. 
Police claimed that two cops were shot at and wounded when ‘land grabbers’ opened fire on them while residents alleged that three people — two women and a 15-year-old boy — suffered injuries in “firing and tear gas shelling” by the law-enforcers. 
Authorities stopped the anti-encroachment drive being carried out under the orders of the deputy commissioner (DC) East after the incidents. 
A police spokesperson identified the wounded policemen as Constable Manzoor Khan, 52, posted at the Sharea Faisal police station and Constable Zulfiqar Sharafudin, 32, posted at the Anti-Encroachment Establishment. 

Two cops, three residents suffer bullet wounds; city police chief orders probe; SUP condemns action against ‘Sindhi population’

A Chhipa spokesperson in a statement said that two women — Tasleem Yusuf, 32, and Zeenat Bashir, 35, and 15-year-old boy Noor Malik were also injured. 
The injured were taken to different hospitals. Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said the condition of the wounded boy and two women was out of danger.
She said that the boy suffered a single bullet wound in the right thigh while Taslem and Zeenad sustained multiple pellet injuries on the face, shoulder and torso.
‘Illegal encroachments in three Dehs’
East-SSP Syed Abdul Rahim Sherazi said that the DC-East in a letter to police and other authorities on July 22 had requested an action for removal of illegal encroachments from three Dehs — Songal, Doozan and Thoming, in Gulzar-i-Hijri, district East. 
The letter stated that an anti-encroachment operation had been planned between July 26 and 31 in the three Dehs. The DC had requested the police, other law-enforcers for adequate force and provision of machinery along with labour for the anti-encroachment drive. 
The anti-encroachment force started demolishing ‘encroachments’ and the local police provided support to them amid protest by locals, added the SSP. 
The protest became violent when some “criminal elements joined the protesters” and opened straight fire on the force, resulting in bullet injuries to two policemen, he said. 
Another officer, Aurangzeb Khattak, said: “Land grabbers and activists of some ethnic parties chanting slogans resorted to firing on police and anti-encroachment force resulting in bullet injuries to two policemen”. 
Protesters’ version 
Mahboob Abbasi of a local NGO, who is one of the leaders of the protesters, said that the ‘builder mafia’ was eyeing Ghazi Goth and the police and administration were allegedly supporting them. 
He claimed that the mafia had also attempted to occupy the village in 2016, but the residents got a stay order from a court. 
He claimed Ghazi Goth was spread over 110 acres and the mafia was allegedly trying to ‘occupy’ four to five acres having commercial value. He claimed that residents had ‘lease papers’ and all civic facilities had been provided to them. The residents had built up to three-storey houses. The police and anti-encroachment force were not showing any ‘papers’ to residents in connection with their demolition drive. 
Mr Abbasi claimed that the anti-encroachment force supported by local police started demolishing shops and houses. When the people put up resistance, the police allegedly resorted to ‘massive’ tear gas shelling and firing, resulting in injuries to several persons. 
He claimed that for the last several days the police had launched an operation and six FIRs had been registered against residents, political and social workers, and five FIRs had also been registered against himself. 
He called upon authorities and the Sindh chief minister to take notice as residents were ‘voters’ of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party. He said the villages were ‘beauty’ of Karachi and the Sindh government should protect them and initiate an inquiry into the incidents. 
He said it appeared that the provincial government was “helpless before the builder mafia”. 
Meanwhile, in a statement issued here, Sindh United Party president Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah condemned the ‘demolition drive’ in Ghazi Goth. 
He said his party condemned the action allegedly carried out to “uproot the Sindhi population and settle people from other countries and provinces in the Sindhi goths”. 
Meanwhile, Karachi police chief Javed Odho took notice of reports of ‘torture’ on women in Ghazi Goth and directed the DIG-East to conduct an inquiry, fix responsibility and take action against responsible officers.
“No one would be allowed to take law into their hands as protection of people was first priority of the police,” he said.

2,Karachi’s Masroor Base received 23.81 inches rainfall in July,"“Right now, there are no signs of any emerging system that could affect Karachi,"" Met official says.","KARACHI: Weather is likely to remain partly cloudy to cloudy with chances of light rain/drizzle in the next few days with maximum temperature ranging between 31 degrees Celsius to 33°C, a Met official stated on Saturday.
“Right now, there are no signs of any emerging system that could affect Karachi, which is likely to continue with its normal weather features in the next four to five days,” chief meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfarz said, adding that Karachi historically received more rainfall in the month of August.
According to the Met official, the upper parts of Sindh are likely to remain under the influence of the prevailing weather system in Balochistan and are expected to receive light to moderate rain with isolated thunderstorms.
Meanwhile, the Met department has released the July rainfall data of Karachi according to which the maximum rainfall was recorded at the Masroor Base i.e. 605millimetres, or 23.81 inches, followed by Gulshan-i-Hadeed (586mm, or 23.07 inches) and DHA (523mm, or 20.59 inches).

4,Water crisis hits areas dependent on supply from Hub Canal,"After breach repair work, it will take two days to normalise supply.","KARACHI: Acute water shortages in the metropolis, especially in district West, continued on Saturday as the water supply from Hub Dam could not be fully restored because of delays in plugging of a 150-foot breach developed in the Hub Canal. 
Sources said that only 64 million gallons of water could be released in the Hub Canal that supplied 100 million gallons of water daily to the city. 
The canal developed a breach last week mainly due to overflowing of Hub Dam located 56 kilometres from Karachi. 
They said that the repair work was delayed due to intermittent rains, but some work had been done. 
The sources said that less water was being released in the Hub Canal as a precautionary measure to check the strength of the wall built to plug the breach. The precaution is being taken to ensure that no further damage is done to the repaired portion of the water passage. 

After breach repair work, it will take two days to normalise supply

The dam on July 18 had filled to capacity and finally started to overflow due to the heavy spell of monsoon rains in Balochistan and its level reached 340 feet leading to spill over of the reservoir. 
Wapda officials said that water level in the dam was still between 339 and 340 feet and water was being released through the spillway. 
The dam’s level was 322 feet before the start of the monsoon rains in Balochistan and its level had already risen to its maximum capacity of 340 feet. 
Last week a breach in the Hub Canal led to suspension of water supply to district West, which could not be fully restored so far. Because of the suspension of the water supply, people dependent on the water from the dam faced a great deal of problems. 
Residents of different localities, including Baldia Town and Orangi Town, said that the water scarcity in their areas had made their life miserable. 
They said that the delay in plugging of the breach in the Hub Canal had caused a great deal of hardship in their localities. 
A resident of Baldia Town said that a tank of 1,000-litre built on a Suzuki pick-up earlier available at Rs700 was being sold at Rs1,000 to Rs1,500 in his area. 
He said there were many localities where regular water tanker could not reach due to narrow lanes. “We rely on these small water carriers, but it is very difficult for most of the residents to pay that much price for a 1,000-litre tank,” he added. 
A spokesman for the water utility said that the quantity of water would be increased in the Hub Canal gradually. “By tomorrow (Sunday), 70 million gallons of water will be released in the canal,” he said, adding that the 100 million gallons of water supply to the city would be completely restored in two days.

5,"For instant updates, Karachiites rely more on WhatsApp, Facebook groups",Citizens have come to rely on other citizens for instant reliable news.," 

Photo by writer

KARACHI: Whenever there is a problem, any disturbance or crisis in the city, the citizens have come to rely on other citizens for instant reliable news, which they receive through Facebook groups or WhatsApp broadcast lists.
These groups and lists are being run by some very responsible and dependable persons who have their finger on the pulse of the city. And their importance became clearer during the recent urban flooding that also led to so many other issues such as traffic jams, power failures, accidents, shortage of supplies, scarcity of food items and medicines in the rain-hit areas.
One Facebook group that everyone in the Defence Housing Authority and Clifton areas was using to voice their issues or opinions or to alert others during the rains was ‘Voice of DHA’, or VOD. Not far behind were the ‘Offroad club Pakistan’, ‘Karachi One2One Concierge’ and ‘One2One Admin’.
A particular example of a post on the VOD Facebook group would be someone informing others about electricity returning to her area after 70 or so hours or too much water on a particular road, a badly damaged road and better possible alternative routes. Meanwhile, some might share about a recent burglary or seeing suspicious persons to warn others.
A post or call for help in the Offroad club Pakistan group on Facebook saved lives over the past few days as the men in 4x4 jeeps, or Sport Utility Vehicles, rescued people, helped deliver groceries as well as medicines in the flooded areas.
Similarly, in the Karachi One2One Concierge group one found posts such as asking if anyone could help someone find a night attendant for someone who was sick. One2One Admin is also a community focussed on helping each other in daily life.
There are other groups on Facebook such as ‘Halaat Updates’ and ‘Weather Updates Karachi’.
Halaat Updates adds you after a bit of scrutiny and after you agree to a few community conditions. The group mostly keeps one updated on what is happening on the political side, and who in the government or city administration will do what about what.
Weather Updates Karachi, as the name suggests, is to keep one informed about the weather when the Meteorological office fails you. The admins of the group use satellite images to support the information they share. And they are rarely wrong.
Aside from these groups, which anyone can join and see as the aim is to extend help to all by reading and learning from each other’s experience, there are also the WhatsApp broadcast lists. Many use this option in WhatsApp to become an annoyance when they send you a greeting every day or a regular piece of advice or quotation. But there are also some who have used it to spread the word.
A WhatsApp broadcast list is one that is different from a WhatsApp group where everyone can chat or react if the admins have allowed it. A WhatsApp broadcast list has no chat option with others, though you may talk to the owner of the list. It is also quite private as no one, other than the list owner, knows who else is on the list.
One such very useful WhatsApp broadcast list is the Karachi Alerts, which shares news about things happening around you, which you should know about. If you want to know if the Muharram or Eid moon has been sighted, you may check on Karachi Alerts. If you are confused about the summer vacations extending or not, you can see what Karachi Alerts has to say. In times of crisis and emergency, too, Karachi Alerts has been alerting folks about the latest.
The gentleman behind this extremely valuable and reliable list is Corporate Crisis and Security Manager Norbert Almeida. Many on social media receive news from his broadcast list to then share on social media in the form of posts or tweets. “My work helps me know things first-hand,” Almeida told Dawn.
No bit of information is shared blindly. “Since I have cops, journalists including beat reporters on my list also, I verify the information before sharing it,” he said.
Asked if he has issues with people tweeting info they received through him, Almeida said that he has no such issues. “It is fun to see them tweeting the info,” he said. But his WhatsApp broadcast list also grew into a Twitter account by the same name and a very useful blog with helpful tips on security.
There are so many people on Almeida’s WhatsApp list and they are all dependent on his alerts. In fact they feel quite handicapped if he doesn’t share anything for long. “Lots of people on the list complain if I am busy or travelling and not sharing info. Basically, people on the list stopped watching the news or going online to verify what they got from me. Since it was all free and 99 per cent accurate and well before widely known to others, they got hooked on it,” he said.

6,The sky is the limit,"KARACHI: It’s always a delight to see paintings made in two genres with two different techniques having, somehow, ...","KARACHI: It’s always a delight to see paintings made in two genres with two different techniques having, somehow, a similar powerful effect on the viewer. This usually happens, if it’s not the case for all times, when the makers of those paintings let the heart sit in the driver’s seat of their creative vehicle and all that they have learnt in terms of craft, which is to with the thinking faculty, are pushed to the back seat. 
Technique is important, make no mistake, but when you create something with all your heart and soul in it, the truthfulness of the effort shines through. The argument is meant to introduce a striking two-person show titled Under the Sky that’s under way at the Canvas Art gallery. 
The artists whose works were on display at the exhibition that concluded recently are Hala Nasir and Mamoon Tahir. 
While the artworks are the most persuasive way of providing evidence of how feelingly they are produced, the thoughts of the two artists may elucidate their intentions. 
Hala says, “Sometimes when we are travelling, we see this side of society in our surroundings, the poor and the gypsy children… Even though the world has progressed a lot, some faces, poor and innocent, are still a very real part of our society.” 
For Mamoon, “I often learn so much more about myself from viewing the final painting. In the same way, the seed puts forth a blade of grass through the hard soil and the mountain burst into colour in a display of sheer enthusiastic creation and life, I know the energy within every seed is also in me…” 
Notice the verbal integrity of the two creative people: the former carries a collective responsibility and the latter explores the self to reach a larger conclusion. Meaning: Hala uses faces to keep things in the realm of reality (‘Sneak Peek’, wool thread on canvas) and Mamoon opts for a surrealistic approach to let art reflect life (‘Dynamics of Two Worlds’, acrylic on board). Both do their bits with beauty and grace.

7,"Cases of self-harm on the rise among youth, says expert",Counselling clinic opens for public at Karachi University...,"KARACHI: Incidence of self-harm, depression, suicidal thoughts and anger have increased dramatically over the past two decades among the youth who need counselling as well as support from the family to cope with the pressures of life. 
This was stated by Prof Qudsia Tariq, chairperson of the Karachi University’s psychology department, while speaking to Dawn against the backdrop of some significant steps the department has recently taken to promote mental health, particularly among students. 
The measures included the establishment of a clinic where trained counsellors are providing services at minimal charges and launch of collaboration with four professional bodies catering to the needs of differently abled persons and promoting mental health. 
“The major reason behind the growing frustration and confusion among the youth is the communication gap between parents and children, which you may also describe as a generation gap. Today, parents have no time for their children to listen to their day-to-day happenings and share their small achievements and failures,” Prof Tariq noted. 

Counselling clinic opens for public at Karachi University

Parents, she pointed out, just wanted their children to get enrolled in a reputed school, obtain a good grade and get a high-paying job later in life. 
“To fulfil this dream, often both husband and wife have to work and practically leave with no productive time at the end of the day for their children who need their support to understand his or her individuality and the pressures of life,” she explained. 
Parents should talk and try to understand their children instead of imposing their views and decisions on them, she added. 
Positive development 
Prof Tariq, who has been practicing as a clinical psychologist for 26 years, shared that a major positive development that had taken place in a few decades in the field was that now people realised the importance of mental health and counselling. 
“Earlier, patients who had already been diagnosed with psychiatric illness were brought to us by their families. Today, the patient understands that he or she has a problem that needs to be addressed and approaches us directly. But, the flip side is the growing number of patients.” 
About the KU counselling clinic, Prof Tariq said her team had ensured that clients were provided with complete confidentiality. “This is one of the most important things in counselling as there are issues, for instance, sexual harassment, which are difficult to be discussed at home and, at times, even with a friend. You need someone who is not only a patient listener but also understands your predicament and suggests a solution.” 
In its efforts to enhance research and students’ training on the campus, the department has recently signed memorandums of understanding with four organisations — the Centre for Autism Rehabilitation and Training, Special Olympics Pakistan, Karwan-i-Hayat Institute for Mental Health Care and Charter for Compassion Society of Pakistan. 
According to teachers, this collaboration will provide students with the much-needed platform to learn and get first-hand experience in dealing with mental health issues. 
The counselling clinic is open for the general public from 11am to 4pm.

He also announced a relief package for the rehabilitation of roads in the badly affected areas and also compensation against loss of life and property.
The CM received briefings from the officials concerned on rain devastation and position of Manchhar Lake, Darawat Dam and other water bodies in the two districts.
Later, speaking to the media at different places, Mr Shah said that all main and link roads connecting hundreds of villages within the Kachho belt of Dadu district would be rehabilitated under the emergency relief package.
He said distribution of ration among the effected families in Kachho, Kohistan and other rain-hit areas of Dadu and Jamshoro districts had already begun and financial assistance would be extended to the families soon. Initially, he added, Dadu district’s six main roads linking Johi with Wahi Pandhi, Chhinni, Drigh Bala, Sawaro, Haji Khan and TR Khan would be rehabilitated while the damaged bridges along Kachho belt and Khirthar mountain range would be repaired. 

Pledges compensation over loss of life and property, rehabilitation of roads and bridges

He issued necessary directions in this regard to the officials concerned.
He told the media that sufficient stocks of ration, tents, medicines, plastic sheets and other relief goods had already been made available to the district administrations for distribution among the affected people. 
In Johi, he distributed the relief goods among 1,000 families living in Chhinni, Sawaro, TR Khan and Shah Hassan union councils. He took an aerial view of Nai Gaaj dam and Manchhar Lake which received hill torrents during the recent week-long heavy rainfall in the region. Several hundred villages along the route have been hit by flooding and their road links with Johi town washed away. Over 500 families in the area have been rendered homeless.
Dadu Deputy Commissioner Syed Murtaza Ali Shah, briefing the CM on rain devastation, said that five people were reported killed and over 550 houses destroyed during the heaviest spell of rain which had started on July 23 and continued for about 36 hours in the Khirthar range and Kachho belt. The water level in Nai Gaaj went up to 24 feet from10 feet during the July 7 to 27 rainfall, he added.
He said that 16 boats were employed to pick marooned people from their villages and take them to safe places. Over 2,000 ailing and injured people were provided treatment at four health facilities and eight mobile medical camps in Kachho, he added.
The CM announced a compensation of Rs1 million against each rain-related death.

The book launching ceremony was organised by Sindhi Adabi Sangat’s Barani Mugheri chapter and a panel of writers, Prof Mukhtiar Samo, Imam Rashdi, Prof Jam Jamali, Comrade Kareem Baloch and Ms Nayab Sarkash, presided over the proceedings. 
Dr Siyal said that literature had been his passion for his entire life. “I’ve written continuously without expecting any reward from anyone. A book remains its writer’s property until it is in his possession in manuscript form but once it has been published and made public readers get a right over it in their own way,” he said. 
He said that he had conducted research for his Ph.D on a unique topic Mir Nawaz Ai Niaz: Critical study of his personality and poetry. Naz was a seasoned poet of Talpur ruling family whose unique love with a woman named Bali was well documented in history, he said. 
He said that an officer of Sindh culture department took his thesis from him for publication but it had yet not been published.
Prof Samo said that comrade Kareem had done a good work by compiling the articles which thoroughly highlighted the works of Dr Siyal in prose, poetry and research. Out of a total of 27 books Dr Siyal had authored, 14 were on poetry for children, which was a unique credit because there was dearth of literature on children in Sindhi, he said. 
Imam Rashdi, a historian, said that Dr Siyal was very senior and dear poet of Sindh. He had worked tremendously during his tenure as secretary general of SAS. His poetry and prose had deep, thought-provoking ideas, which readers appreciated highly, he said. 
Prof Jam Jamali said that Dr Siyal was a creative writer whose literary works maintained their own stamp on Sindhi literature. He was such a writer who enjoyed cosmopolitan outlook in his thinking and as well as in action, he said. 
Comrade Kareem, who compiled the book, said that he was happy at his work because it had introduced to readers all the literary work done by Dr Siyal over half a century. 
Murtaza Kalhoro, former secretary of the press club, said that the club had always extended cooperation for the promotion of literature. 
Among others who spoke on the occasion were; Nayab Sarkash, Qadir Jagirani, Yasmin Brohi and Faqir Mohammad Sindhi, while singer Shiraz Abbasi sang poetry of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai on the occasion to entertain the audience.

12,Senior doctors agitate against ‘unfair’ posting of junior fellow as DG health,Claim move is in violation of high court order...,"HYDERABAD: Senior doctors of the Sindh health department have sent a representation to the health secretary urging him to allow the look-after charge of the director general of health services to anyone from amongst senior most doctors in BS-20 grade.  
Four doctors, three of them are in BS-20 grade and one is the senior-most in BS-19 grade, submitted the representation after DG Health Services Dr Juman Bahoto handed over the charge to a BS-19 doctor, Dr Waqar Mehmood Memon, on July 15.  
Dr Bahoto has proceeded on ex-Pakistan leave to attend an international conference on AIDS in Canada.  
The applicants are Dr Nasrullah Shaikh, Dr Shahabuddin Qureshi, Dr Sohrab Hisbani and Dr Lachman Das.  
The provincial services, general administration and coordination (SGA&C) department had allowed the ex-Pakistan leave to the DG on July 13.  

Claim move is in violation of high court order

The aggrieved doctors have taken exception to the fact that the DG handed over the look-after charge to a junior-most doctor in BS-19 (Dr Waqar Mehmood Memon), who was posted in the provincial directorate at Hyderabad. They believe that the action is against the prescribed law, rules and regulations.  
They argued that as per the job description, an additional director general (ADG) of health services should look after the charge of DG health in his absence. They said that the ADG Hyderabad, Dr Khursheed Qureshi (BS-20), was available while six deputy director generals (DDGs) in BS-20 grade were presently posted at the directorate. These officers are Dr Nasrullah Shaikh, Dr Shahabuddin Qureshi, Dr Sohrab Khan Hisbani, Dr Mohammad Arif, Dr Nanad Lal Dewani and Dr Tazeen Memon. All of them were experienced and capable of handling official assignments, they stressed. They called for cancelling the look-after charge of Dr Waqar Mehmood and giving the same to an ADG or DDG in BS-20.  
A division bench of the Sindh High Court comprising Justice Salahuddin Panhwar and Justice Adnanul Karim Memon had on Sept 21, 2021 ordered removal of all junior officers from the senior positions given to them on any ground.
Pursuant upon this order, the health department had removed then DG Health Dr Irshad Memon who, being an officer of BS-19, was serving as the DG health. After his removal, Dr Juman Bahoto was given the post on Sept 27, 2021. And now the same DG Health has handed over the charge of his office to a junior-most officer in the directorate, according to the representation.   
Meanwhile, health department sources claimed on Friday that the officers who submitted the representation might be issued show-cause notices by Sindh government.  
Sindh health department, in a cavalier fashion, has been dealing administrative issues/matters for which superior courts’ repeated directives were issued. The recent re-posting of a planning wing officer of health department Abdul Sattar Jatoi vide July 27 notification has been recommended by health secretary Zulfikar Shah in spite of the fact that he was removed only 26 days back by Sindh government.  
Health department has recommended his posting for a position/post whose ‘re-designation’ has been held illegal by Sindh Services Tribunal and the tribunal’s order was upheld by Supreme Court. It was a clinical side post of AMS in BS-19 which the officer got re-designated only for himself as a ‘person specific’ post to deny his senior batch mate his right of promotion six years back.
