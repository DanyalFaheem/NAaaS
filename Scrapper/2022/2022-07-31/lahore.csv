1,Updated form a must for solemnising nikah in Punjab,Union councils’ secretaries told to ensure provision of the marriage document to the nikah registrars.,"LAHORE: The Punjab local government and community development department has issued updated Form-II of nikahnama and directed the union councils’ (UCs) secretaries to ensure provision of the marriage document to the nikah registrars for solemnising nikah in their respective jurisdictions.
A handout says the Form-II of nikahnama has been appended to the Punjab Muslim Family Rules under Muslim Family Law Ordinance, 1961, containing there the amendment regarding incorporation of oath of Khatam-e-Nabuwat (finality of prophet hood) with the direction to ensure that the only the updated document should be used to solemnise the nikah.
It says the nikah registrars have been directed also to use the updated Form-II to solemnise the nikah, failing which strict disciplinary action shall be taken against the UC secretary concerned.  
If a nikah registrar is found not using the updated Form-II, he shall be proceeded against under sub-rule (4) of Rule 7 of Punjab Muslim Family Rules under Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961, it warns.
Both the bride and the groom will be required to sign the oath of Khatam-e-Nabuwat at the time of solemnising nikah, it says.
The law states, “If any person to whom a licence has been granted under this rule contravenes any of the conditions of such license, he shall be punishable with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month, or with fine which may extend to two hundred rupees or with both”.
The move to incorporate the oath of Khatam-e-Nabuwat in the nikahnama was initiated by Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi as speaker of the Punjab Assembly and the amendment was made through legislation.

3,Ahsan threatens to take Imran to court,"""I am taking you to court where you have to prove that I am involved in corruption,"" he says.","LAHORE: A visibly angered Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal on Saturday threatened to take former prime minister Imran Khan to court.  
“I am taking you to court where you have to prove that I am involved in corruption,” he told Khan.  
Addressing a press conference, he said: “I am on record claiming that during my five-year tenure, I oversaw Rs3,200 billion development expenditure. If someone proves even 32 paisa corruption in it, I will accept any punishment. But if not, Imran (Khan) should get ready for consequences.”  
“Imran Khan, who presents himself as Mr Clean, is in fact Mr Corrupt. It is him who gave Rs50 billion, laundered and corrupt money traced by the UK National Crime Agency (NCA), to a developer in exchange of some gold and diamond sets. This money, which belonged to the state of Pakistan, was given to an individual through the cabinet decision, which was kept secret even from ministers and they signed the dotted lines.  
“Imran Khan is an egotist hatemonger who is spreading lies and misleading people through social media. His playwright is (Adolf) Hitler who acted exactly the same way and left behind a devastated Germany; Imran Khan would not prove any different,” the minister blasted.  
Taking exception to the Election Commission, Iqbal wondered why it was delaying decision on the foreign funding case. “Has the commission been scared into inaction in the case? If so, it is going to a very bad example: it would open the way for everyone to threaten it into silence. It should announce decision immediately. With so many documentary evidences, what is the commission waiting for.  
“It is not only evidence which proves the case against Imran Khan, but his behaviour as well. When all proofs reached the commission, Imran Khan asked it to move to in-camera hearing. Why would a clean man do so, especially who has been demanding open trial in all other cases against him? He has been shouting from the rooftop to demand money trail of others, but wants to hide his own money trail. All these evidences and his behaviour make it an open and shut case. Why has Election Commission been sitting on it?”  
Iqbal conceded that economic decisions taken by his (PML-N) government hurt it politically and caused an embarrassing defeat in the recent by-elections. “Yes, we knew these decisions were going to reduce party’s political capital and they have. But, one must not forget who put us into economic straitjacket? It was Imran Khan; let his ministers (Shaukat Tareen or Hafiz Sheikh) deny that it were them who finalised deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which forced the PML-N to take those hard decisions. The exchequer has no fiscal space for any kind of subsidy and the entire international price hike is being shifted to the people of Pakistan. They are causing economic pain and the government is aware of it, but helpless.”  
“The PML-N, as a party, is trying to control the genie at a greater political cost. But this economic altruism is necessary for the sake of country and ending political and economic uncertainty. Imran Khan and his supporters in institutions are trying to spread political uncertainty. Some decisions in the recent past had added fuel to this fire and created speculative economy. The increasing imbalance between rupee and dollar is directly linked to those decisions. This kind of national disservice must end forthwith,” he demanded.

4,PTI may mute calls for early vote,By-elections in three constituencies of Punjab are scheduled for September 11.,"GUJRAT: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf leadership will not be so vocal for early elections in the changing political scene, believes a senior leader of coalition partner Pakistan Muslim League-Q.  
“The PTI chief has been advised by some aides in the coalition that upcoming by-polls give an opportunity to the party to consolidate its position in Punjab and KP (where the coalition is in power) to pose a serious political threat to rival parties in next general election.
By-election in three  constituencies of Punjab, including NA-157 (Multan), PP-139 (Sheikhupura) and PP-241 (Bahawalnagar) is scheduled for September 11. It will be followed by another such exercise as 11 PTI MNAs have been de-seated by the ECP following the acceptance of their resignations by the NA speaker. 
“The coalition can easily face the challenge of these polls while being in power in two provinces,” the senior PML-Q leader told Dawn.

‘Completion of uplift projects; victory in coming by-polls may consolidate party’s position in Punjab, KP’

He said some background discussions between the rival parties on  the matter of going for an early vote had  revealed that the PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari was not ready to  dissolve the Sindh Assembly “apparently due to the fear of the PTI rise in  several parts of Sindh.”
He said Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi had once again assured the PTI Chairman Imran Khan of honouring the commitment of dissolving the Punjab Assembly whenever Mr Khan advised so.
“The assurance was given by Mr Elahi to Mr Khan during his first meeting in Bani Gala after taking oath at the presidency,” he said.  
Another well-placed source in the PML-Q told Dawn the chances of going to elections very soon were slim as PTI chief had tasked the CM to focus on re-launching of health card, Ehsaas Ration and other public welfare projects initiated by the PTI government led by Usman Buzdar.
He said several mega uplift schemes initiated by the Buzdar government had been slowed down by the PML-N government of Hamza Shahbaz. So the task was also to expedite such schemes that were near completion or even half completed so that the lawmakers of the coalition parties could show some uplift projects to the masses in their respective constituencies prior to the next elections.
He said discussion was underway on the formation of the provincial cabinet.Asked about the new CM’s policy towards the PML-N led federal government, he said developing a sort of working relationship with the federal government was not possible in the current tense political environment in the country, especially after what the PML-N did with the PTI and PML-Q during a short period in power.
“CM Elahi will follow policy guidelines given by the PTI chief,” he said.

5,Harking back: Lahore and bitter lessons of our ‘forgotten past’,"It seems Lahore is much larger than what our imagination allows us to fathom. When one travels to faraway places, in...","It seems Lahore is much larger than what our imagination allows us to fathom. When one travels to faraway places, in one form or another, memories of our city come forth, normally in emotive ways.
The last two weeks have been spent in San Francisco visiting my daughter. The begum has been busy cooking away and freezing the most delicious dishes which yours truly will never reach. Also my two grandsons are spoiling their Nani beyond measure. So that allows me time to research on various aspects of Lahore’s history.
In this piece we will dwell on the famous ‘Ghadar’ Museum in San Francisco. Then on to the amazing Partition 1947 Archives in Berkeley University, and lastly, no less importantly, are the people one meets while walking along old train trails, as also to the nearest market. In California distances are massive, so to shop one goes in huge cars.
My attempt to visit the Ghadar Museum, an event which in 1915 and 1916 Punjabis living in California collected funds to sail to British India to ‘invade’ and liberate their homeland. They collected a lot of arms and hired a Japanese ship called Kamagata Maru and set sail for India. At Calcutta a majority were butchered on the docks of the Bengal capital. But then a lot of them managed to make it overland to the Punjab and Lahore.
In Lahore in Lohari Mandi they set up an office under the leadership of Maulvi Barkat Ali, Ram Chandra and Sohan Singh Barkna and launched a newspaper called ‘Ghadar’. It became hugely popular. But then with local assistance the colonialists very soon traced and executed most of them. A few like Taraknath Das were arrested and sent to jail for being ‘German agents’. The promising Ghadar Movement fizzled out.
However, the California-based newspaper ‘Ghadar’ continued and was seen by US authorities as an effort by conspirators and they were sent to prison for violating ‘neutrality’ laws. So hundreds of “Ghadri Babas” spent long prison sentences, and were released after promising to work free on Californian field.
Today those ‘Ghadri’ families own huge tracts of agricultural lands and are very well off. The museum called the Gadar Museum continues but under Indian official auspices and is open only once a week on a Wednesday, and one can visit it on appointment only. The Indian government keeps a tight control on them. Probably the ‘Khalistan Scare’ still works on their minds. But then books and artifacts from Lahore and the Punjab are on display and worth visiting.
Next in Berkeley University is a new institution called the ‘1947 Partition Archives’ which is led by an amazing scholar Dr Guneeta Singh Bhalla. In her team of eight persons, they collect stories of partition, in video, written, photographs and sound of this greatest human exodus in history, which remains the least remembered in our land. This in itself is a tragedy. “Just imagine how the German Holocaust is exhibited and our Exodus was much bigger in a shorter time period, yet our children have no idea about it”.
This Oral History Research Program needs to be replicated all over the sub-continent. My interest was fired by the possibility of the Bradlaugh Hall being conserved and a 1947 Partition Museum Trust being set up in Lahore by concerned educationists and scholars. It might take two years before the hall is ready, but preparation for the Museum needed attention now. One hopes people will support this effort. A Trust is the best way to ensure its longevity.
Lastly, let me return to real human beings. As I walked one day along the old Iron Trail of old steam trains in San Ramon, one crossed an Indian couple who looked very Punjabi. After a friendly greeting they asked where I was from. ‘Lahore’. The lady virtually exploded in happiness and said: “My family was from Vachoowali in Lahore”. She started with the strange question: “Is it still there”. Of course, places never disappear, was my response. She quickly broke into another story when her husband joined in.
“My name is Khanna. My father had a shop in Anarkali, which we just left and fled the mobs. We lived in Lohari Gate”. So here was a couple from Lahore who remembered Lahore. We spent 20 minutes on the trail and exchanged experiences and I asked Mr. Khanna to contact the 1947 Archives office in Berkeley, which he promised to do. “I will ask my son to make a donation”, he said.
The Khanna family now live in Chandigarh where they tell me that there is a group of old Lahoris who gather every afternoon once their children go to work. “We do not discuss Lahore all the time, but it is our prime reason to get together. It is not that we remain alien to the environment, but that being old Lahoris gives us a special reason to meet.
This reminded me of an Indian couple who stayed with us in Lahore a few years ago. They were the Malhotra family, an educationist-publisher couple. I took Arun to his home town Bhera, where with utmost precision he walked to his old house. At the doorway was a dilapidated temple in which two donkeys stood. Mr. Malhotra went silent and returned. He did not speak all the way back to Lahore. Sad event it was.
His wife Goldy’s father belonged to Ludhiana and had their home in Lower Mall, just behind the government office that faces the Town Hall. It is a massive house and she is always welcome when she is in Lahore. We have stuck up a Facebook friendship and she loves learning about her city. The couple’s son has migrated to Canada and they visit every year.
This brings me to what a lot of Indian and Pakistani aging couples do every year. Middle class families have two or three children, whom they educate well. They are mostly computer wizards and they are all pulled to California. So as parents they visit for six months every year, and if you by chance happen to be in San Francisco or its nearby towns, you surely will bump into them.
That is why Lahore can be seen everywhere. Be it Cambridge University in England or any top USA university or a computer-led company, you are surely to come across this set of Lahoris. Be they doctors or MBAs or any qualified person, opportunities abound. By the time you read this column we will have returned to my university in Cambridge, and very soon will be in Lahore. It has been a fruitful two weeks, but then a lot of reading remains.

According to Manager Shaheen Construction Company (which distributes bills in Rahim Yar Khan division) Allah Ditta, there are almost 700,000 Mepco consumers in RYK circle and only 213,000 in RYK division.
He alleges the meter readers do not get reading on scheduled time printed on the bills and visit the area eight to 10 days later. He says 15th of each month is the date for getting reading but for the batch number 9 meter readers recorded the consumed units on July 24 and its due date for payment was July 28. But due to fault in printer of computerised billing section of Mepco, the bills were delivered on July 28 and “how can we manage to distribute in a large area the same day,” he says.
Allah Ditta says during the tenure of former senior engineer, the reading dates and releasing of bills by Mepco were on time but when the new SE assumed charge three months ago, the entire bills distribution system got disturbed.
He alleges that on Thursday a consumer near Hospital Road beat his employee Bilal Masih for delivering electricity bill on due date.
Mepco spokesperson Jamshaid Niazi says there are many complaints of not receiving the bills by Mepco in RYK division and the matter would be highlighted by the contractor to SE for its solution so that the SE could extend the dates after releasing a news or advertisement in the media for a large number of consumers.
He says the SE was on leave for performing Haj but recently he assumed the charge. He says there was a fault in the printer and only Mepco vendors can repair.

10,Drainage issue on Shakargarh’s main road resurges,Lawyers hold strike over the issue...,"NAROWAL: The main road of the Shakargarh city gets submerged by rainwater and sewage during rains due to the faulty drainage system. The issue has been lingering on for the last two years as the administration as well as public representatives allegedly ignore the frequent requests for resolution to the issue by the citizens and traders.  
Due to frequent inundation, the road, from Shakargarh-Norkot road, the main artery of the city gets submerged has become bumpy at places, especially near Antuvali, where sewage has been accumulating on it since long.  
The lawyers on Saturday boycotted the courts in protest over the faulty drainage sewerage system that causes the issue.

Lawyers hold strike over the issue

Talking to Dawn, the citizens, Faroz Din and Muhammad Qamar, say everyone has to pass through the stagnant water to enter and leave the city. They say new drivers and private vehicles using the road would often get stuck in the dirty water, adding that an ambulance carrying a heart patient got stuck in two-foot deep dirty water in Antuvali the other day. 
He says the local people pushed the ambulance out and the patient was shifted to another ambulance to be sent to hospital.
