Over the incident, an inquiry was ordered to ascertain the role of the police as to how the gunmen had the information about the movement of the police along with the suspect.
The police said the suspect was arrested in connection with a murder and attempted murder case dated November 25, 2021, at Bhambar Tarar in which Naveed Hussain was killed and his son Walid Hussain injured.
About two days ago, the investigators arrested the suspect and took his custody from a court on two days’ physical remand. During the interrogation, he disclosed the place where he had hid the murder weapon, a Kalashnikov.
Over the disclosure, a six-member police team armed with weapons set out to the place for the recovery of the weapon taking the suspect along, the police said. On their way to Bhambar Tarar from the Koral police station, three men riding a Mehran car intercepted them at Kirpa and opened fire on the police vehicle from the front side.
The policemen disembarked from the vehicle and took cover behind it and retaliated too. The police vehicle was damaged due to the firing during which the attackers set the suspect free and escaped.
Over the incident, a case was registered at the Koral police station under different sections of the law, including section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) against the unidentified attackers.
Senior police officers said it was the second such incident since July 14 in which gunmen attacked police and set free suspects.
On July 14, four persons armed with weapons intercepted a police team at E-11 and set free their handcuffed accomplice. The suspect was arrested in connection with the murder of a delivery boy at F-9 Park on June 5. He was later killed in an encounter with police at Bhara Kahu.
Both the police teams and staff of the police stations are under suspicion as how the armed persons knew the police movements along with the suspects and their routes. A spokesman for the police, when contacted, said an inquiry was ordered to probe the role of the police team and staff of the Koral police station to establish the facts.

1,Islamabad’s Safe City Project turns out to be white elephant,"Since 2016, not a single criminal traced or arrested through surveillance system, police officers say.","ISLAMABAD: The $125 million Safe City Project inaugurated six years ago in the capital has so far failed to produce the desired results and achieve its objectives.
Police officials say neither a single incident/crime was prevented nor any criminal arrested with the help of the system. Besides, two scanners, which were part of the project, also disappeared without being traced.
Senior police officers told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the Safe City Project was made operational in June 2016 with 1,950 close circuit television (CCTV) cameras, but since then not a single incident or crime has been prevented through the system. Besides, no criminal, suspect or proclaimed offender was arrested through the surveillance of the cameras.
The project also failed to assist the police in chasing and arresting culprits who escaped after criminal activities, they added.

Since 2016, not a single criminal traced or arrested through surveillance system, police officers say

The project was launched in 2014 to counter terrorism and criminal activities by monitoring the movement of people through the security cameras. The Rs6 billion project was initially conceived in 2008 but could not be launched due to unavailability of funds till 2014.
Under the project, 130 LED screens would be installed at the control room for monitoring the CCTVs. These would have been equipped with modern and sophisticated software worth Rs250 million which was used only in USA and England at that time.
The CCTVs can capture an image of 32 mega pixels, giving them an ability to pick out a single ace from a gathering even at a distance of 30 metres. The project was equipped with a modern 4GLTE communication system to connect the control room with the then Rapid Response Unit, now Counter-Terrorism Department.
The aim and objective of the project was prevention of terrorism and crime and keep an eye on suspects and arrest them along wanted criminals through surveillance with the cameras besides chasing and arresting criminals escaping after conducting a crime, the officers said. But during a period of six years, it failed to get success in achieving the main objective even though there were 1,806 Interactive Video Systems (IVS) and 191 Automatic Number Plate Readers (ANPR) due to improper handling, administrative and other reasons.
Since January 1, 2016, the capital police registered 57,719 cases, including 7,628 crime against persons and 17,857 crime against property cases, including robbery and thefts, the officers said. The contribution of the Safe City Project to check the crime was not more than 15 per cent.
The project, however, assisted the police counter protests and demonstrations against the sitting government and identified its participants. Hence, it served the government instead of the citizens, said the officers.
Earlier, the police solved cases and arrested criminals by traditional policing which was replaced with the mobile tracking system or geo-fencing, so the Safe City does not make any difference, it only eased the investigators’ job.
There is no proper backup to save recordings of the CCTVs and only one backup is available with 60 days’ recording.
Most of the time, scores of the CCTVs remain nonoperational due to several reasons. During the last one month, about 300 CCTVs were repaired and made operational.
Now the CCTVs and software to run the control room of the Safe City Project have become outdated, the officers said. These CCTVs are not night- or rain-vision devices, as a result, there are many problems to get the desired results from the project.
Under the project, 1,997 cameras were installed in the capital but during the past six years the capital has expended and now the number of cameras covered only 40 per cent area.
There are only 70 screens installed at Safe City Project office and a team of 72 officials monitor the screens in different shifts.
Increasing the number of CCTVs from 1997 to 4,000 will make no difference as there are not much screens and staff available for monitoring, they added.
Two scanners were also bought as part of the Safe City Project and one of them was given to Karachi by the late Rehman Malik when he was holding the office of the interior minister. The other scanner disappeared, the officers added.
A spokesman for the police, when contacted, told Dawn that there were 1,997 CCTV cameras out of which 1,922 were operational. 
He also confirmed that not a single incident/crime had been prevented or any criminal caught with the help of the Safe City Project so far.
However, 3,785 cases were solved since its operational, he said, adding that there was only one backup and recording of 60 days was available.
Replying to a question, he said only police had access to the CCTV cameras. 
However, if required, other agencies and departments are given access through proper protocols. Citizens’ privacy is ensured through international rules on right of privacy and electronic data regulations act 2016, he added.

Mushaal, in her letter to Indian Premier, demanded that the Indian government should release JKLF leader Chairman Yasin Malik on health grounds and give him an opportunity of fair trial.
She said her husband was moving towards slow death due to governments callous attitude towards him coupled with his hunger to death strike.
She warned if anything bad happened to the voice of Kashmir freedom struggle, the Indian state would be held responsible for his murder.
Mushaal also appreciated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for making a strong demarche to the Indian High Commission for in Islamabad over the fast deteriorating health condition of Yasin Malik.
In a letter addressed to the Indian PM, Mushaal demanded her husband’s immediate release from prison in view of his precarious health condition that aggravated after his decision to go on a hunger-strike on July 22.
The Indian diplomat was conveyed Pakistans deep dismay on the Indian authorities latest move of implicating Yasin Malik in two more bogus cases crafted around incidents that happened at least three decades ago.
Despite numerous pleas, she lamented that Yasin Malik has been denied his lawful right of personal appearance and cross-examination in the on-going trials, it added.
She said that having no legal recourse at his disposal, Yasin Malik went on a hunger strike unto death on July 22, 2022.
The chairperson stated that the long-drawn illegal incarcerations, implication in fictitious cases, inhuman torture at the hands of the Indian occupation forces and the worst forms of political victimisation have already had a cumulative grave impact on the physical, mental and emotional well-being of Yasin Malik.
Keeping in view Yasin Malik’s sharply deteriorating health indicators, Mushaal urged the government of India to provide him urgent medical care, immediately release him from the prison, cancel his fallacious conviction under fictitious charges and withdraw all other fabricated cases that have been mischievously spun around him.

7,Two sentenced to five years in land grabbing case,"One of the convicts arrested, other escapes from court...","ISLAMABAD: A local court on Saturday convicted two persons in a land grabbing case and awarded them five years imprisonment along with a fine of Rs1 million.
Following the court’s verdict, police arrested one of the convicts, Mohammad Afzal Khokhar. However, the other, Chaudhry Abdul Rehman, escaped before pronouncement of the verdict.
The court however ordered the senior superintendent of police (SSP) as well as station house officer (SHO) Koral to arrest Rehman and send him to the Adiala jail.
The complainant in the case, Ishtiaqul Salikeen, had initially nominated Imtiaz alias Taji Khokhar and Chaudhry Ali Akbar along with the above mentioned convicts in a decade-old case of grabbing 135 kanals. Their names were, however, deleted from the complaint after their demise.

One of the convicts arrested, other escapes from court

The complainant contended that Rehman and his accomplices asked him to sell his 135 kanals for his private housing society.
As per the complaint, Salikeen refused to sell his land and turned down their offer. However, they forcibly took possession of the land.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Abdul Ghafoor Kakar in March this year had ordered the deputy commissioner, inspector general and the SSP for the recovery of the land under the Land Dispossession Act 2005 from Rehman, adding the possession of the land be given to the complainant, who as per the court order was its actual owner.
The complainant contended that Rehman along with his accomplices forcibly took over possession of his 135 kanals and converted it into over 400 residential and commercial units and sold out to different buyers.
He said on the direction of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), the additional deputy commissioner revenue (ADCR) had appointed a commission to furnish demarcation of the land. The revenue officer in his report pointed out that “multiple high-rise commercial and residential buildings were constructed over there” and stressed the need for assistance of the Survey of Pakistan as the demarcation could not be possible by the revenue officials.
As per the order of ADSJ, the demarcation report was then submitted but the owners of the society objected that the ADCR was supposed to complete the job but it was done by a naib tehsildar.
The judge, on the other hand, was of the view that the land was demarcated in accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court. He directed the senior police officers and the district administration to give possession of the land to Salikeen from the “illegal occupation and possession of the respondents or any other illegal occupants.”
Rehman then filed an appeal against the order of the ADSJ in the IHC which is pending adjudication.
The ADSJ, hearing another complaint filed by the same complainant seeking criminal proceedings against Rehman and Khokhar, held that they had forcibly grabbed the land and convicted them under Illegal Dispossession Act.

8,Fate of Pakistani medical graduates working in US hangs in balance,Pakistan has failed to meet the criteria of the World Federation for Medical Education and the deadline is approaching fast.,"ISLAMABAD: Doctors who graduated from Pakistani colleges may not be able to work in the United States (US) after Jan 2024 as the country has failed to meet the criteria of the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) and the deadline is approaching fast.
Defunct Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) had applied for the WFME accreditation and also invited its delegation to visit Pakistan but in 2019, the PMDC was dissolved and Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) was established. Subsequently, the WFME visit was postponed.
In order to get accreditation from the WFME, Pakistan has time till January 2024 and the current Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) Act at present does not meet the criteria to get recognition from the world body.
The PMC, on the other hand, claimed that it had “formally initiated the application process for the recognition” and the entire process, including on-site visit by the WFME, is expected to take 12 to 15 months, which is well within the time frame of Jan 2024.

PMA official expresses fear Pakistan may jump WFME recognition deadline; PMC says nothing to worry about

According to a senior official of the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS), around 25pc of the doctors working in the US has foreign qualifications.
“US’s Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG), after realising that the quality of foreign graduates was deteriorating due to mushroom growth of private-for-profit colleges, on Sept 21, 2011, announced that after January 2023 graduates of only those countries having recognition from WFME will be allowed to appear in United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE),” the official said, adding that the deadline was later extended to January 2024 due to Covid-19.
Though the PMDC had started the process, it was removed via a presidential ordinance and eventually the PMC was established in its stead. 
The PMC started claiming itself to be a licensing body and powers to inspect medical colleges were given to universities. In other words, the PMC does not have control over medical education in the country.
In case of failure to take timely measures, Pakistan might miss the deadline, rendering graduates of Pakistani medical colleges unable to practice medicine in the US.
Talking to Dawn, Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) Secretary General Dr Qaiser Sajjad said it was unfortunate that the PMC had cancelled the visit of the WFME.
“It is not going to be easy to get accreditation by 2024 as there is a long list of conditions which include quality of education, criteria for inspections of colleges, rules, faculty and many other things,” the official added.
Process underway
The PMC, in a written statement, claimed that it has formally initiated the application process. 
The assessment, including physical visit by the WFME, is expected to take 12 to 15 months, which is well within the time frame of 2024 when the WFME recognition will become mandatory to practice medicine in the US.
“The PMC will be closely liaising with the WFME and other international organisations to ensure that all requirements for recognition are fully met prior to the actual assessment and inspection process of the WFME.”
The WFME recognition process initiated runs its full course divided over phases with extensive data and information submissions made and evaluated as per the steps of the WFME process culminating in the final physical visit and assessment of the PMC and selected medical colleges,” it stated.
“It has taken the commission extensive efforts and continued work for almost 18 months to prepare for the WFME process, which is now complete.
The formal application to the WFME to initiate the process required the prior approval of the new 2022 National Standards for Recognition of Medical and Dental Colleges and Teaching Hospitals as well as the 2022 National Medical and Dental Curricula, which have recently been approved and notified….”
The commission has over the last year worked tirelessly to ensure that all regulatory processes, including the recognition and accreditation of teaching hospitals and colleges as well as the admission and examination process and especially the national licensing examination are designed and implemented at the highest international standards including the introduction of digital licensing for practitioners,” it stated.

9,Teachers protest reappointment of official as education authority chief,RAWALPINDI: Teachers and clerks associations on Saturday staged a token sit-in on Murree Road against the ...,"RAWALPINDI: Teachers and clerks associations on Saturday staged a token sit-in on Murree Road against the appointment of Azam Kashif as the District Education Authority chief executive officer and threatened to lock offices and block the main road on Tuesday if the Punjab government did not withdraw the notification by August 1.
The government on Saturday appointed Mr Kashif as the chief of the District Education Authority. 
In the past, the official was appointed twice in the district but transferred on the demand of teachers and clerks.
Punjab Teachers Association and Punjab Clerks Association expressed their resentment and said the official was appointed third time time in the district but teachers and clerks would not accept him because of his behaviour.
All organisations in Rawalpindi working for the rights of teachers and clerks rejected the reappointment by locking the CEO office here.
More than 300 protesters staged the sit-in front of the education offices on Murree Road and later dispersed peacefully. 
Leaders of Punjab Teachers Association Raja Aurangzeb, Raja Shahid Mubarak and representatives of Punjab Educators Association, Punjab Subject Specialist Association, All Pakistan Clerks Association Raja Aftab, Raja Shahid Mehmood and English Teachers Association and others participated in the protest.
The participants were carrying placards and chanting slogans in favour of their demand.
Addressing the gathering, Raja Aurangzeb and Raja Shahid Mubarak said the protest would continue till their demand was met. 
They said the scope of the protest will be expanded from Monday.
“We would lock all the offices of the Education Department from Monday. If the CEO’s appointment is not withdrawn, all teachers and clerks of Rawalpindi district will block the Murree Road from Press Club Rawalpindi to the CEO offices and hold a protest march.”
They said there was no political agenda of the teachers and clerks. 
The PTI always claimed to follow merit but after coming to power its leaders have started appointing their favourites, they added.
The protesters said a junior official was appointed as head of the authority.
They alleged the chief executive officer’s attitude towards teachers and staff, especially female teachers, was very inappropriate and indecent. 
It was his routine to suspend teachers without any reason on a daily basis, they said.

10,"Cultural relations can bring Pakistan, Philippines closer, says envoy",Philippines embassy celebrates their culture with dance and home-cooked culinary delights.,"ISLAMABAD: There were fewer nicer places to be at on a clear sunny monsoon day this Saturday than the Philippines embassy where there was a celebration of the country’s culture with dance and home-cooked culinary delights.
“We are actually celebrating a very important part of our culture and that’s dance. The best traditional dance is Sakuting, which originated from the northern islands in the Philippines. It’s a dance with sticks which is a huge part of Filipino tradition, all of which reflects our rich cultural heritage before foreign influences,” said Dan Erwin Bagaporo, deputy head at the embassy of the Philippines, who hosted close friends from the diplomatic community and a few local guests at a show organised to promote cultural cooperation between his country and Pakistan.
Trees in the embassy looked particularly fine in the morning with the lush green grass and the ground speckled with flowers outside, under the soundtrack of traditional Filipino tunes.
Besides the home-cooked food by the embassy staff such as sweet and sour fish, Pancit Canton and Sotanghon Guisado (vegetable mixed noodles), chicken Adobo, the highlight of the show was that all the guests danced the Sakuting, a dance inspired by martial arts.
“We hope that with the mixing of cultures we can highlight not just our colourful traditions but also complement the Pakistani culture,” said the deputy head.
After a few instruction lessons for the guests, First Secretary of Economic at the Indonesian embassy Indra Noer and his wife Henny Lidya were declared the best dancers.
“I love to dance and Sakuting is quite energetic,” said Henny Lidya quipping.
Charge d’ Affaires Maria Agnus Cervantes told her guests that dances and food were a great way to see and experience the true cultural experience of the Philippines.
Desserts such as Buchi made from rice and seeds and Puto Maya were a must have, especially the Sago at Gulaman to wash down the food, Maria Agnus told her guests.
“Food in the Philippines is varied because of our history especially our seafood. The Sago at Gulaman is one of our favourite drinks for summer in which the Sago comes from the palm and Gulaman comes from sea weed, mixed in sugarcane juice,” said Maria Agnus who believed that Pakistan and the Philippines had numerous opportunities for promoting mutual cultural, economic and trade relations.
“The Philippines is a representative of a strong cultural heritage, which has many similarities with Pakistan’s culture and civilisation, which can be helpful in bringing the two countries closer with significant opportunities for cooperation in tourism,” Maria Agnus said.
In his remarks, Bagaporo said the promotion of cultural relations between Pakistan and the Philippines would also strengthen bilateral economic and trade relations.
He said cultural, diplomatic, economic and trade ties had been established between the two countries in many potential sectors with wider possibilities of further strengthening bilateral relations in the future.
