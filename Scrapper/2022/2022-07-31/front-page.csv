“The federal government will extend all help to the areas that suffered losses due to torrential rains and flash floods, including Balochistan,” Prime Minister Sharif said on Saturday while talking to the media after visiting the Jhal Magsi area of Nasirabad division.

Meanwhile, five people, including three Levies personnel, were reportedly killed in rain and flood-related accidents in Mastung and Zhob. Torrential rains and flash floods wreaked havoc in Khuzdar, Kalat and Mastung districts while flooding continued in the already adversely affected areas of Lasbela and Jhal Magsi districts.
Moreover, the death toll in Chagai and Naushki districts due to floods and heavy rains was reported to be six on Saturday, including three minor girls of a family, an assistant lineman of the Quetta Electric Supply Company, a boy who had been washed away along with his car and a man, who went missing on Thursday, was found dead from Khaisar Nala in Noshki on Saturday.
Traffic on RCD highway was partially suspended after flash floods damaged the road at several locations, while the freight train service between Pakistan and Iran also remained suspended for the third consecutive day owing to damages to the track. Electricity supply to a few towns in Chagai and many areas of Dalbandin was suspended.
Also on Saturday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took an aerial view of the flooded areas of Dadu and Jamshoro districts. He announced a relief package for the rehabilitation of roads and bridges in Dadu as well as compensation of Rs1m for families of each victim of rain-related incidents. He also distributed ration bags among 1,000 affected families.

1,PTI decides to file reference against ‘biased’ CEC,"Punjab, KP assemblies to pass resolutions against poll body chief, discloses Ali Nawaz; PPP terms move ""attempt to blackmail ECP"".","• Punjab and KP assemblies to pass resolutions against poll body chief, discloses Ali Nawaz
• PPP terms move ‘attempt to blackmail’ ECP
ISLAMABAD: While the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is expected to decide the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) funding case within a fortnight, the party on Saturday decided to move a reference against Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan in the judicial commission, accusing him of meeting leaders of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).
The PTI will also get resolutions against the CEC passed from Punjab and Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Assemblies, where it has the majority. 
Besides, the party will contest elections on 11 seats of its members of National Assembly (MNAs) recently denotified by the ECP.
Sources in the ECP said it was a matter of routine that political leaders met the CEC but the most number of leaders who had meetings with the CEC belonged to the PTI. They said just a few weeks ago, PTI vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi had a meeting with the CEC that lasted for almost one and a half hours.
While criticising the PTI decision to move a reference, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) termed it an ‘attempt to blackmail’ the commission.  
PPP leader Saleem Mandviwalla said the PTI was trying to avoid decision of prohibited funding case. “Imran Khan himself used to praise the CEC and now [he] has been trying to threaten him. What has happened that has shattered the confidence of Mr Khan in the CEC. Though we have apprehensions, we will stand by the ECP,” he added.
However, PTI member of the National Assembly from Islamabad Ali Nawaz Awan told Dawn the decision about the reference was made during the party meeting due to the ‘biased attitude’ of the CEC who the lawmaker said also had been meeting the ruling party leadership.
After the recent formation of the PTI-led coalition government in Punjab, he said resolutions would be passed against the CEC from both Punjab and KP assemblies.
“We, all MNAs, had resigned and then deputy speaker Qasim Suri had moved the letter to the ECP to de-notify us, but the ECP remained mum. Recently, a letter to de-notify 11 MNAs was sent to the ECP and it was implemented without hesitation. I assume that government wants to create unrest in the country,” he said.
Asked if the PTI would take part in by-elections on 11 seats of National Assembly, Mr Awan said it was a unanimous decision of PTI that it would not boycott any election. “We will contest all 11 elections, if held, and then we may consider resigning again from those seats,” he said.
While addressing a press conference earlier, senior vice president of the PTI Fawad Chaudhry lashed out at the CEC for meeting with leaders of ruling parties. He said the CEC met leaders of ruling coalition in sheer violation of code of conduct; wherein he discussed prohibited funding case.
He said code of conduct for the judiciary also applied to CEC Sikandar Sultan who along with ECP members had allegedly violated it. He said the ECP assured the ruling coalition of early decision on the (PTI foreign funding) case. “We are consulting our legal team for a reference against them in judicial commission,” he said, demanding their removal from the positions.
Replying to a question, he said there was nothing new in the Financial Times report, as the PTI had already declared all those accounts. He said Arif Naqvi gave an affidavit that the money was sent to the PTI through legal channels. He said parties did get such funding. Shaukat Khanum spent Rs70 billion that had come from overseas, he added.
He said they were overseas Pakistanis and the only thing party had to determine was to check if the money was being sent through legal means. “We cannot check the source of income of a donor,” the senior PTI leader said.
He said general election was the only solution to the current issues being faced by the country and it was ECP’s constitutional responsibility to hold the elections. But unfortunately the commission strengthened the “agenda of the conspiracy” by not holding the election instead, he alleged.
Sources in the ECP said it was a routine that political leaders and ministers met the CEC. “Recently, PTI leader Humayun Akhtar also had a meeting with the CEC. And while the PTI was in power, five ministers had meeting with the whole commission at the same time. It was the requirement of the seat of CEC to meet representatives of political parties at his office. Recently, a delegation of Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) had a meeting with whole commission rather than CEC alone. How one party’s meeting can be right and other party’s wrong,” the sources in the commission said.
As everyone knew that the decision in the foreign finding case was reserved and would be announced soon, the PTI was trying to pressurise the ECP, the ECP sources added. “ECP did not get influenced by the previous government and will not be influenced by current government. Decision will be announced as per merit, all these tactics will not dissuade the commission from performing its functions in accordance with constitution and the law,” they added.
They believed the announcement of moving reference was nothing but to divert the attention by creating a smokescreen at a time when the Financial Times report became top trend on social media.
Economic situation
In a separate development, PTI leaders Asad Umar and Shaukat Tarin expressed serious concerns over the dwindling economic situation of the country.
Mr Umar said government’s incompetence and lack of interest were the main contributors to the country’s fast dwindling economy and Mr Tarin blasted the government for crushing the public under the unprecedented price hike of daily-use items.

2,"PM, Hamza summoned in money laundering case on Sept 7",LAHORE: A special court on Saturday summoned Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza Shehbaz on Sept 7 for...,"LAHORE: A special court on Saturday summoned Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza Shehbaz on Sept 7 for indictment in a Rs16 billion money laundering case registered against them by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
Both Mr Sharif and Mr Shehbaz — who have already been granted pre-arrest bail in the case — skipped Saturday’s hearing as their counsel filed written requ­ests for a one-time exemption from personal appearance.
The premier’s counsel, Advocate Amjad Pervez, said his client was in Islamabad and could not travel to Lahore due to official engagements. 
Hamza’s lawyer Rao Aurangzeb said the PML-N leader had severe backache and he had attached the medical report with the exemption request.
FIA prosecutor Farooq Bajwa did not object to the exemption applications and also submitted the death certificate of co-suspect Malik Maqsood Ahmad, a peon in the Ramzan Sugar Mills, who died while absconding in the United Arab Emirates.
The prosecutor told the court that the death certificate had been verified by the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra). Presiding Judge Ijaz Hassan Awan then stopped the trial proceedings against Mr Ahmad.
Mr Bajwa also informed the court that the FIA had obtained record of 19 bank accounts of proclaimed offender Suleman Shehbaz, younger son of Shehbaz Sharif, while the records of seven others had yet to be secured.
Some records relating to immovable properties of Suleman had also been compiled by the agency, he said, adding that investigators were also gathering details of the assets owned by another proclaimed offender, Tahir Naqvi.
The judge accepted Mr Sharif and Mr Shehbaz’s applications and directed them to appear on Sept 7 for the indictment in the case.
The judge also directed the prosecutor to ensure the appearance of other suspects at the next hearing.
The FIA booked Shehbaz Sharif and his sons Hamza and Suleman in November 2020 under sections 419, 420, 468, 471,34 and 109 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, read with Section 3/4 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The trial court granted interim bail to Mr Sharif and Mr Shehbaz on June 21 last year, a day before their first appearance at the FIA. Meanwhile, Suleman Shehbaz is in the UK and has been declared an absconder.
Fourteen others have also been named in the FIR under sections 5(2) and 5(3) (criminal misconduct) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
Shehbaz and Hamza were previously set to be indicted on May 14, but it was deferred as the prime minister was not present in the country at the time.

3,Another delegation in Kabul for peace talks with TTP,Mufti Taqi Usmani optimistic about outcome of meetings with Afghan Taliban.,"PESHAWAR: A 17-member delegation of tribal elders and others reached Kabul on Saturday to resume talks with the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), just as a team of senior religious scholars returned home after negotiations with the TTP leadership.
The eight-member ulema’s delegation, led by Mufti Taqi Usmani, has returned from Afghanistan after holding meetings with the TTP leadership and Afghan Taliban. 
A source privy to the ulema’s delegation claimed that Mr Usmani, respected by the Afghan Taliban as well as the TTP, was able to convince the militant group that he had reviewed Pakistan’s Constitution and there was nothing in there which could be construed as un-Islamic.
Read: Don’t negotiate with TTP
According to the source, Mr Usmani argued that even if the militant group deemed a clause or two as un-Islamic, it was neither their mandate to change it or provided any justification for them to take up arms against the state. 

Usmani optimistic about outcome of meetings with Afghan Taliban

The source described it as a major breakthrough. There was no formal comment from Mr Usmani, the government or the TTP.
The militant group, the source said, again broached the issue of ex-Fata merger, but Mr Usmani told the TTP leadership that he was a religious scholar and he could only speak on religious matters.
While the TTP released a two-page statement reiterating its demands and calls for an Islamic system in Pakistan, Mr Usmani in a tweet sounded optimistic that their meetings with the Afghan Taliban leadership were useful in strengthening relationship, restoration of peace and achievement of common goals between the two countries.

 





 
Mr Usmani did not make any reference to their meetings with the TTP leadership but said more details [about the negotiations] would be shared later. Unconfirmed reports said the outlawed group handed a charter of demands to the delegation.
The delegation that reached Kabul on Saturday is led by Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, Special Assistant to the Chief Minister on Information and Broadcasting. It includes tribal elders and parliamentarians and is scheduled to stay in Afghanistan for four days.
This would be the group’s second visit to the Afghan capital to hold parleys with the TTP leadership. The first delegation comprised 58 members.
The first round, described by a participant, as “cordial and at times tough”, did not make any headway on the TTP’s demand for the reversal of the ex-Fata merger into KP but the two sides agreed to return to the table after consultation.
In May, an official team from Pakistan held direct talks with the TTP leadership and while deadlock persisted on the key TTP demand, the two sides acceded to the Afghan Taliban leadership’s request for an indefinite ceasefire and continuation of peace talks.
Dawn has learnt that another meeting was held between the two sides towards the end of June under the auspices of the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan” which did make some headway, prompting optimism that a possible peace agreement was achievable.

4,AGP backs judges’ view amid Judicial Commission of Pakistan storm,"Ashtar Ausaf Ali maintains he supported deferment for want of ""structured criteria"" for elevation.","• Law officer maintains he supported deferment for want of ‘structured criteria’ for elevation
• Federal minister urged apex court to revisit Munir Bhatti case, JCP audio reveals
ISLAMABAD: The top law officer of the country came out in support of the views put forward by Justice Qazi Faez Isa and Justice Tariq Masood — over the decisions taken in the previous Judicial Commission meeting — saying that he had agreed to defer the meeting as he was of the opinion that a “requisite criteria be structured for such appointments” before considering them.
In a late night letter issued by the office of the attorney general for Pakistan, Ashtar Ausaf Ali maintained that he categorically agreed with the stance put forward by Justice Tariq Masood.
He also supported the version of events presented by Justice Isa in his earlier letter, saying that he “wish[ed] that the meeting had ended in a cordial manner, with unambiguous conclusions... preclude[ing] the Honourable Justice and Senior Puisne Judge Mr. Qazi Faez Isa from completing his remarks”.
In the letter, circulated to other members of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and the press, Mr Ausaf Ali wrote that while he had refrained from commenting on the merits of each nominee proposed for elevation by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial “in the interest of propriety”, he had maintained that Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah was “eminently qualified to be considered for elevation to the apex court”.
He clarified that his stance in the meeting was that “rejection or confirmation of candidates must be regulated by guiding rules”, which must be settled beforehand, and the data of any new candidates must be thoroughly assessed accordingly. 
“It was for this particular reason that I suggested that the meeting be deferred until the approval of such criteria,” the AGP wrote.
“Any appointment to the Supreme Court of Pakistan is a sacred trust, vested in the members of the Judicial Commission. To fulfill this trust, members must afford one another a full and unimpeded airing of their views.
“I am constrained to observe that the proceedings of the Judicial Commission can no longer be marked by such acrimony. We find ourselves in these rather transient offices as fiduciaries: our duty is to the republic we serve, not the travails of our personal experiences. To ensure the dispensation of justice, it is vital that the most outstanding jurists be elevated to the august Supreme Court of Pakistan, in a manner that is rooted in merit and process,” he concluded. 
It is worth noting that following Thursday’s ‘hotly-contested’ meetings of the JCP, conflicting accounts had been circulating regarding what actually happened. 
While a Supreme Court press release claimed that the meeting that deferred giving an opinion on the nominees put forth by the CJP for elevation to the apex court, JCP members said that the nominees were turned down by a five-to-four majority. 
Justice Isa’s letter, written to JCP members after the meeting, lent credence to the latter impression by saying that the meeting had been wrapped up abruptly by the CJP, before he had a chance to fully deliver his views. He also noted that the CJP had not dictated meeting minutes, and the job had been left to the acting secretary.
On Friday, the CJP ordered the release of the audio recording of the JCP meeting in a bid to settle the controversy surrounding the meeting, while Justice Tariq Masood – another JCP member – wrote his own letter, supporting Justice Isa’s contentions. 
Revisiting Munir Bhatti case
Also during Thursday’s meeting, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had suggested revisiting the 2011 Supreme Court judgement in the Munir Bhatti case, which held that the parliamentary committee overstepped the rightful jurisdiction of the JCP and ignored its constitutional boundaries.
The law minister had also shared with the JCP the sentiments of the parliamentary body members; that their recommendations were not honoured whenever they reversed JCP decisions, and that almost every time there was a judicial intervention or 95 per cent of their decisions were overturned by courts.
This emerged from the over two-hour long audio recording of the JCP meeting, where the law minister highlighted that the parliamentary committee was a constitutional body and the Constitution clearly called for respecting and adherence to the trichotomy of powers.
In 2011, a four-judge Supreme Court bench had held in the Munir Bhatti case that parliamentary committee neither had the expertise nor the constitutional mandate to reverse the reasoning and findings of the JCP, which consists of people with a background in law and the judicial system.
The purpose then was that the discretion in making judicial appointments should not be the forte of one man, as in the old system, but should rather be devolved to a body consisting of people who could be trusted to make a just evaluation through criteria relevant for the appointment of a judge of the high court, the judgement had held.
Constituted under the 18th Amendment, the concept of nomination by the JCP and then confirmation by a parliamentary body was included in Article 175A of the Constitution for elevating judges to superior courts.
The minister also did not support the nominations proposed by the CJP for elevation to the Supreme Court, adding he knew about the anxiety to fill five vacancies in the SC, but it is also true that filling a seat that will fall vacant next month should not be considered since it may create precedence and even be stretched too far.
Besides other JCP members, he also suggested considering the name of Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah who is an honourable judge and would be a good addition to the Supreme Court, and his elevation will also end the perception that capable senior-most judges are not being elevated to the apex court. His addition will also add to the transparency factor, he said.
Pakistan Bar Council representative Akhtar Hussain, another JCP member, also emphasised the need for adhering to the seniority principle, saying he had been a member of JCP for four years and the Bars have been urging for the need to adhere to this principle, and demand amendment to the JCP rules. He sought an early meeting of the rules committee.
