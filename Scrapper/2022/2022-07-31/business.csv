Moreover, the rupee continued its free fall against the dollar to reach an all-time low of 239.94 amid scepticism over the release of the loan tranche from the IMF, said Arif Habib Ltd.
Volatility became more evident as the current acco­unt deficit climbed 39 per cent year-on-year in June to clock in at $2.3bn. The sentiment turned positive, however, after the finance minister reiterated that all prior actions had been undertaken for the revival of the IMF programme. Furthermore, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) echoed the finance minister’s statement and rejected the possibility of default on global payments in the near future.
In addition to this, Fitch and Moody’s showed optimism over the disbursement of $1.2bn from the IMF soon although S&P Global downgraded Paki­stan’s credit outlook from neutral to negative.
As a result, the benchmark closed at 40,150 points after gaining 73 points or 0.18pc week-on-week.
According to AKD Securities, the political environment seems relatively stable after the resolution of the turmoil in Punjab. “A record depreciation — when added to the mix with inflationary pressures and high interest rates — has created an environment of uncertainty for the market. A recovery in the sentiment can be expected once the $1.2bn tranche from the IMF is released,” it said.
The outlook for the stock market remains hazy for the short term, it noted, adding that investors should consider any bull run as an exit opportunity.

1,Exports to US hit $9bn,The total trade volume between Pakistan and the United States has increased to $12bn from nearly $9.5bn last year.,"WASHINGTON: Pakist­an’s annual exports to the United States increased by 35 per cent to $9 billion in 2021-22, statistics released on Saturday showed.
Last year, Pakistan exported $7bn of goods and services to the United States. Noting this net increase of $2bn in a year, Pakistan’s US Ambassador Masood Khan said, “there’s great potential for further increase in our bilateral trade.”
In 2021-22, Pakistan imported $3bn worth of goods from the US, compared to $2.4bn in 2020-21. Thus, the total trade volume between Pakistan and the United States has increased to $12bn from nearly $9.5bn last year.
Ambassador Khan pointed out that the US has maintained its primacy as the largest export destination for Pakistani goods anywhere in the world.
“If the exports continue to grow at the rate of 35pc per year, in the next three years overall Pakistan-US trade volume would cross $20bn, which would still be a modest goal given the immense potential that is there between the two markets,” he said.
The ambassador said that the remarkable growth of overall Pakistani exports should “contribute to the stability of Pakistan’s economy and assuage fears being stoked. “What we need the most is market confidence”, he added.
A breakup showed that goods constitute $6.8bn of the total exports to the US while the component of services, including IT, is $2.2bn in FY22. Last year, the Pakistan-based tech startups earned around $800 million out of which 60pc has been funded by US-based Venture Capital firms, primarily in San Francisco. Top American Venture Capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, Tiger Global and Sequia have started supporting Pakistani startups at the pre-seed, seed, and incubation stages.
“The emphasis is on connectivity and productivity as well as tangible results,” Ambassador Khan said, adding that early dividends would be forthcoming soon.
Earlier this week, Salman Sufi, who heads the prime minister’s team for strategic reforms, also discussed various proposals for enhancing bilateral trade with US officials in Washington.
At the White House, he met National Security Council Director Courtney Dunn, discussing a wide range of issues with him, including the resumption of direct PIA flights to the US.
The two sides also talked about posting a representative of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in Karachi to ensure Pakistani products get clearance at home.

2,Aptma seeks review of ‘wheeling’ charges under CTBCM scheme,Aptma chief says industry believes the necessary cost of wheeling charges should not be more than 1.5-2 cents.,"LAHORE: Power regulator Nepra has assured the textile industry of reviewing wheeling charges against cheaper power generation facilities to be set up by the industry under the Comp­etitive Trading Bilateral Contr­act Market (CTBCM) scheme.
“Both the industry and Nepra representatives should sit together and calculate judicious wheeling charges to make them acceptable for both sides,” Nepra chief Tauseef H. Farooqi proposed in a session with the members of All Pakistan Textile Association (Aptma) on Saturday.
During the session, Aptma chief Rahim Nasir said the industry believed that the necessary cost of wheeling charges should not be more than 1.5-2 cents.
The concept of wheeling, i.e. using a distribution company’s system to transport electricity, has existed in Pakistan for many years. Nepra in November 2020 approved a plan comprising 18 months leading to the CTBCM in a bid to shift the existing electricity market into a broader open market that can allow both buyer and seller to bilaterally procure and supply electricity by leaving the existing arrangement where the consumers have no option but to buy power from distribution companies (Discos). 
In June, the authority launched the CTBCM scheme — a new model under which any of the bulk power consumers (one megawatt and above) may come out of the system of Discos and procure electricity from the officially approved or designated power suppliers in the open market. 
The new arrangement also allows Discos to buy electricity from the open market and supply it to their customers through their distribution system (11kV to 132kV).
On the occasion, Aptma members urged the Nepra chairman to save the industry from unnecessary costs to keep it viable under the challenging economic environment of the country. They also emphasised converting the present arrangement with independent power producersof “take or pay” to “take and pay” with IPPs to get rid of the outstanding Rs1.4 trillion capacity charges.
The authority chief said that business-to-business (B2B) transactions can be facilitated under the CTBCM scheme, as the distribution companies (Discos) must transmit merchant power generation to industrial facilities through Discos’ systems under the B2B arrangements.
On being informed that there was no acceptable merchant power available in the country, the chairman suggested that the industry should come forward and install power generation stations to avail the facility through wheeling charges of eight US cents or so.

3,AKD-BIPL Securities merger becomes effective,"KARACHI: The operational merger of BIPL Securities and AKD Securities will become effective from Monday, with the...","KARACHI: The operational merger of BIPL Securities and AKD Securities will become effective from Monday, with the surviving company being renamed as AKD Securities.
In a regulatory filing with the Pakistan Stock Exchange, BIPL Securities said it’ll continue to mention its former and new names outside its offices and official correspondence for 90 days.
The development follows a June 6 announcement in which the company told investors that the Sindh High Court sanctioned the investment bank’s merger with AKD Securities Ltd, an unlisted brokerage house that’s part of businessman Aqeel Karim Dhedhi’s conglomerate.
The parent company of BIPL Securities, BankIslami Pakistan Ltd, transferred its entire stake constituting 77.12 per cent of the paid-up share capital to AKD Securities about a year ago.
The Islamic bank first announced in April 2019 that it’d sell BIPL Securities because the stock brokerage business was not in line with the Shariah-compliant mandate of the commercial lender.
Until 2015, BIPL Securities operated under the name of KASB Securities Ltd. It was listed as an asset on the balance sheet of KASB Bank Ltd, which was put under a moratorium and subsequently sold off to BankIslami for its non-compliance with regulatory requirements.

4,$500m annual investments needed to sustain gender data systems,Pakistan lauded for use of digital IDs to provide social protection benefits to women.,"KARACHI: Pakistan holds an estimated $652 million in annual revenue potential in the women’s financial services market, according to data shared at a roundtable held recently. However, this remains untapped due to poor policies and a culture of gender inequality towards women’s financial empowerment.
At a virtual media roundtable held on Thursday, findings from a diagnostic report from six countries on the Women’s Financial Inclusion Data Partnership showed an untapped market for women’s financial services of up to $800 million. 
The virtual roundtable, titled ‘Women’s Market opportunity as a result of financial inclusion’, had speakers including Leora Klapper from the World Bank, Mayra Buvinic from Data2X and Anna Gincherman from CCX. The event was moderated by Dilly Severin.
The event discussed a three-year gender data project in six countries, including Bangladesh, Honduras, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Turkey; all these countries were chosen as they are committed to making progress in women’s financial inclusion and could serve as replication models for other countries.

Pakistan lauded for use of digital IDs to provide social protection benefits to women.

Pakistan was highlighted as a positive example where it was easier for women to use financial services when they’re available. The use of digital IDs, which were used by the government during the peak Covid-19 pandemic to provide social protection benefits under Ehsaas, was lauded at the event.  
It was highlighted that the estimated gender gap in access to formal financial services by 2030 will increase to 32pc, the highest among the six countries, followed by Turkey at 22pc, Bangladesh and Honduras at 16pc each, and Nigeria at 7pc. Only Kenya is expected to see a 1pc decrease.
On the occasion, Inez Murray, the CEO of Financial Alliance for Women, said they did a piece of research in 2014 with Mckenzie that interviewed 30 CEOs of banks that represented 20pc of global banking assets and essentially characterised the findings in one [line] — “There is a lack of awareness that there is a women’s market and that, in fact, men and women are different when it comes to accessing and using financial services.”
To effectively fill gender data gaps and create a better enabling environment, champions from within the finance sector, particularly among regulators and at the highest levels of government, must act now.
Data2X findings showed that only 50pc of gender indicators from the SDGs are available with sex-disaggregated data. Almost 33pc of potential gender data indicators from the SDGs are entirely unavailable. It further said that to build and sustain core gender data systems, an additional $500 million from donors is needed every year from now through 2030.
Findex research showed that worldwide account ownership has reached 76pc of the global population — and 71pc of people in developing countries.

5,Policy for solar panel manufacturing in the offing,Ministry of Industries and Production tasked with formulating a policy to manufacture solar panels and allied equipment.,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to overcome the ongoing energy crisis, the government has decided to promote solar energy, and the Ministry of Industries and Production (MoIP) has been tasked with formulating a policy to manufacture solar panels and allied equipment in the country.
Sources in the Ministry of Industries said that the Engineering Development Board (EDB) is likely to finalise a policy document on “Solar Panels and Allied Equipment Manufacturing” in August.
The solar panel manufacturing policy will be aligned with the National Solar Energy Policy being prepared by the Ministry of Power and the Renewable Energy Task Force.
Currently, the basic raw materials related to solar panels are imported, but as the demand was soaring, there was a need to promote local raw material manufacturing.
An EDB official highlighted that while glass and aluminium frames used for solar panels can easily be manufactured in Pakistan due to the strong presence of this allied industry within the country.
The EDB, which falls under the MoIP, has held consultations with stakeholders, including for local producers of solar panels, provincial energy departments, research organisations, academia, users, and other relevant organisations and departments in the federal and provincial governments.
To reduce dependence on fossil fuels only for power generation and promote alternative energy, the government has also decided to solarise government offices and tube wells.
The country was facing serious energy shortages with record prices that had directly and indirectly affected all sectors of the economy.
The country’s electricity demand has reached almost 29,000 megawatts compared to 22,000 MW generation, creating a considerable gap between generation and demand and resulting in load-shedding.
With the present government’s focus on promoting solar energy, it becomes imperative to promote localisation and indigenisation of solar panels and their allied equipment in the country to save a huge outflow of foreign exchange.
The initial draft prepared by the EDB also suggested that the roof-top solar generation system needs to be encouraged and incentivised as it is the cheapest source of electricity generation.
It has been said that local manufacturing of solar panels and allied equipment will invite investments and provide skilled job opportunities for Pakistani technicians.
The power sector of the country has a structural issue as energy mix is 40 per cent based on indigenous resources while 60pc comprises imported oil fuel.
The government has planned to increase local share to 90pc by 2030, out of which the targets set for renewable energy are 20–30pc, which is currently around only 1.4pc of the total installed capacity.

6,Investors reap ‘late delivery’ windfall as auto prices go through the roof,Local assemblers have passed on the negative impact of a soaring dollar against the rupee to consumers.,"KARACHI: Investors, who got delivery of their vehicles booked at old  rates after a delay of months, are reaping windfall by selling their  cars, jeeps and pickups at huge premiums due to massive hike in prices  in recent weeks.  
With the country on the verge of default, booking suspensions, massive price increases, restrictions on auto financing, and sales falling by 25-30 per cent in FY23 and non-production days, local assemblers have passed on the negative impact of a soaring dollar against the rupee to consumers.
The price gap between the old and new locally assembled vehicles now hovers between Rs590,000 and Rs3.12 million, while fear of more price hikes looms in case the rupee continues to crawl down against the dollar.
Read: Corolla, City and Fortuner — how expensive have cars gotten after latest price hike?
Due to the suspension of bookings by some big assemblers, the showrooms are now dealing with customers whose delivery time of vehicles has matured after a three-to-six-month long wait.
Market sources said the “on money” or price difference on Kia vehicles ranges between Rs1-1.3m.
For example, investors are demanding Rs7.6m for Sportage All-Wheel Drive (AWD) models, whose price has been increased to Rs7.250m from Rs6.363m.
Kia Picanto automatic booked at old prices of Rs2.312m and Rs2.7m in previous months is now pegged at Rs3.2mn. However, the buyer has to manage over Rs1m to get the instant delivery from the investor.
Kia Lucky Motor Limited and Hyundai Nishat Motors raised prices on various models by up to Rs1.1m. 
Sources said a similar situation exists in Toyota vehicle prices as “premium” or difference the investors are charging between Rs500,000 and Rs2.5m on various models. 
A Toyota dealer said investors are taking a big chunk from the consumer on those cars whose delivery is now lined up with old prices. “You either call this practice ‘on money’ or a big price disparity,” he added.
Indus Motor Company (IMC) has jacked prices by Rs590,000 to Rs3.12m followed by Honda Atlas Cars Limited (HACL) by Rs785,000-Rs1.450m.
A Japanese assembler car dealer said customers are getting the deliveries of their old vehicles booked six months ago, but they are waiting for the price to be settled in the market and then selling them.
A dealer said a premium of Rs100,000–150,000 exists on Honda City as the company has not suspended its booking yet, while booking of Toyota and Suzuki vehicles has been closed from May 18 to July 1.
He said “on money” on Suzuki Cultus and Alto660cc is around Rs500,000 as the company has not yet announced any price hike but old deliveries booked at low rates are being cleared.
A used car dealer said a number of people had parked their two to three-year-old cars and big vehicles waiting to make a jackpot at a certain time in view of the persistent increase in prices.
He said many people have pulled their money from their businesses and plunged into the auto business as investors due to the bullish trend in vehicle prices.
Sources said some deals of “on money” are stuck within the showrooms of the authorised dealers, despite tall claims by the assemblers that their showrooms’ staff are not involved in “on money” syndrome. Many deals are made outside the showrooms.
Dealers said the practice of “on-money” usually thrives due to long delays in delivery of vehicles ranging from two to 10 months.

7,How the other half lives: luxury companies thrive,Millions of wealthier consumers are still sitting on a cushion of savings built up during the Covid-19 pandemic.,"LONDON: While millions are fretting whether they can afford another $1,000 on energy this year, others are still splashing out on $10,000 Hermes handbags as soaring prices leave wealthier people relatively unscathed.
A string of consumer companies, from spirits group Diageo to Birkin bag maker Hermes, have this week reported they’re making money from their most expensive products and expect to continue to do so, despite a cost of living crisis that shows no signs of abating.
Sharply higher interest rates, surging inflation and a prolonged energy crisis are leading to the conclusion that the global economy is headed towards recession.
But millions of wealthier consumers are still sitting on a cushion of savings built up during the Covid-19 pandemic and keen to treat themselves after two years of restrictions.
Hermes reported a record quarterly profit margin on Friday, as sales rose sharply amid strong growth in Europe and the United States, and a rebound in China in June.
Chairman Axel Dumas said he saw no sign of a slowdown in any region, even though the company has raised prices 4 per cent this year.
Carmaker Renault also said its turnaround strategy of focusing on selling fewer but more profitable cars was paying off, and upgraded its forecast for full-year margins. The most expensive Renault cars can cost over $100,000.
“The surprising resilience of European consumers can also be seen in the strong results of luxury brands owner, Louis Vuitton , particularly in their fashion and leather goods, such as Fendi and Christian Dior,” Rebecca Chesworth, senior equities strategist at investor State Street SPDR ETFs, said.
“Consumers enjoying travel reopening have been boosting sales of wines and spirits.”
Come fly with me
Many consumers are bracing for the economy to deteriorate rapidly this winter.
In Britain, for example, a price cap on typical household energy bills is expected to jump from 1,277 pounds ($1,552) earlier this year to more than 3,500 pounds by October, while the cost of food has leapt by 10pc year-on-year.
That will plunge hundreds of thousands into financial jeopardy, unable to spend on anything but the absolute basics.
Food and personal goods companies such as Nestle and Unilever have been locked in hard negotiations with retailers since late last year, with supermarkets reluctant to raise prices of basic necessities and risk alienating shoppers struggling to get by.
“Not all companies can (raise prices), only companies that have pricing power that are doing relatively well — that have the dominant positions in their respective sectors — will be able to do that,” BlackRock Investment Institute’s global chief investment strategist Wei Li told Reuters.  “Focusing on the quality players within the sector is important.”  While wealthier consumers’ savings are still being eroded by inflation, they currently seem focused on enjoying the freedoms that have returned with the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.
British Airways-owner IAG on Friday returned to profit for the first time since the pandemic, as more people flew around Europe between April and June.
“Commentary suggesting forward bookings show no sign of weakness supports the argument that pent up demand for travel still far outweighs the impact of a cost-of-living crisis,” Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.
IAG sales, on trips mostly booked out of Britain, Spain and the United States, more than quadrupled to 9.35 billion euros ($9.55 billion) in the first half of the year versus last year.
“We’ve had fast growth in the recovery (in travel retail) as you see travel pick up,” Diageo CEO Ivan Menezes told analysts on Thursday after the Don Julio tequila and Johnnie Walker whisky maker beat full-year sales expectations.
To be sure, Menezes cautioned:  “To get back to where we were, it’s probably another two years, maybe a bit longer.”  Europe’s lenders this week also offered some positive surprises on profits, but investors are watching for signs a weaker economy, surging inflation and the war in Ukraine could hit their prospects.
Eurozone inflation rose to another record high in July and its peak could still be months away, keeping pressure on the European Central Bank to opt for another big interest rate increase in September.
For now, however, French bank BNP Paribas reported better than expected quarterly profit on Friday, after bad loan provisions dipped and business remained buoyant in both investment and retail banking.
