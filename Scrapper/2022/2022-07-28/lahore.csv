0,Punjab regime change ‘ill omen’ for police officers,Three more to get new assignments.,"LAHORE: The regime change in Punjab hardly augurs well for senior police officers as is evident from ‘displacement’ of four key figures including the Lahore capital city police officer (CCPO).  
Hours before the new chief minister took oath, three police officers were transferred and repatriated to the federal government while another was removed from his post and made an officer on special duty (OSD). As they were not “in the good books” of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), they were transferred on their request to avoid victimisation.  
BS-20 police officers Bilal Siddique Kamyana and Rana Abdul Jabbar and BS-19 officer Sardar Ghias Gull Khan seemed to be on the ‘hit list’ of PTI chief Imran Khan and other leaders. Kamyana was serving as CCPO Lahore, Jabbar as DG Anti-Corruption Punjab and Ghias Gull as DPO Jhang. The other police officer, Sajid Khokhar, was posted DPO Mandi Bahauddin, the district where most of the police officers were appointed on the recommendations of Parvez Elahi.  
Late on Tuesday, they were not only transferred but also relieved of their respective duties from Punjab in the wake of strong confrontation between the PTI and the PML-N.  

Three more to get new assignments

According to the notification, the federal government immediately posted and put services of Kamyana and Jabbar at the strength of Intelligence Bureau (IB) to assume new assignments while Gull was directed to report to the Establishment Division for further order. 
A source said the PTI considered these four police officers close to the PML-N. He said Kamyana and former IGP Rao Sardar Ali Khan were scorned in various speeches by PTI chief Imran Khan. During the recent by-polls in Punjab, Imran Khan had warned them of action for “siding with the PML-N to victimise the PTI’s candidates, supporters and voters.”  
Rao Sardar had already requested the federal government to transfer him to any suitable place. He was transferred and posted as IG Railways. Similarly, Kamyana and Gull followed the same course and the federal government issued their transfer orders from Punjab to the Centre. 
The source said Gull bore the brunt of political victimisation when he was posted as DPO Jhang during the tenure of PTI government in 2020. He said a PTI MNA, who was federal minister at that time from Jhang, and a lady MPA “targeted” him for not obeying their orders.  
A woman was allegedly murdered in the district and Gull as DPO had ordered police to ensure her postmortem but the PTI leaders had asked him to stop the proceeding. He said the DPO, however, turned down what he considered the illegal demand of the PTI leaders, which irked them. The then federal minister later moved a privilege motion against Gull in the National Assembly and managed to initiate proceedings against him.  
Gull moved the high court against the proceeding of the NA and got a stay order, the official said, adding that he was later removed from his post.  
To avoid victimisation from the PTI government, he submitted a request to the Establishment Division to allow him to proceed abroad (UK) on scholarship. Despite PTI leaders’ efforts to stop the process on his application, he managed to get ex-Pakistan leave. As he came back from the UK in September last year, the PTI leaders again used their influence and made him OSD.  
When the PML-N formed government in the Centre and Punjab, it again posted him as DPO Jhang, the source said, adding that meanwhile a photo went viral showing then home minister Atta Tarrar sitting on the seat of the DPO while presiding over a meeting. The meeting was called in the wake of security measures taken for the by-elections and the PTI again criticised Gull, alleging that he was planning rigging in favour of the PML-N candidate in Jhang.  
As for Mandi Bahauddin DPO Sajid Khokhar, the official said, he was removed from the post as the local PTI leaders turned against him for being appointed by the PML-N and wanted the new DPO of choice.  
There are reports that two more police officers -- former DPO Sialkot and DIG Operations Lahore -- also are vulnerable due to regime change.

The squad will have more than 100 officials, including 11 female staff, who are getting training from Rescue 1122.
A specialied training has been designed on community action for disaster response (CADRE), Cardio Pulborough Resuscitation (CPR) training and motorbike riding in hilly terrain. The 11-day training course from July 19 to 29 at Rescue academy (Punjab emergency services department) would enhance the professional capacity of the tourism squad to help tourists.
Experts are training the officials about first aid during any emergency/accident, motorbike practice, cycle practice on hilly areas, walking on mountains and climbing. One of the important aspects of daily training routine besides physical exercise is lectures on ethics and attitude as public facilitation would be their prime duty.
After this emergency coaching, they will be imparted two-week training about behaviour, tourist facilitation, tourist guide and related activities from the Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management of TDCP.
According to the tourism department, there were complaints of visitors about high rates of hotels at tourist places and about hoteliers’ behaviour. Also, tourists face difficulties in finding places, registering their complaints, redress of complaints, coordination among different departments like police, health, traffic police, Rescue 1122 and the administration. So to cope up with that, the provincial government has introduced the Punjab Tourism Squad which will work in three zones (north, central and south Punjab).
There will also be a UAN number managed by PITB “1421” where any visitor can register complaint and PITB experts will divert to the respective department/zone of the tourism squad. The squad has not only been equipped with motorcycles for mobility but also related essential equipment.
They will firstly be posted at Murree during tourist season on the occasion of Independence Day. Afterwards they will be posted in central Punjab (Lahore and adjoining areas) and south Punjab (Multan/ Bahawalpur, DG Khan) wherever there is any need like festivals at shrines, gurdwaras, mosques, jeep rallies at Cholistan/Thal.
The squad will not only provide guidance to them but also assist in finding locations/hotels under relevant rules.
Tourism Secretary Ehsan Bhutta while speaking about the department’s effort said: “These people have been chosen for the service of tourists in Punjab and they will definitely change the image of tourism by ensuring discipline and facilitation at different points.”

The production was a tribute to great literary figure Patras Bokhari. 
Theater Wallay is a non-commercial group of artists with a passion for theatre and literature. Based in Islamabad since 2005, Theatre Wallay has put up many performances of plays from world literature -- English, Urdu and Punjabi. One of their original productions, the acclaimed ‘Daagh Daagh Ujala’ (This Stained Dawn), toured the United States in 2015. Another one of our projects, On Common Ground, toured the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and Artists Repertory Theatre, Portland, in 2017.  
The play, titled ‘Marhoom Ki Yaad Mein’, was a theatrical tribute to the great Urdu literary figure. The play was written, adapted and directed by Imran Iftikhar, one of the core members of Theatre Wallay. 
The cast included Ahad Ali Siddiqui, Zia Rehman, Ramil Aftab, Adil Yousaf, Umer Farooq Bhatti, Usama Ahmad and Saboora Marium. Mustafa Hasan designed the sound and lights for the production. On Thursday( today) Azaad Theater will stage its play at the festival titled, Totaan Wala Khoo. 
The festival which commenced on July 22 will conclude on July 29. The theatre festival is getting attraction from the masses despite the fact that Lahore Arts Council is not focusing much on the advertisement of the festival.  
Usually, no senior Alhamra officials remain present at the festival performance. The council has not even designed any good banner for the festival.  
Dawn learned that relatives and friends of the production house people are inviting the audience by sharing the quality productions of the festival through word of mouth and sometimes through video clips. 
Art lovers demanded that the rooftop of Hall No 2 be checked. They said it is surprising that the council get huge funding but it does not pay any attention to such repairs which are vital. Back in the 90s, the roof of Hall No 1 collapsed.

10,"A tug of war for Punjab Assembly speaker, deputy slots","PTI ""almost finalises"" Sibtain Khan for the chair.","LAHORE: With the changing of the guard in the province, both the new ruling coalition of the PTI and the PML-Q and the opposition alliance comprising PML-N, PPP, Rah-e-Haq and some independent MPAs, have stepped up the consultation process to lay claim to the coveted offices of speaker and deputy speaker of the Punjab Assembly.
The PTI-PML-Q coalition has so far finalised the name of Sibtain Khan for the post of speaker after Parvez Elahi, the previous holder of the office, was elected as chief minister.
A final decision will, however, be taken when PTI chairman Imran Khan visits Lahore on Thursday (today) to also finalise the members of Mr Elahi’s cabinet.

PTI ‘almost finalises’ Sibtain for the chair

Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s son Zain Qureshi, Mahmoodur Rashid, ex-CM Usman Buzdar and Mian Aslam Iqbal had also been lobbying for the speaker’s office. Sources say one of them may be accommodated if the office of deputy speaker falls vacant, as the ruling coalition is planning to move a no-confidence motion against the incumbent Sardar Dost Muhammad Mazari.
A meeting of the PML-N and PPP parliamentary representatives was held under deposed chief minister Hamza Shehbaz for consultation on future politics in Punjab.
Besides deciding to give a tough time to the Elahi government, the meeting also discussed three names – ex-speaker Rana Iqbal, Sardar Awais Leghari and Malik Nadeem Kamran – as likely candidates for the office of the speaker.
The meeting also discussed a strategy to foil the likely no-trust motion against Mr Mazari and decided that in case of failure of their plan, a new candidate for the post would be selected after consulting all the allies.
Meanwhile, former Punjab home minister Ata Tarar, who was appointed special assistant to the prime minister in a development late in the evening, alleged that double standards were adopted to adjudicate Punjab chief minister election issue by the Supreme Court.
He told a press conference here on Wednesday that the people were seeing a ‘judicial’ chief minister for the first time as the constitutionally’ and ‘legally’ elected CM was removed through a court order. Various options were under consideration against the ‘judicial’ chief minister, he added.

11,LHC seeks ACE reply on plea of Farah Khan’s mother,Lawyer argues FIR against petitioner was politically motivated since her daughter was close to former premier's wife.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Wednesday sought a reply from the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) on a petition of mother of Farah Khan, a friend of former prime minister Imran Khan’s wife Bushra Bibi, challenging a case of alleged corruption in allotment of a commercial plot.
Advocate Azhar Siddique appeared before the court on behalf of Bushra Khan, the petitioner, and contended that the ACE registered the case beyond facts and at the behest of the previous government.
He said the FIR against the petitioner was politically motivated since her daughter was close to the wife of the former prime minister. He asked the court to quash the case for being registered unlawfully.
Justice Amjad Rafiq issued a notice to the ACE for submission of a reply within a week.
According to the FIR, a probe was initiated into the allegations of illegal allotment of plots to M/s AI-Muez Dairy & Foods (Pvt) Limited, a company established by Farah Khan and her mother, in connivance with some officials of Faisalabad Industrial Estate Development & Management Company (FIEDMC).
It further stated that during the inquiry proceedings, the ACE team found illegalities committed by FIEDMC former CEO Rana Muhammad Yousaf, Special Economic Zone (SEZ) committee secretary Maqsood Ahmed and others.

A law officer told the court that respondent Rana Abdul Jabbar had already been transferred from the post of ACE DG.
At this, Justice Amjad Rafiq disposed of the petition.

Mr Rashid faces an inquiry pending with the ACE, however, the court restrained the ACE from causing any harassment to him.
On a separate petition of Ahmad against a call-up notice of the ACE in an inquiry, the agency filed its reply saying the petitioner benefited from the Rawalpindi ring road project.
It said a land sale agreement between the petitioner and a housing society was not duly registered.
The judge adjourned the hearing for a week as the petitioner’s counsel sought time to submit his rejoinder to the reply of the ACE.
The ACE accused him of misappropriation of millions of rupees on account of fees in the sale of state land to Royal Residencia Islamabad Housing Society.

Subsidised flour shortage in city

The shortage of subsidised flour was creating problems for the citizens in various parts of the city and they were complaining about the non-availability of the flour at stores and open markets.
The tandoor operators said the price of the flour was increased in the open market and they could not purchase the commodity from the market and demanded provision of flour at utility stores.
The mill owners admitted that there was a shortage of the flour because the government was providing less wheat quota to them.
They said there was a demand of more than 20,000 tonnes for wheat in Punjab but only 16 maund quota was being provided to them.
They said the supply of flour to other regions including Lahore would improve in a few days.

He also directed the additional deputy commissioner general (ADCG) to check the supply of flour at Garhi Shahu, GT Road, Shadbagh, Ghoray Shah, Salamatpura and Dubbanpura.
The assistant commissioners and the respective price control magistrates were directed to check the notified prices immediately.

14,Two youngsters stranded in floodwater drown in well,20-foot breach in Sutlej dyke has widened to 50-feet and yet to be plugged...,"BAHAWALNAGAR: Two villagers drowned near Baba Fareed Bridge after they were stranded in the floodwater caused by a 50-foot wide breach in the protection dyke in the Sutlej here on Tuesday night.
The breach, which occurred near Shamska village on July 21, flooded more than 10,000 acre land over a 20-km area and has yet to be plugged despite several protests by the locals.
According to Rescue 1122, Muhammad Shahid (25) along with his 10-year-old cousin Muhammad Waqas, residents of Habibka village, were visiting their relatives in Basti Gujjar situated in the river bed. The duo got stranded because of the floodwater along with hundreds of people of the area. On Tuesday night, they decided to leave and were on their way home wading through five-foot deep water when suddenly they fell into a 20-foot deep well near Baba Fareed Bridge and drowned.
Rescuers, from the [sole] flood relief camp set up at Mari Chakoka, launched a search operation and recovered the bodies from the river after a hectic hours-long effort.

20-foot breach in Sutlej dyke has widened to 50-feet and yet to be plugged

Talking to media persons, families of the victims declared the district administration responsible for human and financial loss. They blamed the administration for not taking steps earlier to plug the breach.
They said the authorities did nothing to plug the breach even after the passage of a week. They said the Bahawalnagar DC did not even bother to visit the flooded area till now.
They demanded that Punjab CM Parvez Elahi take immediate notice of the matter before the situation worsened and announce compensation for them.
A revenue official requesting anonymity told Dawn that initially the breach was only 20-foot wide and it could be plugged easily. However, the ‘negligent’ officials left it unattended for 36 hours until it widened to 50-foot.
A rescue official said the affected area needed several flood relief camps to evacuate stranded people and to provide them food and other facilities but the district administration had set up a single [Rescue 1122] camp for the 20km affected area.
Assistant Commissioner (AC) Minchinabad Ahmad Javed Cheema, who claimed to have started plugging the breach from July 24 told this correspondent on phone, that the breach was yet to be plugged because of the ‘inefficient’ irrigation officials.
Irrigation SDO Ali Abdullah said it was not the his department’s job to plug the breach but it was a matter related to the DC office. He said the matter needed massive funds and the department had limited amount which could be used only to repair the canal breach. Extra funds were required to repair the breach which could be issued only by the DC, he added.
He said the breach had become so wide that it was no longer possible to repair it but the damage could be minimised by diverting river water channels. In this regard, the irrigation officials, including EXEN and SE, had informed the Minchinabad AC and the Bahawalnagar DC about solution to the problem since day one, he maintained.
“As soon as the DC releases the funds, the department will start work to plug the river breach.”
Deputy Commissioner Bahawalnagar retired Capt Muhammad Waseem neither attended calls nor replied to text messages despite repeated attempts.
