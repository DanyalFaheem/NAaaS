1,Sharia-compliant trading platform for RDA clients launched,Aims to help expatriate Pakistani investors invest in Sharia-approved securities.,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) will provide a dedicated Sharia-compliant trading platform for the clients of Roshan Digital Account (RDA), an online facility that lets overseas Pakistanis undertake banking, payment and investment activities in Pakistan.
Set up in collaboration with Meezan Bank Ltd, the trading platform will help expatriate Pakistani investors invest in Sharia-approved securities, the PSX said in a statement on Wednesday.
The platform will be available through the online trading system provided by the PSX called KiTS or Karachi Internet Trading System. Any RDA client of an Islamic bank can now use it for investing in the PSX through the services offered by more than 100 stockbrokers using KiTS as an Order Management System (OMS).
The purpose of this platform is to enable non-resident Pakistanis (NRPs) to securely invest in their homeland’s capital market in a Sharia-compliant manner. With this development in KiTS, the Sharia-compliant investing facility can be offered virtually by many brokers to their RDA customers. Hence, the PSX is providing RDA clients with a broader suite of securities brokers to select from for their Sharia-compliant investment needs.
The criteria for investing on the Sharia-compliant platform has been developed by Meezan Bank and vetted by the PSX’s Sharia adviser. The specifications of the Sharia-compliant trading platform include investing in Karachi Meezan Index (KMI)-All Share securities, Sharia-compliant initial public offerings (IPOs) and Sharia-compliant exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
The trading option is available for Ready and Odd Lot markets only. The recently bought shares can be sold on a T+2 basis — i.e. when shares purchased are available in the Central Depository System (CDS) account.
Speaking at the launch of the platform, PSX Managing Director Farrukh Khan said the demand for Sharia-compliant offerings is consistently rising while the PSX has continued to grow its suite of Islamic capital market products.
With the latest development in KiTS, all trading right entitlement certificate holders can now offer Sharia-compliant products to RDA clients, which will create new business opportunities for them, Mr Khan added.
Meezan Bank CEO Irfan Siddiqui said the bank is already offering a Sharia-compliant trading platform for NRPs through 22 brokers, which have been on-boarded through their own systems.

3,Stocks manage modest gains in depressed trading,Show recovery after assurance on inflows from IMF and current account surplus.,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange remained under pressure throughout the trading session on Wednesday on the back of an uncertain economic situation, said Arif Habib Ltd.

4,Potential buyers begin on-site inspections of PSM,Govt focused on resolving pending matters for early revival of steel mills as it was incurring huge losses.,"ISLAMABAD: The Privatisation Commission (PC) on Wednesday said meetings with the  pre-qualified parties for the sell-off of Pakistan Steel Mills were underway, with the companies conducting due diligence processes and on-site visits.
At a review meeting, Minister for Privatisation and PC Chairman Abid Hussain Bhayo stated that the commission should focus in order to resolve all the pending matters for the early revival of steel mills since it was one of the biggest entities on the active privatisation list and was incurring huge losses to the national exchequer since 2015.
The privatisation plan of the government seeks revival of the steel mills for the acquisition of 51 to 74 per cent of  issued share capital together with management control of Steel Corp (Private) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pakistan Steel Mills Corporation (Private) Limited.
The review meeting focused on the progress so far made in the transaction of various entities to be  privatised. Secretary Privatisation Dr Irum Khan and senior officials  and consultants were present during the meeting.
During the PC review meeting, the transaction status of National Power Parks Management Company Ltd (NPPMCL) was also discussed, and it was informed that a series of meetings with stakeholders have been held on the debt  and equity matters. For that purpose, a plan of action has already been  agreed upon regarding debt-refinancing for the plant from local and  commercial banks. Once the debt-refinancing and recapitalisation are  finalised, the sale of equity shares will quickly follow.
NPPMCL, a  state-owned enterprise, owns and operates two RLNG-based combined cycle  technology power plants located in Haveli Bahadur Shah in district  Jhang and Balloki in district Kasur, together with the HBS power plant.
These  plants are to be privatised with the acquisition of up to 100pc of the  equity stake with management control in either NPPMCL or two companies,  each of which will own one of the power plants in case different  investors acquire power plants.
The meeting was informed that the  privatisation of House Building Finance Corporation (HBFCL), Pakistan’s  only housing finance entity, and the First Women’s Bank Limited (FWBL),  also came up for review, and the meeting was informed that the  privatisation of HBFCL will likely be completed in the current fiscal  year, as national and international investors have shown keen interest  in it.

In a meeting with Commerce Minister Naveed  Qamar, the US envoy also discussed difficulties faced by businesses due to the import ban besides ways to increase bilateral trade between the two  countries.
Mr Qamar assured that the ban is temporary in nature and a certain relief has already been granted to some of the shipments.
Mr Blome was assured that the commerce ministry was working diligently for the resolution of any issues being faced by businesses, including those of US. The commerce ministry has already submitted a summary for withdrawal of the ban to the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet in this regard which was deferred in its last meeting.
An official announcement said Mr Qamar also requested the US envoy for early revival of the GSP Scheme which will further provide market access to Pakistani exporters.
Mr Qamar underscored the importance of the decades-long relationship between Pakistan and the US. The role played by Pakistan in averting a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, and the efforts undertaken by it to ensure stability of the region were also highlighted.
US Ambassador appreciated the significant growth seen in exports from Pakistan to the US and expressed the hope for a deeper and wider bilateral relationship in the fields of trade and investment, digital services, science and technology, education, energy, and climate.
Both sides pledged to further strengthen the mutual relationship and work together for the peace and stability of the region.

6,Govt to sell SOEs’ shares to friendly countries with buyback option,"Miftah Ismail says laws, not people, need to be changed to make state firms work efficiently.","ISLAMBAD: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail on Wednesday said the government was amending the laws to enable the sale of shares of listed state-owned entities (SOEs) with a buyback option to friendly countries on a government-to-government (G2G) basis and help bridge a part of $4bn financing gap estimated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the current fiscal year. 
Speaking at a seminar on SOEs corporate governance, the minister also said the ban on imports would be lifted in a couple of weeks and all prior actions agreed upon under the staff-level agreement with the IMF had been completed and there was no more hitch to be able to get the first tranche in the later part of August. 
Without naming the Inter-Government Commercial Transaction Act 2022 that the federal cabinet approved later in the day, the finance minister said the law was necessary because the existing privatisation law did not allow such commercial transactions on a G2G basis.
An official statement after the cabinet meeting said the cabinet approved ‘Inter-Government Commercial Trans­­action Act 2022’ presented by the ministry of law and justice and referred it to the relevant standing committee of the parliament. The cabinet was informed that the law would provide confidence to foreign investors and also increase foreign investment on a G2G basis in developmental agreements. The meeting was told that it was for the first time that practical step was being taken to protect G2G agreements and make them transparent.

Laws, not people, need to be changed to make state firms work efficiently, says Miftah

The minister also talked at length about the prior actions committed with the IMF for the revival of its programme and said the government would be lifting the ban on imports in a couple of weeks because it created difficulties for the people. Mr Ismail said Pakistan had a persistent issue with the SOEs as some of them were badly managed and while some of them were important for service delivery but even those were not providing services and were rather creating problems in the budget.
Mr Ismail said that most of the SOEs had professional people running them as he had personal experience working with boards of PIA, Sui Southern Gas Company and so were others like OGDCL and power distribution companies. Yet they were not able to perform which meant that maybe laws and governance structures restrict their ability to perform. Therefore, the country perhaps needed better law and governance structures to make such entities perform or better ways to expedite their privatisation.
He said there had been no progress on privatisation either over the past decades. A small bank has been losing money since 2007 and on the privatisation list since 2008 but there may be something wrong with laws that it continues to bleed and could not be privatised. Likewise, Roosevelt Hotel in New York has been on the active privatisation list for 26 years since 1996.
He said the country faced an LNG shortage because the ministers and officers in the previous government were scared of the National Accountability Bureau and its law to take decisions and book future orders. On the other hand, such a law also provided an excuse to the people not to work or take decisions which had a huge cost to the nation.
He said NAB had been in place for 20 years but the level of corruption or perception of it did not go down. Similarly, there had been Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) and its laws for more than 20 years but he did not know if procurement costs had been lower and things get better than they were before PPRA.
The reason was that these laws were a straightjacket and provided some people an excuse not to work. Therefore, the change in SOEs-related laws would be made “appropriately to sell SOEs shares to a friendly country through a stock exchange” and two LNG-based power projects owned by the federal government — Balloki and Haveli Bahadur Shah — to another friendly country.
Mr Ismail despised that even though talks for these transactions had not begun, some people had started criticising the sale of “family silver”. “We are only selling shares traded at the stock exchange and only a little bit of each of them. We are not selling majority shares or ownership shares and we are selling a small number of shares on buyback option,” he said, adding that the government could buy back those shares at a later stage if it so desires with improved economic conditions.

7,Pakistan's current account deficit swells to $17.4bn,PML-N-led coalition govt posts second-highest quarterly deficit of $4.3bn.,"KARACHI: The current account deficit (CAD) swelled to $17.4 billion in FY22, which could be the  most painful shock for an economy already in trouble with serious  imbalances.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Wednesday reported  that the country recorded a CAD of $17.406bn in FY22 compared to a gap of just $2.82bn in FY21.
The massive CAD speaks a lot about the severe problem of the balance of payments. The PML-N-led coalition government posted a CAD of $4.323bn in the April-June period of 2021-22, which was the  second highest quarterly deficit of the fiscal year that ended on June  30.
The deficit of over $17.4bn is more inflicting in the wake of  no inflows as loans while the commercial markets are not ready to accept  Pakistan’s bonds due to higher risks.

PML-N-led coalition govt posts second-highest quarterly deficit of $4.3bn

The current account deficit  has exceeded the SBP’s projection for the deficit in FY22. The CAD  increased to 4.6 per cent of GDP in FY22, up from 0.8pc in FY21.
In  November 2021, the SBP issued its Annual Report and said the current  account deficit is projected in the range of 2pc to 3pc of GDP during  FY22.
Reports appearing in local and foreign media suggest that  Pakistan can’t unlock the dollar inflows until the IMF executive board approves its staff-level agreement reached on July 15.
The finance minister has been  hinting at an early deal with the IMF, but with the passage of time,  the trust deficit is rising; the currency market reflects the trust  deficit by depreciating the local currency on a day-to-day basis.
The  CAD in June FY22 was much higher than in May as it rose to $2.275bn in  June compared to $1.430bn in May. The CAD in June FY21 was $1.637bn.
“A surge in oil imports saw CAD rise to $2.3bn in June despite higher  exports and remittances,” the SBP tweeted on Wednesday. So far  in July, oil imports are much lower and the deficit is expected to resume its moderating trajectory,” it added.
The central bank said 3.3 million tonnes of oil were imported in June, a 33pc increase over May.
“Together  with higher global prices, this more than doubled the oil import bill  from $1.4bn to $2.9bn. By contrast, non-oil imports ticked down,” said  the SBP.
The higher oil import bill was held for a higher current  account deficit in June, but the entire fiscal year noted a very high  current account deficit as the second quarter noted the biggest deficit of  $5.565bn.
Further details showed that exports of goods in FY22 were $32.45bn while service exports were $6.97bn.
The  imports of goods were $72.05bn, while the imports of services were  $12.14bn. The balance of trade in goods and services showed a net  deficit of $44.77bn in FY22 compared to $31.15bn a year ago.
The  ongoing fiscal year will face a tough time with poor inflows and  higher outflows while the economic growth rate will be half of the  growth achieved in the previous fiscal year.
