0,Iran says Israel-linked agents planned attack on defence plant,Claims Kurdish militants recruited by Israel's spy agency and given high explosives for attack.,"TEHRAN: Iran said on Wednesday a sabotage team detained by its security forces were Kurdish militants working for Israel who planned to blow up a “sensitive” defence industry centre in the city of Isfahan, state media reported.
Iran’s Intelligence Ministry had announced the arrests on Saturday amid heightening tensions with arch-enemy Israel over Tehran’s nuclear programme, without giving the nationality of those detained.
The ministry said in a statement carried by state media that those detained belonged to the Iranian Kurdish opposition group Komala who had been recruited by Israel’s spy agency, Mossad, and given high explosives for the attack. The Israeli prime minister’s office, which oversees Mossad, declined to comment on the ministry’s first announcement on the arrests on Saturday.
Iran, which often voices concern over the alleged presence of Mossad in the autonomous Iraqi Kurdish region, attacked the area with ballistic missiles in March saying it targeted Israeli  “strategic centres.” Tehran suggested it was revenge for Israeli air strikes that killed Iranian military personnel in Syria.
The Iraqi Kurdish regional government said the attack targeted civilian residential areas, not sites belonging to foreign countries, and called for an international probe.
Earlier this month, US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid signed a joint pledge to deny Iran nuclear arms. Tehran says its nuclear programme is peaceful and denies seeking nuclear weapons.
Separately, an Iranian news agency close to the hardline Revolutionary Guards suggested on Wednesday that Iran should target the Albania-based Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK) exiled opposition group with drones and missiles.
“(Using) Iran’s offensive drones and ballistic missiles to hit the MEK headquarters in Albania faces no legal prohibition, and Tehran’s authorities should put military action on the agenda after issuing the necessary warning to the Albanian government,” Fars news agency said.

Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan and his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian discussed ways of  “boosting bilateral relations and areas of cooperation for the benefit of both countries”, the UAE’s state news agency WAM reported.
Sheikh Abdullah  “highlighted the UAE’s keenness... to enhance the security and stability of the region”, WAM added.
Iran’s foreign ministry said Amir-Abdollahian  “welcomed the enhancement of the level of ties between the two countries” as  “an important step in the process of developing bilateral relations”, in a statement.
It said the Iranian minister also spoke separately with his Omani and Kuwaiti counterparts on Tuesday night.
The United Arab Emirates scaled back its ties with the Islamic republic in 2016 after Iranian protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran following Riyadh’s execution of Shia Muslim cleric Nimr al-Nimr.
Earlier this month, UAE presidential adviser Anwar Gargash said his country was considering sending an ambassador back to Iran and called for regional economic cooperation to help ease political tensions.
“The next decade cannot be like the last decade. It’s a decade where ‘de-escalation’ should be the key word,” he had said.
His comments came after Israel and the United States signed a new security pact reinforcing their common front against Iran, during a visit to the Jewish state by US President Joe Biden.
The UAE’s talk of strengthening Iran ties comes alongside Iraqi efforts to mediate between Emirati ally Riyadh, and Tehran.
Saudi Arabia and Iran have had no diplomatic ties since the 2016 attacks on the kingdom’s diplomatic missions in the Islamic republic, while Kuwait also downgraded relations with Tehran.
An Iranian diplomat told a Kuwaiti newspaper earlier this week that a Kuwaiti ambassador would arrive in Tehran  “in the next few days”, but authorities in the Gulf emirate have yet to announce such a move.
The oil-rich UAE has previously said that Arab Gulf states should take part in  “collective diplomacy” to reach an agreement with Iran, whose talks with Western powers over a faltering 2015 nuclear agreement have been stalled since March.
In 2020, the UAE established diplomatic relations with Israel, a move which Tehran condemned.
Amir-Abdollahian on Tuesday described Israel’s presence in the region as a cause of  “instability and insecurity”, Iran’s foreign ministry said.

2,US Senate passes bill to boost chip making,"WASHINGTON: The US Senate on Wednesday passed sweeping legislation to subsidise the domestic semiconductor industry,...","WASHINGTON: The US Senate on Wednesday passed sweeping legislation to subsidise the domestic semiconductor industry, hoping to boost companies as they compete with China and alleviate a persistent shortage that has affected everything from cars to weapons and video games. 
The Senate passed the long-awaited bill by 64 to 33. The House of Representatives is expected to approve it as soon as later this week, which would send it to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into law. 
The long-awaited “Chips and Science” act provides $52 billion in government subsidies for US semiconductor production as well as an investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion. 
The legislation would also authorise more than $170bn over five years to boost scientific research efforts to better compete with China. Congress would still need to pass separate appropriation legislation to fund those investments. 
“This legislation is going to create good paying jobs, it will alleviate supply chains, it will help lower costs, and it will protect America’s national security interests,” the Senate’s Democratic majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said, urging support for the bill.

3,One gets 63-month sentence for role in US Capitol riot,"Mark Ponder, 56, also was ordered to pay $2,000 in restitution and faces three years of supervised release.","WASHINGTON: A District of Columbia man who pleaded guilty to assaulting police officers outside the US Capitol was sentenced on Tuesday to 63 months behind bars, tying the record for the longest prison term to date for anyone convicted in the Jan 6, 2021 riot.
Mark Ponder, 56, also was ordered to pay $2,000 in restitution and faces three years of supervised release following his federal prison term of five years and three months, the US Department of Justice said in announcing the sentencing.
Ponder assaulted three officers in a series of confrontations on the Capitol grounds after a mob of supporters of then-president Donald Trump overwhelmed police lines on the West Plaza of the building on the afternoon of Jan 6, according to court documents in the case.
The ensuing riot led to several deaths, left more than 140 police officers injured and delayed a joint session of Congress in certifying the November 2020 presidential election victory of Democrat Joe Biden over Trump, the Republican incumbent who falsely claimed he lost due to widespread fraud and summoned supporters to Washington to  “stop the steal.”  Arrested on March 17, 2021, Ponder pleaded guilty in April of this year to charges of assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers using a dangerous weapon.
According to the DOJ statement, he swung a pole at a US Capitol Police officer, striking the officer’s riot shield and breaking the pole in two, before arming himself with a thicker pole that he wielded against other officers, striking one of them in the shoulder. US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, at Tuesday’s hearing, said Ponder  “was leading the charge” as  “part of a group who, when they couldn’t get what they wanted, decided they were going to take it, and they were going to take it with violence,” according to the Washington Post.
The 63-month-long sentence levied against Ponder matches the prison term imposed in December against a Florida man, Robert Scott Palmer, convicted for throwing a wooden plank and a fire extinguisher at police during the Jan 6 riot.
Palmer’s sentence was then the longest yet stemming from the attack on the Capitol.
More than 850 people have been charged with taking part in the riot, the most violent assault on the halls of Congress since the British invasion of Washington during the War of 1812. More than 325 guilty pleas have been entered to date in connection with the Jan. 6 upheaval.

James Lovelock

 
LONDON: Influential Bri­tish scientist James Lovelock, famed for his Gaia hypothesis and pioneering work on climate change, has died at the age of 103, his family announced on Wednesday. 
The legendary scientist’s family said in a statement that Lovelock died on Tuesday on his 103rd birthday as the result of complications from a fall. 
“To the world he was best known as a scientific pioneer, climate prophet and conceiver of the Gaia theory,” it said, noting he was also a “loving husband and wonderful father with a boundless sense of curiosity”. 
Responding to the news Mary Archer, chair of Britain’s Science Museum Group’s board of trustees, described him as “arguably the most important independent scientist of the last century”. 
“Jim Lovelock was decades ahead of his time in thinking about the Earth and climate and his unique approach was an inspiration for many,” she added in a statement. 
In the 1970s, Lovelock came up with the Gaia hypothesis that Earth is a single, self-regulating super-organism made up of all its life forms, which humans are destroying. 
The notion was at first ridiculed by his peers, but helped to redefine how science perceives the relationship between our inanimate planet and the life it hosts. 
Lovelock became known as a prophet of climate doom. 
With his 2006 book The Revenge of Gaia, he issued a terrifying warning: if humankind failed to radically curtail greenhouse-gas emissions, there would, quite literally, be hell to pay. 
“We have left it far, far too late to save the planet as we know it,” Lovelock said in 2009. 
Pixie-like and unfailingly polite, Lovelock spent much of his career as a self-described “independent scientist”, but the price for freedom was a lack of institutional backing. 
Lovelock’s ideas were often at odds with conventional wisdom, ahead of their time or, in the case of climate change, unbearably grim. 
In a 2020 interview, he warned that the world had lost perspective in responding to the coronavirus, and should focus on a far more formidable foe: global warming.  “Climate change is more dangerous to life on Earth than almost any conceivable disease,” he said.  “If we don’t do something about it, we will find ourselves removed from the planet.”  
Born in 1919, Lovelock grew up in south London between the two World Wars, and studied chemistry, medicine and biophysics in the UK and the US. 
As his brilliance emerged, he was quickly drafted by Britain’s National Institute for Medical Research, where he worked for 20 years. 
In the 1950s, he invented the machine used to detect the hole in ozone layer. 
In the early 1960s, Nasa lured him to California to investigate possible life on Mars.  With another Nasa scientist, he analysed the atmosphere on the planet, looking for a chemical imbalance and gases reacting with each other, which would hint at life. 
They found nothing, putting a dampener on hopes of finding life on Mars. 
Scientists now think that Earth’s nearest neighbour may once have been warm and wet and possibly have supported microbial life.

5,China closely tracking debris of its most powerful rocket,It is understood that this type of rocket adopts a special technical design and most components will be destroyed during reentry.,"BEIJING: China is closely tracking the remnants of a Long March 5B rocket launched over the weekend, but the chances of debris causing damage are very slim, the foreign ministry said on Wednesday.
Last year, China was accused of being opaque, particularly by Nasa, after it kept silent about the estimated debris trajectory of a Long March 5B rocket and its reentry window.
On Sunday, China’s most powerful rocket was launched for the third time since its maiden flight in 2020 to deliver a module into orbit as part of the construction of a Chinese space station.
It is understood that this type of rocket adopts a special technical design and most components will be destroyed during reentry, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular media briefing, when asked if China knew when and where the rocket debris could land. The probability of causing harm to aviation and the ground was very low, Zhao said.

6,Shadowy Al Qaeda fighters heap pressure on Mali’s junta,"BAMAKO: Al Qaeda jihadists are tightening the screws on Mali’s military junta, extending their attacks to the ...","BAMAKO: Al Qaeda jihadists are tightening the screws on Mali’s military junta, extending their attacks to the south of the country and hitting a key garrison town on the outskirts of the capital.
Raids last week displayed coordination and operational complexity at a range that is unprecedented in the country’s decade-long jihadist campaign, say analysts.
Last Thursday, six attacks unfolded simultaneously at 5am, striking the country’s troubled centre as well as the southern regions of Sikasso, Koulikoro and Kayes, which until now had never been targeted.
The following day, two explosive-laden vehicles smashed into the gates of an army building in Kati, a garrison town 15 kilometres from Bamako, killing a soldier.
The suicide raid was claimed by the Support Group for Islam and Muslims (GSIM), the main jihadist alliance in the Sahel and an Al Qaeda affiliate, according to monitoring group SITE.
The operation was  “a way of telling (the authorities) that they can strike anywhere,” a Malian analyst in the central town of Sevare said.
The name of Kati has huge resonance in Mali. Its army base was the springboard for the country’s August 2020 coup and reputedly houses the country’s strongman, Colonel Assimi Goita, and Defence Minister Colonel Sadio Camara.
‘Corridor’ to south
GSIM was created in 2017 from several groups — Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, an early pioneer of jihadism in the Sahel that was born in 2007, and Katiba Macina, Ansar Dine and Al-Mourabitoun, which were also led by veteran militants.
A UN-based expert in jihadist groups said the GSIM’s southward push emulated its successful  “strategy of contagion” in the centre of the country. Jihadists first struck the north of Mali in 2012, joining a regional insurgency.
After being scattered the following year by French forces, they regrouped, in 2015 launching attacks in the ethnically volatile centre and cross-border raids on Niger and Burkina Faso.
Across the three countries, thousands of civilians have been killed and more than two million have been displaced, and the economic damage has been devastating.
Heni Nsebia, a researcher at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), said the recent attacks had had  “modest results, bearing in mind the means that were deployed”.
However, they were also a potent demonstration of the GSIM’s powers of coordination, proving the organisation is not  “just a coalition of disparate groups”, he said.
One insight that emerges is the  “major freedom of movement” for jihadists between the centre and south of the country, demonstrating the GSIM’s influence over a vast area that includes the border with Burkina Faso, said Nsebia.
A recent report by UN specialists described a  “southwards corridor” enabling GSIM to  “extend towards the Atlantic coast” and countries on the Gulf of Guinea beyond Burkina Faso, notably Benin and Togo, where cross-border attacks have been rising.
GSIM’s targeted tactics contrast with those adopted by IS jihadists in Mali, who are often blamed for indiscriminate massacres of civilians.
In areas where it wields special clout, such as the arid regions of the north, the GSIM tries to set up a parallel government to the state, say local sources.

7,Miners unearth pink diamond believed to be largest seen in 300 years,SYDNEY: Miners in Angola have unearthed a rare pure pink diamond that is believed to be the largest found in 300...,"SYDNEY: Miners in Angola have unearthed a rare pure pink diamond that is believed to be the largest found in 300 years, the Australian site operator announced on Wednesday.
A 170 carat pink diamond — dubbed The Lulo Rose — was discovered at Lulo mine in the country’s diamond-rich northeast and is among the largest pink diamonds ever found, the Lucapa Diamond Company said in a statement to investors.
The  “historic” find of the Type IIa diamond, one of the rarest and purest forms of natural stones, was welcomed by the Angolan government, which is also a partner in the mine.
“This record and spectacular pink diamond recovered from Lulo continues to showcase Angola as an important player on the world stage,” Angola’s Mineral Resources Minister Diamantino Azevedo said. The diamond will be sold at international tender, likely at a dazzling price.
Although The Lulo Rose would have to be cut and polished to realise its true value, in a process that can see a stone lose 50 percent of its weight, similar pink diamonds have sold for record-breaking prices.
The 59.6 carat Pink Star was sold at a Hong Kong auction in 2017 for 71.2 million US dollars. It remains the most expensive diamond ever sold.

8,Pro-Sadr protesters storm parliament over PM nomination,BAGHDAD: Supporters of powerful Iraqi cleric Moqtada Sadr on Wednesday stormed parliament after penetrating the...,"BAGHDAD: Supporters of powerful Iraqi cleric Moqtada Sadr on Wednesday stormed parliament after penetrating the capital’s high-security government Green Zone, protesting against a rival bloc’s nomination for prime minister.
The protests are the latest challenge for oil-rich Iraq, which remains mired in a political and a socioeconomic crisis despite elevated global oil prices.
Protesters  “stormed the parliament” after initially being stopped by police firing a barrage of tear gas, a security source said.
State news agency INA said on messaging app Telegram that  “protesters have entered the parliament building”.
Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi called on the protesters to  “immediately withdraw” from the heavily fortified Green Zone, which is home to both government buildings and diplomatic missions.
He warned in a statement that security forces would see to  “the protection of state institutions and foreign missions, and prevent any harm to security and order”.
A correspondent in the Green Zone had earlier seen protesters carrying a fellow demonstrator who had been hurt.
Sadr’s bloc won 73 seats in Iraq’s October 2021 election, making it the largest faction in the 329-seat parliament. But since the vote, talks to form a new government have stalled.
The protesters oppose the candidacy of Mohammed al-Sudani, a former minister and ex-provincial governor, who is the pro-Iran Coordination Framework’s pick for premier.
Iraq was plunged deeper into political crisis last month when the 73 lawmakers from Sadr’s bloc quit en masse in an apparent bid to break a logjam over the establishment of a new government.
Sixty-four new Iraqi lawmakers were sworn in later in June, making the pro-Iran bloc the largest in parliament.
Sadr had initially supported the idea of a  “majority government” which would have sent his Shia adversaries from the Coordination Framework into opposition.
The former militia leader then surprised many by compelling his lawmakers to resign, a move seen as seeking to pressure his rivals to fast-track government formation.
Earlier this month, hundreds of thousands of Muslim worshippers loyal to Sadr attended a Friday prayer service in Baghdad, in a display of political might to revive stalled talks on government formation.
The huge turnout came despite scorching heat and the cleric not being there in person — an indication of his status as a political heavyweight, as well as a key religious authority.
The mercurial cleric’s sermon took aim at rivals from other factions, including a powerful ex-paramilitary network.
“We are at a difficult... crossroads in the formation of the government, entrusted to some we do not trust,” Sadr said in the speech on July 15, read out by Sheikh Mahmud al-Jayashi. Some factions have shown they are  “not up to the task”, he added.

9,Scotland houses Ukrainian refugees on cruise ship,EDINBURGH: Scotland has started to house Ukrainian refugees who fled the Russian invasion on a cruise ship docked ...,"EDINBURGH: Scotland has started to house Ukrainian refugees who fled the Russian invasion on a cruise ship docked off Edinburgh, the devolved government has said.
The first Ukrainians boarded the specially chartered M/S Victoria on Tuesday, in a policy that critics brand potentially unsafe and unsuitable.
The Scottish government plans to use the vessel, which is says is  “fully staffed” and safe, to house up to 1,700 Ukrainian refugees in 739 cabins until next January to fill an accommodation backlog for refugees.
It insists they will have access to support services, including healthcare and benefits, as well as  “unrestricted access” to services onshore.
“We do not want people spending more time in temporary accommodation, such as the ship, for any longer than is absolutely necessary,” government minister Shona Robison said.
“But we want to make them as comfortable as possible during their stay and we have worked with partners to provide a variety of services on-board for guests in addition to the support services available.” She noted they include restaurants, child play facilities with toys and books, shops, laundry, cleaning, wifi access and communal spaces.
But opposition parties and welfare organisations have voiced concerns, including over access to schooling for younger refugees and the possibility of Covid-19 outbreaks on-board.
“People fleeing war were promised a safe place to stay in Scotland, but instead they have been stuck on a cruise ship,” Scottish Labour’s Sarah Boyack said.
Scotland has provided housing for more than 9,000 displaced Ukrainians since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.
A sponsor scheme has brought nearly 100,000 Ukrainians so far to Britain, but Scotland suspended its version of the scheme earlier this month after a dramatic increase in the number of new applicants.
It said more time was needed to match new arrivals to temporary and long-term accommodation.
Former finance minister Rishi Sunak — who is competing with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to replace outgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson — recently unveiled plans to detain migrants on cruise ships after they crossed the Channel.
The proposal was subject to hostile counter-briefings, with newspapers reporting it was  “laughed off the table” by ministers and officials over costs and legal concerns.

10,"Russia ‘one of last imperial colonial powers’, says Macron",Describes country as “one of the countries to make the most forceful use of instruments of propaganda”.,"COTONOU: French President Emmanuel Macron, on a visit to Benin on Wednesday, branded Russia  “one of the last imperial colonial powers” for its invasion of Ukraine.
“Russia launched an offensive against Ukraine. It’s a territorial war, the likes of which we thought had disappeared from European soil.
“It’s a war from the early 20th, even the 19th century,” Macron said on the second leg of a trip to Africa to reset France’s relations with the continent, where many nations are former French colonies.
“I speak on a continent that has suffered colonial imperialism,” Macron added.
Delivering the broadside at a news conference with Benin President Patrice Talon, Macron said  “Russia is one of the last imperial colonial powers”, because it had decided to  “invade a neighbouring country to defend its interests”.
Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, triggering a war that has killed thousands, displaced millions and sparked fears of a global food crisis over blocked grain exports.
Macron accused the Kremlin of launching  “a new type of hybrid world war”.
“It decided that information, energy and food were military instruments placed at the service” of the war in Ukraine, he said.
Macron said he wanted to  “describe what’s happening today in the baldest terms”.
He accused Russia of disruption through  “disinformation”, describing it as  “one of the countries to make the most forceful use of instruments of propaganda”. He referred specifically to the television channels Russia Today and Sputnik.
Simultaneous Russian tour 
Russia has cut back on gas deliveries to western Europe and Ukrainian grain has remained blocked in ports since the start of the war, driving a surge in global prices for energy and cereals.
Russia’s energy giant Gazprom slashed its gas exports to Europe via the Nord Stream pipeline on Wednesday to about 20 percent of its capacity, German authorities have said.
Ukraine, meanwhile, says it had restarted operations at its Black Sea ports, a key phase to resuming grain exports under a UN-backed deal.
The French leader is on a tour of three African countries — Cameroon, Benin and Guinea-Bissau — that coincides with an African tour by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
In Ethiopia on Wednesday, Lavrov urged a gathering of African diplomats not to back a US-led world order.
It is up to us to decide whether to have a  “world where we have (the) so-called collective West... totally subordinated to the United States and feeling... that it has the right to decide when and how to promote its own interests, without following international law”, he said. The West responded to Russia’s military incursion into Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Moscow.
In Addis Ababa, Lavrov accused the West of throwing its principles  “down the drain... when they needed to do what they believe is to punish Russia”.
“I don’t have the slightest doubt that if need be, they will not hesitate to do the same in relation to any other country... which would irritate them,” he warned.
French pledge of support
In Cameroon on Tuesday, Macron said the archives on French colonial rule in Cameroon would be opened  “in full” and asked historians to shed light on the period’s  “painful moments”.
French colonial authorities brutally repressed armed Cameroonian nationalists before the country’s independence in 1960.

11,China says US will ‘bear all consequences’ if Pelosi visits Taiwan,The potential visit is likely to dominate a phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US counterpart Joe Biden.,"BEIJING: China warned on Wednesday that Washington would  “bear the consequences” if US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visits Taiwan, with tensions soaring ahead of an expected phone call between the two countries’ leaders.
Beijing has hit back hard against the United States after reports emerged last week that Pelosi, a Democrat who is second in line to the presidency, could visit the self-ruled island of Taiwan in August.
The potential visit is likely to dominate a phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US counterpart Joe Biden, which the US leader has said he expects will take place this week.
Ties between the two global superpowers have continued to deteriorate under Biden’s presidency, over issues including Taiwan, human rights and technology sector competition.
Beijing this week warned that it was  “getting ready” for a possible visit by Pelosi, which would be the first to Taiwan by a sitting US House speaker since 1997.
“We are firmly opposed to Speaker Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular press conference on Wednesday.
“If the US pushes ahead and challenges China’s bottom line... the US side will bear all the consequences,” he added.
A possible visit by Pelosi — yet to be confirmed by the senior Democrat — has stirred alarm in Biden’s administration, which fears the trip may cross red lines for China.
It also comes at an especially fraught time as Chinese President Xi Jinping prepares to cement his rule later this year at a major party meeting amid economic headwinds.
Last week Biden said the US military thought a visit was  “not a good idea right now”.
Democratic Taiwan lives under constant threat of being invaded by China, which views it as part of its territory to be seized by force if necessary. China’s air incursions near Taiwan have risen sharply this year as Beijing works to isolate the island on the international stage.
Pelosi told reporters last week it was  “important for us to show support for Taiwan”, while denying Congress was pushing for independence for the island.
In 1979 Washington switched relations from Taipei to Beijing, and successive administrations have been careful to recognise only  “one China” by not sending top-ranking officials to Taiwan. Washington has had a long-standing policy of strategic ambiguity on whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack on the island.
Biden recently said the United States was ready to defend Taiwan militarily in an invasion — going beyond just providing weapons — although the White House has walked back his remarks.
The US State Department in April approved the potential sale of equipment, training and other items to support Taiwan’s Air Defense System in a deal valued at up to $95 million.
But Taiwan enjoys bipartisan backing in divided Washington and China’s warnings have only fuelled calls for Pelosi to go ahead.
She has long been an outspoken critic of Beijing’s human rights record, in 1991 outraging her hosts by unfurling a banner in Tiananmen Square in memory of pro-democracy demonstrators killed there two years earlier.

12,Nine killed in Somalia suicide bombing,The attack occurred outside the administrative office in the town of Marka.,"MOGADISHU: Nine people including a senior local government official were killed on Wednesday in a suicide bombing in southern Somalia claimed by the Al Shabaab jihadist group, police and witnesses said.
The attack occurred outside the administrative office in the town of Marka, where the district commissoner Abdullahi Ali Ahmed Wafow was speaking with local people, police said.
“Commissioner Abdullahi Wafow was killed in an explosion together with eight other people, most of them security personnel,” a police officer in Marka, Ibrahim Ali, said.
“The police are still investigating the incident but there are already indications that a suicide bomber carried out the deadly attack.” Al Shaabab claimed responsibility in a brief statement, saying the  “martydom operation” had targeted the commissioner.
“The bomber ran up to the commissioner and blew himself up,” witness Abdukadir Hassan said.
“I was close to where the incident occurred, the scene was horrible with these shattered pieces of human flesh all around.” Somalia’s new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said this month that ending Al Shabaab’s insurgency required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time is right.
The jihadists have been seeking to overthrow the fragile foreign-backed government in Mogadishu for about 15 years.
