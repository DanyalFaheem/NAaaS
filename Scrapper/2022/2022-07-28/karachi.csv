0,Sanitation becomes big challenge after Karachi gets respite from rains,Two more die from electrocution; moderate to heavy rains expected for a couple of days.,"KARACHI: With light rains in some parts of the city after the fresh spell of monsoon almost subsided, the damages done by heavy downpour earlier this week continued to affect the city life on Wednesday claiming life of three people and rendering several residential areas unlivable due to overflowing sewage from drains and gutters and stagnating rainwater on roads.  
The Met office recorded light rain in the early hours of day when Gulshan-i-Hadeed received the highest amount of rainfall i.e. 17 millimetres followed by Korangi (10mm). Most of the city areas witnessed drizzles, traces or single digit count of the downpour.  
“The system [of fresh spell] has almost subsided and moved to Balochistan, but a few areas of upper Sindh can still witness light to moderate or heavy rains for a couple of days,” said Sardar Sarfaraz of the Met office.

Two more die from electrocution

He added that the current model and the latest data analysis didn’t suggest any new system for at least a week. It is expected that the fresh break may help the city administration bring back the city to normality, which is right now facing a serious challenge of sanitation.  
The sanitation conditions and garbage disposal system in the metropolis have become a major problem after the rains. Despite light and scattered rains on Wednesday, the downpour continued to cause damages and fatal incidents.  
Jauharabad SHO A.D. Chaudhry said that the body of a man, in his early 30s, was found floating in the river near Imtiaz Superstore.Chippa divers recovered the body and took it to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital to fulfil medico-legal formalities. The corpse was shifted to the morgue for want of identification.  
In another incident, Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the body of a 40-year-old man, identified as Nadeem Ahmed, was brought from Jubilee to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi. He died from electrocution.  
Another 50-year-old man, Shaukat Husain, died when he received an electric shock inside his home in Miskeen Shah Mohalla of Baldia Town.  
Meanwhile, a traffic police spokesperson said there was accumulated rainwater at Submarine turning. Rainwater was still standing between Nazimabad Chowrangi-1 and Lasbella.  
The spokesperson said the condition of National Highway in Malir from Lala Zar to Quaidabad Chowk was also bad due to standing water. Korangi Causeway has been closed for traffic while potholes had been created on several roads across the city due to accumulated rainwater disturbing the traffic flow.

1,Ruckus as PTI boycotts Sindh Assembly session over opposition leader’s arrest,"PA passes Sindh Social Protection Authority Bill, 2022 unanimously.","KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly on Wednesday unanimously passed the Sindh Social Protection Authority Bill in the absence of main opposition party, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, which staged a walkout in protest over the arrest of Leader of the Opposition Haleem Adil Sheikh.
At the outset of the proceedings, PTI’s parliamentary party leader Khurrum Sher Zaman rose right after dua seeking Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari’s permission to speak to raise the issue of Mr Shaikh’s arrest on a point of order as the chair called for Question Hour in the assembly.
However, the deputy speaker denied the permission telling the PTI member that she would hear him after the completion of the business on the house agenda.
However, he insisted to be given the floor. The deputy speaker, however, made it clear that she would not run the house as per anyone’s wish.

Minister Chawla says police not bound to take permission from speaker before arresting any MPA

Mr Sher Zaman said that the deputy speaker should tell the house why Mr Sheikh had been arrested. He also wanted to know if prior permission of the chair was obtained before the arrest of the PTI leader.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla rose to tell the house that Mr Sheikh had been arrested in a land grabbing case.
While Minister Chawla and Mr Sher Zaman exchanged harsh words, the other PTI members also stood and gathered in front of the speaker’s rostrum, chanting slogans against the government.
The deputy speaker also warned PTI’s Dr Seema Zia for filming the protest telling her that the mobile phone was not allowed in the house.
“If you people were serious, you would have listened to me,” Ms Leghari told the protesting PTI members, asking them to go back to their seats.
“I have not denied you to speak. I will hear you after Question Hour,” she repeatedly said.
Nonetheless, the chair gave floor to Mr Sher Zaman, who said that the opposition leader was arrested without the permission of the speaker. “He [Mr Sheikh] is a member of this house and has obtained bail in cases registered against him yet he was arrested,” he deplored and asked the chair if the opposition leader was arrested with her permission.
Minister Chawla said that the opposition leader was arrested in a criminal case and the police were not bound to take permission from the speaker before arresting a sitting lawmaker under the law and assembly rules. 
“He [Sheikh] is a land grabber and a number one thief,” Minister Chawla said, as his remarks enraged the PTI members who tore copies of the agenda before boycotting the proceedings.
Labour Minister Saeed Ghani rose to say that there was no law or rule in the assembly rules to seek permission of the speaker before the arrest of any MPA in a criminal case. However, he said, the chair’s prior permission was required before the detention of an assembly member.
Later, Mr Chwala, who also holds the portfolio of food ministry, furnished replies and statement to the lawmakers’ written and verbal queries.
Social protection authority bill passed
The house unanimously passed The Sindh Social Protection Authority Bill, 2022 to establish an authority to provide what the government said comprehensive and efficient social protection to the vulnerable people.
“The State is obligated to promote social justice and economic well-being of all, but in particular of and ensure social vulnerable persons and families. The Province of Sindh is committed to realise the principles of policy reflected in Articles 37 and 38 of the Constitution,” said the statement of objects and reasons of the bill.
It added that the provincial government was committed to the establishment of an institutionalised framework to provide sustained and coordinated social protection interventions to assist the poor and vulnerable individuals and households achieve economic security, human development and social empowerment.
It said: “In order to assist the poor and vulnerable individuals and household and to achieve economic security, human development and social empowerment, it is expedient to establish an Authority known as the Sindh Social Protection Authority and to enact a law in the matter.”
Minister Chawla also introduced three government bills —The Sindh Prohibition of Preparation, Manufacturing, Storage, Sale and Use of Gutka and Manpuri (Amendment) Bill, 2021, The Sindh Reproductive Healthcare Rights (Amendment) Bill, 2022 and The Dow University of Health Sciences (Amendment) Bill, 2022.
The bills were sent to standing committees concerned for further deliberations. Later, the chair adjourned the house to Thursday (today).

2,"Dua Zehra sent to shelter home with consent of parents, ‘spouse’",KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Wednesday sent teenage Dua Zehra to a government-run child protection and shelter...,"KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Wednesday sent teenage Dua Zehra to a government-run child protection and shelter home, where she would stay till the conclusion of the trial of a case pertaining to her alleged kidnapping.
Judicial Magistrate (East) Aftab Ahmed Bughio passed this order on an application moved by her purported husband, Zaheer Ahmed, seeking directions for the child protection officer (CPO) to produce Dua in court.
Dua, who was brought to Karachi on July 24 from Lahore, was on Wednesday produced before the judicial magistrate by the investigating officer, DSP Saeed Rind through CPO Hafiz Noman Iqbal Usmani amigh tight security.
At the time of her production, the magistrate only allowed the counsel representing the parties to present inside the courtroom.
He clarified to the parties that “at this juncture it is necessary to point out that today the purpose of production of the minor/victim is to safeguard her rights till commencement of the trial and decide the better place for her for her temporary stay”.
The magistrate wrote in his order that after her production the victim/minor was identified by inquiring the introductory questions i.e. her name and father’s name. After being satisfied with regard to the identity she was inquired about the place where she was temporarily/lodging in the Shelter Home for Destitute and Orphan Children Social Welfare.  Thereafter, the magistrate also inquired accompanying CPO about the environment under which the victim/minor is kept/residing.
A counsel representing her purported husband Zaheer Ahmed said Dua wanted to give a brief statement. However, the magistrate did not entertain the counsel’s request and made it clear that she was not produced in court for the purpose of recording her statement, but the purpose was just to ensure protection of her rights, including security.
The court inquired from the counsel representing the parties as to whether they were satisfied if the custody was entrusted to the Shelter Home for the Destitute and Orphan Children Social Welfare. Upon which, both the parties — Zaheer and Dua’s family — showed no reservations if Dua’s custody was handed over to the shelter home.
“I’m of the opinion that Shelter Home for Destitute & Orphan Children Social Welfare is the appropriate place for entrusting the custody during the period of trial or till further orders. Accordingly, the custody of the victim is hereby entrusted to the Shelter Home for Destitute & Orphan Children Social Welfare,” the magistrate ordered.
The court also directed the CPO to ensure that no person was allowed to meet Dua without seeking prior permission from the court. 
He also ordered that the custody of the minor shall not be moved from the shelter home unless there was written orders from the court or any other court of competent jurisdiction.
On April 16, Dua’s parents had lodged an FIR stating that their daughter had been kidnapped when she left the house to dispose of some trash. After nearly 10 days, on April 26, the teenage girl was recovered from Okara. In a video statement that day, Dua had said that she wasn’t kidnapped and had married Zaheer of her own free will.

3,Uzair Baloch acquitted in three more cases for ‘lack of evidence’,"The decade-old cases pertain to murder, kidnapping, possession of explosives and police encounter.","KARACHI: An antiterrorism court on Wednesday acquitted chief of outlawed Peoples Amn Committee Uzair Baloch in three cases pertaining to kidnapping, premeditated murder and encounter with police due to “lack of evidence”.
The alleged Lyari kingpin is facing trial in dozens of criminal cases pertaining to kidnapping, murder, encounter and running extortion rackets under the alleged patronage of police high-ups and the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party.
On Wednesday, the ATC-VII judge, who conducted the trial in the judicial complex inside the central prison, pronounced his verdict reserved earlier in the three cases.
The judge ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove the charge against accused Uzair Baloch, Zakir alias Dada and Muhammad Shahid.

The decade-old cases pertain to murder, kidnapping, possession of explosives and police encounter

The judge ordered immediate release of Uzair, who is kept in a Rangers’ detention facility, if his custody was not required in any other case.
However, Advocate Abid Zaman said Uzair could not be immediately released since he has been facing trial in around 15 identical criminal cases. He said he has so far been acquitted in around 20 criminal cases.
According to the prosecution, on the instructions of PAC chief Uzair his armed aides — Zubair Baloch, Zafar Baloch alias Langra and others — had kidnapped two members of the rival Katchi Rabita Committee on Feb 15, 2012 within the jurisdiction of Kalri police station and killed one of them.
A case was registered under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 302 (premeditated murder), 109 (abetment) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) read with Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997 at the Kalri police station.
The same court also acquitted Uzair Baloch, Zakir alias Dada and Muhammad Shahid in two identical cases pertaining to attacking an armoured personnel carrier with rockets killing Constable Syed Nayyer Abbas and two passers-by on Feb 15, 2012.
The prosecution said that the law enforcement agencies had launched a joint operation against Lyari gangsters, who led by Uzair Baloch and Zafar Baloch attacked then with rockets and grenades.
A case was registered under Sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 324 (attempted murder), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Sections 3/4 of the Explosive Substances Act read with Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the ATA at the Kalakot police station.
In January 2016, Rangers had announced the arrest of Uzair in a raid on the outskirts of Karachi. Some reports said that he was already in custody when he was arrested in Dubai with the help of Interpol. Later, the army had taken over his custody for a trial in an espionage case and a military court had sentenced him to 12 years in prison for spying for Iranian intelligence agencies.

4,Historic Napa building damaged by torrential rains,"Since Hindu Gymkhana is heritage building, repair works cannot be undertaken without permission...","KARACHI: This year’s monsoon season, which unfortunately has not ended yet, has caused enormous harm to the lives and properties in Karachi. The damage has largely been of a tangible nature. But the excessive accumulation of rainwater inside the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) housed in the historic Hindu Gymkhana, is causing destruction on multiple levels. 
While the structure itself is a work of art — a heritage building — its historicity and the artistic dreams that the students and faculty of Napa pursue contribute an invaluable amount to the intangible cultural richness that the city in particular and the country in general are proud of. 
The rains that came down with ferocious might on July 24 found their way, through M R Kayani Road, into the Napa premises. Consequently, the garden and the open spaces that lead to the main building and Zia Mohyeddin Theatre got inundated with rainwater, so much so that driving a vehicle or walking into the academy has become a toilsome task, not to mention the detritus and garbage that the area gathered in the wake of the rainy spell. 
If walking around the vicinity is no cakewalk anymore, using your olfactory sense is also a struggle. 

Since Hindu Gymkhana is heritage building, repair works cannot be undertaken without permission

Not just that, a visit to the cultural space on Wednesday brought to light the cracks and leakage in the ceilings of the structure; and the drip-drop on the floors because of the downpour has burdened those who look after the academy with a new task unrelated to artistic activities. 
Talking to Dawn, Farooq Qasim Ali, company secretary at Napa, said, “Rainwater is coming through the ceilings, but since it’s a heritage building, we can’t do anything about it without permission. When the [M R Kayani] road submerges, the water enters Napa. As a preventive measure, we put blocks of cements and stacked them in front of the doors to the rooms, for example, in front of the main entrance to Zia Mohyeddin Theatre. While it did stop the water from entering the building, we could not do anything about the leakage.” 
Hindu Gymkhana was built in the 1920s. Designed by Ahmed Husain Agha, it’s believed it was inspired by the tomb of Itamadud Daula in Agra (1628), which is why it’s representative of Mughal revivalist designs (as are a couple of Agha’s other works of architecture in Karachi). It has a raised central section, arched openings, octagonal corner towers and chhajjas. 
Napa’s is just one important pre-independence piece of construction that the recent rains have unleashed their wrath on. Karachi is dotted with such colonial legacies. The authorities concerned should realise that monsoons are destroying our collective present and past with equal callousness.

5,"Experts raise alarm at high prevalence of hepatitis cases  in country, say most patients unaware of their status","Advise people to get tested for hepatitis B, C; World Hepatitis Day today...","KARACHI: Sharing their concerns over the high prevalence of hepatitis in the country, experts said on Wednesday that Pakistan had the second highest burden of hepatitis C virus infection in the world and its cases were on the rise amid a decline in the number of hepatitis B cases. Both infections combined claimed lives of around 30,000 to 35,000 people every year.
A major barrier in tackling the health challenge, they pointed out, was that the majority of the infected patients were unaware of their hepatitis status.
They were speaking to Dawn in connection with World Hepatitis Day which is being observed today (July 28). The theme of this year is Bringing hepatitis care closer to you.
“Often, people don’t get tested out of their misplaced fear that they would have to go through painful treatment, if their results came positive. They don’t know that now inexpensive, painless treatment is available with complete recovery in three months,” Dr Huma Qureshi, senior gastroenterologist and National Focal Person for Hepatitis, explained.

Advise people to get tested for hepatitis B, C; World Hepatitis Day today

Describing hepatitis C as a silent killer, she said the infection remained in the body for years with no symptoms. Delayed diagnoses resulted in chronic liver disease, primary liver cancer, and cirrhosis.
“This is why it’s important that people get themselves screened for the infection, voluntarily. Earlier, patients were administered with injections, a painful treatment. But, now we have tablets that can easily be taken for a few months and the results are very positive.”
On the government-run hepatitis control programme, she said it needed to be run on sustainable grounds as facilities for free diagnosis and treatment were occasionally suspended due to insufficient funds, causing huge inconvenience to patients.
Liver cancer risk
According to Dr Saeed Hamid, senior consultant gastroenterologist at Aga Khan University Hospital, there are nearly 10 million people actively infected with hepatitis C in the country and need treatment.
“However, only about 21 per cent have been diagnosed, so far, and only 13-15pc treated. The biggest challenge is to diagnose the many millions that need treatment. Same story goes for hepatitis B. Together, these chronic viral infections increase the risk of liver cancer in these patients by 15 to 20 fold,” he said.
Liver cancer was the second commonest cause of cancer deaths in our country, he added.
About the risk posed by hepatitis E, he said, it could become a serious, life threatening illness in pregnant women and in patients with chronic liver disease.
“These two groups need to be protected from this infection through ensuring safe water and food supplies. A vaccine for prevention of hepatitis E is also now available in Pakistan,” he said.
Senior gastroenterologist Dr Zahid Azam, also medical superintendent at the Dow University Hospital, was of the opinion that new cases of both hepatitis B and hepatitis C were declining (in Karachi) mainly due to the availability of hepatitis B vaccine and good medicine for hepatitis C with 90pc response rate.
“A positive step taken in the Musharraf government was to make hepatitis B vaccination part of the EPI programme, which has led to a decline in new cases.”
Dr Azam believed that the risk factors for liver disease in the coming years would be obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol level and blood pressure, also risk factors for heart diseases.

According to her, the cost of chemotherapy at Dow Hospital will be much lower than private hospitals. 
The hospital already has other allied services for cancer patients including in- and out-patient department services and a day-care centre.
“The medical oncology services have now been completed at the hospital. These services are being supervised by a specialist certified by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, UK. We plan to offer chemotherapy services to all patients in need including breast and ovarian cancer patients,”said Dow Hospital medical superintendent Dr Zahid Azam.

A team of media persons from Thatta on Wednesday visited deltaic villages of Ali Mohammad Katiyar, Anb Khaskheli, Saud Perozani, Majeed Wenjharo, Peeru Perozani, Essa Rajpar, Haji Qasim Wadhelo, Abu Bakar Khaskheli, Mohammad Khan Hajano, Zahid Baloch, Usman Marvo, Alu Somalani, Mohammad Notkani, Mehmood Jat and others in Keti Bandar, Kharochan, Ghorabari and Mirpur Sakro talukas and found houses and standing crops inundated by rainwater.
The team found 15 Dehs (Revenue Administrative Unit) of union councils of Moal, Bet Meyar, Khann, Baghan, Buhara, Chowbandi and Ketibandar were the worst affected as the rainwater and the back-flow of water had caused Baghaan, Garho, Oachato and Balki saline water drains to overtop their banks and wreak havoc in the areas.
A newly built-up bridge on Ochato Baghan drain was washed away by strong currents of rainwater and locals warned if the situation was not brought under control in time the things would get out of hands.
The marooned families said that they were starving and expressed fears the situation could become disastrous if oceanic high tide also joined stagnant rainwater gushing into nearby villages.
The villagers Qadir Khaskheli, Ali Muhammad, Mohammad Siddique and others told media persons that no elected representative and official of revenue and other departments had so far brought any help to the trapped population.
They appealed to Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah to provide them tents and food and make arrangements for shifting them to safer places till normality returned to the area.

10,ACE arrests PTI’s Haleem Sheikh in land-grab case,Opposition leader alleges he is being implicated in false cases at the behest of PPP leaders under a conspiracy.,"HYDERABAD: Leader of the Opposition in Sindh Assembly and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Haleem Adil Sheikh was arrested by Anticorruption Establishment (ACE) Jamshoro officials on Wednesday in connection with a land transaction of Malir.
Soon after his arrest, PTI lawyers gathered in Sindh High Court’s Hyderabad circuit bench for hearing of a habeas corpus petition after closure of courts. PTI lawyers led by retired Justice Noorul Haq Qureshi wanted hearing on the petition on Wednesday evening.
Sheikh had appeared before ACE Jamshoro and was arrested after he had recorded his statement. PTI activists blocked a section of National Highway after his arrest. 
ACE officer Zeeshan Hyder had summoned him to record his statement at ACE police station Kotri in a land transaction case of 63-acre government land in Thana Bula Khan.
According to PTI activist and lawyer, Bhagwandas, who had sought interim pre-arrest bail of his client on July 18 in Hyderabad, Sheikh was granted pre-arrest bail in crime No.2/22 by Special Judge Anticorruption (provincial) and it was fixed for confirmation on Thursday in Hyderabad. Sheikh had joined the investigation today but was arrested in another case, he said.
“Details of the new case are not available and we are sitting in SHC Hyderabad circuit to file a habeas corpus petition for the production of Sheikh before court of law,” he said. Bhagwandas said that SHC additional registrar Sabit Ali Shah had been contacted to open Hyderabad circuit bench of SHC like Punjab where SC registry was opened at night in Lahore. 
“We are with retired Justice Noorul Haq Qureshi and we want hearing of our petition today. Sabit Ali Shah told us that a message has been conveyed to Chief Justice of Sindh High Court and we are awaiting the response,” he said.
Today, Sheikh was arrested in a case of transfer of 70 acres of land in Quaidabad lodged by ACE circle officer, Abdul Wahab. Some government officials were also co-accused in the case. 
A police contingent from Hyderabad also rushed to arrest Sheikh, who was said to have been taken to Karachi.
Earlier, after recording his statement Sheikh told journalists that Sharifs wanted judicial decisions that suited them and they had always attacked institutions and judiciary. 
He alleged that he was being implicated in false cases at the instance of PPP leaders Asif Ali Zardari, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and CM Murad Ali Shah under a conspiracy.
He said that Lahore High Court had termed his arrest illegal, otherwise a conspiracy was hatched to kill him through police at the instance of Hamza Shahbaz. 
He said that false case was lodged at ACE Jamshoro. BAP and MQM wanted to form alliance with PTI but they have been told ‘na khappay na khappay’. He said coalition government might use all tactics but people would beat them, he said.
Sheikh shifted to Karachi

He said in a press statement issued here on Wednesday that Sindh was ripe for the taking as people had become fed up with Zardari but they saw no alternative. “PTI can provide people a viable alternative and people will undoubtedly respond,” he said. 
Mr Bhutto said the constitution and democracy had triumphed and despite their best efforts to control and pervert peoples’ will by performing somersaults, “the foreign stooges and enemies of democracy have fallen flat on their faces”. 
He said the coalition partners in centre were humiliated in by-election in Punjab on July 17 and once again they had to face what he called ‘ignominy’ in the Supreme Court.
He said that such was the ‘inevitable’ fate of those who sold their souls for the sake of power and sacrifice national interests for the attainment of narrow selfish objectives. They represented the dying old political order which the will of the people had rendered obsolete, he said. 
He was confident that they [the coalition government] had no place in the emerging new political order in Pakistan which had its roots in a genuine representation of the public will, protection of national interests against foreign as well as indigenous threats and jettisoning of stagnant and outdated ideas and dogmas along with their incompetent and corrupt proponents.
But the old political order would not die silently, he said. Its pangs of death could still be detrimental to nation and must be guarded against, he said. 
He said the most encouraging and positive development in all this was that people of Pakistan were now more aware than ever before. They had mobilised to exert their will in an unprecedented manner and were ready to face all challenges, said Bhutto. 
Bhutto said that people would no longer remain idle spectators to hijacking of the country by self-seeking charlatans. People were the source of political legitimacy and they were the owners of the country. Imran Khan was the first leader after Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to give them this awareness, he said, adding if this trend continued the future was bright for Pakistan.

Affected growers Ali Hasan, Ranjhan Malik and others told reporters that armed men belonging to Choliyani community deliberately broke the dyke and destroyed their rice fields on several acres because they had refused to pay the protection money to them. The armed men had threatened them of dire consequences, they said.
“They destroyed our crops worth millions of rupees and inundated our land. It will take much time to drain out water from their land and re-cultivate it,” they said.
They demanded the Sindh government take action against the extortionists and compensate the affected growers for their loss.

15,Murad approves Rs14bn plan to rehabilitate Hub Canal,KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Wednesday approved construction of a bridge on Korangi ...,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Wednesday approved construction of a bridge on Korangi Crossing  and the Hub Canal rehabilitation project, directing the local government department to complete them within a year.
CM shah gave the go-ahead while presiding over a meeting held to review different development projects at the CM House.
The meeting was attended by Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Shah,  Karachi Metropolitan Corporation Administrator Murtaza Wahab, Chief  Secretary Sohail Rajput, Planning and Development Chairman Hassan Naqvi,  Finance Secretary Sajid Jamal Abro and others.
The LG minister said that the Hub Canal project included construction  of Hub Canal (canal plus pipe hybrid), water conveyance from Hub Dam  and Rehabilitation of Hub filtration plant, enhancing its capacity from  80 MGD to 100 MGD operation, and maintenance of the canal and pipe would  cost Rs14bn. 
The CM was told that the project  would be started on a public-private partnership mode, and would be  completed within two years. 
He said that the  launching of the project on the said mode would take time, therefore,  the government would finance the project with the condition to complete  it within a year.
The LG department assured him that the project would be completed within a year. 
“This city needs water, and we cannot delay water projects,” he said. 
The  chief minister was told that 65 MGD Bulk Water Supply project would  start from Keenjhar-Gujjo Canal to High point, including construction of  Gharo water pumping stations and the project would cost around Rs9bn.
He directed the department to start the tendering process so that work could be started in time. 
Korangi Causeway
“The existing causeway submerges during monsoon seasons, therefore, people of Korangi and Malir face serious problems,” the CM said and added that with the construction of a bridge, 28 per cent population of the two areas would be facilitated. 
The chief minister said that Korangi Causeway needed a bridge. He was told that there were two options for its construction – a four-lane bridge or a six-lane bridge.
Mr Murad said that it must be six-lane so that it could cater to the requirement of the areas for the next 20 years. 
The LG department said that the project would cost around Rs5 billion, and would be completed within two years. However, CM directed them to complete it within a year, and ‘start its work on top priority basis’. 
The LG secretary said that the life of the bridge would be 80 years, and it would be a 1.6 km bridge.
The CM directed P&D department to prepare a scheme to overhaul the Jam Sadiq Bridge. “It should also be started within the next three months,” he said. The World Bank’s proposed alternate bridge would also be constructed for BRT services. 
Seawater RO plant
The LG minister said that a 5 MGD seawater desalination plant project of Karachi Water and Sewerage Board had already been approved and plant would be installed at Ibrahim Hyderi, Korangi. 
The chief minister directed the LG department to work out the cost of the project and cost of the water per gallon so that it could be assessed. 
He added that if the cost of per gallon production was feasible, more projects could be launched. The chief minister directed the LG department to focus on the water distribution system of Karachi Water and Sewerage Board.
