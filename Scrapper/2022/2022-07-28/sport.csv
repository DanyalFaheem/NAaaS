0,Pakistan battling to save second Test after De Silva ton,The onus will be on Pakistan skipper Babar Azam to help his team bat out the final sessions.,"GALLE: Sri Lankan century-maker Dhananjaya de Silva warned on Wednesday that they needed early Pakistan wickets on the final day of the second Test with bad weather looming. 
Sri Lanka set Pakistan a record target of 508 and then restricted them to 89-1 to keep alive their hopes of a series-levelling victory. The hosts declared their second innings on 360-8 but were robbed of precious time as only six overs could be played in the final session before bad light stopped play. 
Opener Imam-ul-Haq was batting on 46 at stumps with Pakistan 419 runs behind the improbable target. 
The onus would be on Pakistan skipper Babar Azam, batting on 26, to help his team bat out the final three sessions for a draw that would also secure a 1-0 series victory for the tourists. 
De Silva, who hit 109, said the hosts were wary that bad light could mean another shortened final session on Thursday. 
“We need to get wickets early tomorrow,” he said. “The key is to bowl at one point consistently. There are a few rough areas on the pitch and we need to show discipline while bowling.” 
The tourists will need to make an unprecedented chase if they are to make it 2-0. The West Indies own the record for the highest successful fourth innings chase in tests having overwhelmed a target of 418 against Australia in 2003 at Antigua. 
Sri Lanka, who declared their second innings in the second session after resuming on 176-5, need nine wickets on the final day to end the series level. 
First-match hero Abdullah Shafique and Imam began well, seeing through the first hour of what looked like a long grind for Pakistan before Prabath Jayasuriya snapped the 42-run opening stand. 
Abdullah (16), who scored an unbeaten 160 in the first Test when Pakistan successfully chased down 342 runs to set a record at Galle, charged out against the spinner but could not connect well sending the ball to mid-off where Dunith Wellalage ran sideways while eyes on the ball to take a tumbling catch before tea. Imam and Azam took their chances against the spinners to get quick runs in the weather-hit final session of play, with 47 runs and six boundaries between them. 
After the 28th over of the innings, the Pakistan batters successfully complained to the umpires that they could not see the ball.  
“There’s only two results possible in the game and our chances of winning took a severe beating because of bad light,” De Silva said. 
Earlier, De Silva made a dominant century before being run out at the non-striker’s end and Sri Lanka skipper Dimuth Karunaratne called his batsmen back to the pavilion. 
De Silva put on a key stand of 126 with overnight partner Karunaratne, a left-handed batsman who battled spasms of back pain during his knock of 61. 
“Dimuth had a bit of a pain. He didn’t show it. He absorbed it and played,” said De Silva of his captain. “What we wanted to do was to deny them wickets when they were bowling well. We knew if we batted for three sessions we will get to where we want to.” 
Karunaratne , who was pushed down to the middle order, went past 6,000 Test runs but fell in the first session after he escaped two close calls off Nauman Ali’s left-arm spin, unsuccessfully reviewed by Pakistan. 
Nauman finally got Karunaratne caught at short leg, with Abdullah taking a sharp reflex catch.  
De Silva went on to post his ninth Test hundred, after only one half century in 12 innings this year. One of de Silva’s 16 boundaries, an elegant cut against Mohammad Nawaz, brought up his hundred. 
De Silva added 82 runs for the eighth wicket with Ramesh Mendis as Pakistan had to further toil on the field. Mendis was rarely troubled during his 55-ball 45 not out, including five fours, giving an indication of the docile nature of the pitch. 
Sri Lanka had been waiting for Mendis to complete his first half-century in Test cricket but de Silva was run out for 109 when Yasir Shah from mid-on came up with a direct hit. Sri Lanka declared the innings at that point. 
Karunaratne did not take to the field in the final innings with De Silva again standing in as skipper.

1,"Pressure-free Pakistan can chase mammoth 508, says Yousuf",Says the team had benchmarked itself against its 506-run chase against Australia at home in March.,"GALLE: Pakistan batting coach Mohammad Yousuf said Wednesday he was confident his team could still play for victory against Sri Lanka in the second Test, despite needing an unprecedented 508-run chase to win.
The tourists ended day four on 89-1 with Imam-ul-Haq on 46 and skipper Babar Azam on 26 when bad light stopped play for the second successive day.
They will need another 419 runs to win, or to bat out the last three sessions to draw the match and win the series 1-0.
“Babar and Imam are playing to their strength and I feel if they play in the same manner we will try to go for the target,” said Yousuf.
He said the team had benchmarked itself against its 506-run chase against Australia at home in March, in a match ending with a draw on 443-7.
“I think the same target is needed in the same amount of time. Babar played an excellent innings of 196. Abdullah Shafique got 96 and it was a very good game,” Yousuf told reporters.
“The way Babar and Imam are playing it will be an interesting day tomorrow.”
The West Indies hold the record for the highest successful Test chase with 418 against Australia in 2003 at Antigua.
But Yousuf said the team were relaxed and relishing the challenge to perform at their highest level.
“Boys are not under pressure, they are enjoying the game and taking on the challenge,” he said.
Pakistan lost their three-Test home series to Australia 1-0 but whitewashed South Africa, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh last year.

Sri Lanka will host the Women’s T20 Champions Trophy in 2027, subject to them qualifying for the event, the sport’s governing body added.
“We are delighted to have awarded ICC women’s white ball events to Bangladesh, India, England and Sri Lanka,” ICC chair Greg Barclay said in a statement.
“Accelerating the growth of the women’s game is one of the ICC’s strategic priorities and taking these events to some of our sport’s biggest markets give us a fantastic opportunity to do that and deepen its connection with cricket’s one billion plus fans.”  The hosts were selected following a bidding process that was overseen by a sub-committee.
The ICC Board accepted the recommendations of the committee who conducted a thorough review of each bid.
Australia won this year’s 50-over World Cup, beating hosts New Zealand by 71 runs in the final in April.
South Africa will host the T20 World Cup in 2023.

3,ICC plays down threat to ODI format,NEW DELHI: The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) played down threats to the game’s 50-overs format on...,"NEW DELHI: The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) played down threats to the game’s 50-overs format on Wednesday and said a  “healthy” number of One-day Internationals will be played in the 2023-27 cycle.
The proliferation of lucrative domestic T20 leagues have cramped up cricket’s already-strained calendar and England all-rounder Ben Stokes attributed his shock ODI retirement to an  “unsustainable” schedule.
Earlier this month, South Africa abandoned their ODI tour of Australia as it clashed with the launch of their domestic T20 league rising their chances of qualifying directly for next year’s World Cup in India.
ICC chief executive Geoff Allardice said structuring of the game’s three formats was discussed at the governing body’s annual general meeting in Birmingham where the Future Tours Programme (FTP) 2023-27 was finalised.
“I think at this stage there is some discussion, not specifically about ODIs, but about the mix of formats within the calendar,” Allardice told a video conference.
“Countries have been, in their FTPs, are still scheduling a healthy number of ODIs as well.
“So in the FTP, I don’t think you’ll see any significant change to the number of ODIs or the proportion of ODIs as being planned.”
Australia Test batsman Usman Khawaja has said ODI cricket was  “dying a slow death”, while former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram called the format a  “drag”.
Allardice conceded some members put  “particular attention on their domestic leagues” but insisted their commitment to international and bilateral cricket was  “as strong as it’s ever been”.
“Each of them has to manage that balance between domestic competitions, their international schedule and the management of their players.
“Each of those boards is in slightly different situation. So there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to that balancing issue.”
ICC chairman Greg Barclay acknowledged franchise-based leagues were expanding fast.
“So there’s a lot of pressure on the calendar, but I’m not sure it’s a tipping point,” said the New Zealander.

4,IPL’s global dominance in T20 cricket dangerous: Gilchrist,MELBOURNE: Former Australia captain Adam Gilchrist on Wednesday voiced concerns over the Indian Premier League’s...,"MELBOURNE: Former Australia captain Adam Gilchrist on Wednesday voiced concerns over the Indian Premier League’s (IPL) expanding global footprint, saying the cash-rich league’s efforts to monopolise T20 franchise cricket are becoming  “a little bit dangerous.”
Gilchrist’s comments came in the wake of reports in Australian media saying batter David Warner will skip Australia’s Big Bash League (BBL) this season to participate in a new league in the United Arab Emirates, backed by IPL money.
Warner plays for IPL side Delhi Capitals, owned by India’s GMR Group, which owns a team in the Emirati league. The new tournament’s schedule is set to clash with the BBL’s, which runs from December to early-February 2023.
IPL team owners have also bought all six franchises of South Africa’s new domestic T20 league, while three IPL franchise owners — of Kolkata, Rajasthan and Punjab — own teams in the Caribbean Premier League.
“I think it would almost be commercial suicide for [Cricket Australia] to allow a player like him [Warner] to go head-to-head up against their own competition,” Gilchrist told Australia’s SEN Radio.
“They can’t force David Warner to play in the BBL... But to let him then go off — or another player, let’s not single out Warner because there will be other players on the radar — it’s all part of this global dominance that these IPL franchises are starting to create.
”... It’s getting a little bit dangerous the grip that it’s having to monopolise that ownership and the ownership of the players and their talents and where they can and can’t play.”
Gilchrist said that veteran Warner’s commitment to Australian cricket could not be questioned, but added that younger players could follow in his footsteps.
“If he rides off into the sunset and says, ‘Sorry Australian cricket, I’m going to become a gun for hire for my Indian franchise team in various tournaments’, you can’t question him on that,” Gilchrist said.
“That’s his prerogative and he’s done everything he needs to get the profile and get that market value. It’s the new younger player coming in that starts to make those noises where it’ll be really challenging.”
The IPL did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

The 23-year-old made 101 off just 56 balls with 36 of those runs coming from sixes. Batting first, Allen and Martin Guptill (40) put on 85 for the opening wicket to launch a strong platform for the middle order to get New Zealand past 200.
Guptill (3399) became the highest run scorer in Twenty20 history when he passed Rohit Sharma’s 3379 in eight fewer innings.
Glenn Phillip (23), Daryl Mitchell (23) and Jimmy Neesham (30) all contributed as the Black Caps finished on 225-5.
Scotland also had a decent start with George Munsey (28) and Calum MacLeod (33) putting on 62 before the spin of Ish Sodhi and Mitchell Santner turned the match New Zealand’s way.
Sodhi finished with 4-28, including three of the opening four wickets, along with Santner’s 2-23 as Scotland finished on 157-8.

6,"UEFA to trial safe standing in England, Germany and France","NYON: UEFA is launching a safe standing observer programme in its competitions for matches in England, Germany and...","NYON: UEFA is launching a safe standing observer programme in its competitions for matches in England, Germany and France this season with a view of reintroducing it on a permanent basis, Europe’s football governing body said on Wednesday.
While safe standing areas are becoming the norm at the domestic level, UEFA’s current regulations do not permit it in its competitions after a ban following the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster.
The programme has been approved by the Executive Committee but the body said it would be limited to just the top five ranked associations in the UEFA rankings where standing is already authorised and implemented at the domestic level.
Although Spain and Italy are in the top five, UEFA said it would be limited only to England, Germany and France as they were compliant with national and local legislation.
“The programme will be carried out during the group stage and knockout phases up to and including the semi-finals of the 2022-23 UEFA men’s club competitions. The finals are excluded,” UEFA said in a statement.
“At the end of the 2022-23 season, on the basis of the reports submitted by the mandated experts, the UEFA administration will assess the findings of the programme and submit the results to the UEFA Executive Committee.”  The Committee will then decide on any potential continuation or possible extension of the programme.
In England, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City and Chelsea received approval to have licensed safe standing in seated areas from Jan 1 this year, with more British clubs set to adopt safe standing areas next season.
Grounds in England’s top divisions were converted to all-seater stadiums nearly 30 years ago after Liverpool supporters were crushed in overcrowded and fenced-in areas at the Hillsborough Stadium in 1989, which led to 97 deaths.
Thirty-nine people, mainly Italians, died at Heysel Stadium in Brussels when a wall collapsed after Liverpool fans charged Juventus supporters before the 1985 European Cup final, which Juve won 1-0.

The 18-year-old was in top gear in the second and final round of stroke play as he made seven birdies to card a two-under par 70 at the windy Bandon Dune course. That saw Omar make the cut with a two-day aggregate of 143.
Omar’s compatriot Yashal Shah who carded 75 on the opening day at Bandon Trails finished with a score of 77 in the second round at Bandon Dunes to fall out of the race for qualification to the match-play stage.
Omar, who needed to finish among the top 64 players in a field of 264 top-ranked juniors from 25 nations to make it to match play, ended at 48th spot after posting an even-par total in 36-holes.
Omar, who became the youngest winner of the Pakistan Amateur Golf Championship at the age of 16 last year, hit seven birdies in the second round and now faces Caden Pinckes in the round-of-64.

Ajax had reached an agreement with United earlier this month with the 24-year-old moving for an initial fee of 57.37 million euros ($58.21 million) and a further 10 million euros of potential add-ons included.
United said they also have the option to extend his contract for a further year. Primarily a centre back, Martinez can also slot into midfield and he is reunited with manager Erik ten Hag, who coached him for three seasons at Ajax.
“It’s an honour to join this great football club. I’ve worked so hard to get to this moment and now that I’m here, I’m going to push myself even further,” said Martinez, who was Ajax’s player of the year last season. “I’ve been lucky enough to be part of successful teams in my career and that’s what I want to continue at Manchester United.” 
Martinez is the third signing of the Ten Hag era following the capture of  left-back Tyrell Malacia from Feyenoord and the free transfer of former  Brentford midfielder Christian Eriksen. 
United, who finished a  disappointing sixth in the Premier League last season, host Brighton on  August 7 in their first match of the new campaign.

9,Cuba says three defected during worlds at Eugene,"HAVANA: Three members of Cuba’s athletics delegation at the World Championships in the US, including former discus...","HAVANA: Three members of Cuba’s athletics delegation at the World Championships in the US, including former discus world champion Yaime Perez absconded, the country’s sports institute said on Wednesday.
Defections by Cuban sports people while on international duty are commonplace as the communist nation has long prevented its athletes from turning professional.
Perez, 31, was the defending champion in Eugene, where she finished seventh, and a bronze medalist at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.
Javelin thrower Yiselena Ballar, 19, and physiotherapist Carlos Gonzalez also disappeared.
The Jit online newspaper for Cuba’s INDER sports institute described the defections as  “serious indiscipline”.
Both Perez and Ballar are believed to have escaped during a stopover in Miami while on the return journey to Cuba.
Cuba suffered its worst ever result at an athletics world championships, failing to win a single medal.
More than two dozen Cuban sports people have defected this year alone, including Olympic long jump silver medallist Juan Miguel Echevarria, Olympic Greco-Roman wrestling champion Ismael Borrero and Olympic sprint canoeing champion Fernando Dayan Jorge.
Last month, Olympic boxing champion Andy Cruz, considered by many experts to be the finest Cuban boxer of his generation, was caught trying to flee the island nation.
Cuba has slowly been opening up to professional sport in a bid to discourage the defections.
In April, communist authorities finally allowed boxers to take part in professional boxing competitions, leading to a team match against Mexico, which the Cubans won 6-0 with five knockouts, even without Cruz.
Other sports such as baseball have also embraced limited professionalism recently as in May Cuban authorities reached an agreement with the sport’s international governing body, the WBSC, to allow Cuban baseballers to manage their own professional contracts with clubs in foreign leagues.
Cuba is suffering its worst recession in three decades, partly provoked by the coronavirus pandemic and the ramping up of US sanctions under former president Donald Trump, which has led to mass migration.

10,New Japan police raids over Tokyo Olympics claims,TOKYO: Japanese police carried out new raids on Wednesday over allegations that a 2020 Tokyo Olympics board member...,"TOKYO: Japanese police carried out new raids on Wednesday over allegations that a 2020 Tokyo Olympics board member received money from a sponsor he signed a consulting contract with, local media reported.
Haruyuki Takahashi, 78, is suspected of receiving more than $300,000 from high street business suit retailer Aoki Holdings Inc., an  “official partner” of last year’s pandemic-delayed mega-event.
That could reportedly constitute bribery because Takahashi was considered a quasi-civil servant who was not permitted to accept money or gifts related to his position.
Takahashi’s Tokyo home was raided by investigators on Tuesday morning according to reports.
And local media said searches were conducted Wednesday at the home of former Aoki chairman Hironori Aoki, 83, and the disbanded Tokyo 2020 organising committee office at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.
The Tokyo Olympics organising committee wound down operations last month but it maintains a presence to deal with assets and liabilities.
The Tokyo prosecutors’ office told AFP it could not comment on individual cases.
Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told reporters the situation was  “extremely regrettable” and she would  “keep a close eye on developments.”  “I have told the organising committee that they should co-operate fully with this investigation,” she said.
A sports consulting firm run by Takahashi is suspected of receiving money from Aoki for a contract signed in 2017, according to local media.
Aoki in October 2018 became a Tokyo Games sponsor, allowing it to use the event’s logo and sell officially licensed products.
Takahashi told the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper last week that the money his company rece­ived was for consultancy work.
“There was no conflict of interest whatsoever with my position as an organising committee board member,” he was quoted as saying.
Aoki issued a statement last week saying it had no comment on reports of the payments.
Takahashi, a former executive at Japan’s biggest advertising agency, Dentsu, served on the Tokyo 2020 board from June 2014.
Former Tokyo 2020 president Seiko Hashimoto told reporters Tuesday that she would  “cooperate fully” with the investigation if instructed to do so.
“Matters such as this coming to light after the fact is very disappointing,” she said.
“We have to act in a way that will not tarnish what was achieved even with the pandemic.” The case is not the first time questions have been raised about alleged impropriety around the Games.
French prosecutors launched an investigation into allegations of corruption linked to Tokyo’s bid for the Games in 2016.
The former head of Japan’s Olympic Committee, Tsunekazu Takeda, stepped down in 2019 as French authorities probed his involvement in payments made before Tokyo was awarded the event.
The Tokyo Olympics opened on July 23 last year after an unprecedented one-year delay because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Games were held in largely empty stadiums after fans were banned over surging virus infections in Japan.

According to a press release issued by the association, POA president retired Lt Gen Syed Arif Hasan made the appointments.
“Inam has secured medals in the Commonwealth Games and made history by winning the first-ever medal and that too gold for Pakistan at the World Beach Games,” the press release added.

12,Acting secretary Haider joins PHF as Bajwa leaves quietly,"LAHORE: Former international Haider Hussain, the newly-appointed acting secretary of the Pakistan Hockey Federation,...","LAHORE: Former international Haider Hussain, the newly-appointed acting secretary of the Pakistan Hockey Federation, joined the PHF here on Wednesday after Asif Bajwa quietly left the office after developing differences with retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar, the president of the national game’s governing body.
First, the PHF president appointed Olympian Saeed Khan as acting secretary but later when it was realised that Saeed was not a member of Congress and therefore is not entitled to become the acting secretary, Haider was appointed.
The announcement on Haider’s appointment was made from Birmingham by the PHF president who is there to witness Pakistan hockey team’s matches in the Commonwealth Games starting today.
Bajwa did not respond to a number of calls made to him to get his comments.
It may be mentioned here that the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) on June 30 de-notified the PHF body headed by Brig Khokhar and appointed a four-member committee — which also included Brig Khokhar — to hold fresh PHF elections within 30 days.
Haider, 42, is not included in the committee which has been tasked with holding the elections.
So Brig Khokhar’s decision to appoint Haider and not to accept the four-member committee is likely to further increase the gulf between the PHF and the PSB.
Though the PHF is not bound to accept any such committee or to be de-notified by the PSB, which is the primary financial supporter of the federation, such poor relationship between the two institutions will in no way help to promote Pakistan hockey, which has already faced unprecedented decline over the past decade or so.
When highlighted that his name was not included in the PSB-appointed committee, Haider said the PHF president was in a better position to answer such questions.
However, he said the PHF was starting the process of holding fresh elections, which we due, from Thursday.
Haider on his first day as the acting secretary did not look in the right position to answer the questions, as the PHF affairs had been made complicated due to the cold war-like situation with the PSB and the quiet leaving of Bajwa as secretary of the federation.
It may be mentioned here that Bajwa was named as PHF secretary for the second time by  Brig Khokhar in May 2019 after former Pakistan captain Shahbaz Ahmed Senior left the post in controversial circumstances.
Interestingly, Brig Khokhar at the time, said that Shahbaz had resigned and he had accepted it. Whereas Shahbaz in his media talk had claimed he did not resign.
A couple of days ago, Bajwa, in a chat with some of his close friends, also claimed that he did not resign.

13,Commonwealth Games defy doomsayers to remain afloat,Some track and field stars will be absent when the competition gets under way.,"BIRMINGHAM: The Commonwealth Games are sometimes seen as a quirky relic in the modern sporting calender but former International Olympic Committee (IOC) marketing chief Michael Payne says they have consistently defied the doomsayers.
The 22nd edition of the Games opens in Birmingham on Thursday, bringing together around 5,000 athletes from 72 nations and territories — mostly former British colonies — to compete in 19 sports over 11 days.
Some track and field stars will be absent when the competition gets under way — just days after the end of the world championships in Eugene, Oregon.
But there will still be plenty of big names on show at the event, which features sports as diverse as lawn bowls and marathon running.
The Commonwealth Games are not on the scale of the Olympics that Birmingham once aspired to host — the city was beaten by Barcelona for the right to put on the 1992 Games — but officials hope they can provide a big economic boost for the area.
According to the Financial Times, the West Midlands Combined Authority estimates the event will be worth 1 billion pounds ($1.2 billion) to the regional economy.
Payne, credited with transforming the IOC brand and finances through sponsorship, said the Commonwealth Games had shown remarkable resilience over the decades.
“People have been talking of the demise of the Commonwealth Games for nearly half a century but they are still going, so I would not write them off just yet,” he told AFP.
Another former IOC marketing executive, Terrence Burns, who since leaving the organisation has played a role in five successful Olympic bid campaigns, said it was important for the event to find its own niche and evolve accordingly.
“These other Games are not the Olympic Games but tend to try to mirror them in look, feel, and impact,” he said.  “That’s just not possible or credible.
“So I think they need to redefine ‘success’ and build their product accordingly.”
The Commonwealth Games have, like other global events in recent years, had trouble in attracting host cities.
“Finding nations willing to host is a challenge for many sports bodies these days,” said Payne.  “That is why you have seen a far more flexible process introduced to identify potential hosts.
“But the Commonwealth Games do face a major hurdle, as their marketing and sponsorship revenue potential is limited and, as such, nations wanting to host must be willing to commit to $1 billion of taxpayer support.” Burns said the nature of the Games, held every four years, throws up obstacles for organisers.
“I think an event that aspires to be global but by definition limits its participation base to a finite set of nations and territories, has a global fan interest challenge as well as a hosting city challenge,” he said.  “That part is just maths.” Steps have been taken to remodel the event, with the Common­wealth Games Federation last year publishing a roadmap for the future.
One recommendation was for  “approximately” 15 sports to feature at the Games, with athletics and swimming compulsory but some flexibility to allow hosts to choose from a wider list of core sports.
Payne says that makes sense but he takes issue with a bolder idea of awarding co-hosting admittedly  “only in exceptional circumstances” to non-Commonwealth countries.
“Like staging the Asian Games in Europe, it is a non-starter.” He says the Commonwealth Games are a vital showcase for smaller nations and territories that struggle to attract compete at the bigger events.
“For many of the smaller nations this is their one moment on the world sports stage, with an opportunity to shine and win medals,” said the 64-year-old Irishman.
“That is important for these nations and governments to drive local sports interest. At the Olympics there is no chance for them to medal.” This is reflected by the lengths the impoverished Sri Lankan team have gone to get to Birmingham.
Commonwealth Games organisers and the Sri Lanka cricket board have covered their costs.
“We want to stand like other nations, in front of our flag, as a proud nation, keeping our backs straight, our heads strong and we want to do our best,” said Dampath Fernando, the team’s chef de mission.
