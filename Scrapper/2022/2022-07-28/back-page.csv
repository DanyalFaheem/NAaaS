0,Pakistan detects 14th polio case of the year,All victims are aged under two years; Health Ministry examines preparations to deal with monkeypox.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has reported its 14th wild poliovirus case this year, with the latest victim being an eight-month-old girl from Miramshah tehsil of North Waziristan district, a National Institute of Health (NIH) official said on Wednesday.
“This is the third wild poliovirus case from Mira­mshah and the 13th from North Waziristan this year,” the official told Dawn.
All 14 victims are aged under two years, whereas the only case outside North Waziristan was reported from Lakki Marwat last week.
The health ministry said in a statement polio campaigns had proven to be successful all over the world, with over 99pc of the world now polio-free. The only two remaining polio-endemic countries — Pakistan and Afghanistan — have reported 15 cases this year, with 14 cases detected from Pakistan between April and June and one case from Afghanistan in January.

Ministry examines preparations to deal with monkeypox

“The national emergency operations centres of Afghanistan and Pakistan are continuing cross-border coordination efforts,” it said. “The countries have synchronised two polio campaigns in May and June and are ensuring vaccination of children under 10 on all major transit points, along with vaccinating all ages at the international borders.”
After staying polio-free for almost 15 months, Paki­stan reported a polio case in April. The country detected only one case last year.
Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus and mainly affects children aged under five years. It enters the nervous system and causes paralysis and even death. While there is no cure, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this crippling disease.
Session on monkeypox
As the monkeypox outbreak has been declared a “public health emergency of international concern” by the WHO, a special session was held under the direction of federal Minis­ter of National Health Services Abdul Qadir Patel to review the country’s preparedness in this regard.
The federal special secretary, director general of the health ministry and representatives from the interior ministry, CAA, Central Health Establis­hm­ent and FIA also attended.
According to a statement, the participants were informed that the situation was currently “well controlled” and was being closely monitored at nati­onal, regional and global levels epidemiologically.
“All the national and provincial health authorities and other stakeholders, especially Central Health Establishment (monitoring points of entry), are advised to remain vigilant and on high alert for any suspected case,” the statement said and urged all public and private hospitals “to ensure readiness for isolation and treatment of monkeypox”.

1,Kyiv strikes key bridge to choke Russian advance,Donbas region sees intense fighting; Black Sea ports set to resume work under grain deal.,"

KYIV: Ukrainian artillery on Wednesday struck a key bridge falling in Moscow-controlled territory in south Ukraine, damaging an important supply route as Kyiv’s forces look to wrest back the Kherson region.
The strike on the Antonivskiy bridge over the Dnipro river came hours ahead of the opening in Istanbul of a joint observation centre to monitor Ukrainian grain exports that have been blocked by the Kremlin’s warships.
Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-installed regi­onal administration in Kherson, confirmed the bridge had been hit overnight and traffic had been halted.
But he downplayed the damage, insisting that the attack would not affect the outcome of the hostilities “in any way.” “The special military operation is continuing,” Stremou­sov said in a video posted on social media, using the Kremlin’s preferred term to refer to their invasion.

Donbas region sees intense fighting; Black Sea ports set to resume work under grain deal

Ukrainian forces in recent weeks have been clawing back territory in the Kherson region, which fell to Russian forces easily and early after their invasion launched on February 24.
Their counter-offensive supported by Western-supplied long-range artillery has seen its forces push closer to Kherson city, which had a pre-war population of under 300,000 people.
Ukrainian officials in the region have said their forces in the Black Sea region have changed tack, from defensive to offensive and that Kherson will “definitely” be liberated by the end of September.
Russian forces “should leave Kherson while it is still possible. There may not be a third warning,” Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhaylo Podolyak said on Twitter after the attack.
Donbas and beyond
While Ukrainian forces have been piling pressure on Russian pos­i­tions in the south, the eastern Don­bas region has seen intense fighting.
Journalists in Bakhmut, one of the remaining towns in Donbas under Ukrainian control, heard sporadic artillery fire and saw a house on the outskirts that had been hit by a Russian shell.
“I was in the barn and was going to go out. I heard a whistle. And I don’t remember anything. It exploded and I was thrown into the barn by explosion wave, 51-year-old Roman said.
The head of the Donetsk region in Donbas, said on social media that Russian artillery had hit a hotel and initial reports suggested the strikes had left people dead and injured.
Work resumes on grain ports
Also on Wednesday, Kyiv said that work had resumed at three Black Sea ports designated under a recent deal with Russia to resume cereal exports that have been blocked by Russia’s invasion.
“In connection with the signing of the agreement on the unblocking of Ukrainian ports for the export of grain, work has resumed in the ports of Odessa, Chernomorsk and Pivdennyi,” the Ukrainian navy said in a statement on social media.
Last week, Kyiv and Moscow agr­eed on a mechanism — with the help of Turkey and the United Nations — to allow blocked Ukrainian grain to be exported from the three ports.

2,Donald Trump hints at 2024 run for president,"At a thinktank, former US president highlights needs to ""straighten out our country"".","WASHINGTON: Former US president Donald Trump returned to the US capital this week and delivered a speech that’s being interpreted as his first for the 2024 election campaign.
“As Trump speaks in Washington, his allies prepare for a second term,” The Washington Post reported. “Trump supporters are already working on a government-in-waiting if he wins re-election in 2024.”
Mr Trump, who left Washington in January 2021, without attending his successor Joe Biden’s inauguration, stayed away from the US capital till this week. He returned on Tuesday to speak at a think-tank — the American First Policy Institute — that he founded.
CNN, which strongly opposed Mr Trump during his first term, noted that the speech showed “his 2024 campaign would take the country down a dark and dangerous road”.
“I always say I ran the first time and I won, then I ran a second time and I did much better,” AFP quoted Trump as saying. “We may just have to do it again. We have to straighten out our country.”
The Guardian noted that Mr Trump “stopped short of outright declaring his candidacy,” but he did say that it would be his “very great honour” to run again, and that if he didn’t “our nation is doomed”.
The Post reported that in his “dystopian speech,” Mr Trump encouraged “tough, nasty and mean” responses to violent crime and the forcible relocation of homeless people to quickly-built tent cities in the suburbs.
Another Washington news source, Politico, hinted at the possibility of “a Biden-Trump rematch” in 2024 but noted that “neither side wants to move first”. Mr Trump said if he ran, he would not do so for personal gratification. “I’m not doing this for me because I had a very luxurious life. I had a very simple life. I do it because I love our country,” he said.

3,"Sri Lanka extends emergency laws, protest leaders arrested",Rajapaksa allowed to stay in Singapore for two more weeks; more protesters nabbed amid crackdown.,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s parliament approved the extension of a state of emergency for a month in a bid to get a grip on a political and economic crisis that has forced a change of leadership, a lawmaker said, as Singapore permits Gotabaya Rajapaksa to stay in the island republic for an additional 14 days, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
Then acting-president Ranil Wickremesinghe had declared a state of emergency on July 17 and won a parliamentary vote to become president three days later, over a week after Rajapaksa fled the country and resigned from his post of president in the face of widespread protests.
The emergency ordinance, which allows for the military to be given powers to detain people for long periods, limit public gatherings and search private property would have lapsed on Wednesday if it had not been ratified by parliament. The extension meant it would continue for a month before it must be approved again, the lawmaker said.
Also on Wednesday, ex-president Rajapaksa was granted permission to stay a further 14 days in Singapore, where he had landed two weeks ago via the Maldives, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The extension would last until August 11, they said.

Rajapaksa allowed to stay in Singapore for two more weeks; more protesters nabbed amid crackdown

Singapore’s immigration authority did not respond to a request for confirmation of the move. The Singaporean government said he had not been granted asylum but was in the country on a private visit.
“It is my belief he may eventually consider returning to Sri Lanka but there is no definite political or other stance on this,” Sri Lankan government spokesperson Bandula Gunwardena said on Tuesday. If Rajapaksa returned to Sri Lanka, he might not be protected under law if any charges were filed against him, legal experts said.
Wickremesinghe, who served six terms as prime minister, has outlined plans to have a donor conference involving India, China and Japan after Sri Lanka secures a rescue line from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He said on July 18 that negotiations with the IMF were nearing a conclusion. China is Sri Lanka’s third-biggest lender, behind international financial markets and the Asian Development Bank. Japan is also a major lender.
Over the last decade and a half, China has lent Sri Lanka more than $5 billion for projects including highways, a port, an airport and a coal power plant. Sri Lanka is in talks with China for up to $4 billion in assistance to help navigate the financial crisis.
Ex-president Rajapaksa had been blamed for mismanaging the nation’s finances and steering the economy into a tailspin after the country ran out of foreign currency needed to import vital goods. Public anger simmered for months in Sri Lanka before the huge demonstration on July 9 that brought an end to Rajapaksa’s rule. Rajapaksa was forced to flee when tens of thousands of protesters stormed his residence in the capital Colombo. He later flew to Singapore and tendered his resignation while his successor Wickremesinghe declared a state of emergency and vowed a tough line against “trouble-makers”.
As parliament extended tough emergency laws imposed to restore order, police arrested two activists who helped lead mass demonstrations that toppled Sri Lanka’s president. Police said they had arrested activists Kusal Sandaruwan and Weranga Pushpika on unlawful assembly charges. After Rajapaksa fled, Sandaruwan was seen in social media footage counting a large cache of banknotes found in the president’s home. Police have also released photographs of 14 suspects wanted in connection with an arson attack on Wickremesinghe’s home on the same day the president’s office and residence were overrun. The arrests of the two activists come a day after student leader Dhaniz Ali was nabbed when he boarded a Dubai-bound flight.
Police last week demolished the capital’s main anti-government protest camp in a pre-dawn assault that raised alarm among foreign diplomats and rights groups.

4,"Five killed, buildings toppled as quake jolts Philippines",Wednesday’s quake was one of the strongest recorded in the Philippines in years and was felt across swathes of Luzon island.,"

MANILA: A 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed at least five people in the northern Philippines on Wedn­esday, toppling buildings and shaking high-rise towers more than 300 kilometres away in the capital Manila.
The shallow and powerful quake struck the mountainous and lightly populated province of Abra on the main island of Luzon at 8:43am (0043 GMT), the US Geological Survey said.
Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage than deeper ones. This one left more than a hundred people injured across the hilly region, triggered dozens of landslides, damaged buildings, and knocked out power supply.
“We felt really strong shaking. We started shouting and rushed outside,” said university student Mira Zapata in the San Juan municipality of Abra, which took the full force of the quake.
“Our house is OK but houses down the hill were damaged.” As buildings shook and walls cracked in the municipality of Dolores, people ran outside, Police Major Edwin Sergio told AFP.
“The quake was very strong,” Sergio said, adding that windows of the local market were broken.
In Bangued, the provincial capital of Abra, a 23-year-old woman was killed after a wall fell on her, police said. At least 78 were injured in the province.
A video posted on Facebook and verified by AFP showed cracks in the asphalt road and ground in Bangued.
“Some of the buildings here show cracks,” police chief Major Nazareno Emia added. “Power was cut off and internet as well.” Two construction workers in the nearby landlocked province of Benguet died in separate incidents, police said.
Another person was killed when boulders smashed into the building site where he was working in Kalinga province, police said. Six other workers were injured.
Police said an elderly woman in Suyo municipality in Ilocos Sur province suffered fatal injuries after she was buried by a landslide while out walking.
In Vigan City, a Unesco World Heritage site in Ilocos Sur, centuries-old structures built during the Spanish colonial period were damaged, police said.
Ring of Fire
The Philippines is regularly rocked by quakes due to its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.
Wednesday’s quake was one of the strongest recorded in the Philippines in years and was felt across swathes of Luzon island, the most populous in the archipelago.
It was followed by nearly 300 aftershocks, the local seismological agency said. Several of the subsequent quakes measured from magnitude 4.7 to 5.2, according to USGS.
Residents and office workers in Manila were evacuated from high-rise buildings. Military personnel have been deployed to Abra to help with rescue operations.

5,Iran probes Pakistani planes’ near-miss,"PIA spokesman says a cockpit collision avoidance system heled the two pilots to correct course, avoid collision.","TEHRAN: Iran is investigating a claim of a near-miss in its airspace between two Pakistani passenger jets due to “human error” by air traffic controllers, state media said on Wednesday.
The report comes days after Pakistan International Airlines said two of its planes flying at high altitude over Iran came within 1,000 feet of each other on Sunday.
The Pakistani flag carrier said Iranian air traffic controllers had cleared Peshawar-bound PIA flight PK-268 to descend to 20,000 feet from 36,000, leading to the close call with PIA flight PK-211 which was at 35,000 feet and en route to Dubai.
The Civil Aviation Organisation of Islamic Republic of Iran said an investigation had been launched into the near-miss.
“Appropriate measures have been taken to obtain documents of the country’s control centre, and we requested reports from the pilots of the planes for further investigation,” said CAO deputy head Hassan Khoshkhoo.
“Normally, after receiving all the documents, the issue is reviewed... and the final result is announced,” he told state broadcaster IRIB.
PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez Khan told AFP a cockpit “collision avoidance system helped the two pilots to correct the course and avoid a collision after the planes came close to each other”.
“We will write to the Iranian authorities to investigate the incident as the ATC (air traffic control) should not have cleared the Peshawar-bound flight to descend,” he added.
Khoshkhoo said the planes had been equipped with the system that “gives the necessary warnings from a long distance,” adding that “such incidents have also happened in other countries”.

6,Mirrored skyscraper ‘lines’ Middle East crossroads,"Project’s ‘first phase’ will be completed by 2030 at a cost of 1.2tr riyals, says Saudi crown prince.","

A PICTURE provided by Saudi Arabia shows the design plan for the 500-metre tall parallel structures, known collectively as ‘The Line’, in the heart of the Red Sea megacity, NEOM.—AFP

 
JEDDAH: A futuristic Saudi megacity is to feature two skyscrapers extending across a swathe of desert and mountain terrain, according to the latest disclosures on the project by the kingdom’s de facto ruler.
The parallel structures of mirror-encased skyscrapers extending over 170 kilometres, known collectively as The Line, form the heart of the Red Sea megacity NEOM, a plank of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s bid to diversify the Gulf state’s oil-dependent economy.
First announced in 2017, NEOM has consistently raised eyebrows for proposed flourishes like flying taxis and robot maids, even as archi­tects and economists have questioned its feasibility.
In a presentation, Prince Mohammed sketched out an even more ambitious vision, describing a car-free utopia that would become the planet’s most liveable city “by far”.

Project’s ‘first phase’ will be completed by 2030 at a cost of 1.2tr riyals, says Saudi crown prince

Analysts noted, though, that plans for NEOM have changed course over the years, fuelling doubts about whether The Line will ever become reality. NEOM was once touted as a regional “Silicon Valley”, a biotech and digital hub spread over 26,500sq-km (10,000 square miles).
Now it’s a vehicle for reimagining urban life on a footprint of just 34sq-km, and addressing what Prince Mohammed describes as “liveability and environmental crises”.
“The concept has morphed so much from its early conception that it’s sometimes hard to determine its direction: scaling down, scaling up, or making an aggressive turn sideways,” said Robert Mogielnicki of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.
Population boom
Officials had earlier said NEOM’s population would top one million, but Prince Mohammed said the number would actually hit 1.2 million by 2030 before climbing to nine million by 2045.
The eye-popping total is part of a hoped-for nationwide population boom that Crown Prince Mohammed said would be necessary to make Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest crude expo­rter, an economic powerhouse.
The goal for 2030 is to have 50 million people — half Saudis and half foreigners — living in the kingdom, up from roughly 34 million today.
“That’s the main purpose of building NEOM, to raise the capacity of Saudi Arabia, get more citizens and more people in Saudi Arabia. And since we are doing it from nothing, why should we copy normal cities?” The site will be powered by 100 per cent renewable energy and feature “a year-round temperate micro-climate with natural ventilation”, a video released on Monday mentioned.
Finding funds
At just 200 metres wide, The Line is intended to be Saudi Arabia’s answer to unchecked and wasteful urban sprawl, layering homes, schools and parks on top of each other in what planners term “Zero Gravity Urbanism”.
Residents will have “all daily needs” reachable within a five-minute walk, while also having access to other perks like outdoor skiing facilities and “a high-speed rail with an end-to-end transit of 20 minutes”, according to a statement.
Though NEOM will operate under its own founding law, which is still being prepared, Saudi officials say they have no plans to waive the kingdom’s alcohol ban.
An airport is already operational at NEOM, and authorities announced in May it would begin receiving regular flights from Dubai, but it is unclear whether major construction of the megacity itself has commenced.
First phase to cost $319bn
NEOM said on Tuesday it would create 380,000 jobs by the end of the decade “whilst providing the ultimate work-life balance”. The “first phase” of the project, lasting until 2030, will cost 1.2 trillion Saudi riyals (roughly $319 billion), Prince Mohammed said.
Besides government subsidies, potential sources of funding include the private sector and an initial public offering for NEOM expected in 2024, he added.
Securing the necessary financing remains a potential challenge, though the current climate is more favourable than during the coronavirus pandemic that lowered oil prices.
“But funding is only part of the equation... demand is harder to buy, especially when you’re asking people to be part of an experiment on living and working in the future,” Mogielnicki said.
