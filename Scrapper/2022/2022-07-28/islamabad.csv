The Supreme Court had directed Governor Balighur Rehman to administer the oath of office to Mr Elahi in accordance with the law and Constitution not later than 11.30pm on Tuesday and in case the governor was unable or unwilling to do so, President Alvi could carry out the job.
The new chief minister later left for Lahore by road at about 4.30pm on Wednesday after spending a busy day in the federal capital territory.

5,"NA secretary, PAC served notices in case pertaining to reopening of inquiries against PTI leaders",Petition claims PAC went beyond its jurisdiction by investigating allegations of sexual harassment against former NAB chairman.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday issued notices to the National Assembly (NA) secretary and Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on a petition filed against the PAC’s directive to reopen closed inquiries against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leadership.
Acting IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq took up the petition filed by acting National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman Zahir Shah along with another plea submitted by the bureau’s Lahore director general, retired Maj Saleem Shahzad.
In the petition, the acting NAB chairman contended that the PAC had gone beyond its jurisdiction by investigating the allegations of sexual harassment against former NAB chairman Javed Iqbal and issuing directives to reopen closed inquiries.
The petition pointed out that the PAC could only take up audit reports of ministries and departments of the federal government, adding that matters in question were already sub judice before the appropriate courts, hence the committee could not intervene into the judicial domain.
Moreover, the petition pointed out that the incumbent PAC chairman, Noor Alam Khan, was facing NAB inquiry, and being an accused, lacked moral authority to preside over meetings related to the bureau.
The court directed the petitioner’s counsel to argue on the maintainability of the petition on the next date of hearing.
Justice Farooq remarked that the PAC summoned an official in matters related to finance. The deputy attorney general, Arshad Mehmood Kiani, told the court that the PAC had powers to entertain public interest petitions.
The counsel for NAB director general argued that the Supreme Court in the Punjab chief minister case had set a precedent of judicial interference in the parliament’s domain.
It may be mentioned here that NAB Lahore Director General Saleem Shahzad was facing the inquiry before the PAC on the complaint of Tayyaba Gul over her manhandling and harassment.
Ms Gul came into the limelight in 2019 when a private television channel aired a secretly recorded video of former NAB chairman, retired Justice Javed Iqbal.
She accused Mr Shahzad of conducting strip search and fabricating false cases against her. Appearing before the PAC, Mr Shahzad denied her allegations and accused Ms Gul of being involved in immoral activities. Ms Gul also filed an application before the IHC to implead her as party in Shahzad’s petition.

9,Govt’s choices to determine success in achieving SDGs: NA speaker,Legislators reiterate commitment towards UN’s plan.,"ISLAMABAD: Choices that the government makes today will determine its success towards building a transition to a sustainable, greener more inclusive and resilient tomorrow, National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said on Wednesday.
Members of the national and legislative assemblies gathered in Islamabad to re-affirm their commitment to the 2030 United Nations Plan for Sustainable Development Goals and develop a national framework for their monitoring and implementation. The framework was devised at the national meet on SDGs, organised by the Parliamentary SDGs Secretariat, National Assembly in collaboration with Mustehkam Parlimaan, a project of the European Union (EU).
Mr Ashraf along with Minister for Planning and Development Dr Ahsan Iqbal, EU Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Riina Kionka, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) Romina Khurshid Alam attended the opening session of the event.
The NA speaker said implementation and localisation of the UN’s agenda 2030 would transform Pakistan into a prosperous and developed country.

Legislators reiterate commitment towards UN’s plan

Covid-19 has been a major setback for the global economy and prosperity and Pakistan was not an exception, he said, adding that Pakistan was facing acute challenges like climate change, healthcare, economic growth, poverty, gender inequality and socio-economic challenges.
He said it was imperative to work and call for an honest reflection of agenda 2030.
National governance for the SDGs could only be effective when it was in accord with global governance for sustainability, Mr Ashraf said, adding that Pakistan was a developing country where millions of people were without a number of basic amenities.
The participants were informed that no one, especially children, could be deprived of essential nutrients, which directly hindered their growth.
They learnt that deteriorating health conditions in Pakistan with little to no access to healthcare services was yet another issue and it was the responsibility of legislators to provide equal and quality health services to all.
Furthermore, the impacts of natural disasters have made under-nutrition and malnutrition a huge concern in the country which is why building a world with zero hunger could positively impact economies, participants were told.
Dr Iqbal said the SDGs could only be implemented by localising their solutions in Pakistan’s unique context.
EU Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Riina Kionka praised efforts of the National Assembly Secretariat for organising the conference, adding that the EU was pleased to join forces with Pakistan to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
She also highlighted the role of the National Task Force as an important stakeholder in the process in terms of prioritisation and accountability.
Special Assistant Alam said the aim of the national conference was to bring together stakeholders from all over Pakistan to share ideas, expertise and solutions for taking ambitious action and building partnerships to achieve the SDGs.

This was decided at a high-level meeting, presided over by AJK Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) retired Justice Abdul Rashid Sulehria, here on Wednesday. 
The meeting was attended among others by EC members Raja Farooq Niaz and Farhat Ali Mir, chief secretary Mohammad Usman Chachar, IGP Amir Ahmed Shaikh, special home secretary Abdul Hameed Mughal and DIG HQ Irfan Masood Kashfi.
On July 20, the AJK Supreme Court had extended the deadline it had earlier given to the government for holding LB polls from August 30 to October 15 after Advocate General Khawaja Maqbool War had sought the respite until November this year while citing financial constraints and some other administrative issues.
The apex court had disagreed with the EC plan to conduct polls in three phases and had instead directed it to carry out the process across the state on the same day.
For the very reasons, the AJK police force alone could not cope with the law and order situation and deployment of additional forces from Pakistan was inevitable, decided the meeting after the CEC recalled that as many as 19,000 additional troops from Pakistan had been deployed to maintain order during the last year’s general elections.
Talking to Dawn, after the meeting the CEC informed that after fresh delimitation of LB wards the number of polling stations had increased to 5,192.
The new delimitations had raised the number of union councils to 2,080, municipal corporations’ wards to 133, municipal committees’ wards to 77, town committees’ wards to 53 and district councils’ wards to 280, he said.
He said the schedule for the polls would be unveiled in a couple of days in consultation with the government while the final polling scheme will be released by Aug 15.

12,‘Novel tobacco products being freely marketed due to poor tobacco control policy’,ISLAMABAD: Novel tobacco products are becoming increasingly popular among Pakistani youth due to extensive social...,"ISLAMABAD: Novel tobacco products are becoming increasingly popular among Pakistani youth due to extensive social media marketing and advertisement campaigns by the tobacco industry. These so-called ‘less’ harmful products pose immense danger to public health and if the government does not ban these products, Pakistan’s health system will suffer unprecedented damage.
These thoughts were shared by health experts in a joint press release issued by the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (Sparc) to divert the federal cabinet’s attention towards the alarming increase in the use of nicotine pouches, e-cigarettes and vapes, collectively referred to as novel or alternative products.
Country head, Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, Malik Imran Ahmed said tobacco companies had been able to freely market and sell alternative products because unfortunately in Pakistan tobacco control did not go beyond cigarettes and Gutka.
“The alternative products have been in Pakistani market for several years now but there has been no policy or legislation to control and monitor their sales, promotion and advertisement,” he said, adding that the claim of ‘less’ harmful was a big lie because every year around 170,000 precious lives were lost in Pakistan due to tobacco-induced diseases such as cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and cardiovascular disease.
“So even if we believe the lie that alternative products are ‘less’ harmful, the damage done will still be significant,” Mr Ahmed said.
Sparc Programme Manager Khalil Ahmed Dogar said the tobacco industry was searching for a new generation of buyers to keep their business and profits running.
“The fallacious campaigns are targeted at children and youth through social media platforms and sales near educational institutions,” he said, adding that if these attempts of the tobacco industry to gain more buyers are not kept in check through proper mechanisms, they will grow more powerful and continue being the cause of deaths and diseases.
CEO, Chromatic Trust, Shariq Ahmed said tobacco companies were investing huge money in online campaigns on almost all social media platforms.
“The advertisements are designed in such deceptive manner that even famous celebrities join them. There is a need of state-level campaign to raise awareness about the harms of nicotine, second-hand smoking and adverse impacts of tobacco products on public economy and environment,” he said.
