1,Imran loses hope of early elections,Warns against installing technocrat government in country.,"LAHORE: Strongly reacting to the rumours that serious considerations are afoot to install a technocrat government, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan has said he is no more optimistic about holding of general elections in the country anytime soon.
Sticking to his stance that there is no use of talking to the incumbent “imported government”, former prime minister said only establishment had the role in letting elections happen and added that “establishment means army chief”. He said he had no contact with the “establishment”.
Speaking to media persons at his Zaman Park residence here on Wednesday, the PTI chief said: “It is more important to convince those forces that are backing the PDM government than the government itself to call that elections be held soon.”
 
 

He said there is hearsay about a technocrat government to be installed in the country and this compels him to believe that the government is not interested in holding general elections anytime soon.
He said the Pakistan Democratic Move­m­ent had reduced to a drawing room party.

Warns against installing technocrat government in country

Citing the example of Bangladesh, Mr Khan warned that “if any political engineering is attempted in the next general elections, the results will not be good”. Recalling that the mandate of the largest party in East Pakistan was not accepted, he said the PTI was the largest political party of Pakistan and denying mass public opinion would result in dire consequences.
The former prime minister yet again castigated former army chief retired Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, asserting that the latter committed “excesses against Pakistan” that pushed it to the threshold of default.
“Gen Bajwa did great injustice to this country; we are standing close to default,” he said, explaining how threat to default had increased to 90 per cent which was 5pc during his government.
Mr Khan said his government’s working relations with the former army chief were “good” and added that Gen Bajwa, however, did not consider corruption by politicians as something serious.
 
 

He claimed that corruption cases worth Rs1,100 billion were closed by amending the NAB law.
The PTI chief had earlier alleged that Gen Bajwa had “struck” a deal with PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah. Mr Khan said since both PML-N and PPP had foreign assets, there was no use of entering into what they call a ‘charter of economy’.
He said the country is facing chronic political and economic problems and these cannot be resolved without ensuring rule of law after holding free and fair elections. He said the wave of terrorism would intensify if the powers that be did not hold dialogue with Afghanistan.

2,Public Accounts Committee to examine SC dam fund,PAC chairman told SBP restrained from providing details of bank accounts related to fund.,"ISLAMABAD: The Public Accounts Committee (PAC), which oversees government spending, decided on Wednesday to write a letter to the Supreme Court to seek information about a fund set up by former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar during his tenure to collect money for the Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand dams.
The fund was set up in July 2018 and the Supreme Court’s website had specifically solicited donations for building the two reservoirs.
PTI chief Imran Khan, the then prime minister, also threw his weight behind Mr Nisar’s call for donations, making it a joint venture to overcome the country’s water scarcity.
The fund hit Rs10 billion in collections by March 2019 while reportedly a sum of Rs13bn was spent on its advertisements.

Committee chairman told SBP restrained from providing details of bank accounts related to fund

The PAC summoned Mr Nisar earlier this year for an explanation on the fund, but he did not come to attend the committee’s meeting.
While scrutinising the audit reports of the water ministry, the committee directed the auditor general to audit the dam fund.
The auditor general, Mohammad Ajmal Gondal, told the PAC that Supreme Court’s registrar did not share the details of the funds’ collection.
The PAC asked the secretary committee to write a letter to the principal accounting officer of the apex court to provide details.
PAC Chairman Noor Alam Khan said he had learnt that the State Bank of Pakistan had also been restrained from providing details of bank accounts related to the fund.
He said the people of Pakistan deposited Rs10 to 100 million in this fund and the PAC was obliged to keep a check on the public money.
The committee also ordered a forensic audit of the Diamer-Bhasha, Dasu, Mohmand and Neelum-Jhelum dams and the K-IV water project in Karachi.
It was informed that during 2016-17, some Rs22.88bn funds were released for Dasu Dam, including Rs4.58bn mobilisation advance.
However, the auditors told the committee that the work could not start even after five years.
Officials of the water ministry told the committee that the ministry released the funds because of a deadline set by the World Bank.
The committee also ordered the National Accountability Bureau to investigate the submission of a fake bank guarantee for the Nai Gaj Dam by its contractor.

4,Bilawal claims PTI chief scared of ‘polls on time’,Claims former PM’s ‘facilitators’ present in some institutions.,"LARKANA: PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday said that if general elections are held on their scheduled time there would be no “facilitators” of Imran Khan left in “any of the institutions” and that’s the reason the PTI chairman has been calling for snap polls. 
“That’s why he (Imran Khan) has indul­ged in blame game so that he could create hurdles in the way of democracy and interrupt the tenure of parliament,” he said.
Talking to reporters after visiting the newly-built Trauma Centre, the foreign minister while stressing the continuity of democracy recalled that since 2007 dem­o­cracy had started gaining root in the country as parliamentary institutions completed their constitutional terms thrice in sharp contrast to the past when assemblies used to be dissolved within two to three years. 
Now Imran Khan, he alleged, wanted the door of dictatorship opened so that he could enter the corridor of power from back door. There must be a conspiracy behind Mr Khan’s moves, he said. 
The PPP leader said that Imran Khan was adamant on getting early elections when his “facilitators” were in the establishment so that he can take advantage of their presence. 

Says former PM’s ‘facilitators’ present in some institutions; visits newly-built Trauma Centre in Larkana

Mr Bhutto-Zardari said though his [Imran Khan’s] ‘facilitators’ no longer existed in the establishment, he cannot rule out the possibility of presence such elements in other institutions. Therefore, he emphasised, if elections are held on time there will be no such facilitators left in any of the institutions.
Describing Imran Khan and his slogans as a story of the past, he recalled that Gen Musharraf also used to make tall claims about revolution when he was democratically ousted. 
Referring to Imran Khan’s election narrative that army will support him, the PPP chairman wondered whether people in all the institutions worked as the PTI’s tiger force. 
He regretted that a man sitting out of power for the past eight months had been openly talking about violating the Cons­titution and described this kind of political narrative as against democracy and a manifestation of dictatorial mindset. 
“Whenever people were given opportunity, they inflicted defeat on undemocratic and selected forces and elected democratic forces,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari said, adding that parliament would complete its five-year term.
While visiting the Trauma Centre, the PPP leader said that Chandka Medical College Hospital (CMCH) had served not only Larkana, Qambar-Shahdadkot and Jacobabad districts but patients from parts of Balochistan and southern Punjab also came to this health facility. 
People of Larkana will have the facility of 1122 emergency ambulance service. The service should be expanded to Hyde­rabad, Sukkur and other cities, he said. 
Earlier, the PPP leader visited Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Bhutto and offered fateha on Bhuttos’ graves. 
He also visited the residence of DSP Abdul Malik Bhutto, who embraced martyrdom during an operation against dacoits in Ghotki.

5,‘Resigned’ PTI lawmakers set to meet NA speaker today,"Qureshi says party ready for parliamentary role, but govt not serious.","ISLAMABAD: After multiple delays, the much-awaited meeting between National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and PTI leaders will take place in Parliament House on Thursday (today) at 11:30am for the personal verification of party MNAs’ pending resignations, the assembly spokesperson said on Wednesday.
A four-member committee led by PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi will meet the speaker, a source in the National Assembly Secretariat (NAS) told Dawn. The other three members will include Asad Umar, Amir Dogar and Pervez Khattak.
The PTI announced mass resignations from the National Assembly on April 11, a day after the ouster of then  prime minister Imran Khan through a vote of confidence in parliament. 
However, while the PTI wants the speaker to accept the resignations collectively, Mr Ashraf insists he will accept them one by one after the personnel appearance of each member of National Assembly.

Qureshi says party ready for parliamentary role, but govt not serious

A source in the PTI said the party was seeking a way to return to the assembly. 
On the other hand, the speaker was said to be under government’s pressure not to “accept the resignations”. Mr Ashraf hinted that some PTI lawmakers had contacted him and requested “they do not want to get their resignations accepted”.
As for today’s meeting, he said: “They are most welcome. I will brief them in the light of the Constitution and I hope that [the PTI lawmakers] are sane enough to understand.”
He said the PTI team wanted to meet him on Tuesday, but he was in Naudero to attend the 15th death anniversary of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
On Wednesday, the speaker contacted Amir Dogar, former chief whip of PTI in the National Assembly, and invited him to a meeting on Thursday.
Asked if any PTI MNA contacted him and expressed willingness to rejoin the assembly, Mr Ashraf said: “There are many, but being a custodian of the house and its members, I cannot tell their names.”
Earlier on July 28, Mr Ashraf accepted the resignations of only 11 PTI lawmakers. 
The PTI challenged the move in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in August, but the court dismissed the petition the next month.
The party then approached the Supreme Court, requesting it to set aside the IHC order. A decision is still pending.
Meanwhile, PTI’s Mr Qureshi said his party was willing to play a role in parliament, but the government was not ready to make a serious commitment in this regard. 
Australia tour
PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said that although the speaker had called the PTI team for a meeting on Thursday, Mr Ashraf was leaving for Australia on the same day.
However, he also said that after the resignations of MNAs, courts had nothing to do with that matter.

6,Balochistan seeks 1pc increase in NFC share,CM says province spends at least Rs40bn on security needs.,"QUETTA: In light of the volatile security situation, the Balochistan cabinet has decided to seek a one per cent increase in its share in the National Finance Commission (NFC) award on account of security expenditures amounting to at least Rs40 billion.
A meeting of the provincial cabinet chaired by CM Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo agreed that Balochistan did not have enough money to meet its security expenses. CM Bizenjo said Balochistan shared borders with Iran and Afghanistan and added that the province was a victim of ‘external terrorism’.
He said the province was on the ‘frontline’ in Pak­istan’s fight against terrorism. Out of its meagre resources, Balochistan allocates Rs40bn-50bn for security expenditures, the CM said. 
He said Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa was getting a fair share in the NFC on account of its security expenditure; therefore, Balochistan should also be given an extra 1pc share in the NFC for the same purpose. The cabinet decided to forward this demand to the prime minister and the Council of Common Interests (CCI), hoping the centre and other provinces would empathise with Quetta.

CM says province spends at least Rs40bn on security needs

The chief minister further said that only Rs70 billion were being allocated for the province’s development budget, which was not even enough to meet the development needs of Quetta.
Cabinet decisions
The cabinet also approved the issuance of a letter of intent for a housing project under the public-private partnership, which was being managed by the Department of Urban Planning and Development. It also approved the agenda presented by the Depart­ment of Secondary Edu­cation regarding the role of the National Commission for Human Development and Basic Education Community Services.
The cabinet also approved the Balochistan Public Private Partnership Rules 2022 along with a proposal to amend the Human Rights Policy 2022 and Balochistan Drugs and Therapeutics Goods Rules 2021.
The provincial cabinet further approved the regularisation of contract employees of Gwadar Indus­trial Estate Develop­ment Authority and Balo­chistan Public Private Partnership Rules 2022 besides the release of additional grant-in-aid for the Balochistan Judicial Academy. It further approved a policy for wheat procurement.
The establishment of two new tehsils and one sub-tehsil in the Noshki district and compensation for the losses of the traders affected by the pilgrimage were also approved in the meeting. 
The cabinet also approved the establishment and construction of district councils in the newly established districts of Hub and Usta Muhammad and gave the approval to release funds for the salaries of PDMA employees.

7,Millers in Quetta hint at price hike amid flour shortage,"QUETTA: The chairman of the Pakistan Flour Mills Association’s Balochistan chapter, Syed Nasir Agha, has warned...","QUETTA: The chairman of the Pakistan Flour Mills Association’s Balochistan chapter, Syed Nasir Agha, has warned that prices of wheat and its flour will further increase in the province if timely steps are not taken to overcome the acute shortage of wheat in Balochistan.
Speaking at a press conference here on Wednesday along with Badaruddin Kakar and Asmatullah Kakar, Balochistan chapter representatives of the association, Mr Nasir said that the province was facing acute shortage of wheat which had pushed up prices of wheat and its flour in the province and wheat flour was not easily available to the people.
He said that Provincial Minister Zamarak Khan Piralizai had visited Lahore a few months ago and discussed the wheat shortage issue in Balochistan with leaders of the Punjab government and a request was made to the Punjab government to provide at least 600,000 wheat bags to Balochistan to end the shortage of wheat and its flour in the province.
Mr Nasir said that Punjab 
Chief Minister Parvez Elahi had agreed to supply wheat to Balochistan, but so far Balochistan had not received the Punjab government promised wheat.
Mr Nasir said that wheat stock in Balochistan was about to end and only the private sector had some wheat stock which was also about to be finished soon.
He said that at present Balochistan was the only province which had been experiencing serious wheat shortage. 
He said if the Punjab government did not provide wheat to Balochistan, the province would experience the worst shortage of the commodity in the coming days.
Mr Nasir said that Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (Passco) gave a subsidy of Rs7 to Rs8 billion to Gilgit-Baltistan for wheat, but the organisation was not ready to provide the same facility to Balochistan. He said the Flour Mills Association of Balochistan region had protested four months ago over the issue, but no step had been taken so far to resolve the matter.
He said the government provided wheat in huge quantity to flour mills, adding that at present the price of wheat was the highest in the country and it would further go up if the federal government did not intervene to control the situation.

In a press statement issued here on Wednesday, the minister claimed that Mr Khan was a thief and a foreign agent whose four-year rule turned a “prosperous Pakistan” into a ruined country. “His was the worst experiment in the country’s history,” Ms Aurangzeb said.
She said the group of incompetent people and foreign agents, imposed on the country in 2018, had been thrown out of the parliament in April.
She also accused the PTI leader of trading off national interests, including the Kashmir cause, in return for foreign funds, adding that malicious campaigns against martyrs of the army and institutions had been launched at his behest in the country.
She challenged the PTI lawmakers of the National Assembly to appear before the NA speaker for acceptance of their resignations, adding it was astonishing why the PTI was not dissolving assemblies in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

10,Punjab CM urged to implement 85/15 media payment formula,"KARACHI: In a joint statement issued by the All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS), Pakistan Broadcasters ...","KARACHI: In a joint statement issued by the All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS), Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) and Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors (CPNE), the media organisations have urged Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi to implement the media payment formula of advertising dues as implemented by the federal government as well as provincial governments.
Under this mechanism, the federal and provincial governments pay their verified advertising bills directly to the relevant media and the agency commission/trade discount is paid directly to the advertising agencies based on an 85/15 formula.
This entails 85pc being paid to media and 15pc to advertising agencies for services rendered.
“The media bodies are of the considered view that this system ensures timely and transparent disbursement of media and agency dues,” they said in a statement.
The representative bodies of media have stated that if the above-agreed formula was withdrawn by the Punjab government, the media would be deprived of the timely payments of the advertisements published/aired by the media.
The APNS, PBA and CPNE have also requested the provincial government to take the media stakeholders on board before finalising its advertising policy.
