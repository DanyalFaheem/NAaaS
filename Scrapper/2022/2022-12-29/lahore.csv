4,Teachers protest brings city to a standstill,Educators seek regular service,"LAHORE: Thousands of educators on Wednesday protested outside former prime minister Imran Khan’s house in Zaman Park to demand regularisation of their jobs.
Punjab Physical Education Teachers Association (PPETA), Punjab Teachers’ Union (PTU) and Punjab Government Schools Association of Computer Teachers (PGSACT) held the protest outside Chief Minister’s House, and later moved towards Imran Khan’s residence in Zaman Park.
The protesters blocked the road outside Imran Khan’s residence, causing long queues of traffic on Canal Road.
They raised slogans, holding banners and placards inscribed with their demands of service structure and regularisation of assistant education officers.

Educators seek regular service

The city government and police officials held negotiations with the protesters in the evening and later they changed the place of their sit-in and reached outside 8-Club Road where they held a sit-in outside the CM house but no one from the government approached them to address their grievances.
They said 14,000 teachers including SSEs, SESEs, and ESEs/ AEOs had not been regularised since 2014. They said that they would not end their protest till the acceptance of their demands .
They said under the recruitment policy, they appeared in the NTS test and departmental interviews for regular recruitment but the government was again asking them to appear in another test and interview to get themselves regularised.
Meanwhile, hundreds of vehicles got stuck in traffic on The Mall, Jail Road, Canal Road and  other adjoining arteries due to a protest lodged by the government  teachers outside the Zaman Park residence of Imran Khan. 
They blocked the main Canal Road by staging a sit-in which led to a worst traffic blockade on the roads. 
Witnesses  said several families also got trapped in long queues of the vehicles  and they were forced to use the narrow streets to reach their  destinations.  
Reports suggested that the teachers who were  demanding [pay] incentives first staged a sit-in at the Davies Chowk,  creating traffic mess on The Mall and other arteries. 
As they  found out that the authorities concerned were still unmoved to their  protest and demands, many of them reached the Canal Road and blocked  traffic there.  
The blockade of two major roads led to a traffic  mess in major parts of the city, causing a great deal of inconvenience  to commuters.

6,"Short wheat supply blamed for flour shortage, price hike",LHC strikes down restriction on release of wheat from public stock to new mills,"LAHORE: Flour millers hold reduced wheat supplies by the food department as one of the major reasons behind flour shortage and an increase in its price, which has gone up to Rs140 per kilogramme for the chakki variety.  
Central chairman of the Pakistan Flour Mills Association, Asim Raza Ahmed, and Punjab Chairman Chaudhry Iftikhar Mattu say the only reason behind non-availability of flour and increase in its sale price in all the districts of Punjab, including Lahore, is a shortfall of 5,000 tonnes in wheat release quota for mills by the food department.  
They say that instead of 26,000 tonnes, the department is releasing only 21,000 tonnes of grain daily from its stores in the province. That is the reason customers are seen standing in long queues to buy flour.  
In a statement, they say the food department has surplus wheat, while at least 500,000 tonnes of imported wheat will reach the province by the end of January. But people are facing a shortage of the commodity because the department is not fulfilling the local requirement, as more flour is consumed during winters to meet energy needs.  

LHC strikes down restriction on release of wheat from public stock to new mills

They say that fixing the Rs4,000 per 40kg grain support price by Sindh against Rs3,000 for the same weight by Punjab is also affecting the wheat market in the province, as the rate of the commodity has gone up to Rs4,300 per kg in the local markets. This has led to an increase in the price of 15kg flour bag here, they add.  
This pressure in the open market, they say, will be reduced only through improved supplies of wheat, and the flour price will automatically come down for the benefit of the consumers.  
Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court has struck down a restriction imposed by the food department and allowed the release of wheat from public stock to newly established flour mills possessing valid licences.  
Justice Abid Hussain Chattha passed the order allowing several petitions filed by Rana Abdul Basit Khan and other flour mill owners challenging a notification by the food secretary issued on May 19.  
The petitioners’ counsel contended that the mills applied for the release of wheat from public stock to the food department and due inspections were carried out for the verification of their installed machinery and grinding capacity.  
However, the request of the petitioners for release of wheat from public stock was denied in view of a provision in clause-VII of the impugned notification.  
Assistant Advocate General Barrister Lehrasip Hayat Dahar contended that the food department has the right to formulate policies and regulate the release of wheat from public stock in larger public interest. He said the rationale for incorporating the restriction in the notification is that the distribution policy can be kept stagnant and adhered to without any disruption and frequent changes.  
He said the petitioners/mills were not barred from grinding the wheat after procuring it from the private sector and that they will become eligible for release of wheat from the public stock after the next harvest season.  
The law officer argued that if every new entrant is extended the benefit of the policy, a new quota will be required after incorporating them, which is not only impractical, but will also hinder smooth and uninterrupted supply of wheat to the existing mills.  
However, Justice Chattha observed that the restriction is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious and not based on any intelligible criteria.  
“It does not withstand the test of structured discretion and therefore… clause VII of the notification is struck down and is declared unconstitutional and unlawful,” he concluded.

8,CPSP head for posting of senior students to far-off hospitals,Move can help cope with medics’ shortage,"LAHORE: The College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan (CPSP) has proposed to the government to appoint third- and fourth-year postgraduate students for a certain period at the tehsil and district headquarter hospitals as ‘specialist’ to cope with the shortage of doctors in far-flung areas.  
The proposal was shared by CPSP President Prof Dr Shoaib Shafi at the fifth convocation of the CPSP held here on Wednesday to address the longstanding issue of extending healthcare to the poor patients visiting the far-flung health facilities.
Punjab Governor Muhammad Balighur Rahman, renowned gynaecologist and pioneer of the test-tube baby in Pakistan Prof Dr Rashid Latif, Fatima Jinnah Medical University Vice Chancellor Prof Khalid Masood Gondal and other senior faculty members attended the two sessions of the convocation.
Diplomas were awarded to 532 FCPS and 110 MCPS doctors of the year 2020 in the first session and 648 FCPS and 90 MCPS medics in the second session.

Move can help cope with medics’ shortage 

During the sessions, the CPSP president floated the proposal to resolve the issue of vacant slots at the tehsil and DHQ hospitals of the country.  
He said there were nearly 33,000 postgraduate students and of them those at third and fourth year sessions were having capability to provide treatment to the patients as ‘specialist doctor.’
Dr Shafi said the appointment of these medics as specialists at the DHQ and THQ hospitals would address the decades-old issue as most of the slots at these state-run health facilities used to remain vacant.
The CPSP president proposed that the senior doctors serving at these hospitals could be declared co-supervisors of the young specialist doctors during their service at the DHQ and THQ hospitals.  
After completing their certain period that may be from three to six months, they would rejoin their previous supervisors and the proposal would help create a trained human resource at the hospitals.  
“This is also a best model in practice in the developed countries,” Dr Shaoib Shafi said adding that since most of the medical students were the female, the government would have to provide them with some incentive, security and residences to materialise the scheme.  
A number of participants attending the event endorsed the proposal.  
Speaking on the occasion, Prof Rashid Latif Khan lauded the services of the present council saying that establishing a modern hospital equipped with latest international technology was the need of the hour.
Punjab Governor Balighur Rahman said earning money alone should not be the goal of the [fresh] postgraduate medics saying that the principle of purposeful and meaningful life has been taking care of the ailing humanity.  
He admired the services of the CPSP for providing services abroad like in the UK, Ireland, Saudi Arabia and Nepal and the FJMU’s vice chancellor for establishing the department of family medicine.  
“We should promote the use of modern technology and adopt teamwork among ourselves,” the governor said.
