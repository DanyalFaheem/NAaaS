0,Development spending drops 38pc in July-Nov,"The massive drop would not only slow down the economy but would take a toll on revenue collection as well, says ministry.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s overall development spending dropped 38 per cent to Rs130.64 billion in the first five months (July-November) of the current fiscal year from Rs209.53bn a year ago to create a cushion for rising current expenditures.
According to data released by the Ministry of Planning and Development on Wednesday, the massive drop would not only slow down the economy but would take a toll on revenue collection as well.
In absolute terms, the expenditures so far account for 17.96pc of the total revised allocation of Rs727bn, drastically short of the development spending target.
Under the disbursement mechanism announced by the Planning Division, the development funds allocated in the federal budget are released at the rate of 20pc in the first quarter (July-September), followed by 30pc each in the second (October–December) and third quarter (January-March) and remaining 20pc in last quarter (April-June) of a fiscal year.
It is believed that the development expenditure is being curtailed to contain the rising fiscal deficit owing to the increase in current expenditures.
The PMLN-led coalition government has appointed over 70 special assistants, who are drawing huge salaries besides perks and privileges at a time when the country’s forex reserves have dwindled drastically and industries are cutting their production.
The government now estimates its overall expenditures to surge past budget target by about Rs1 trillion due to about Rs900bn higher interest payments and expected Rs422bn revenue shortfalls that may need to be bridged through additional tax measures in the second half of the current fiscal year.
The main driver of development expenditure which reached Rs130.64bn is because of 42.45pc share in total spending by state-run corporations — power sector entities and National Highway Authority (NHA) — to Rs55.46bn in 5MFY23.
The breakdown showed that the utilisation of development funds by state-run corporations stood on the higher side chiefly because of a more than 227.28pc surge in power sector projects which increased to Rs34.42bn from Rs10.52bn in 5MFY22.
NHA’s expenditure on the other hand dropped to Rs21.03bn in 5MFY23 against Rs38bn in the corresponding period last year.
Excluding corporations, the development expenditure by the federal ministries and divisions and their attached departments stood at Rs75bn in 5MFY23 compared to Rs160bn last year, a fall of over 53pc.
The Planning Ministry data showed that about Rs224bn had been authorised for utilisation under the rules and disbursement mechanism during 5MFY23 but actual spending could not go beyond 41.8pc or Rs130.64bn.
The Water Resources Division emerged as the best performer in terms of utilisation of funds with Rs20bn against authorised amount of Rs22.43bn in 5MFY23 because of ongoing major development projects. Last year, the water sector consumed Rs27.27bn in five months against authorised spending of Rs58.79bn.
The second biggest share in development expenditures was made to provinces and special areas which stood at Rs18.38bn and another Rs11bn for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to the parliamentarians during the first five months of the FY23. The total authorisation of the development budget for parliamentarians is Rs87bn.
The Ministry of Finance has already reported the country’s first quarter fiscal deficit at 1pc of GDP against 0.7pc in the same period last year. The deficit in absolute numbers in three months this year was reported at Rs809bn compared to Rs484bn in the same period last year — up 67pc.
According to the finance ministry, the country’s revenue collection dropped in the first three months of FY23 and total expenditures went up when compared to the same period last year — leading to an increase in the fiscal deficit.
The total revenue as a percentage of GDP dropped to 2.6pc this year from 2.7pc last year as tax revenue plunged to 2.3pc of GDP when compared to 2.7pc of GDP in the first quarter last year.

1,SECP steps in to shield borrowers from digital lenders,Regulator bars firms from storing data on cloud outside Pakistan.,"ISLAMABAD: The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) on Wednesday restricted the digital lending platforms from taking coercive measures for recoveries and barred them from shifting borrowers’ data outside Pakistan.
The SECP through circular no. 15 has directed the digital lenders that the borrowers’ data cannot be stored on any cloud infrastructure outside the jurisdiction of Pakistan.
The commission has also issued digital lending standards applicable to Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) undertaking lending activities through digital channels/mobile applications (apps).
The regulator has announced these measures amid growing complaints from the public that the digital lending platforms were involved in mis-selling, breach of data privacy and coercive recovery practices.

Regulator bars firms from storing data on cloud outside Pakistan

The circular has been forwarded to licenced digital lending companies and placed on the SECP website for public consumption and awareness.
The SECP has made it mandatory that the lending app will have to display the summary of the Key Fact Statement (KFS) through a video/audio, screenshot and email/SMS in both English and Urdu languages.
This move aims to ensure transparency and ease of understanding, while the lending companies need to stipulate minimum mandatory disclosures and provisions, before loan disbursement to the borrower.
These include loan amount approved, annual percentage rates, tenor of loan, installments/lump sum payment amounts with date, and all charges. Any fee not included in KFS will not be charged to the borrower.
At the same time to discourage non-licenced operators, the licenced digital lender shall be required to disclose its full corporate name and licencing status on its lending platform/app, and ensure that any advertisement and publication shall be fair and not contain misleading information.
The SECP has also specified a comprehensive grievance redressal mechanism over and above the current NBFC grievance redressal framework.
Further, to ensure the confidentiality and privacy of data, the digital lender will not be allowed access to the borrower’s phone book or contact list, or photo gallery, even if the borrower has given consent in this regard.
The circular has restricted the lenders not to contact the persons in the borrower’s contact list, other than those who have been specifically authorised by the borrower as guarantors and who have also provided their consent to the digital lender at the time of loan approval.
Recently the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has taken notice of violations and deceptive marketing by the mobile applications offering nano personal loans and asked the aggrieved people to lodge their complaints to the CCP in this regard.

2,Tax collection from cigarette industry jumps 26pc,PM directs FBR chief to take immediate measures to curb cigarette smuggling as well as illegal transportation of tobacco.,"ISLAMABAD: The revenue collection from the cigarette manufacturers grew 26 per cent to Rs83.5 billion in the first half of the current fiscal year from the same period a year ago thanks to the Track and Trace System (TTS) introduced to check tax evasion in the tobacco sector.
The statistics were shared in a special meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to review measures taken to curb smuggling and tax evasion in the cigarette industry. 
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, Special Assistant to Prime Minister Tariq Bajwa, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman Asim Ahmed and senior officials attended the meeting.
The TTS was introduced in the tobacco sector on July 1, 2021.
However, no data was shared on whether there was any increase in the number of cigarettes because of the tracking system. 
The revenue growth is mainly because of two factors — the cigarette prices were increased besides a substantial increase in the Federal Excise Duty rates in the last budget.
An official announcement said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the FBR chairman to take immediate measures to curb cigarette smuggling and tax evasion as well as illegal transportation of tobacco.
The meeting was informed that most of the cigarette factories had implemented the TTS, which has led to a significant improvement in tax collection.

3,Profits on foreign investments nosedive,SBP data shows that $128.7m was paid on foreign investments in Pakistan during July-Nov FY23 compared to $776m during the same period last year.,"KARACHI: The outflow of profits and dividends on foreign investment drastically declined during the first five months of the current fiscal year (FY23), reflecting both positive sign for lower repatriation of dollars and negative one for the poor economic growth.
The latest data released by the State Bank showed that $128.7 million was paid on foreign investments in Pakistan during July-Nov FY23 compared to $776m during the same period last year. The massive decline saved dollars for the country, but at the same time it reflected the poor economic growth which failed to generate profits on investments.
The weak economic performance further reduced foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country by over 50 per cent during the first five months of FY23 as it fell to just $430m against $885m during the same period last year.
Analysts and researchers said there is no hope for higher FDI in the coming months since the economic growth is much lower than expectations.
A recent State Bank’s annual report on the state of economy stated that the economic growth would be lower than the range set for FY23. The growth range for the current fiscal year is 3-4 per cent, while credit rating agencies estimate the growth at just 2pc against 6pc in FY22.
The highest outflow of profits worth $42m was noted from the oil and gas exploration sector in the first five months of FY23 against $22m during the same period last year.
The mining and quarrying sector paid profits worth $17.9m against zero outflow last year. However, all other sectors’ profits fell drastically during the period under review. The outflow of profits from the power sector in five months was $23.8m compared to $93.4m during the same period last year.
The highly lucrative banking sector had paid $148m in five months of FY22 as profits on foreign investments, but it fell to just $7.8m during the same period of FY23. Banks are mostly investing in government papers and avoiding lending to the private sector as the high interest rate has created higher risk of default.
The communication sector had paid $89.6m as profits in five months of the previous fiscal year, but it declined to $4.2m during the same period of FY23.
The highest outflow in five months of FY22 was $104.9m from the food sector, which fell to zero this year. Food packaging and beverages also offered zero profits this year compared to $37.6m and $33.5m, respectively, last year fiscal year.
Tobacco, transport and chemicals noted an outflow of $2.7m, $1.9m and $4.4m, respectively, during the first five months FY23 compared to $32.4m, $50m and $32.9m during the same period last year.
The low outflow shows lower profits produced this year which means the industries and services are not working efficiently to generate profits like the fiscal year FY22.

4,Exxon sues EU to block windfall tax,HOUSTON: US oil major Exxon Mobil Corp is suing the European Union in a bid to force it to scrap the bloc’s new...,"HOUSTON: US oil major Exxon Mobil Corp is suing the European Union in a bid to force it to scrap the bloc’s new windfall tax on oil groups, arguing Brussels exceeded its legal authority by imposing the levy.
Record profits this year by oil companies benefiting from high energy prices have boosted inflation around the world and led to fresh calls to further tax the sector.
The windfall profits tax is  “counter-productive,” discourages investments and undermines investor confidence, Exxon spokesperson Casey Norton said on Wednesday. Exxon will factor in the tax as it considers futu­re multibillion-euro inves­tm­ents in Europes energy supply and transition, he said.
“Whether we invest here primarily depends on how attractive and globally competitive Europe will be,” Norton said.

5,Arif Habib plans up to five REIT listings in 2023,"“Four to five of these REITs will raise funds from the public within 2023,” says official.","KARACHI: The stock exchange will witness up to five listings of real estate investment trusts (REITs) in 2023 from the Arif Habib Group alone, a company official told Dawn on Wednesday.
REITs are investment schemes that collect money from investors and deploy it in real estate projects. Ordinary investors can trade REIT units like company shares once they get listed on the stock exchange within three years of inception — a feature designed to let small investors take exposure to an otherwise capital-intensive and illiquid real estate market.
Speaking on the sidelines of a gong ceremony held to mark the start of trading in Globe Residency REIT, Arif Habib Dolmen REIT Management Ltd CEO Muhammad Ejaz said the group has registered as many as nine schemes with a collective fund size of Rs125 billion. 
“Four to five of these REITs will raise funds from the public within 2023,” he said.
The number of upcoming REIT listings is unusually high in view of the fact that a total of three listings, including that of Globe Residency REIT, took place on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) in the outgoing year.
The same group launched Pakistan’s first REIT — Dolmen City REIT of Rs22bn — in 2015. The REIT sector, which had only one constituent until now, is the best-performing PSX sector in 2022 so far.
According to data compiled by Topline Securities, the REIT sector outperformed all others due to a stable dividend yield coupled with favourable changes in the regulations. Commercial banks can now invest in REIT units and count the investment towards their housing and construction finance targets. The regulatory tweak has led to a big jump in the investment of REIT units by commercial banks.
In his speech at the gong ceremony, industrialist Arif Habib recommended that the government should exempt the first-time purchasers of home, shop and office from submitting wealth reconciliation.
“Developers face problems when their end buyers insist on paying in cash. That’s because their wealth isn’t reconciled in most cases,” he said, adding that the deep-rooted, societal problem compels developers to declare understated profits.
Mr Habib also demanded that the government should tax the holdings of empty plots at a higher rate to encourage land development, which creates employment and increases the asset value by two to three times. He added that tax relief should instead be given on the development of empty plots into useable real estate.
Citing research from independent sources, he said real estate is the largest asset class in Pakistan with the investment value of around Rs90 trillion. Investments in banking deposits, stock market and mutual funds amount to Rs22.7tr, Rs6.3tr and Rs1.4tr, respectively.

7,Wheat target to be achieved: Cheema,"Minister hopes that ""despite all odds the wheat production target of 28.4 million tonnes for 2022-23 will be achieved.""","ISLAMABAD: National Food Security Minister Tariq Bashir Cheema has expressed the hope that despite all odds the wheat production target of 28.4 million tonnes for 2022-23 would be achieved.
According to official statistics released by the ministry on Wednesday, the sowing of wheat has been completed on an area of over 21 million acres against the target of 22.85m acres. In Punjab, the crop has been sown on 16.48m acres.
In Sindh, the pace of sowing is slow against the target of 2.79m acres due to flood-related issues. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is also nearing completion against the target of 2.22m acres, whereas in Balochistan 0.804m acres have been brought under the crop against the target of 1.36m acres.
Counting on other measures to facilitate farmers under Kisaan Package, Mr Cheema told newsmen that loans worth Rs663.9bn were disbursed to farmers by banks in the first five months of the current fiscal year. 
Mr Cheema stated that the government had ensured the availability of DAP fertiliser at subsidised rate of Rs11,250 per bag under the Kisaan Package. The government will not allow misusing the subsidy on the supply of urea fertiliser, and in this regard, provinces were being coordinated, he declared.
