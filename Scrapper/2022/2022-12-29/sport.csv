0,"Ramiz should’ve quit PCB after Imran’s ouster as PM, says Aqib","“Many chairmen in the past had left the post with the ouster of the PM who had appointed them and Ramiz should’ve followed suit.""","LAHORE: Former Pakistan fast bowler Aqib Javed said on Wednesday that Ramiz Raja should have quit his post as the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board once Imran Khan had been ousted as Prime Minister. 
“Many chairmen in the past had left the post with the ouster of the prime minister who had appointed them and Ramiz should’ve followed suit,” Aqib, a part of Pakistan’s 1992 World Cup-winning side alongside Ramiz under the leadership of Imran, told reporters. 
Ramiz, who was appointed the PCB chief in September of 2021 for a term of three years after winning an unopposed election, was removed last week when a 14-member PCB management committee headed by former chairman Najam Sethi was placed to run cricket affairs in the country. 
Aqib, the coach of Pakistan Super League franchise Lahore Qalandars, said Ramiz had gained few friends during his tenure as PCB chief. 
“A lot of people were unhappy during his time at the top,” said Aqib. “The pool of the players had been limited to just 200. Ramiz ran the PCB as a one-man show and neither the players, franchises of the PSL nor the PCB employees happy with his attitude.” 
Sethi has outlined his vision to restore departmental cricket under the PCB constitution of 2014 and Aqib hailed it “as a good step to increase the pool of players”. “With jobs in departments, it will see more people take up cricket,” he said. 
PCB HITS BACK AT CLAIMS
Earlier on Wednesday, the PCB issued a lengthy statement expressing its “disappointment” over the comments made by Ramiz against Sethi on his YouTube channel as well as a television interview. It also attempted to provide clarity to Ramiz’s claims. 
“The PCB believes former chairman Mr Raja’s comments are aimed at tarnishing and damaging the impeccable reputation of present chairman 
Mr Sethi, and it reserves it’s rights to pursue legal proceedings to protect and defend the image and credibility of its Chairman and the institution,” read a PCB statement. 
It noted that it had already rebutted allegations from Ramiz that he’d not been allowed to collect his belongings. It also said that comparisons made by Ramiz about his expenditures to those made by Sethi during their time as chairmen of the PCB are “misleading and inaccurate as the circumstances are incomparable” as Pakistan played most of its cricket overseas while the Pakistan Super League too was held in the United Arab Emirates.

The world’s second-most populous nation has previously hosted the Asian Games and the Commonwealth Games, and Thakur told the Times of India newspaper it was the  “right time” to host the Olympics.
“If India is making news in every sector, from manufacturing to services, then why not in the field of sports? India is looking very seriously at bidding for the 2036 Olympics,” Thakur added.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said it was in preliminary discussions with 10 cities but has not revealed a timeframe for when it plans to award the 2036 edition.
Paris, Los Angeles and Brisbane host the next three Games.
Among potential rivals for the Games are Indonesia and South Korea, as well as Qatar, which hosted this year’s FIFA World Cup. 
Thakur said his government would consult the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and prepare a roadmap ahead of the IOC session in Mumbai next year.
“The IOC session is a prestigious event for India and whatever steps have to be taken to bid along with the IOA, the government will support them. It has to be a joint preparation,” he said.

3,Domingo quits as Bangladesh head coach,DHAKA: Bangladesh coach Russell Domingo has quit just days after the side’s disappointing Test series defeat at...,"DHAKA: Bangladesh coach Russell Domingo has quit just days after the side’s disappointing Test series defeat at home to India with a year left on his contract, the country’s cricket board announced on Wednesday. 
Domingo, 48, had already been partially sidelined earlier this year when he was stripped of his role overseeing the T20 side right before the Asia Cup. 
The South African’s departure will leave Bangladesh scrambling to find a replacement before they host England in February. The South African informed the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) about his resignation on Tuesday. 
All other coaching staff members, including pace bowling coach and fellow South African Allan Donald, will remain in their roles despite Domingo’s resignation. 
Domingo became the head coach in September 2019 after the BCB sacked Steve Rhodes and had a contract with the board until the 2023 50-over World Cup. 
Under him, Bangladesh won Twenty20 series against Australia and New Zealand at home, earned a historic Test win in New Zealand, an ODI series victory in South Africa and at home against India. 
Bangladesh won the ODI series against India 2-1 but lost both Tests, despite an impressive showing by their bowlers in the final match. 
England will play three ODIs and three T20 matches during their tour which concludes on March 14 in Dhaka.

4,Carey century puts Australia in box seat in second South Africa Test,MELBOURNE: A maiden century by wicket-keeper Alex Carey pushed Australia closer to a series-sealing victory in the...,"MELBOURNE: A maiden century by wicket-keeper Alex Carey pushed Australia closer to a series-sealing victory in the second Test as South Africa’s batsmen were left with a mountain to climb at the end of a rain-hit day three on Wednesday. 
With Carey scoring 111 and all-rounder Cameron Green contributing an unbeaten 51 with a broken finger, the hosts piled on the runs before declaring at 575-8 under gathering clouds at the Melbourne Cricket Ground with an ominous lead of 386 after South Africa were bowled out in their first innings for 189. 
In reply, the Proteas were 15-1, still needing 371 runs to make Australia bat again, when play was stopped seven overs after tea and later abandoned due to persistent drizzle. 
Their bid to save the Test, and the three-match series after losing the opener in Brisbane, got off to a horror start with under-pressure skipper Dean Elgar caught by Carey off home skipper Pat Cummins without scoring in the second over. 
Opener Sarel Erwee was seven not out and number three Theunis de Bruyn was on six, the latter having been dropped by David Warner in the slips off Cummins. 
With drizzle falling and the ball skidding on a damp pitch, Erwee and De Bruyn headed off gratefully when play was halted. 
But Australia will be confident of taking the remaining wickets and avoid batting again. 
Following Warner’s double-century on day two and Green’s five-wicket haul on day one, Cummins’s team dominated for a third successive day, with South Australian Carey leading from the front. 
He had good support from Green, who bravely soaked up 177 balls despite nursing a broken finger that saw him retire on day two. 
The pair built a 117-run partnership as South Africa’s bowlers failed to build on a positive start after taking four wickets in the morning. 
“It was nice to be able to consolidate on our start from yesterday,” said Carey, who became only the second wicket-keeper to make a Test century at the MCG after Rod Marsh. 
“This one’s really special, obviously it’s a big moment. But it’s also great to help the Australian cricket team be in a strong position. That’s what we play for, to win games. To see [Green] put on a brave face, bat beautifully ... it allowed us to put on a really good partnership.” 
Carey pulled Marco Jansen for three to bring up his century but was later caught and bowled by the all-rounder after sending a top-edge high above the pitch. 
It could have been a better day for South Africa had their bowlers kept up the pressure after grabbing four early wickets. 
Australia began on 386-3 with Travis Head on 48 and Carey on nine after a herculean unbeaten double century from Warner in his 100th Test in gruelling heat on day two. 
The veteran opener retired exhausted with severe cramp after making his third Test double ton, but he returned to the crease when Anrich Nortje bowled Head for 51. He told host broadcaster Fox before play began that he had a “rough night’s sleep”. 
“I probably woke up six or seven times,” he added, and was bowled first ball by Nortje’s sizzling yorker. 
Cummins survived the hat-trick ball but was caught behind for four off the bowling of paceman Kagiso Rabada. 
“In general it has been a tough three days for us as a bowling unit,” admitted Proteas bowling coach Charl Langeveldt. “Kagi [Rabada] wasn’t on song and a few of the other guys in periods didn’t bowl well as a unit. It’s important for us to get the consistency going, but it hasn’t been there for us in this game. We have to take it hour by hour tomorrow and just try and get runs and see where it goes from there.” 
South Africa had taken three wickets for five runs, leaving Australia 400 for six, but the rally stalled as plucky tail-ender Nathan Lyon (25) combined with Carey in a quickfire 40-run partnership. 
Though Green batted superbly with his injury, the big all-rounder will not bowl for the rest of the Test and has been ruled out for the third and final match in Sydney. 
Fast bowler Mitchell Starc was also nursing a sore finger on his bowling hand but showed ample pace and swing in his few overs before the rain. 
Carey was confident Australia had enough in their attack to take care of business in Melbourne. 
“The way that [Starc] is bowling, I don’t have too many concerns for this match,” he said. “Pencil Gaz [Lyon] in for a heap of overs .... I feel like we’ve got enough bowling.”—Agencies

5,"India promote Pandya, drop Pant for Sri Lanka series",Out-of-form wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant has been dropped from both white-ball squads.,"NEW DELHI: All-rounder Hardik Pandya will lead India’s T20 side at home against Sri Lanka next week after selectors left several heavyweights out of the side.
Selectors have been under pressure to make wholesale changes to India’s white-ball squads after the side’s disappointing T20 World Cup semi-final defeat to England in November.
Sri Lanka’s tour begins with the first of three 20-over matches in Mumbai on January 3 before a three-match ODI series from January 10-15, with Pandya reprising his role as T20 captain for a second straight series, after leading India to victory over New Zealand in November.
Out-of-form wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant has been dropped from both white-ball squads.
Ageing superstars Virat Kohli, 34, and Rohit Sharma, 35, were not included for the three-match T20 series but both return for the ODI portion of the tour.
Sharma returns as 50-over captain after a thumb injury that forced him to sit out most of this month’s Bangladesh tour.
Pandya, who captained the Gujarat Titans to the Indian Premier League title this year in their debut season, will also serve as vice-captain for the ODI series.
Veteran ODI opener Shikhar Dhawan, 37, who led the team for a three-match series against hosts New Zealand in December, was also dropped from the squad for up-and-coming rookies Shubman Gill and Ishan Kishan after scoring just 18 runs across three matches in Bangladesh.
Sri Lanka have announced a 20-man squad for the tour with all-rounder and Asia Cup-winning skipper Dasun Shanaka leading the visitors in both formats.
India Squads:
Twenty20 Internationals: Hardik Pandya (captain), Ishan Kishan (wk), Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav, Deepak Hooda, Rahul Tripathi, Sanju Samson, Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Axar Patel, Arshdeep Singh, Harshal Patel, Umran Malik, Shivam Mavi, Mukesh Kumar.
One-day Internationals: Rohit Sharma (captain), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Ishan Kishan (wk), Hardik Pandya, Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Umran Malik, Arshdeep Singh.
Sri Lanka squad: Dasun Shanaka (captain), Pathum Nissanka, Avishka Fernando, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Kusal Mendis, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Charith Asalanka, Dhananjaya de Silva, Wanindu Hasaranga, Ashen Bandara, Maheesh Theekshana, Jeffrey Vandersay, Chamika Karunaratne, Dilshan Madushanka, Kasun Rajitha, Nuwanidu Fernando, Dunith Wellalage, Pramod Madushan, Lahiru Kumara, Nuwan Thushara.

7,"Sajjad, Shahid triumph in national snooker",Punjab qualifier Rana Irfan pulled off the biggest upset of the day when he toppled former world champion Ahsan Ramzan 4-2.,"KARACHI: Veteran Mohammad Sajjad started his title defence on a winning note as former champion Shahid Aftab compiled a splendid break of 140 on the opening day of the NBP 47th National Snooker Championship at the NBP Sports Complex on Wednesday.
With four national titles under his belt, Sargodha-based top seed Sajjad sent former national champion Mohammad Bilal packing 72-44, 56-50, 97-4, 62-34 in his Group ‘A’ opener.
However, Punjab qualifier Rana Irfan pulled off the biggest upset of the day when he toppled second seed and former world champion Ahsan Ramzan 4-2 with the score reading 63-39, 121-0, 39-83, 56-20, 39-78, 58-17 including a century break of 103 in the second frame.
Third seed Babar Masih and fourth seed Haris Tahir were stretched to their limits before overcoming their respective opponents. Babar who was 1-3 down fought back to whip M. Jawed Ansari 41-51, 80-43, 0-81, 32-98, 98-13, 71-35, 106-8 while Haris trounced Zaib Khan 109-8, 30-64, 40-63, 62-52, 98-47, 33-70, 68-15.
The day witnessed three century breaks with fifth seed Shahid hogging limelight cracking the highest break in the third frame registering 79-14, 81-8, 140-0, 58-26 triumph against Fawad Khan. He was unlucky in piling up 147 as he missed the black ball.

United’s Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial stepped out from the Ronaldo’s shadow to score in their dominant victory but manager Erik ten Hag is still targeting a striker to replace the Portuguese in the transfer market to make the Red Devils more clinical in the final third.Rashford has been a player transformed under Ten Hag and carried his fine form for England at the World Cup into the Premier League’s return.
“Our players performed really well in the World Cup, I was happy to see that and now they continue,” Ten Hag told Amazon Prime.  “They have to stay on that level, keep going and progress from game to game.”
A brilliantly worked corner opened the floodgates for United as Christian Eriksen picked out an unmarked Rashford inside the area to sweep into the top corner while  Martial converted Rashford’s pass to add another quickfire goal. 
Forest were without their first choice goalkeeper Dean Henderson as he is on loan from United and his understudy Wayne Hennessey was culpable when the home side doubled their lead just three minutes later.
United were also short handed at the back with Lisandro Martinez absent following Argentina’s World Cup celebrations, Diogo Dalot injured and Harry Maguire still feeling the aftereffects of an illness.
As a result Raphael Varane was forced into starting just nine days after playing 113 minutes for France in the World Cup final, while Luke Shaw lined up as a centre-back in a back four for the first time.
The home side should have added more than one goal in the second half, leading Ten Hag to repeat his call for a new striker.
United appear to have already missed out on one target with Cody Gakpo set to join rivals Liverpool from PSV Eindhoven.
“We are looking for a striker because games are coming every three days,” added Ten Hag.  “It’s tough and we want to play in all the leagues. Hopefully we can keep going till the end of the season, so we need numbers in the squad.”United finally got the third goal they deserved three minutes from time. The imperious Casemiro strode forward to win possession and picked out his Brazilian compatriot Fred to slot into the far corner.
Victory takes United to within one point of the top four and with a game in hand to come on fourth-placed Tottenham.
Forest remain rooted in the relegation zone, but just one point adrift of safety.
Meanwhile, Kai Havertz and Mason Mount both netted in the first half of a  dominant performance but the hosts will feel they could have won by a  bigger margin given the possession they enjoyed and chances they  created.
Chelsea ended a run of five league matches without a victory and moved up one place in the league standings to eighth.
Bournemouth have now lost four of their past five league games and remain in 14th place on 16 points.
Havertz  had Chelsea ahead after 16 minutes at the end of a swift move through  the middle, started by Jorginho, helped on by Mount and then with Raheem  Sterling delivering a perfect cross to the back post for the German to  stretch into the net.
The quick movement of the ball was  characteristic of the home side’s approach as they overwhelmed  Bournemouth in all departments.
Chelsea extended their lead in the  23rd minute at the end of another storming forward drive, with several  players involved before Havertz laid it back for Mount to hit a  right-footed curler into the net from outside the penalty area.
Chelsea,  with seven players from the World Cup in their starting line-up, had  Reece James back after the knee injury that made him miss out on the  tournament in Qatar and the England right back wasted no time in  reminding of his qualities.
But he had to go off early in the second half, visibly upset as he looked to suffer fresh knee trouble.
Bournemouth,  whose manager Gary ONeil was marking his first league match in charge  since being handed the job on a permanent basis, took almost an hour  before testing Kepa Arrizabalaga with substitute Jaidon Anthony’s shot  easily saved by the Chelsea goalkeeper.
The Spaniard made a much more vital stop in the 78th minute to deny midfielder Ryan Christie.
Bournemouth did finish lively, looking dangerous in the final 10 minutes  and might have got a consolation goal as former Chelsea player Dominic  Solanke missed with a close range header in stoppage time.

9,Japan coach Moriyasu staying on post World Cup,TOKYO: Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu will stay in his job after leading the Samurai Blue to the last-16 at the World...,"TOKYO: Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu will stay in his job after leading the Samurai Blue to the last-16 at the World Cup in Qatar, the Japan Football Association said Wednesday.
There had been speculation about his future after a rollercoaster performance by Japan, who again failed to reach the quarter-finals but produced stunning wins against Germany and Spain.
“This is really the happiest job”, Moriyasu said of his reappointment.
“It’s a job that gives me a chance to compete on a global stage with the pride of being Japanese. That’s why I decided to accept the offer”, he said.
It was the fourth time Japan had exited at the first knock-out stage and denied them a much-coveted quarter-final debut in their seventh straight World Cup appearance.
Moriyasu becomes the first Japan coach to stay on after a World Cup.
The 54-year-old’s new contract will run  “until the next World Cup”, said Japan Football Association head Kozo Tajima, who lauded Moriyasu for  “elevating the international status of Japan’s football”.
After the heartbreak of their exit in Qatar, Moriyasu insisted Japan are on the right path.
“We weren’t able to overcome this hurdle of losing in the last 16 and you might say that we didn’t achieve anything new,” he said.
“But the players have shown us something that we haven’t seen before by beating former champions like Germany and Spain.”

SYDNEY: Nick Kyrgios’s late withdrawal from the inaugural edition of the United Cup took his own team mates by surprise on Wednesday as they were left in the dark until minutes before their pre-tournament news conference.
Kyrgios, who is ranked 22nd in the world and reached this year’s Wimbledon final, was set to lead Australia in the joint ATP and WTA event, which is being held in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth and offers ranking points and $15 million in prize-money.
Organisers said the 27-year-old, who was due to face Britain’s Cameron Norrie in his first singles match on Thursday in Group ‘D’, withdrew due to injury.
“We literally just found out 10 minutes ago. Obviously it’s news to all of us and we just move forward now,” co-captain Sam Stosur told reporters.
Kyrgios, who opted out of Australia’s Davis Cup team this year, later posted a video on Instagram where he was seen out in the sunshine at a harbour with the caption ‘Beautiful day’.
Alex de Minaur, who will now move into the number one men’s position for Team Australia, wanted to avoid discussing Kyrgios and focus on the upcoming event.
“I think it would be great if we just talk about this great team,” he said.  “We are all here, we are all happy to be here, we are about to play an exciting new event, something new for all of us — the United Cup.”  Australia will also play Rafa Nadal’s Spain in Group ‘D’.
Speaking before Kyrgios pulled out of the United Cup, Nadal said the Australian could easily go all the way.
“I know he doesn’t like a lot to play Roland Garros, that’s the only  tournament that looks like he doesn’t like to play that much,” said  Nadal in Sydney.
“The rest of the tournaments, he played final in  Wimbledon, in New York he was close with the quarter-finals I think,  with a very positive chance.“He can win in any tournament that  he’s playing. He has all the talent, the weapons to win against any  player. Of course he can.” 
The tournament, which runs from Dec 29-Jan 8, features 18 countries split into six groups of three, with teams playing two men’s and two women’s singles matches and a mixed doubles match.

12,Andoo Comanche returns to victory in Sydney-Hobart yacht race,"SYDNEY: Andoo Coma­nche beat LawConnect in the Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race on Wednesday, a return to victory...","SYDNEY: Andoo Coma­nche beat LawConnect in the Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race on Wednesday, a return to victory after a race which narrowed down to two 100-footers in the final stretch. 
Andoo Comanche crossed the Derwent River finish line about 1 a.m. local time (1400 GMT), taking one day, 11 hours, 56 minutes and 48 seconds to complete the 628-nautical mile bluewater classic, according to the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia. 
The win was the fourth for the supermaxi yacht, after wins in 2015, 2017 and 2019 under different ownership and the name Comanche. It was the second year in a row that LawConnect placed second. 
“It feels pretty unbelievable at the moment, it’s still sinking in,” Andoo Comanche skipper John Winning Jr told reporters in Hobart, Tasmania. 
“It was less than an hour ago we were sort of still thinking, are we about to have a shutdown, what’s gonna happen, it didn’t feel real until the last minute and then now it’s just starting to settle in,” added Winning, greeted at the finish line by his father, who competed in the race in the 1970s. 
Andoo Comanche set the pace down Australia’s east coast from the start but LawConnect put up a strong challenge, according to race commentators, and crossed the finish line just 24 minutes behind the winner. 
Black Jack, the winner of the 2021 race, came in third, followed by Wild Oats, which fell behind after tearing one of its sails earlier in the race. The 109-strong racing fleet set off from a sun-splashed Sydney Harbour on Monday afternoon, charting their way through the 628-nautical mile course (1163km) towards the finish line in Hobart. 
The Bass Strait, which separates Tasmania from the mainland, can unleash perilous conditions. Race officials on Tuesday evening said only three of the starting fleet had been forced to retire so far. 
One of them, 40-foot yacht Yeah Baby, withdrew less than four hours into the race after reportedly colliding with a massive sunfish. 
Dozens of smaller yachts were still in the water on Wednesday morning, competing for the handicap prize, which compensates for boat size.

13,Missed chances cost Pakistan as Williamson ton sees New Zealand gain lead,"“Since days one and two, the pitch is probably at its best,” says New Zealand opener Tom Latham.","KARACHI: Pakistan were let down by missed opportunities and New Zealand ensured they took advantage. The hosts’ wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed was in the midst of it all as he erred not once, but twice in attempts to stump Kane Williamson out.
The veteran batter went on to score his first hundred in two years as New Zealand overcame Pakistan’s mammoth first-innings total of 438 with ease on the third day of the opening Test here at the National Stadium on Wednesday.
Pakistan did strike in the closing minutes to expose New Zealand’s tail and the Tim Southee-led side will look to add on to a tiny two-run lead with four wickets in hand on the penultimate day. But with the playing surface deteriorating fast, it wouldn’t be too easy for the visitors.
“Since days one and two, the pitch is probably at its best,” New Zealand opener Tom Latham said during the post-day press conference. 
“It is starting to take little bit more turn and especially out of footmarks. So it’s not going to get any easier to bat on, and from the position we are in, we will try to get as many runs as possible to put Pakistan under pressure.”
Williamson, who was conservative in his approach after Pakistan had struck in the first session to dismiss opener Devon Conway, took 47 balls to score his first boundary. On the next ball, he was ruled out lbw off leg-spinner Mohammad Abrar before challenging the field umpire’s decision to get it reversed.
The right-hander got his first reprieve at 15, when he missed a flick and the ball beat Sarfraz behind the stumps with Williamson well out of the crease. 
Sarfraz missed out again, this time on an easier chance, with Williamson on 21, as the wicket-keeper failed to dislodge the stumps after the former New Zealand skipper lost his balance in an attempt to play a drive off Nauman Ali.
Now more comfortable on the crease, Williamson danced down the track to smash one over the left-arm spinner’s head to get his second boundary. He then took on both Abrar and Nauman for five more boundaries to reach his 34th Test fifty.
Pakistan had an economic few overs before tea, but Williamson continued his onslaught on the hosts’ spinners after the break and soon reached his 25th hundred — his first ton since January 2021.
The 32-year-old was ably supported by a 47-ball 42 by Daryl Mitchell after New Zealand had lost Latham — after the left-hander had scored a hundred and Henry Nicholls, who played on Nauman onto his stumps to get dismissed at 22.
Mitchell started off with a four and six in the first six deliveries that he faced and dispatched Pakistan pacer Mohammad Wasim for four consecutive boundaries four overs later before a reverse sweep off Abrar ended his innings and his quickfire 65-run fourth-wicket partnership with Williamson.
It was then Tom Blundell’s turn to fortify New Zealand’s position. The wicket-keeper batter demonstrated balance between attack and defense and used his feet with precision to score boundaries. 
By the time he ended his stay on the crease, he had faced 116 balls for his 47, an innings that was studded with three fours and a six. With Williamson, he added 90 runs to New Zealand’s total before Wasim trapped him lbw.
After Blundell’s departure, Pakistan got their sixth and last wicket of the day when tailender Michael Bracewell was caught after getting a leading edge off Abrar.
“I think they were chances but one of the deliveries was on the leg side and Sarfraz did his best,” Nauman said of the missed chances.
“This pitch is on the slow side so our effort will be to get the last four wickets early on day four and then set a good target of close to 200 — which will be good on this pitch.”
Williamson wasn’t the only New Zealand batter to benefit from Pakistan’s errors. Conway, too, could have been out on Tuesday had Pakistan taken a review when the left-hander was ruled not out by the field umpire despite getting caught behind off spinner Nauman. He managed 92.
Conway’s partner Latham, on the other hand, added 18 to his overnight tally to reach what was nearly a flawless hundred. Both openers, however, couldn’t extend their stays on the crease for long after reaching their hundreds.
Their 183-run partnership was broken when Conway was trapped leg-before by Nauman with a delivery that spun sharply to thump into the batters pads. Conway’s dismissal had to be confirmed through a DRS review.
Latham, who had showed sound technique throughout his innings, brought his knock to an end with a miscued reverse sweep off Abrar to get caught in the slips at 113.
Both openers were dismissed before lunch with Sarfraz designated as the Pakistan captain in the absence of Babar Azam, who was off the field due to flu along with Shan Masood and Salman Ali Agha. The skipper, however, returned on the field later in the day.
