On the other hand, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has said its Punjab parliamentary party would meet on Jan 2 to decide whether CM Chaudhry Parvez Elahi should take a vote of confidence before Jan 11 — the date when the Lahore High Court is due to hold its next hearing on the Punjab government’s plea against the governor’s ‘unconstitutional’ order to remove the chief minister and his cabinet.
“The Punjab PTI’s parliamentary party is meeting in Lahore on Jan 2 to decide the date when CM Elahi should take a vote of confidence from the provincial assembly,” Fawad Chaudhry, a party leader, told Dawn on Wednesday. 
In reply to a question whether the chief minister would go for a trust vote after the court’s hearing on Jan 11, the former information minister said: “The chief minister has to take a vote of confidence before or after Jan 11 (as per legal requirement). So we will go for it and the chief minister will manage to secure the required 186 votes.” 

Baligh asks MPAs to ‘brace for run-off election’

During the meeting with Balighur Rehman on Wednesday, some 15 PML-N lawmakers were of the unanimous opinion that the governor’s constitutional order asking the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence was justified. 
“The governor told the lawmakers to brace for a run-off election as the chief minister won’t be able to take the vote of confidence,” a participant of the meeting told Dawn.  
He said the PML-N camp was “very excited” about its prospects of forming a government in Punjab. He claimed that “some PTI MPAs” were in touch with the PML-N and the ruling Punjab coalition should be ready for a surprise when the chief minister went for a vote of confidence. 
The PTI is believed to be keeping an eye on “some Jahangir Tareen and Aleem Khan sympathisers” among its MPAs. There are reports that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has spoken to both leaders in this regard. 
As PTI chairman Imran Khan reportedly wants the chief minister to take the trust vote before Jan 11, some lawmakers of the provincial ruling coalition have suggested it should first wait till the LHC verdict on the question whether the governor’s order to summon a session during an ongoing session as well as denotifying the chief minister was valid or not. 
Although PM Sharif recently hinted at moving the Supreme Court against the restoration of Mr Elahi as chief minister by the LHC, he has yet to take a decision. 
Last week, the LHC had suspended the governor’s order  denotifying the chief minister and restored Mr Elahi as chief minister on an assurance that the assembly would  not be dissolved, at least until the next date of hearing (Jan 11).   
Moonis Elahi. a PML-Q leader who has been in touch  with Imran Khan over the coalition’s affairs, asserted on Wednesday that the PML-N would face yet another humiliation in the Punjab Assembly as the chief minister would be able to secure the vote of confidence.

1,"Russia steps up mortar artillery attacks on Kherson, eastern Ukraine",Kyiv claims 33 missiles fired at civilian targets in 24 hours,"KYIV: Russian forces stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on the recently liberated city of Kherson in southern Ukraine on Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said, while also exerting constant pressure along front lines in eastern regions of the country.
Russia fired 33 missiles from multiple rocket launchers at civilian targets in Kherson in the 24 hours to early Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said in its morning report. Russia denies targeting civilians.
Heavy fighting also persisted around the Ukrainian-held city of Bakhmut, now largely in ruins, in the eastern province of Donetsk, and to its north, around the cities of Svatove and Kreminna in Luhansk province, where Ukrainian forces are trying to break Russian defensive lines.

Kyiv claims 33 missiles fired at civilian targets in 24 hours

Air raid sirens also sounded across Ukraine on Wednesday morning, officials said. Ukrainian social media reports said the nationwide alert may have been declared after Russian jets stationed in neighbouring Belarus took off. Reuters was unable to immediately verify that information.
Britain’s defence ministry said in its latest update on the military situation in Ukraine that Russia had likely reinforced the Kreminna section of the frontline as it is logistically important to Moscow and has become relatively vulnerable following recent Ukrainian advances further west.
There is still no prospect of talks to end the war, now in its 11th month.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is vigorously pushing a 10-point peace plan that envisages Russia fully respecting Ukraine’s territorial integrity and pulling out all its troops.
But the Kremlin on Wednesday rejected the plan, reiterating its stance that Ukraine must accept Russia’s annexation — announced in September after “referendums” rejected by Kyiv and the West -- of four Ukrainian regions: Luhansk and Donetsk in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south.
“There can be no peace plan for Ukraine that does not take into account today’s realities regarding Russian territory, with the entry of four regions into Russia,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
“Plans that do not take these realities into account cannot be peaceful.” Russian forces abandoned Kherson city last month in one of Ukraine’s most significant gains of the war. Kherson region, located at the mouth of the mighty Dnipro River and serving as gateway to Russian-annexed Crimea, is strategically important.
The joy of Kherson residents over the city’s liberation has quickly given way to fear amid relentless Russian shelling from the east bank of the Dnipro, and many have since fled.
Russian forces shelled the maternity wing of a hospital in Kherson, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, Zelenskiy’s deputy chief of staff, claimed on Telegram. No one was hurt and the staff and patients had been moved to a shelter, he added.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the report.

3,Travellers from China to face Covid restrictions in several states,"BEIJING: Beijing’s sudden pivot away from containing coronavirus has caused jitters across the world, with the...","BEIJING: Beijing’s sudden pivot away from containing coronavirus has caused jitters across the world, with the United States saying it may restrict travel from China and Italy, India, Japan and several other countries making Covid screening mandatory for all travellers from China.
Several countries have expressed concerns about the potential for new variants to emerge as China battles the world’s biggest surge in infections. 
US officials said they were considering Covid entry restrictions on travellers from China, after countries including India, Japan, Malaysia and Italy introduced Covid testing on arrival for Chinese passengers.
China’s loosening of measures effectively brought the curtain down on a zero-Covid regime of mass testing, lockdowns and long quarantines that has stalled its economy and triggered large-scale nationwide protests.
“Currently the development of China’s epidemic situation is overall predictable and under control,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday.
“Hyping, smearing and political manipulation with ulterior motives can’t stand the test of facts,” Wang added, calling Western media reporting on China’s Covid surge “completely biased”.

5,UNSC asks Taliban to drop restrictions on women,"UNITED NATIONS: Stepping up the pressure on the Afghan Taliban, the UN Security Council has called for the full,...","UNITED NATIONS: Stepping up the pressure on the Afghan Taliban, the UN Security Council has called for the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls in Afghanistan, denouncing a ban on women attending universities or working for humanitarian aid groups.
“The members of the Security Council are deeply alarmed by reports that the Taliban have suspended access to universities for women and girls, and reiterated their deep concern of the suspension of school beyond the sixth grade...,” the 15-member body said in a unanimously agreed statement.
The council urged the Taliban “to reopen schools and swiftly reverse these policies and practices, which represent an increasing erosion for the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms.” 
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres echoed the Security Council’s message, calling the latest restrictions on women and girls “unjustifiable human rights violations” that “must be revoked”. 
Meanwhile, Shariah justice has returned to Afghan courts. 
While hundreds of millions of dollars were spent building a new judicial system after the Taliban were overthrown in 2001 — a combination of Islamic and secular law, with qualified prosecutors, defence lawyers and judges bringing more gender balance to family courts — all that has been scrapped by the Taliban, with trials, sentences and punishments now overseen by all-male clerics.
