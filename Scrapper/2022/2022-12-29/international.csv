0,Yellow-band disease ravages Thai coral reefs,"BAN SAMAESAN: Under­neath the calm turquoise waters off eastern Thailand, a rapidly spreading disease is killing...","BAN SAMAESAN: Under­neath the calm turquoise waters off eastern Thailand, a rapidly spreading disease is killing corals over vast stretches of the sea floor, and scientists fear it may be getting worse because of climate change.
Yellow-band disease — named for the colour it turns corals before destroying them — was first spotted decades ago and has caused widespread damage to reefs in the Caribbean. There is no known cure.
But it was detected for the first time off Thailand’s eastern coast just last year, near the popular tourist city of Pattaya, and has already spread over roughly 600 acres (240 hectares) of the sea.
“I haven’t seen anything like this before,” said marine scientist Lalita Putchim, of Thailand’s Department of Marine and Coastal Resources.
“Everywhere we went we saw it, and we expect to see more of it as we go.” Scientists believe overfishing, pollution and rising water temperatures because of climate change may be making the reefs more vulnerable to yellow-band disease.
The disease’s impact cannot be reversed, unlike the effects of coral bleaching.
“When the coral is infected with this disease, it just dies,” Lalita said.
The loss of corals could have a devastating impact on the ecosystem — the reef is  “like a forest”, sustaining massive amounts of life, and its death could eventually impact humans too, she added.
Thai scientists are hoping their investigation into this outbreak will help find a way to stop or cure yellow-band disease.
On one research trip near Samaesan island in Chonburi district, Lalita and her team donned diving gear on a boat before heading underwater. They photographed infected corals, taking measurements and photographs while harvesting samples to study later.
Thai marine authorities are using social media to track reports of infected reefs, and have also asked the public to report any sightings of affected corals.
Thai researchers have also been aided by local volunteers, as well as business owner Thanapon Chaivanichakul, who collected underwater photographic evidence.
“I was shocked when I first saw it,” Thanapon said, using a series of expletives to describe the disease. The disease is also a threat to the livelihoods of many in the area.
Choopan Sudjai, the owner of a sightseeing boat, relies on the income from tourists who come to see the area’s natural beauty — especially the coral reefs.
“Now that the coral has been infected and will be destroyed, what will we do in five years?” said the 55-year-old. “It feels as if our own home has been destroyed.”

1,Netanyahu vows to expand settlements,JERUSALEM: Israeli Pri­me Minister-designate Ben­jamin Netanyahu will pursue a policy of increased settlement...,"JERUSALEM: Israeli Pri­me Minister-designate Ben­jamin Netanyahu will pursue a policy of increased settlement expansion in the West Bank, his Likud party said on Wednesday, as he prepared to unveil his new cabinet.
Following his November 1 election win, veteran hawk Netanyahu secured a mandate to form a government backed by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and an extreme-right bloc.
The incoming government has sparked fears of a military escalation in the West Bank amid the worst violence in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory for nearly 20 years.
“The Jewish people have an exclusive and inalienable right to all parts of the Land of Israel,” a statement of policy priorities released by his right-wing Likud party said.
“The government will enc­o­urage and develop settlement in all parts of the Land of Israel - in the Galilee, the Negev, the Golan, in Judea and Samaria,” it added, using the biblical names for the West Bank. The statement also referred to demands by Netanyahu’s far-right allies to give security forces greater leeway in the use of force in the occupied West Bank.
“The government will strive to strengthen security forces and support fighters and police to combat and defeat terrorism,” the statement said. The statement came as Netanyahu unveiled the appointment of former general Yoav Galant as defence minister.
Galant, a member of Likud and a close Netanyahu ally, was given the key portfolio a day before the cabinet is expected to be sworn in before parliament.
A former commander of the southern region of Israel, Galant has also served in several ministerial posts in Netanyahu’s previous cabinets. Born in 1958 to Polish holocaust survivors, Galant had a long career in the army, reaching the rank of general in 2002, and becoming military attache to former prime minister Ariel Sharon.
He would later be appo­inted commander-in-chief of the southern military region, serving at the time of Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from the Palestinian enclave of Gaza in the summer of 2005.
Bezalel Smotrich, leader of the extreme-right formation Religious Zionism, is to be the minister with control over civil affairs in the West Bank — a responsibility usually falling to the defence minister.
Netanyahu also annou­nced his intention to elect a new speaker of parliament on Thursday, Amir Ohana who, in 2019, was the first openly gay lawmaker to take up a ministerial post in Israel.

2,Bangladesh opens its first metro line in traffic-choked capital,Local researchers say the capital’s economy loses upwards of $3 billion each year in lost work time due to traffic jams.,"DHAKA: Bangladesh’s sprawling capital inaugurated its first ever metro rail line on Wednesday as authorities work to ease congestion that has throttled growth and inflamed tempers in the gridlocked metropolis.
Dhaka is one of the world’s most densely populated cities, and daily commutes along its car-clogged roads are a source of constant frustration for its 22 million people.
Local researchers say the capital’s economy loses upwards of $3 billion each year in lost work time due to traffic jams, often worsened by regular street protests and monsoonal downpours.
The new elevated train network has been in development for nearly a decade and is slated to grow to over a hundred stations and six lines criss-crossing the city by 2030.
Wednesday saw the start of operations on a section of the first line connecting a neighbourhood on Dhaka’s periphery with the city centre, built with a $2.8 billion price tag and largely funded by Japanese development funds.
“This metro rail is also another matter of pride for us,” said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at a ceremony to mark the first service.
“We promised to eradicate traffic jams from Dhaka,” she added.  “With the six metro rail lines, we will be able to do so.” The line is expected to carry 60,000 people each hour when it is fully operational and its opening has been keenly anticipated by commuters.
“We are counting on it. It will reduce public suffering,” Mostafizur Rahman, who spends nearly three hours riding a bus to work each morning, said. 
Hasina used the opening ceremony to commemorate six Japanese rail engineers working on the project who were killed during an attack on a Dhaka cafe by Islamist extremists in 2016.
Once in full service, MRT Line-6 will carry around 4.83 lakh people every day between Uttara and Motijheel. The trip will take 38 minutes, which takes at least two hours on other modes of transport.
The MRT Line-6 project was given the go-ahead in 2012 with a June 2024 deadline and a cost of Tk 21,985 crore. But the authorities went for early commissioning of the Uttara- Agargaon section considering public convenience.
The project was revised this year to extend the line to Kamalapur from Motijheel, and to procure land for some stations. The project cost went up to Tk 33,472 crore and the new deadline was set at 2025. Japan is providing about 60 per cent of the cost as soft loan.

3,US court keeps Covid border policy to block migrants,"“We are advancing our preparations to manage the border in a secure, orderly, and humane way,” says White House spokeswoman.","WASHINGTON: The US government’s two-year-old policy of invoking Covid-19 precautions to turn away hundreds of thousands of migrants at the Mexican border will remain in place for now, the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday.
The decision to uphold the controversial rule known as Title 42 delayed a looming political crisis for President Joe Biden, as thousands waited at the southern border in expectation the policy was about to end.
But the conservative-dominated high court accepted a petition from 19 states warning of a surge of migrants should the policy introduced under former president Donald Trump in March 2020 be lifted as ordered by a lower court.
The Supreme Court said Title 42 — which allows the swift expulsion even of people who might qualify for asylum — would remain in place pending its ruling on the issue, and that it would hear the case in February.
“The states contend that they face an immigration crisis at the border and policymakers have failed to agree on adequate measures to address it,” the court said in its 5-4 ruling. 
“The only means left to mitigate the crisis, the states suggest, is an order from this Court directing the federal government to continue its Covid-era Title 42 policies as long as possible.” 
The ruling could give the Biden administration, which had conceded that Title 42 was wrong and prepared for a surge of asylum-seeking migrants, until May or June before a final decision.
Departing the White House for vacation on Tuesday night, Biden told reporters that ending Title 42 was  “overdue,” but the administration would heed the court’s decision until a final ruling is made, likely in June. “In the meantime, we have to enforce it,” Biden said.
White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier in the day the administration would prepare for the next hearing. “We are advancing our preparations to manage the border in a secure, orderly, and humane way when Title 42 eventually lifts,” Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
“Title 42 is a public health measure, not an immigration enforcement measure, and it should not be extended indefinitely.”  “To truly fix our broken immigration system, we need Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform,” she said.
Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy said that removing Title 42  “would have made our border crisis worse, and the White House seemed willing to let that happen.”  “Glad to see the Supreme Court step in to preserve it, but we need a permanent solution,” he said on Twitter. 
While the government had prepared for the end of Title 42 with more staffing and more fencing along the border, it was not clear how it would have stemmed an expected surge. Some 2.5 million people were intercepted while trying to cross the southern US border in the 12 months through November.
While two years ago most of the migrants were from Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, now more than half come from much further away — from Nicaragua, Venezuela, Cuba, Eastern Europe and Asia.
Ballooning migrant numbers at the border pose an increasing political headache for Biden and his Democratic Party, whom the Republicans have repeatedly sought to paint as soft on illegal immigration.
Critics have branded Title 42  “inhumane.”  “As a Covid control strategy, a humanitarian policy, and a border policy, Title 42 has not only failed but caused irreparable harm on a massive scale,” said Karla Marisol Vargas, senior attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project, in a statement.

All measures would be cancelled on Thursday, apart from the wearing of masks which still remains compulsory, Lee told a media briefing on Wednesday.
“The city has reached a relatively high vaccination rate which builds an anti-epidemic barrier,” Lee said.
“Hong Kong has a sufficient amount of medicine to fight Covid, and healthcare workers have gained rich experience in facing the pandemic,” he added.

5,100 days of protests: Iranian govt challenged by push for change,"""The regime has been unable to quell the popular unrest, and  there is no turning back,” says IHR director","PARIS: More than 100 days of protests in Iran have shattered taboos and shaken the ideological pillars of the Islamic republic in a push for change that has defied a fierce crackdown.
The demonstrations, which erupted in mid-September following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, 22, are a reflection of pent-up public anger over economic shortcomings and social restrictions, analysts say.
While there have been protests in Iran before, this movement has been unprecedented due to its duration, spread across provinces, social classes and ethnic groups and its readiness to openly call for the end of the clerical regime.
Banners of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have been set ablaze, women have openly walked down streets without hijab headscarves, and demonstrators have at times clashed with the security forces.
Iran, for its part, accuses hostile foreign powers of stoking the  “riots”, chiefly its arch-foe the United States but also other Western nations such as Britain and France as well as exiled opposition groups.
In an intensification of the state crackdown, the Islamic republic this month executed two people in connection with the protests, drawing international rebuke and new sanctions.
Iran’s prosecutor general said in early December that the morality police, which arrested Amini in Tehran for an alleged breach of the strict dress code for women, had been abolished.
But activists received the declaration with scepticism, given the continued legal obligation for women to wear a headscarf. 
This was not any  “actual change” and women are still  “punished in other ways”, said Shadi Sadr, founder of the London-based Justice for Iran group. And it has not changed the movement’s key demand. “The protesters want the Islamic republic to go away,” she said.
While protests may have decreased in frequency and size in recent weeks, Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights (IHR) said they still take place  “every day across the country”.
The regime has been unable to quell the popular unrest, and  “there is no turning back,” IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said.
The Islamic republic has ruled Iran, first under revolutionary founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and then his successor Khamenei, since ousting the more West-leaning and secular shah in 1979.
It swiftly imposed policies including Islamic sharia law and compulsory headscarves for women in public.
Rights groups accuse the regime of committing gross human rights abuses ever since, including extra-judicial killings and abductions abroad, and holding foreign nationals hostage at home. It now carries out more executions than any country other than China, according to Amnesty International. IHR says the country has executed more than 500 people this year alone.
Iran remains at odds with Western powers over its nuclear programme, and has also spread its influence throughout the Middle East, notably through Shiite allies in Lebanon and Iraq. Iran has been an active participant in the civil war in Syria and backs rebels in Yemen.
International condemnation of the crackdown and waves of Western sanctions have buried any expectation of quickly reviving the 2015 deal on the Iranian nuclear programme that the United States walked out of in 2018.

6,Human hair recycled in Belgium to protect environment,The Hair Recycle project feeds locks and tresses into a machine that turns them into matted squares.,"BRUSSELS: Hairdressers across Belgium are sweeping up and bagging hair clipped from their customers, and then handing it over to an NGO that recycles it to protect the environment.
The Hair Recycle project feeds locks and tresses into a machine that turns them into matted squares that can be used to absorb oil and other hydrocarbons polluting the environment, or made into bio-composite bags.
Project Co-founder Patrick Janssen, explaining that 1 kilogram (2.2 lbs) of hair can absorb 7-8 litres (1.8-2.1 US gallons) of oil and hydrocarbons, said the mats can be placed in drains to soak up pollution in water before it reaches a river.
“Our products are all the more ethical as they are manufactured locally ... they are not imported from the other side of the planet,” he said.  “They are made here to deal with local problems.”  The project said on its website that hair has powerful properties: one strand can support up to 10 million times its own weight, and as well as absorbing fat and hydrocarbons, it is water-soluble and highly elastic due to its keratin fibres.
Isabelle Voulkidis, manager of the Helyode salon in Brussels, is one of dozens of hairdresser across the country that pay a small fee to the project to collect their hair cuttings.
“What motivates me, personally, is that I find it a shame hair is nowadays just thrown in the bin, when I know that so much could be done with it,” she said, as she combed and clipped one of her customer’s hair.

7,Tunisia to try 13 judges on ‘terror’ charges,"The accused judges are to appear before the Supreme Judicial Council on January 24, official says.","TUNIS: Tunisian prosecutors asked the top judicial body to strip 13 judges of immunity so they can be tried on terror charges, their lawyer said on Wednesday, describing the case as  “purely political”.
The move comes nearly seven months after President Kais Saied sacked 57 judges, accusing them of corruption and blocking inquiries into two left-wing political figures in 2013, among other purported transgressions.
Defence lawyer Ayachi Hammami said the 13 were among 49 judges reinstated in August. But the justice ministry has been investigating his 13 clients for  “terrorist crimes mentioned in security reports,” he added. “This case is purely political,” Hammami said.
The accused judges are to appear before the Supreme Judicial Council (CSM) on January 24, he said.
Saied staged a dramatic power grab in July 2021, sacking the government, suspending parliament and rocking the foundations of the only democracy to have emerged from the Arab Spring uprisings. In February he dissolved a previous top judicial body, replacing it with the CSM whose members the president picks — and can sack without appeal.
In June he issued a decree tightening his control over the CSM, a day before he suspended the 57 judges.
Rights groups Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International had slammed the suspensions as  “a direct attack on the rule of law”, and Tunisian lawyers went on strike for a month in response.

8,"Turkish, Syrian, Russian defence ministers meet for first talks since 2011","MOSCOW: The defence ministers of Russia, Turkiye and Syria met in Moscow on Wednesday, the first such talks since a...","MOSCOW: The defence ministers of Russia, Turkiye and Syria met in Moscow on Wednesday, the first such talks since a war broke out in Syria, the Russian defence ministry said. 
It was also the first meeting between Turkish and Syrian defence ministers since the start of the war in 2011. 
Russia and Turkiye are involved in Syria, with Moscow supporting the Damascus regime against its opponents, and Ankara backing rebels. 
The meeting came as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to launch a military offensive in northern Syria against Kurdish groups. 
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and his Turkish and Syrian counterparts, Hulusi Akar and Ali Mahmoud Abbas, discussed “ways to resolve the Syrian crisis, the problem of refugees, and joint efforts to combat extremist groups in Syria”, said the Russian defence ministry. 
The sides “noted the constructive nature of the dialogue held in this format and the need to continue it in the interests of further stabilising the situation” in Syria and the region, the defence ministry in Moscow said. 
The Turkish defence ministry struck a similar note, saying the meeting was held in a “constructive atmosphere”. 
“At the meeting, the Syrian crisis, the refugee problem and joint efforts to combat all terrorist organisations in Syria were discussed,” the ministry said in a statement. 
On Saturday, Akar told reporters that Turkiye was in talks with Russia about using Syrian airspace in a possible operation against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia. 
“We are holding discussions with the Russians about the opening of the airspace” in Syria, he said.  The Turkish and Syrian foreign ministers had a brief informal exchange on the sidelines of a regional summit last year and Ankara had acknowledged contacts between intelligence services of the two countries. 
Last month, Erdogan said a meeting with Syrian leader Bashar al Assad was a possibility, after cutting diplomatic ties with Damascus throughout the 11-year conflict. 
In mid-December, he indicated that he could meet Assad after the two countries’ defence and foreign ministers meet.

9,Uzbekistan sees Indian syrup behind 18 deaths,"NEW DELHI: The Health Ministry of Uzbekistan has said 18 children, with acute respiratory disease, have died from...","NEW DELHI: The Health Ministry of Uzbekistan has said 18 children, with acute respiratory disease, have died from taking excessive doses of an ingredient in cough syrup, Doc-1 Max, manufactured by an Indian firm, The Hindu reported on Wednesday.
The children consumed “excessive amounts” of the cough syrup, which contained ethylene glycol, a substance that ought not to be present in measured quantities in cough syrup. 
This comes days after a parliamentary panel in The Gambia found “unacceptable levels” of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol in cough syrups made by Haryana-based Maiden Pharma. Here, the cough syrups were linked to instance of acute kidney injury, believed to be responsible for the deaths of at least 63 children. 
India’s health ministry officials said they were “aware” of the report from Uzbekistan but declined comment. “To date, 18 out of 21 children with acute respiratory disease have died as a result of taking Doc-1 Max syrup (made by Marion Biotech). It was found that deceased children took 2.5-5 ml of the drug at home for 2-7 days, 3-4 times a day, which exceeds the standard dose of the drug for children. 
All children were given the drug without a doctor’s prescription. Since the main component of the drug is paracetamol, Doc-1 Max syrup was incorrectly used as an anti-cold remedy on the recommendation of the pharmacy sellers and this was the reason for the deterioration of the condition of the patients… preliminary laboratory studies have shown that this series of Doc-1 Max syrup contains ethylene glycol. This substance is toxic and about 1-2 ml/kg of a 95% concentrated solution can cause serious changes in the patient’s health, such as vomiting, fainting, convulsions, cardiovascular problems and acute kidney failure.”
“Tablets and syrups of the drug Doc-1 Max are withdrawn from sale in all pharmacies of the country in a prescribed manner,” reads the translation of the statement from Uzbekistan’s health ministry on Tuesday.
Following the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) warning on October 5, linking four syrups to the deaths in The Gambia, Maiden Pharma’s export licence has been suspended, but India said the WHO has drawn a “premature link” between the deaths of the children and the India-made cough syrups.

10,"Francis says former pope Benedict ‘very sick’, calls for prayers","VATICAN CITY: Former pope Benedict, a hero to conservative Catholics and who in 2013 became the first pontiff in 600...","VATICAN CITY: Former pope Benedict, a hero to conservative Catholics and who in 2013 became the first pontiff in 600 years to step down, is “very sick”, his successor Pope Francis said on Wednesday, asking Church members to pray for him.
Bishops from Europe, the United States and beyond, urged the faithful to keep Benedict in their thoughts, after the Vatican followed Pope Francis’s announcement with a statement saying Benedict had suffered a sudden  “worsening” of his health.
“I would like to ask all of you for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who, in silence, is sustaining the Church,” Francis said in Wednesday’s surprise announcement made at the end of his weekly general audience.
“Let us remember him. He is very sick, asking the Lord to console and sustain him in this witness of love for the Church, until the end,” Francis said, speaking in Italian.
The Vatican statement said Benedict was receiving constant medical attention and his condition was under control.
Francis, who visited the former pontiff after making the announcement, has often praised Benedict, saying it was like having a grandfather at home. But the presence of two men dressed in white in the Vatican has at times been troublesome.
Conservatives have looked to the former pope as their standard bearer and some ultra-traditionalists even refused to acknowledge Francis as a legitimate pontiff.
They have criticised Francis for his more welcoming approach to gays and to Catholics who divorced and remarried outside the Church, saying both were undermining traditional values.
Catholic Church leaders from Germany, Britain, the United States and elsewhere urged the faithful on social media to join prayers for Benedict, who was pope for almost eight years before he retired in 2013.

11,Israeli minister sees possible attack on Iran ‘in two or three years’,Some experts doubt Israel has the military clout to deliver lasting damage to Iranian targets that are distant.,"JERUSALEM: Israel could attack Iranian nuclear sites in two or three years, its defence minister said on Wednesday, in unusually explicit comments about a possible timeline.
With international efforts to renew a 2015 nuclear deal having stalled, the Iranians have ramped up uranium enrichment, a process with civilian uses that can also eventually yield fuel for nuclear bombs — though they deny having any such design.
Experts say Iran could potentially raise the fissile purity of its uranium to weapons-grade in short order. But building a deliverable warhead would take it years, they say — an estimate echoed by an Israeli military intelligence general this month. 
“In two or three years, you may be traversing the skies eastward and taking part in an attack on nuclear sites in Iran,” Defence Minister Benny Gantz told graduating air force cadets in a speech.
For more than a decade, Israel has issued veiled threats to attack its arch-enemy’s nuclear facilities if it deems world powers’ diplomacy with Tehran a dead end. 
However, some experts doubt Israel has the military clout to deliver lasting damage to Iranian targets that are distant, dispersed and well-defended.
The Israeli military intelligence forecast for 2023 is that Iran  “will continue on its current path of slow progress” in the nuclear realm, according to Israel Hayom newspaper on Sunday. “Iran will only change its policies if extreme sanctions are imposed on it; then it could decide to accelerate enrichment to military grade,” said the report.

12,Tension soars as Kosovo shuts main border crossing with Serbia,BELGRADE: Kosovo closed its biggest border crossing with Serbia on Wednesday after Serbs set up more barricades on...,"BELGRADE: Kosovo closed its biggest border crossing with Serbia on Wednesday after Serbs set up more barricades on their side in one of the region’s worst crises in years.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but Belgrade has refused to recognise it and encouraged Kosovo’s 120,000 ethnic Serbs to defy Pristina’s authority — especially in the north where ethnic Serbs make up the majority.
The European Union and the United States urged Kosovo and Serbia to take “immediate” steps to de-escalate tensions.
“We call on everyone to exercise maximum restraint, to take immediate action to unconditionally de-escalate the situation, and to refrain from provocations, threats, or intimidation,” the EU and US said in a joint statement.
On the other hand, Russia voiced support for its ally Serbia and said it was “very closely” following the developments.
“We support Belgrade in all the actions that are being taken,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
He added that “Serbia is a sovereign country and it is fundamentally wrong to look for some kind of destructive influence of Russia here”.
The latest trouble erupted on Dec 10, when ethnic Serbs put up barricades to protest the arrest of an ex-policeman suspected of being involved in attacks against ethnic Albanian police officers — effectively sealing off traffic on two border crossings.
After the roadblocks were erected, Kosovar police and international peacekeepers were attacked in several shooting incidents, while the Serbian armed forces were put on heightened alert this week.
On Tuesday, dozens of demonstrators on the Serbian side of the border used trucks and tractors to halt traffic leading to Merdare, the biggest crossing between the neighbours — a move which forced Kosovo police to close the entry point on Wednesday.
Pristina also asked Nato-led peacekeepers to clear the barricades that were erected on Kosovo soil.
Serbian Defence Minister Milos Vucevic said on Wednesday Belgrade was “ready for a deal”, but did not specify other details.
Northern Kosovo has been on edge since last month when hundreds of ethnic Serb workers in the Kosovo police as well as the judicial branch, including judges and prosecutors, walked off the job.
They were protesting a decision to ban Serbs living in Kosovo from using Belgrade-issued vehicle licence plates — a policy that was eventually scrapped by Pristina.
The mass walkouts created a security vacuum in Kosovo, which Pristina tried to fill by deploying ethnic Albanian police officers in the region. Kosovo’s 1.8 million population is predominantly ethnic Albanian.

13,Co-leader of Michigan governer kidnap plot gets long jail term,WASHINGTON: The co-leader of a far-right militia plot to kidnap and kill Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer was...,"WASHINGTON: The co-leader of a far-right militia plot to kidnap and kill Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer was sentenced to 19 years and seven months in prison on Wednesday, the toughest sentence yet in the case.
Barry Croft, 47, was convicted in August as one of the architects of the 2020 plan to kidnap the Democratic governor in retribution for her Covid-19 quarantine policies — and more broadly in hope of fomenting a civil war.
Croft was the final defendant to learn his fate in the case, after his fellow militia leader, 39-year-old Adam Fox, was sentenced a day earlier to 16 years in prison.
Both were found guilty of kidnapping conspiracy, conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, and other charges, according to a statement from the US Justice Department.
“Croft and others intended to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer from her vacation cottage near Elk Rapids, Michigan, and use the destructive devices to facilitate their plot by harming and hindering the governor’s security detail and any responding law enforcement officers,” the statement said. “They specifically explored placing a bomb under an interstate overpass near a pedestrian boardwalk,” it said.
The plot never got very far as federal law enforcement followed it with the help of multiple informants in the group, whose members dubbed themselves the Wolverine Watchmen. But it underscored the rising threat that armed right-wing militia groups posed around the country, especially during the hotly contested election of 2020.
Several similar militia groups took part in the January 6, 2021 storming of the US Capitol in support of then president Donald Trump’s attempt to retain power after losing the election two months earlier.
The sentence came two weeks after a Michigan state court handed sentences ranging from seven to 12 years to three others who were charged with domestic terrorism over their support for the plot.

14,Jobs for Emiratis — UAE pushes work for own citizens,"“We’ve reached a point where we have a diversity among Emiratis in terms of skill sets and expertise,” says Emirati researcher.","DUBAI: With foreign workers making up the vast bulk of private sector jobs in the United Arab Emirates, the Gulf’s second-largest economy wants to boost opportunities for its own citizens.
The UAE — like other oil-rich Arab Gulf states — has often used the public sector as an employment vehicle for its nationals.
But times are changing, said 34-year-old Emirati researcher Khalifa al-Suwaidi, who has himself been looking for a private sector job since quitting a government post in June.
“We’ve reached a point where we have a diversity among Emiratis in terms of skill sets and expertise,” said Suwaidi. “The public sector can no longer accommodate many of those talents”.
Just 12 per cent of the country’s more than nine million residents are UAE nationals, with over 90pc of private sector jobs taken by foreigners, according to International Labour Organisation figures.
Suwaidi, author of a forthcoming book titled  “UAE after the Arab Spring”, said he believed some employers overlooked his application because they presumed an Emirati would demand the high wages often paid in lucrative government posts.
“The private sector needs to be more accommodating,” he said.  “I’ve been applying for jobs for a while to no avail.”
The government is now strong-arming private firms into hiring local talent, with the aim of ensuring Emiratis make up 10pc of the private sector workforce by 2026.
Next month, firms with more than 50 employees that fail to fill two per cent of their skilled jobs with Emiratis face being fined.
That has sparked a hiring drive, with recruiters noting a  “flood of vacancies” from companies — many of which won’t be able to meet their targets.
“It’s going to be a tough run,” said Hamza Zaouali, the founder of recruitment agency Iris Executives, but noting it was  “not possible” for the UAE government to keep growing and hiring.
“The more sustainable way is to make sure the economy continuously absorbs, trains and works with Emiratis,” Zaouali said. It is part of a wider trend, said Eman Alhussein, a non-resident fellow with the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.
The UAE is joining  “a larger push in the Gulf to change the dynamics of state-society relations” and wean citizens away from government jobs, she said.
“Gulf states want citizens to alter their expectations, give back to the state and accept jobs with longer hours and perhaps reduced income,” Alhussein said. In November, the UAE’s Minister of Human Resources and Emiratisation, Abdulrahman Al Awar, said that more than 14,000 Emiratis had entered the job market in 2022, with an average of 100 finding jobs each day.
The government also announced a salary support scheme that provides Emiratis in the private sector with up to AED 7,000 ($1,900) extra if monthly wages are less than AED 30,000.
There is no national minimum wage for Emiratis, but in Sharjah, one of the country’s seven emirates, they are entitled to a monthly minimum of AED 25,000.
