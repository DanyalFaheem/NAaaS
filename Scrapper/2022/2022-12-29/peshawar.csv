0,PHC orders de-sealing of 3 currency exchange markets,Stops forex trading there until next hearing.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has ordered the de-sealing of three currency exchange markets here and declared the premises won’t be used for forex trading until next hearing into a relevant case on Jan 17.
It also directed owners of those markets to produce two surety bonds each of Rs500,000 and adjourned hearing into the matter.
The Federal Investigation Agency had sealed the Hafeez Market, Faiz Market and Azad Market early this month over the alleged smuggling of US dollars.
Justice Wiqar Ahmad of a single-member bench issued the de-sealing order after hearing petitions of the owners of those markets, including Hafeezur Rehman, Haji Niaz Mohammad and Noor Habib.

Stops forex trading there until next hearing

In almost identical petitions, market owners challenged the sealing of their respective premises and the issuance of notices to them by the FIA under Section 5(5) of the FIA Act.
In the notices, the agency alleged that traders of those markets were damaging the economy by carrying out the illegal businesses of hundi, hawala and black marketing of US dollars.
Advocate Danyal Asad Chamkani appeared for the petitioners and said the FIA had sealed the markets of his clients without having powers to do so.
He said the FIA had issued notices to the petitioners under Section 5(5) of the FIA Act, whereas the said provision did not authorise the sealing of any premises by it.
Referring to that legal provision, the counsel said, “If, in the opinion of a member of the FIA conducting an investigation, any property which was the subject-matter of an investigation was likely to be removed, transferred or otherwise disposed of before an order of the appropriate authority for its seizure is obtained, such member may direct the owner not to remove, transfer or otherwise dispose of such property in any manner except with previous permission of such member.”
He added that the law’s section in question didn’t empower the FIA to seal a property.
The lawyer argued that the petitioners were the owners of their respective markets comprising several shops, which were rented out.
He contended that if the tenants were involved in any illegal business of money exchange, the FIA should act against them individually instead of targeting market owners.
Mr Chamkani pointed out that apart from money exchange dealers there were also shops dealing in other businesses.
Deputy attorney general Sanaullah rejected the arguments of the petitioners’ counsel and stated that several FIRs were registered against different money changers having shops in those markets.
He said another high court bench headed by Justice Roohul Amin Khan heard an identical petition a few days ago, so those cases might also be fixed for hearing by it.
The bench directed the high court’s relevant office to fix petitions before a bench headed by Justice Roohul Amin Khan on Jan 17, the next date of hearing.
It, however, granted interim relief to the petitioners by issuing directives to de-seal their markets.
The FIA recently conducted raids in the Chowk Yadgar area known for forex trading and sealed four markets and plazas having dozens of shops. It claimed that the action was taken to eliminate the black marketing of US dollars and strengthen the rupee.

“The indifferent attitude of the incumbent federal government is a matter of serious concern which is causing multiple issues for the province,” said the chief minister. He said that combating militancy and terrorism was responsibility of the federation.
“Combating militancy and terrorism is responsibility of the federation because all the relevant institutions and agencies fall within jurisdiction of the federal government,” he said. He added that federal government wanted to create financial instability in KP and sabotage peace and development in the province.
The chief minister said that he would not compromise on law and order in the province. He added that provincial government was utilising huge resources to cope with contemporary challenges.
“Maintaining law and order is the first priority of provincial government and a number of initiatives have been taken to this effect during the last four years that have resulted in significant improvement in the overall policing in the province,” he said. He added additional allowances were approved for the employees of Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and other required resources would also be provided to them on war footings.
Mr Khan termed peace vital for development and prosperity of the province. He said that provincial government extended all-out support to police department.
“Maintaining peace and tranquillity is our collective responsibility for which all stakeholders would have to play their role,” said the chief minister. He directed the participants of the meeting to strengthen coordination amongst the relevant departments and agencies.

2,Cement factory challenges ‘super tax’,PHC asks govt for response to petition,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has issued notices to the federal revenue secretary and Federal Board of Revenue seeking their response to the petition of a cement manufacturing company against a ‘super tax’ and its retrospective imposition.
Justice Mohammad Naeem Anwar of a single-member bench fixed the hearing into the plea of the Cherat Cement Company Limited by a division bench for Jan 11.
He also granted an interim relief to the petitioner by allowing it to submit tax returns by excluding the amount of tax (super tax) imposed under Section 4-C of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.
However, the bench declared that the interim relief should be subject to the deposit of post-dated cheques of the amount of super tax claimed by the FBR or calculated by the petitioner.

PHC asks govt for response to petition

The petitioner requested the court to declare that the imposition of the super tax for the tax year 2022 or any year thereafter is illegal and without lawful authority.
The respondents in the petition are the federal government through the secretary of the revenue division, FBR through its chairman, commissioner (inland revenue), and chief commissioner (inland revenue), Regional Tax Office, Peshawar.
Barrister Ibrahim Khan Afridi appeared for the petitioner and said parliament had passed the Finance Act, 2022, wherein through Section 5, a new section, 4-C, with Division IIB of Part I of the First Schedule, was introduced into the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.
He said through Section 4-C, the levy of the ‘super tax’ on high-earning people had been imposed retrospectively for the tax year 2022.
The lawyer said since the Finance Act, 2022, had taken effect on July 1, 2022, and the tax year 2022 closed on June 30, 2022, the applicability of the impugned tax to the financial year 2022 was illegal.
He said the petitioner belonged to one of the 13 industries, which were subjected to a higher rate of ‘super tax’ compared with that of general taxpayers.
The counsel said his client had already worked out its income on the basis of the law prevailing during the tax year 2022 and it had also prepared the books of accounts and declared profits, dividends and capital gains for the year 2022 on the basis of decisions made while taking into account the prevailing tax laws at that time.
He contended that the imposition of ‘super tax’ on income earned and transactions done in the tax period that had already lapsed, coupled with unjustified discrimination, was illegal, arbitrary, and a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
The lawyer argued that while the legislature was competent to introduce reasonable classification, it was a settled principle of law that even for taxes, there could be no discrimination in the same class of people.
He said the petitioner fell in the first proviso to Part I of the First schedule for which a higher rate of 10 per cent for income above Rs300 million had been prescribed.
The counsel, however, said according to the schedule in question, the rate of super tax was four per cent, but for the petitioner as a cement industry, it was 10 per cent, an act of discrimination against his client.
