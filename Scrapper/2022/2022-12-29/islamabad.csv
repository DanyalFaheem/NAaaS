0,ECP takes U-turn on delimitation for local govt elections in Islamabad,Commission says determination of number of UCs is federal govt’s mandate.,"ISLAMABAD: In what appears to be a U-turn on the issue of delimitations, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in its detailed order said it was the government’s prerogative to increase the number of union councils (UCs) from 101 to 125 in the capital.
In its earlier response to the increase in the number of union councils, the election watchdog had termed the notification ‘illegal’ and refused to postpone local bodies polls in the federal capital.
“…We have arrived to the conclusion that in terms of Article 140-A(1)…the federal government is competent to establish a local government system and devolve political, administrative and financial responsibility and authority to the elected representatives of the local governments,” the ECP said.
“Likewise, in terms of sub-section (1) of Section 6 of the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government Act 2015, determination of number of union councils within the Islamabad Capital Territory is mandate and prerogative of the federal government and thereafter the election commission has to delimit the constituencies after such demarcation,” the detailed order stated.

Commission says determination of number of UCs is federal govt’s mandate

The order pointed out that the federal and provincial governments take advantage of Section 219(1) of the Elections Act 2017 whereby it is mentioned that the commission shall conduct the local government elections under the applicable local government laws.
“The Commission has already proposed certain amendments in the constitution and the Elections Act 2017 so that local government elections may be conducted in time without any delay and should not be delayed by the provincial governments on one pretext or the other,” the commission said.
It urged the governments and parliament to make necessary amendments to Article 140-A and Section 219 of the Elections Act so that local government laws should not be amended near to the conduct of elections or at least such late amendments should not be applicable to the immediate next elections.
The term of the local government bodies in Islamabad expired on February 14, 2021, and under the law, the ECP was bound to conduct elections within 120 days.
Experts believe the ECP’s decision to carry out fresh delimitation would make the conduct of LG polls before general elections next to impossible. The ECP order did not mention if subordinate legislation and notifications could override constitutional provisions.
After facing delaying tactics by the then government, the ECP initiated the process of delimitation and issued the Schedule on March 25, 2022, for carrying out the delimitation of constituencies i.e. 50 Union Councils, 300 General wards and 100 Women Wards. The delimitation committees completed their assigned tasks and a final list of constituencies was published on May 19, 2022.
Thereafter, the schedule for elections was issued on June 2 and July 31 was fixed as the polling day. Meanwhile, the federal government increased the number of union councils from 50 to 101, and the matter was taken by Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry of the PML-N to the Islamabad High Court for its implementation.
The commission during the pendency of the writ petition increased the number of UCs from 50 to 101 and informed the bench upon which the matter was disposed of on June 22.
The commission once again initiated the process of delimitation in the capital and issued a schedule on June 22 for 101 UCs, 606 general wards and 202 women wards. This time, Dec 31 was fixed as the election day. On Dec 19, the government increased the number of UCs from 101 to 125.
The next day the commission decided to hold the elections as per the schedule already issued, but a day later it changed its stance and agreed to postpone the elections.

1,Over 200 policemen to facilitate tourists in Murree,RAWALPINDI: A traffic control room has been established at Sunny Bank Chowki and 270 traffic police personnel...,"RAWALPINDI: A traffic control room has been established at Sunny Bank Chowki and 270 traffic police personnel deployed to facilitate tourists during snowfall in Murree.
Entry of vehicles on The Mall will be banned while special checkpoints have been set up at entry points of Murree where mechanically-fit vehicles and licence holders will be allowed to enter.
A traffic police spokesman said following the special directives of Regional Police Officer Nasir Mehmood Satti, the duty officer traffic (headquarters) chalked out a special plan for Murree to facilitate tourists coming from far-off places.
More than 270 traffic police officers will be on duty to maintain the flow of traffic and provide all possible assistance to tourists. 
As part of the public awareness campaign, pamphlets inscribed with precautions and information regarding snowfall will also be distributed among tourists coming to Murree, while awareness banners about traffic laws and precautionary measures have been displayed on highways.
Additionally, five fork lifters and one tug master (tow truck with crane) have been provided to check violation of parking and provide timely assistance to tourists.
Cranes will constantly be patrolling whereas a special control room has also been built at Sunny Bank Chowki to provide timely assistance to tourists and solve the traffic problem immediately. 
Due to narrow highways and two-way traffic, five main roads of Murree have been declared as one-way to facilitate the evacuation of vehicles.
During snowfall, heavy vehicles will be allowed to enter Murree only at specified times, said the spokesman, adding that there is a parking capacity of around 4,000 vehicles in Murree.
For the convenience of tourists, apart from the allocated parking area, single side parking will be done at certain places so that there is no disruption in the flow of traffic.
Traffic rules will be strictly enforced to maintain uninterrupted flow of traffic during the season and indiscriminate and strict action will be taken in case of violation.
In the meantime, all tourists coming to Murree are requested to make their journey easy and safe by following the instructions issued by the traffic wardens posted on the signboards, banners on highways and safety measures while driving, said the spokesman.
Mr Satti has ordered police to take necessary precautions in light of predicted snowfall and rain in the mountains.

2,Commission asked to satisfy court over postponement of polls,ISLAMABAD: A day after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) postponed local government (LG) elections in the...,"ISLAMABAD: A day after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) postponed local government (LG) elections in the federal capital, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) heard petitions against the decision of the election watchdog, asking it to satisfy the court regarding its decision to defer polls.
Meanwhile, the IHC division bench comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir disposed of an intra-court appeal of the PTI requesting the court to stop the Election Commission from delaying the polls since they had already been postponed.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and Jamaat-i-Islami(JI) had moved the high court against the ECP order issued on Dec 27 postponing elections in Islamabad.
Petitioner’s lawyer Sardar Taimoor Aslam, while giving a brief background of the matter, stated that earlier in the exercise of powers conferred under sub-section (1) of Section 6 of the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government Act 2015, the federal cabinet issued a notification on June 19, 2015, determining the number of the union councils at 50.
The said notification was withdrawn on May 18, 2021. On June 2, 2022 the ECP announced the election schedule relying on the earlier notification of 50 UCs. At the same time, the ECP had expressed willingness to conduct elections and filed a report in the high court stating that directions may be issued to the federal government not to change the number of union councils or amend the law.
The said petition was disposed of with the observation that the commission would complete the process of delimitation of 101 union councils within the period specified under Section 7 of the 2015 act. After a fresh delimitation exercise, the number of UCs was increased to 101.
Thereafter the ECP announced the election schedule for Dec 31. However, a summary was sent to the federal cabinet, seeking an increase in the number of UCs from 101 to 125. Based on the said summary, the number of UCs was increased to 125 vide notification dated Dec 19. The decision was initially opposed by the ECP, but it subsequently agreed to postpone elections.
The counsel for the petitioner contended before the court that the ECP cannot retract its earlier commitment. He argued that the commission through its order on Dec 20 had decided to continue with the election process for cogent reasons. He added that no new development occurred after the passing of the said order.
It was argued that any bill proposing amendments to any law cannot be termed as an act of parliament unless assented to by the president under Article 75(3) of the Constitution. However, the commission in the impugned order has placed reliance on the proposed amendments, which have not yet attained the status of a law of the land.
Justice Tahir directed the registrar’s office to issue notices to the respondents – ECP and the federal government –and also issued a notice to the attorney general. The court asked the respondents “to assist as to why the amount incurred on the process so far, for the conduct of elections, may not be recovered from members of the federal cabinet”.
“The respondents are also directed to satisfy this court as to why the impugned order should not be suspended, pending final disposal of the instant petition,” he asked.

3,Leopard killed after being hit by truck on G.T. Road,"TAXILA: A rare leopard that lives in the Margalla Hills was killed in a road crash on G.T. Road near Margalla Hills,...","TAXILA: A rare leopard that lives in the Margalla Hills was killed in a road crash on G.T. Road near Margalla Hills, according to sources in the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB).
According to the officials, a video shot on a mobile phone revealed that the leopard was hit by a truck followed by a car when it was crossing the road and may have been chasing some other animal. 
Subsequently, it was found lying on the roadside just beside Margalla Hills behind the Nicholson’s Monument and taken away by locals. The truck crew and occupants of the car were recorded as saying that the leopard was either unconscious or had died.
Locals believe that the wild cat descends from the mountains due to low temperature and search for food.
The animal’s body must be handed over to the authorities as keeping it was illegal, the board officials said, adding: “The matter has been reported to local police to find the people who took the leopard alive or dead with the help of eye witnesses or vehicle number plates.”
It may be mentioned here that the first leopard preservation zone was inaugurated at Margalla Hills in January this year to help protect the critically endangered wildcat and promote tourism.

4,"Interview process of shortlisted candidates vying for posts of VCs, rector of three varsities completed",Source says there were 108 candidates who were shortlisted for interviews.,"ISLAMABAD: The education ministry has finally completed the process of conducting interviews of shortlisted candidates to fill the top posts of three public-sector universities in the capital.
A search committee headed by Education Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain conducted interviews on Wednesday of 40 candidates — the last batch of shortlisted candidates — as 18 candidates were interviewed on Tuesday.
A source said there were 108 candidates in total, who were shortlisted for interviews. Earlier this month, candidates under the first batch were interviewed.
“Yes, today the interview process has been concluded and soon we will move three names against each post to the federal government for final appointments,” said an officer of the education ministry.
The interviews were conducted to appoint vice chancellors (VC) of Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) and Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) as well as rector of International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI).
The AIOU, currently, is being run on an ad-hoc basis by a temporary VC while the IIUI has its president to run its affairs. However, the country’s top ranked university, Quaid-i-Azam University, does not even have a temporary VC since Sept 21.
Dr Mohammad Ali was the last vice chancellor, who completed his four-year tenure on Nov 21 and since then, the office of the VC has been lying vacant and the university has been facing several administrative issues.
According to QAU officials, around 400 students have been running from pillar to post to get their degrees, which could not be issued without the signature of a VC. Similarly, the meeting of advance studies and research board to review progress of research work of PhD and MPhil scholars could not take place.
Similarly, the university’s financial issues also remain unresolved.
“We are cognisant of the issue of QAU. We have been pleading the federal government to appoint a temporary VC as soon as possible. We are hopeful that soon we will send three names against each post to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) for final approval,” said an officer of the education ministry.
It is relevant to note here that IIUI rector Dr Masoom Yasinzai completed his tenure in September this year followed by QAU vice chancellor Dr Mohammad Ali and AIOU vice chancellor Dr Ziaul Qayyum, who completed their tenures last month.
“The process of appointing new heads of universities should have been started in August so that the appointment process could have been completed in November, but the issue continues to linger on,” said a QAU faculty member.
Sources said a top educationist, who successfully served in an important education department of Islamabad a few years ago before getting a new assignment in the education sector is also among potential candidates.

Highlighting the impact of ICT on the work of the Wafaqi Mohtasib’s institution in Pakistan, Mr Qureshi said the scope and magnitude of its work had increased manifold over the last 40 years. 
The Wafaqi Mohtasib Secretariat was able to successfully cope with these increasing demands through the use of latest IT tools and upgrading the grievance redressal mechanism on regular basis.
A number of modules were developed by the IT wing internally to cater to the specific requirements of the complainants as well as the federal agencies in maintaining a transparent and credible interface with them.

The employees were deprived of the allowance earlier as being declared non-clinical, president directed the ministry of health to send a fresh summary to the Prime Minister Secretariat for grant of risk allowance to the complainants.
Thousands of employees of federal hospitals got HRA, but 37 employees were denied the allowance by declaring them non-clinical staff. 
Although Federal Ombudsman (FO) gave a decision in employees favour, Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) had objection over it.
The president in his decision observed that in August 2021, the ministry had provided funds to federal government hospitals/entities to grant Covid-19 HRA to clinical staff and that Polyclinic Postgraduate Medical Institute, Islamabad was also one of the beneficiaries of the fund.
He noted that the Executive Director had recommended the ministry to grant the allowance to the remaining 37 employees as all clinical and non-clinical staff worked in the same risky environment, and were equally vulnerable and exposed to infection without any exception.
The president, in his decision, further highlighted that it was a reality that both clinical and non-clinical employees in the hospital were vulnerable and performing duties within the same premises and environment without any exception.
As per details, Maqbool Ahmad and others (the complainants) had lodged a complaint with the ombudsman that during the Covid-19 pandemic, they kept on performing their duties despite their vulnerability and risk of lives on the directions of the heads of their departments along with so many others.
According to them, allowance was paid to a number of employees who performed duties like them but they were discriminated against by being declared as non-clinical staff whereas both the clinical and non-clinical employees performed duties in their hospitals and were equally vulnerable to infection.
The ministry of health, then, had filed an appeal to the President against the decision of the ombudsman.

11,Activists hold ‘foot march’ to highlight Kashmir issue,MUZAFFARABAD: A group of Kashmiri activists continued their ‘foot march’ through the Neelum valley road on the...,"MUZAFFARABAD: A group of Kashmiri activists continued their ‘foot march’ through the Neelum valley road on the second consecutive day on Wednesday as a novel way to draw attention of the international community towards the Kashmir issue.
The marchers were holding one each flag of Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), apart from banners and placards inscribed with slogans that called upon the United Nations (UN) to implement its resolution of January 5, 1949, envisaging right of the Kashmiris to decide their future by acceding either to India or Pakistan on their own free accord.
The march was organised by Pasban-i-Hurriyat Jammu Kashmir (PHJK), an organisation of post-1989 migrants from across the Line of Control (LoC) that has been regularly staging different events to highlight the state sponsored terrorism in India occupied territory as well as New Delhi’s brazen backtracking on its commitments about the Kashmiris right to self-determination.
It began at 10am on Tuesday from Athmuqam, the district headquarters of Neelum located some 84 kilometres northeast of Muzaffarabad, and after covering a distance of 18 kilometres on foot it stopped at Jura Bandi until the next morning.
According to PHJK chairman Uzair Ahmed Ghazali, who is leading the march along with some other office bearers, the number of participants from Athmuqam was 75, as it indicated the passing of 75 years to Indian occupation of Jammu and Kashmir.
On Wednesday, he said, the marchers resumed their activity from Jura Bandi at 9am during which they also held a symbolic sit-in near Seemari village from where India’s military positions on the other side of the divide can be seen with the naked eye.
Mr Ghazali, who spoke to Dawn, said that they had stopped at Nauseri for an overnight stay after covering a distance of almost 28 kilometres.
“We will resume our march on Thursday morning from Nauseri,” he said.
In response to a question, Mr Ghazali said harsh weather had failed to dent the resolve of the participants.
“We want the international community in general and the United Nations in particular to rid the Kashmiris of India’s tyranny and help them exercise their long overdue right to self determination,” he said.
