0,Teen becomes youngest person to fly solo around the world,"Five-month journey saw British-Belgian teenager battle monsoon rains, searing heat and bureaucracy.","SOFIA: A British-Belgian teenager became the youngest person to fly solo around the world on Wednesday after a five-month journey that saw him battle monsoon rains, searing heat and bureaucracy.
Cheers went up as 17-year-old Mack Rutherford landed at an airfield near the Bulgarian capital Sofia after flying 54,124 km and visiting more than 30 countries since he departed from the same site in his Shark Aero microlight airplane on March 23.
“There were many points in my journey where it would have been easy to give up...But I kept going, even when it seemed like I wouldn’t be able to make it to the end,” he said. His journey broke two Guinness World records, including one set by his sister Zara, 19, who handed him one of the certificates on the tarmac.
“Amazing to finally be here again and to have done my goal,” he said with a wide smile.  
“It took a little bit longer than I had hoped for, but it was very exciting, very interesting trip and I don’t regret at all going on it.” 
Rutherford’s journey took longer than planned due to permit delays that forced him to alter his route twice and fly over Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, North America and back to Europe.
His favourite flyovers ranged from the Sahara Desert to Greenland and Iceland. But his trip was also full with challenges, like a 10-hour flight from Japan across the Pacific Ocean to the uninhabited US Attu Island during bad weather.
In Sudan, his solar panel system fell down because the heat melted the glue maintaining it in place combined with extreme haze. In India, monsoon rains entered his main fuel tanks and soaked his aircraft including some documents on board.
Rutherford became the youngest person to fly around the world solo, taking the title from Travis Ludlow, who was 18 when he completed his attempt last year.
He is now also the youngest person to fly around the world in a microlight aircraft, the title held previously by sister Zara, who completed her own trip around the globe in January this year.
For now, he is not planning on breaking any new records but to go back to school and catch up with his studies.
Rutherford, who gained his pilot’s licence in 2020 when he was 15 after training with his father, hopes his five-month voyage will encourage young people to pursue their dreams.
“Basically, just work hard and push forward with your dreams no matter how old you are. Just keep moving forwards and your dreams will eventually come,” he said.

1,US threatens Turkiye with sanctions over Russia ties,ISTANBUL: Turkiye confronted growing US pressure on Wednesday to break off its growing ties with Russia or face...,"ISTANBUL: Turkiye confronted growing US pressure on Wednesday to break off its growing ties with Russia or face potentially crippling sanctions linked to the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. 
Washington is becoming increasingly alarmed that the Russian government and businesses are using Turkiye to evade Western financial and trade restrictions imposed in response to the six-month-old war, as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to step up economic cooperation at a summit in the Black Sea resort of Sochi earlier this month.
US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo in a letter to Turkiye’s TUSIAD business association and the American Chamber of Commerce in Turkiye warned that companies and banks were in danger of being sanctioned themselves.
TUSIAD said in a statement late Tuesday it passed on the letter to Turkiye’s foreign ministry as well as finance and trade officials. “Any individuals or entities providing material support to US-designated persons are themselves at risk of US sanctions,” Adeyemo wrote.
“Turkish banks cannot expect to establish corresponding relationships with sanctioned Russian banks and retain their corresponding relationships with major global banks as well as access to the US dollar and other major currencies.” 
Adeyemo had also raised US concerns in a phone call to Turkish Deputy Finance Minister Yunus Elitas last Friday. “Underlining that it has deep economic and political relations with Ukraine and Russia, Elitas said that Turkiye’s position (on joining) the sanctions has not changed,” the finance ministry said in a statement about the call. However, it added, “It will not allow any institution or individual” to use Turkiye to evade the sanctions regime.
Erdogan has previously argued that Ankara cannot join Western sanctions on Moscow because of Turkey’s heavy dependence on Russian oil and natural gas imports.

2,China faces ‘severe threat’ to harvest from worst heatwave on record,Authorities promise fresh steps to protect crops.,"CHONGQING: China’s autumn harvest is under  “severe threat” from high temperatures and drought, authorities have warned, promising on Wednesday fresh steps to protect crops in the face of the country’s hottest summer on record.
The world’s second-largest economy has been hit by record heat, flash floods and droughts this summer — phenomena that scientists say are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change.
Southern China has recorded its longest continuous period of high temperatures since records began more than 60 years ago, the agriculture ministry said. Four government departments urged the conservation of  “every unit of water” to protect crops.
“The rapid development of drought superimposed with high temperatures and heat damage has caused a severe threat to autumn crop production,” a statement said.
China produces more than 95 percent of the rice, wheat and maize it consumes, but a reduced harvest could mean increased demand for imports in the world’s most populous country — putting further pressure on global supplies already strained by the conflict in Ukraine.
State media reported that the government had pledged 10 billion yuan ($1.45 billion) to help ensure good rice harvests this autumn. A meeting of Beijing’s State Council, presided over by Premier Li Keqiang, had agreed the government should  “do an even better job in fighting and reducing drought”, broadcaster CCTV said.
Officials also called for  “a combination of measures to increase water sources to fight drought, first ensure drinking water for the people, ensure water for agricultural irrigation, and guide farmers to fight drought and protect autumn grain”, it added.
Temperatures as high as 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) have led multiple Chinese provinces to impose power cuts, as cities struggle to cope with a surge in demand for electricity partly driven by people cranking up the air conditioning.
The heat broke records in Sichuan, where a temperature of 43.9 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit) was recorded Wednesday afternoon, the province’s Meteorological Service Centre said in a statement.
The megacities of Shanghai and Chongqing have turned off outdoor decorative lighting, while authorities in Sichuan have imposed industrial power cuts after water levels dropped at key hydroelectric plants.
The searing heat is also drying up the critical Yangtze River, with water flow on its main trunk about 50 percent lower than the average over the last five years, state media outlet China News Service reported last week.
In Chongqing, where more than 1,500 people were evacuated from areas hit by multiple wildfires, locals were struggling.
“I feel too hot to sleep every night, and I’m awakened by the heat every morning,” Xu Jinxin, a 20-year-old student, said.
“Because of the electricity shortage, we don’t leave the air conditioner on all day but rather turn it off once it’s cooled down a bit.” The national meteorological service renewed warnings for drought and high temperatures on Tuesday, calling on 11 provincial governments to activate emergency responses.
Authorities have turned to cloud seeding — a method to induce rainfall — in parts of the country. CCTV published footage this month showing meteorological workers shooting catalyst rockets into the sky and firefighters transporting water to farmers in need.

3,Passengers stuck for hours inside Channel Tunnel,Passenger describes the experience as “terrifying”.,"LONDON: Hundreds of passengers were evacuated from a Eurotunnel train under the Channel between Britain and France after a technical problem, its operators said on Tuesday.
Getlink, which runs the rail link between Coquelles in northern France and Folkestone in southeast England, said some 400 people had to abandon their vehicles on Tuesday.
An alarm on board forced crowds of people to have to leave the train for the adjoining concrete service tunnel, which is normally used by maintenance workers.
One passenger, Sarah Fellows, 37, called the experience  “terrifying”.
“There was a woman crying in the tunnel, another woman having a panic attack who was travelling alone.” Another traveller, Michael Kent, said passengers spent several hours in the train before it was evacuated as staff tried to solve the problem.
Passengers said they were eventually transferred to a replacement train but spent almost five hours in the undersea tunnel. The incident affected a train leaving Calais at 3:50pm on Tuesday, Later trains from France were delayed by up to six hours. John Keefe, from operators Getlink, said passengers were taken to Folkestone while the original shuttle was brought out and they rejoined their vehicles.
“Operations like this do take time, but they are for the safety of everyone and must be conducted carefully,” he said.
By 6am Wednesday,  “everyone who was caught up in the incident had been carried across, diversions removed, and we are now back to normal services”, he added.
The Channel Tunnel opened in 1994 and is composed of two single-track tunnels and a service tunnel each 50 kilometres (31 miles) long. The undersea section covers 38km and is the longest in the world.
Since opening, it has carried more than 80 million vehicles on shuttle trains that are nearly 800 metres long.
Last month, Eurotunnel reduced the number of trains through the Channel Tunnel due to the effects of nationwide rail strikes in Britain, although its staff did not join the protest.

4,Indian tycoon’s  bid for NDTV stokes fears for media freedom,"BENGALURU: Shares in India’s NDTV Ltd jumped the maximum permitted 5pc to a 14-year high on Wednesday, after...","BENGALURU: Shares in India’s NDTV Ltd jumped the maximum permitted 5pc to a 14-year high on Wednesday, after billionaire Gautam Adani’s conglomerate moved to take a near 30pc stake in the media group that could eventually lead to it taking control.
New Delhi Television’s (NDTV) shares surged far beyond the price Adani Group said it would pay in a subsequent mandatory open offer that could take its stake over 55pc. Some analysts said investors were hoping Asia’s richest man would put money into the struggling network.
“All TV channels have been suffering financially, and NDTV suffers a bit more because their rivals are aggressive marketers,” said N. Chandramouli, CEO of TRA Research. “Markets may be reacting because the sentiment is that someone with money is coming in,” he added.
NDTV’s rivals include Times Group’s Times Now and Network18’s CNN-News18, controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani.
Regarded as one of the few media groups that often takes a critical view of the ruling administration’s policies, NDTV said late on Tuesday that Adani Group’s move had come  “without any input from, conversation with, or consent of the NDTV founders” Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy.
“The developments ... are totally unexpected,” senior NDTV official Suparna Singh told employees in a memo.  “We are in the process of evaluating the next steps, many of which involve regulatory and legal processes.”  Some NDTV journalists told Reuters on the condition of anonymity they were fearful of job cuts and losing their editorial independence if Adani Group gained control.
“Almost the last bastion of Independent journalism being taken over by industry,” Kapil Sibal, a former government minister and a top lawyer, said on Twitter.

The kingdom’s economy has not bounced back after fully re-opening to tourists earlier this year, and has been battered by 14-year-high inflation and the economic knock-on effects of the Russian-Ukraine war.
Prices of instant noodles are capped by Bangkok at six baht ($0.16) per packet but anxious major producers had urged the government to raise the limit to eight baht, citing spiralling costs. The internal trade department confirmed that it would approve an increase to seven baht per regular-sized packet, effective from August 25.
The news comes after five major Thai instant noodle producers — Wai Wai, Mama, Yam Yam, Sue Sat and Nissin — petitioned the department for a rise. “We are facing rising commodity prices, oil prices for export,” explained Veera Naphaprukchart from Thai Preserved Food, part of popular brand Wai Wai.
The price of wheat flour rose roughly 20-30 percent and the price of palm oil had doubled, he said.

6,Japan signals return to nuclear power,"Country will restart more idled nuclear plants and look at developing next-generation reactors, says PM.","TOKYO: Japan will restart more idled nuclear plants and look at developing next-generation reactors, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Wednesday, setting the stage for a major policy shift on nuclear energy a decade after the Fukushima disaster.
The comments from Kishida — who also said the government would look at extending the lifespan of existing reactors — highlight how the Ukraine crisis and soaring energy costs have forced both a change in public opinion and a policy rethink toward nuclear power.
Japan has kept most of its nuclear plants idled in the decade since a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011 triggered a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. Quake-prone Japan also said it would build no new reactors, so a change in that policy would be a stark turnaround.
Kishida told reporters he had instructed officials to come up with concrete measures by the year end, including on  “gaining the understanding of the public” on sustainable energy and nuclear power.

7,Oldest human relative walked upright 7m years ago: study,PARIS: The earliest known human ancestor walked on two feet as well as climbing through trees around seven million...,"PARIS: The earliest known human ancestor walked on two feet as well as climbing through trees around seven million years ago, scientists said on Wednesday after studying three limb bones.
When the skull of Sahelanthropus tchadensis was discovered in Chad in 2001, it pushed back the age of the oldest known representative species of humanity by a million years.
Nicknamed  “Toumai”, the nearly complete cranium was thought to indicate that the species walked on two feet because of the position of its vertebral column and other factors.
However the subject triggered fierce debate among scientists, partly due to the scarcity and quality of the available bones, with some even claiming that Toumai was not a human relative but just an ancient ape.
In a study published in the Nature journal on Wednesday, a team of researchers exhaustively analysed a thigh bone and two forearm bones found at the same site as the Toumai skull. “The skull tells us that Sahelanthropus is part of the human lineage,” said paleoanthropologist Franck Guy, one of the authors of the study.
The new research on the limb bones demonstrates that walking on two feet was its  “preferred mode of getting around, depending on the situation,” he told a press conference. But they also sometimes moved through the trees, he added.
‘Not a magical trait’
The leg and arm bones were found alongside thousands of other fossils in 2001, and the researchers were not able to confirm that they belonged to the same individual as the Toumai skull.
After years of testing and measuring the bones, they identified 23 characteristics which were then compared to fossils from great apes as well as hominins — which are species more closely related to humans than chimpanzees.
They concluded that  “these characteristics are much closer to what would be seen in a hominin than any other primate,” the study’s lead author Guillaume Daver told the press conference. For example, the forearm bones did not show evidence that the Sahelanthropus leaned on the back of its hands, as is done by gorillas and chimpanzees.
The Sahelanthropus lived in an area with a combination of forests, palm groves and tropical savannahs, meaning that being able to both walk and climb through trees would have been an advantage.
There have been previous suggestions that it was the ability to walk on two feet that drove humans to evolve separately from chimpanzees, putting us on the path to where we are today.

8,Iran tests drones amid US concern of possible supply to Russia,Two-day war-games will involve 150 drones and will cover Iran’s Gulf coast and most of its territory.,"DUBAI: Iran on Wednesday launched exercises to test its combat and reconnaissance drones, state media reported, amid US concerns over the possible supply of Iranian-made unmanned aircraft to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine.
The two-day war-games will involve 150 drones and will cover Iran’s Gulf coast and most of its territory, state television reported. The country’s air-defences and  “electronic warfare” capabilities will also be tested against mock enemy drones.
Iran and the regional forces it backs have increasingly relied in recent years on drones in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf.
The United States said earlier this month that Russian officials were being trained in Iran as part of an agreement on the transfer of drones between the two countries, and accused Tehran of planning to supply hundreds of unmanned aircraft to Moscow for use in Ukraine. Iran’s foreign minister denied the claim last month, including in a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart.
Iran has developed a large domestic arms industry in the face of international sanctions and embargoes that bar it from importing many weapons.
Western military analysts say Iran sometimes exaggerates its weapons capabilities, though concerns about its ballistic missiles contributed towards Washington in 2018 leaving Tehran’s 2015 nuclear pact with world powers.
