HCCI president Adeel Siddiqui asked what the purpose of his visit to Hyderabad was if the minister did not have time to meet the business community’s leaders.  
He said the community would have explained situation to him. But, he said, the government was not serious. 
He said it appeared even the Hesco chief was not being taken seriously by his own subordinate staff. “I have been approaching the Hesco boss for the past five days and he has issued directives to the SDO, but he is not complying with it,” he remarked. 
He said traders and shopkeepers asked the HCCI leadership as to who would meet the energy requirement of shopping centres. They paid money for transformers which developed faults again, he said.  
He asked what the purpose of that ministry and government was if they did not have time to meet electricity consumers.  
Meanwhile, the Hesco spokesman’s press release did not attribute a single word to the federal minister as if he had remained silent throughout the briefing given to him.
Hesco chief Noor Mohammad Soomro claimed that all directives given by the federal government had been complied with and this had no precedence.

3,Most KE consumers may not get benefit of fuel adjustment charges waiver,Energy minister says FAC will be waived for those who consumed up to 200 units per month.,"KARACHI: Nearly half of the K-Electric consumers may not get the benefit of exemption from paying fuel adjustment charges (FAC) in their monthly electricity bills as Federal Energy Minister Khurrum Dastagir said on Wednesday that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced elimination of fuel adjustment charges in the entire country for only those who consumed up to 200 units of electricity per month.  
Speaking at a press conference here at the KE head office, he said that the federal government had exempted over 17 million electricity consumers from FAC and traders from the fixed tax across the country.  
According to a KE spokesperson, out of over 3.2m there are around 1.5m consumers who used up to 200 units of electricity per month.  
The federal minister while giving the details of the package announced by the prime minister said that those who consumed less than 200 units of electricity in the country would not be charged FAC in the bills issued in August, adding that the facility would also be availed by agriculture consumers.  

Energy minister says FAC will be waived for those who consumed up to 200 units per month; visits Hesco head office

He said that the customers who had paid the FAC in their August bills would be adjusted in the next month’s bills.  
The federal minister said that the fixed tax levied on traders, which had already been abolished, would be collected as per the old system from October with some modifications. 
New privatisation agreement with KE
Mr Dastagir hinted at a new privatisation agreement between the K-Electric and the federal government, saying that the benefits of privatisation of the power utility had not been achieved.  
He said that there were legal and financial issues in the agreement, so its provisions were being reconsidered and a new agreement was being prepared.
He alleged that the increase in electricity prices was the result of former prime minister Imran Khan’s government.  
“During 2018 to 2022, there had been no focus on generating cheap electricity from wind, solar, coal and nuclear energies,” he added.  
He said that in the summer of this year, the maximum electricity demand in the country was 30,000 megawatts, while the country had 22,000MW to 25,000MW from efficient sources.  
“Now this is the policy of the government, in the future; whatever new power plants will be built, they will not use imported fuel,” he added.  
He said that the federal government wanted to ensure the cheap supply of electricity to citizens of Karachi and across the country and the policy had been decided that electricity would be generated from locally available resources and not on any imported fuel. 
“We will give good news to the people of Karachi soon. We will start the 1,320 MW project of Shanghai Company in Thar coal field soon,” he added. 
Financial affairs between KE, govt ‘very complicated’
The federal minister said that the financial affairs between K-Electric and the federal government were very complicated.  
“There are some legal and financial issues between the federal government and K-Electric,” he said, without elaborating.  
He said that floods had caused a lot of damage. “Therefore, the authorities have been asked to restore the submerged grid stations and other facilities as soon as possible,” he added.  
Mr Dastagir said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had directed for bringing innovation in electricity distribution companies. “Providing cheap electricity to consumers is our goal,” he added. 
The minister was also given a briefing during a meeting with the KE authorities. However, no details were available regarding the closed-door meeting.
Meanwhile, the federal minister visited the headquarters of the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) headquarters on Wednesday.  
However, a Hesco spokesperson has issued a press release in which not a single word has been attributed to the federal minister as if he remained silent in the briefing given to him.

JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rehman along with two other party leaders petitioned the SHC stating that the KE and other respondents had failed to discharge their obligations for uninterrupted supply of electricity to the citizens of Karachi.
While citing the KE, ministry of power and the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) as respondents, the petitioners contended that the extended loadshedding in the city was due to poor performance of the KE and improper supervision of other respondents as they became a tool in the hands of the power utility.
They argued that Nepra had no mechanism to gauge the actual production of power by the KE and demand for the provincial metropolis.
They further submitted that the ministry was providing extraordinary support to KE in shape of huge finance on account of subsidiary electricity from national grid as well as fixed gas quota just to facilitate the power utility to minimise the cost of electricity, but the same was not being transferred to consumers.
The petitioners argued that KE was exhorting huge amount of money from consumers in the name of FAC with the permission of Nepra and added that they had approached the regulatory authority, but to no avail.
They asked the SHC to restrain KE from carrying out loadshedding especially in the night-time and to direct the power utility to generate power as per the required demand and in accordance with the agreements made with federal authorities.
They also sought directive for Nepra to stop KE from overbilling in different names including FAC and other taxes including sales tax, TV licence fee and income tax.
The petitioners said that KE may be directed to improve its system and replaced the old machinery in order to improve its performance in generation, distribution and transmission of electricity.

7,Warrants out against 50 suspects over embezzlement of Rs3.2bn pension funds in Sindh,Court directs NAB IO to arrest and produce suspects on Aug 31.,"KARACHI: An accountability court has issued warrants for arrest of as many as 50 suspects nominated in a case pertaining to alleged misappropriation and money laundering of Rs3.2 billion from government pension funds.
Judge Suresh Kumar of the Accountability Court-IV directed the investigating officer of the National Accountability Bureau to arrest and produce the suspects in court on Aug 31.
As many as 13 suspects, including former additional district accounts officer (ADAO) Mushtaq Ahmed Sheikh, are currently in the custody of NAB while 43 are on bail.
In May, NAB had filed a reference against 85 suspects stating that a probe recovered 5,433 pension bills and 130 refund bills while searching the house of ex-ADAO Shaikh.
It added that 1,756 pension bills/vouchers pertaining to the MCB Bank were sorted out, which were signed and processed by the then ADAOs at different times.
The probe found these pension bills fake having fake Pension Pay Order (PPO) numbers and the same were deposited in the bank accounts of the persons other than the names mentioned on the vouchers and 137 bank accounts of 59 individuals, most of them belonged to accused Aijaz Dawach and his family members and friends.
These 137 accounts were operated at three branches of the MCB Bank during the period between 2010 and 2017, it added.
The investigation revealed that total value of these 1,756 fake pension bills/vouchers was Rs1.165bn, which were not processed as per Accounting Policies and Procedures Manual (APPM) issued by the government applicable on federal and provincial governments.
The banking analysis revealed that another amount to the tune of Rs1.8bn was also credited from the government funds. After getting cleared these payments from the State Bank of Pakistan the amount of pension was posted and credited into the accounts of private persons.
The State Bank of Pakistan debited the Sindh government’s account and transferred the requisite pension funds to the corresponding bank branch, officials of which credited these pension funds into the accounts of private unrelated/unauthorised persons. The bank officials later on facilitated the accused persons with cash withdrawal of the deposited money.
NAB alleged bank officials Junejo Bahadur Ali, Abdul Hafeez Lund, Siraj Ali Mastoi, Azhar Hussain Hingoro and Altaf Gorar opened fake bank accounts in active connivance with private individuals as well as government officers and laundered the money.
It accused suspect Noor Ahmed of using his official identity for the release of funds of millions of rupees from the Sindh finance department in favour of the DAO Hyderabad for more than eight years.
Ex-ADAO Shaikh, during his posting as section officer-budget in the fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17, paid an amount of Rs4.6bn for pension without any authority.
Suspect Amir Zia Isran, who also remained posted as the section officer in the finance department as well as SO to the Chief Minister Secretariat from 2009 to 2017, took a bribe from accused Noor Ahmed.
NAB claimed all 84 suspects misappropriated Rs3.2bn from the pension accounts in DAO Hyderabad through fake pension vouchers and fake agriculture refund vouchers, causing losses to the exchequer.
It said they committed an offence punishable under the provisions of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 and the Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2010.

8,Opposition parties slam ECP decision to postpone LG elections,"PPP keeps mum; MQM-P wants delimitation, census issues addressed before polls...","KARACHI: Major opposition political parties on Wednesday lashed out at the Pakistan Peoples Party-led Sindh government and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for postponing the Aug 28 local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad for one more time.
They called it a conspiracy of the parties in the ruling coalition at the Centre to get away from the defeat and depriving people from their right to choose their true municipal representatives.
The Jamaat-i-Islami staged a protest sit-in on main Shahrah-i-Quaideen against the decision and announced that it would hold a protest demonstration outside the ECP offices on Aug 26 (tomorrow).
“It’s so shameful and unacceptable on the part of those involved in this conspiracy,” said JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman. 

PPP keeps mum; MQM-P wants delimitation, census issues addressed before polls

He said that the ECP at the behest of the PPP government had further delayed the elections on the pretext of rains despite the fact that the Met office predicted no rains in Karachi on August 27 and 28. “This decision is tantamount to violating the democratic and constitutional rights of more than 30 million Karachiites,” he said.
PTI
Former federal minister and chief of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Sindh chapter Ali Zaidi said it was the fear of defeat that the PPP was making excuse by exploiting its power in Sindh. 
He referred to the PTI victory in the recent by-poll in the NA-245 constituency as one of the reasons that convinced the “parties in the imported government coalition” to run away from the local government elections.
“But this strategy is not sustainable. All these fake parties which claim themselves as democratic parties would sooner or later face the wrath of the people in the shape of votes. They will all become history in Pakistan’s politics,” said Mr Zaidi.
PSP
Former Karachi mayor and Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) chairman Syed Mustafa Kamal expressed his surprise over the decision to postpone the local government polls.
He said that the reasons mentioned by the Sindh government and later endorsed by the ECP actually emerged only due to non-existence of the local government system in the province.
“There’s no solution of all these problems but an effective and true local government system,” he said, adding: “The local government is so crucial mainly for urban Sindh and one cannot postpone and put it on hold citing any challenge or crisis.”
He said the local government system was in fact solution to every challenge and a “delay in putting such a system in place will further complicate the situation and make the challenge much bigger”.
MQM-P concerned over delimitation
The Mutthida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P), which is a coalition partner with the ruling PPP at the Centre, sounded little concerned about the postponement of the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad. 
The party was more concerned about the “unjustified delimitation, fake voter list and less count of population in the National Census 2017” and demanded that these problems be fixed before the fresh schedule of the local government polls.
“It’s the ECP decision to postpone the elections,” MQM-P leader Khawaja Izharul Hasan told a press conference at its temporary headquarters in Bahadurabad. 
“We still request the ECP to review the delimitation issues in Karachi and Hyderabad. It’s only MQM-P which has been fighting for an empowered and effective local government system both in parliament and in courts,” he claimed.
The ruling PPP, however, stayed silent on the ECP decision.

Iftikhar Arif, who presided over the event and participated in it online from Islamabad, as usual warmed the hearts of the attendees at the council and those who watched him live on the internet with his top-notch poetry. He began his stint with the following couplet and verse: 
Hum apne raftagan ko yaad rakhna chahte hain
Dilon ko dard se aabaad rakhna chahte hain
Buhat mushkil zamano mein bhi hum ahl-i-muhabbat
Wafa per ishq ki bunyaad rakhna chahte hain 
[We want our past, our ancestors, in our memory
In order to keep our hearts soft and eyes wet
Even in the most trying of times, we, the peace lovers
Would like our love to be based on loyalty] 
Anwar Shaoor was the special guest on the occasion. He too earned generous praise from the audience. He recited three well received ghazals. The opening couplets of his two ghazals were: 
Mujhe wo shakhs kahin chhor ker nahin jaata
Main chahta hun ke ja’ey, magar nahin jata 
[That man doesn’t keep me out of his sight
I want him to, but he doesn’t budge] 
Jo haqeeqat mein hai wohi hota
Kaash insaan aadmi hota 
[If the truth prevailed
Humans would be persons] 
Shahida Hasan, who joined from Canada, said she’s going to recite something which is influenced by the current (political) environment in Pakistan. She read: 
Kis ne kaha hai aap se yaum-i-hisaab se darein
Ho jo sakey to apne hi haal-i-kharaab se darein 
[Who has asked you to be wary of judgment day?
Look at yourself, and be afraid of your own condition]  
Sabir Zafar, in his distinct style, recited, among other poems, a patriotic piece: 
Isi khaak pe jeena chahta hun, isi khaak pe marna chahta hun
Main nisaar watan per hote huay, har hud se guzarna chahta hun 
[I want to live on this land, I want to die here as well
I want to go to any limit to sacrifice my life for my country] 
Ishrat Afreen, who resides in the US, presented a nazm and a ghazal using the diction that distinguishes her from her contemporaries. Keeping the jashn-i-aazadi in mind, her ghazal’s first two lines were: 
Sa’in merey khaiton per bhi rut haryali bhaijo na
Sukhi parindon ki chahkarein geeton wali bhaijo na 
[Sa’in, please send over the season of greenery to my fields
Along with the chirping and singing of contented birds] 
Aqeel Abbas Jafri paid a heart-warming tribute to the country in the ghazal which had ‘Pakistan’ as the radeef:  
Likhna tha dunya ka sub se achha naam
Zahn mein aik hi naam aaya tha, Pakistan 
[When asked to write the best name in the world
Only one name came to mind: Pakistan]  
Earlier, Ambareen Haseeb Amber, who moderated the mushaira, formally began the programme with a patriotic kalaam one of whose verses was:  
Muhabbat aur qurbani hi mein ta’meer muzmar hai
Dar-o-deewar se bun ja’ey ghar, aisa nahin hota  
[Homes are made with love and sacrifice
Walls and doors don’t build a home] 
The other participating poets were: Nasir Ali Syed, Ajmal Siraj, Nasra Zuberi, Saeed Sadhu, Ahmed Salman, Akhtar Usman, Uzmee Joan, Ahmad Ataullah, Hameeda Shaheen and Rehana Roohi.

In June, the former shipping minister through his attorney had petitioned the SHC stating that he was abroad and willing to come back and surrender before trial courts to face trial and sought protective bail. The SHC had granted him protective bail in a corruption reference and a money laundering and terror financing case. However, he was arrested as soon as he came out of Karachi airport.
On the last hearing, an additional prosecutor general-Sindh and assistant advocate general informed the SHC that the petitioner had again left the country after getting bail in pending cases from trial courts.
On Monday, the lawyer for the petitioner for a second time argued that the former minister had feared that he would be arrested again if he would return to Pakistan on the basis of some known inquiries.
He sought directives for the respondents to provide details whether any such inquiry/investigation was pending against him so that he could obtain protective/transitory bail prior to his return to the country.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice K. K. Agha sought a report from deputy attorney general, PG and special prosecutor NAB and adjourned the hearing till Oct 4.

“The devastation we are seeing right now has taken almost two months to unfold. The government institutions, however, are still absent from the scene except the army,” Dr Qaiser Sajjad told a press conference here at the PMA House.
He asked why the government in Sindh that had been in power for 15 years had failed to develop institutions like civil defence and rescue services.
Maintaining that the country currently had no system, he said: “It’s the judicial system that’s working, unfortunately. And, it happens in a country when government institutions abdicate their responsibility.” 
He noted: “The poor government response is tragic, but not surprising. If a city generating the largest amount of revenue for the country couldn’t develop the capacity to handle a fire emergency in decades, one can imagine what could be the situation like in times of a bigger disaster.”
Highlighting the devastation caused by floods, speakers said every province was suffering from rain-related devastation that had led to extensive human and infrastructure damages across Pakistan.
The floods, it was pointed out, had resulted in over 800 deaths, some 60,000 houses had reportedly been damaged, while 107,377 cattle reported dead.
The provinces of Balochistan and Sindh, they said, were most adversely affected; death toll had reached 225 in Balochistan, while 22 districts in Sindh had been declared as ‘calamity affected areas’.
“Instead of utilising its own resources to handle the damaged, the government has sought world aid. This is unfortunate. We believe that the government has sufficient funds to help those in need,” said Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro of the PMA.
