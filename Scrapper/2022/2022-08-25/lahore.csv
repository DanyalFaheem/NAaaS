4,"Outrage against FPA in bills: Govt relief measure seems too little, too late","""This is a rare combination of mismanagement and incompetence – some call it insensitivity,"" says former Pepco head.","LAHORE: As people stung by the killing proportion of taxes, mainly fuel price adjustment (FPA) charges for the last two months that multiplied cost of electricity, take to the streets, the government seems to be belatedly waking up to the options that it always had but never bothered to exercise.  
On Wednesday, Federal Minister for Power Khurram Dastgir announced exemption from FPA for those consuming up to 200 units, claiming benefit to 17 million users at a cost of Rs22 billion to the national exchequer. It came after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had suspended collection of the Fixed Sales Tax on the traders through electricity bills and then ordered an inquiry to ascertain why the tax amount was doubled at the implementation stage and asked the finance minister to sit with traders to prepare new mechanism for collecting this kind of tax.  
The sectoral experts, however, point out many more possible mitigating measures and wonder why they were not thought of and taken in the first place. Why did the government wait for protests to gain nationwide momentum to even start 
looking for relief options?  
“This is a rare combination of mismanagement and incompetence – some call it insensitivity – on the part of energy sector managers,” says a former head of Pakistan Electric Power Company (Pepco), who did not wish to be named due to sensitivity of the issue. In fact, none of serving officers, Dawn spoke to on Wednesday, wanted to be named for the same reasons.  
“According to the power sector standard operating procedures (SOPs) agreed with the lenders, the government has to collect FPA for balancing its books. But, book balancing is a yearly exercise, not a monthly one. The government could, and should, have staggered FPA collection: passing a portion of it to relatively lean months. During the last decade, FPA remained negative for years and so was during the Covid crisis. It would certainly drop to half of current amount for July because of drop in world oil prices. It used to be a normal procedure in the ministry to prepare six- to eight-month FPA projections and see how it could be collected, causing minimum discomfiture to consumers. The exercise seems to have been suspended this time,” he thinks.  
“Why the highest ever FPA collection was concentrated on two highest consumption months? A simple look at mathematics of slapping and collection of FPA makes it clear the magnitude of what is now turning out to be belatedly realised folly. In May, Rs7.92 per unit FPA was slapped. In June, it went up to Rs9.89 per unit. The actual impact was even higher: in May, FPA came to Rs9.50 per unit and Rs12 per unit in June as roughly 21 per cent taxes are added to the amount. To make it worse, this amount was collected in July and August, when routine consumption spikes to the highest yearly point. One wonders why the sectoral mangers or politicians looking after the sector did not think through and calculate social and political cost of their act.  
“Now, after much political maligning and social chaos, the government is waking up to the fallout and taking partial and halfhearted remedial measures which would not work,” he warns.  
Advising better realism, Muhammad Ali, a tax consultant from Lahore, says the government should have at least deferred some of the over a dozen taxes which it collects through electricity bills. It has been electricity bills as a vehicle for tax collection but it should have rationalised them due to their disastrous impact, or found some other methods to collect taxes like general sales tax (GST) and fixed taxes.  
“It is not to suggest that the government should have foregone them but only to say that better political and social acumen should have prevailed. How could people, already surviving on the fringes of their financial reach, afford to pay the highest FPA, during the highest inflationary period and that too amid increased and new taxes after budget and stalled salaries and income brackets?  
“More than rationale of the FPA, it is the manner of collection that has made it worse; it smacks of social insensitivity on the part of energy and finance managers in the country,” Ali regrets.  
A former official of the energy ministry, who had been involved in policy preparation, thinks that the government should also decipher the reasons behind the current bind that it finds itself in. “Most of the plants generating electricity are based on foreign fuel which fluctuates due to factors beyond the control of Pakistan. Dollar-rupee parity also contributes to the mayhem. The only option to deal with these fluctuations is long-term purchase agreements, like LNG. Why RLNG was not purchased a few months prior to the crisis? Why we have missed hedging options in case of oil products? This year, hydel generation crest was delayed by two months due to climatic factors and dependence on thermal multiplied – causing the current FPA crisis. One should also have a look into the role of Wapda and the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) whether there was any negligence on their part in restricting dam operation and reducing hydel generation?  
“Yet another question is was the Economic Dispatch Order fully followed during the peak thermal generation months? All these answers should be found to avoid the repeat of this crisis which is fast turning into social disaster,” he advises.

He said the ‘frivolous’ allegations were below the human dignity and at the same time the purpose of the “mudslinging” by the complainant woman was only to get fame in media/social media.

Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman had filed an appeal against rejection of his nomination papers by the returning officer (RO) of NA-108, while Dr Shezra Mansab Kharal, a candidate of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) from NA-118, had challenged acceptance of Khan’s nomination papers for the by-poll.
During the hearing, Barrister Senator Syed Ali Zafar argued on behalf of Mr Khan that the RO rejected the papers of the appellant against the law and ignoring the facts. He said Khan’s nomination papers for the by-election in other constituencies had been accepted, asking the tribunal to set aside the RO’s decision and allow him to contest the by-poll from NA-108.
On the appeal about NA-118, Advocate Mansoor Usman Awan argued on behalf of the PML-N’s candidate that Khan did not disclose, in his nomination papers, the gifts he had received from Toshakhana. He said Khan also failed to disclose the details of the assets owned by him and his wife.
The counsel further argued that the nomination papers filed by the PTI chairman were not attested by an oath commissioner, as required by the law. He asked the tribunal to set aside the RO’s decision and reject the nomination papers of Khan for NA-118 by-election.
Tribunal member Justice Shahid Waheed observed that the scope of the tribunal was limited and the questions raised by the appellant’s counsel could be decided in election petition after the by-election.
The judge further observed that nomination papers could not be rejected on the basis of incomplete information.

On the other hand, PML-N MPAs protested outside the assembly building against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman for hurling threats at a woman judge of Islamabad for remanding Shahbaz Gill to police custody.
The resolution was tabled by provincial minister and PTI leader Mahmoodur Rashid, while Speaker Sibtain Khan suspended the assembly rules to take it up out of turn.
It says the house of the provincial assembly of Punjab strongly condemns the ‘baseless’ and ‘illegal’ cases registered against the former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan.
It terms the PTI the largest and most popular political party and its chairman Imran Khan real leader of Pakistani people, as well as of the Islamic world, and adds that implicating him in ‘false’ terrorism cases is aimed at spoiling atmosphere in the country and derailing the democratic system.
The resolution says the cases tarnished the image of the country in the comity of nations as UN secretary general also expressed his concern at the issue, while international journals are also condemning these developments.
The resolution further says that ‘political’ and ‘baseless’ cases are not acceptable, neither such ‘highhanded tactics’ can stop the PTI’s struggle against this “imported government”. Therefore, it says the house expresses full solidarity with the PTI chairman and strongly condemns these ‘nefarious’ actions of the ‘imported’ government. The house demands the federal government should quash the cases filed against Imran Khan on political grounds immediately and the political leadership be confronted in the political arena, it adds.
Meanwhile, PML-N lawmakers held a demonstration at the staircase of the assembly building to protest against Imran Khan for threatening the woman judge. They also raised slogans against the PTI chairman.
The parliamentarians demanded the chief justice of Pakistan to take a suo motu notice of the incident.
Opposition MPA Hina Pervaiz Butt said Khan’s remarks against the woman judge were unpardonable, while his threats to police officers were embarrassing.
Another member Raheela Khadim said the PTI was a fascist party and that it had already exposed its mentality regarding the womenfolk.
Sadia Taimur said Imran Khan was following the agenda of creating chaos in the country.
Kanwal Liaquat said the PML-N and its federal government were standing by judge Zeba Chaudhry and the police officers being targeted by the PTI.

Talking to a delegation of industrialists and traders led by Afaq Shaukat Mokal, chairman, United Business Group, Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry head Shahzad Ali Malik said the OIC was the second-largest inter-governmental organisation after the United Nations with 57 member states, covering four continents, whereas its intra-trade between 2019-20 registered a decrease of 21.2 per cent, from $700.1bn to $522.8bn.
He pointed out that during the Covid-19 pandemic the world economy witnessed an unprecedented turbulence that impacted different crucial sectors. He said various countries were recovering gradually at different pace.
He said the OIC member countries were blessed with huge natural resources and minerals deposits, but their share in the global economy, and even within member countries, did not match their potential.  
Mr Malik said trade facilitation activities were of great importance to promote intra OIC trade and investment.
He said OIC member states have signed several bilateral, regional and multilateral trade and investment agreements in order to better regulate trade and investment flows and further liberalise international trade transactions with local incentives.
He said the member states have also initiated trade facilitation measures to streamline foreign trade transaction procedures such as the establishment of single windows, the construction of road, rail and airport infrastructure, and the automation of customs administration, the exchange of electronic data inter agency stakeholders of trade and the elimination of several foreign trade documents despite these barriers.
He said it was appropriate for member states to activate the OIC trade preferential system either through the normal or fast-track way, taking into account the evolution of the environment of regional trade agreements to develop the markets for products and services in these countries.

There were also reports that the IG had proposed to attach the feedback of the public on above-mentioned two services with the annual confidential reports (ACRs) of the police officials.
The ACRs would be written on the basis of their performance and the public complaints reported on these services.  

Over 0.1m contacted on first day; modalities to be worked out to make facility part of system

During the meeting, the IG Punjab briefed the CM that the two services received a strong welcome by the local and overseas Pakistanis when they utilised them to get help they required without visiting the police stations.
An official told Dawn that the IG had turned down the requests of many senior police officers to drop the idea of launching the services fearing that they would badly expose the police’s negligence at all ranks starting from constable to the senior grades.
He said some senior officials sitting in Central Police Office (CPO) were also among those who opposed the new services besides those serving in the fields including RPOs and DPOs who were also unhappy as they believed that the ratio of public complaints against the police would increase manifold.  
Rejecting the claims of the officials, the IG was of the view that a strong system of check and balance of public on the police was the only best option for implementation of effective policing and redress of public grievances.According to the figures released by the Punjab police here on Wednesday, over 100,000 local and overseas Pakistanis [on the first day] contacted on WhatsApp number to get help from the provincial police. 
A spokesperson for the Punjab police said IG Faisal Shahkar had inaugurated WhatsApp number 0331-7871787 on Tuesday for the citizens to get a variety of 15 services without visiting their respective police stations.
After the first-day response/feedback, the police department has appealed to the citizens to avoid making calls on the WhatsApp number or sending videos, photos and other content.
Instead, they should contact to get useful information only by sending messages to this number.  
He said the online Complaint Management System can be accessed through this link https://complaints.punjabpolice.gov.pk.
These services include crime report, IGP complaint cell, police service center facilities, gender harassment report, facilities for overseas Pakistanis, Zainab Alert, Citizen Portal, criminal record verification of domestic workers etc.

He also directed the tourism department to take effective measures for the promotion of tourism activities, while the government and other relevant departments will provide all possible assistance and cooperation in this regard.
He said that there is a need to focus on the promotion of tourism activities at the level of divisional headquarters across the province, while a comprehensive Lahore tourism package should be developed keeping in mind the places of the touristic, historical and religious importance of the city.
The representatives of the hotel industry also expressed their views and said that the hotel industry can play an important role in the promotion of tourism, but there is a need to review taxes, government policy and industry issues in this regard.
Officials said that Pakistan has more domestic tourists than international tourists, so we have to target them. Along with improving the infrastructure, we have to improve the quality of services.
