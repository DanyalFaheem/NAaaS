0,PTI moves SHC against ban  on Imran’s live speeches,"Plea says Imran is being  ""politically victimised"", ban imposed allegedly at behest of ruling party in centre.","KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Wed­nesday moved the Sindh High Court (SHC) against a ban imposed by the Pakis­tan Electronic Media Regu­latory Authority (Pemra) on the live telecast of the speeches of party chairman Imran Khan.
A two-judge bench hea­ded by Justice Mohammad Junaid Ghaffar took up the matter and directed the lawyer representing the petitioner to satisfy the court about the maintainability of the petition on Aug 26 (Friday).
The petition made the information ministry, Pemra chairman, and the Pakistan Broadcasters Association respondents in the case. 
In the petition filed by PTI provincial president Ali Zaidi, the former ruling party contended that Imran Khan was being “politically victimised” by Pemra as the ban was imposed allegedly at the behest of the ruling party in the centre to “settle outstanding political rivalries”.
It said that the notice was “illegal and in violation of Article 19 as well as Perma Ordinance” since the PTI chief was only seeking the redressal of his grievances.
The petitioner contended that the former premier had vowed to take legal action against a judge for not taking “proper action as per the law” and the Islamabad police officials in the alleged episode of Shahbaz Gill’s torture.  
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf  counsel Omer Soomro argued that Pemra “incorrectly” labeled the statement of Mr Khan about the Islamabad police and the additional sessions judge as hate speech. 
However, he added that the PTI chief and his party were intending to take legal action by filing cases against the relevant quarters of the subordinate judiciary and Islamabad police for being allegedly complicit in the extension of the physical remand of Mr Gill and “degrading physical and mental torture [of Gill] in police custody”.
The counsel further contended that seeking redressal of one’s grievance against police and lower judiciary through legal means was not akin to hatred within the scope of Section 20 and 27 of the Pemra Ordinance as alleged by the regulatory authority in the notice.
He argued that the action taken by Pemra with respect to the statement of Mr Khan was not only “punitive/strict/penal, but also suppressed the individual viewpoint which was beyond the parameters mentioned in Article 19”.
The lawyer asserted that the party chief in his speech made “no reference to any vigilante justice nor threatened the well-being of the Islamabad police and judiciary and his words were in no way prejudicial to the maintenance of law”. 
The petitioner pleaded to set aside the impugned notice and to suspend the operation of such notice till the disposal of the petition.

1,Balochistan opposition seeks relief package,"Warn on staging sit-in outside PM House,  NDMA headquarters in Islamabad if federal govt doesn't announce special package.","QUETTA: Members of the opposition parties in the Balo­ch­istan Assembly have appealed to the international community, donor agencies and the federal government to announce a special package for reconstruction and rehabilitation of rain- and flood-stricken Balochistan that suffered massive destruction. 
Speaking at a joint press conference, opposition leader Malik Sikander Khan, along with Malik Naseer Ahmed Shahwani, Akhtar Hussain Langove and Mir Zabid Reki, on Wednesday warned that if the federal government would not announce the special package, they along with the treasury members would stage a sit-in outside the PM House and NDMA headquarters in Islamabad.
They said the unprecedented torrential rains and flash floods had played havoc on Balochistan, claiming hundreds of lives and damaging infrastructure that rendered a huge population homeless in all the 34 districts, besides destroying standing crops and creating food shortage. 
They said the provincial government had no resources to compensate the people for the billions of rupees of losses and launch reconstruction and rehabilitation work in the province. 
The opposition members said they would meet the chief minister in this regard and, if necessary, would also hold a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. 
Malik Sikander said the entire province was badly affected and it immediately needed financial help for rehabilitation of the flood victims. He said JUI-F and BNP were participating in relief activities on their own, but people from other segments of society and donor agencies also need to participate in relief work at this time. 
Instead of the PDMA photo session, he said, the chief minister should use all resources in relief operation and send the pr­­ovincial ministers to the affected areas for providing relief to the people. The administrative machinery should be direc­t­­ed towards the relief of public and address their losses, he added. 
Mr Shahwani said landowners in Balochistan had suffered losses of more than Rs300 billion so far.

2,"Shah Mahmood Qureshi takes on govt for ‘focusing on Imran, not poverty’","PTI claims 288,000 people have signed up as ‘Imran Tigers’.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Wednesday lashed out at the government for apparently only focusing on filing terrorism cases against PTI Chairman Imran Khan instead of paying attention to the “back-breaking inflation” that has made the lives of people hell.
In a video statement, Mr Qureshi claimed the government was least bothered about the hardships of the people who were neck-deep in multiple crises.
“Look at the situation that they registered FIRs against Imran Khan for his just demand to take legal action against officials. We need to think if any individual or institution is above the law,” he questioned.
The former foreign minister said the “back-breaking price hike” had made the lives of the poverty-stricken masses miserable, as the inflation rate had reached a record 42 per cent and people were unable to pay their electricity bills.

PTI claims 288,000 people have signed up as ‘Imran Tigers’

He went on to say that the government’s apathy towards the masses was evident from the fact that the price of petrol was raised by Rs6 per litre when fuel prices had declined globally. Farmers were reeling from the surge in fuel price, as it was next to impossible for them to pay their tube well bills by purchasing diesel at Rs244 per litre.
Qureshi said the salaried class and all the affectees would have to raise their voices together against the unbridled inflation, adding that various organizations were already in touch with them.
Talking about the upcoming by-polls, the PTI vice chairman said: “As you are well aware that by-elections on three seats are going to be held on Sept 11 and nine seats on Sept 25, I request all my friends to stamp on the bat (the PTI election symbol) to send a clear message to the imported government against the soaring prices, incompetence and mismanagement.”
42,000 ‘Imran Tigers’ in 15 hours
According to the PTI, around 42,000 people had signed up as “Imran Tigers” in 15 hours.
On Tuesday, PTI Chairman Imran Khan had invited the youth to join the “Imran Tigers” team to convey his message of ‘real freedom’ door to door. For this purpose, the party had provided a WhatsApp number and a website for volunteers to register themselves as “Tigers”.
“Till now, 288,000 people have logged in to www.ImranTigers.com provided by PTI. For the first time in the history of Pakistan, such a large number of people were invited by any political party,” a party statement said on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, educationists, writers and artists held a press conference at the National Press Club and condemned the alleged torture on PTI leader Shahbaz Gill in police custody, and urged the chief justice of Pakistan to ensure human rights.
The demonstrators included civil society representative Sarwar Bari, anchorperson Dr Moeed Pirzada, singer Salman Ahmed, Nadia Khattak and others.
Mr Bari called the circumstances prevailing in the country “nothing but state terrorism”. He also said no television channel should be shut down and people should have the right to watch the channels of their choice.
Salman Ahmed said he had also received a notice from the FIA for allegedly spreading fake news through his social media account.
Advocate Ayesha Siddique Khan said unfortunately, people were living in an environment where they couldn’t speak up due to fear.
The speakers demanded legislation to stop torture in police custody and strict punishments for culprits.

4,ECP summons PTI leaders in  Daska by-poll saga,ISLAMABAD: As the controversy over the mysterious overnight disappearance of 20 presiding officers during the Daska...,"ISLAMABAD: As the controversy over the mysterious overnight disappearance of 20 presiding officers during the Daska by-poll in February last year continues to haunt those held responsible for the plot to rig the NA-75 election, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) issued notices to Usman Dar, then special assistant to the prime minister, Punjab chief minister’s special assistant Firdous Ashiq Awan and PTI’s central Punjab president Umar Dar to appear before it on August 30.
Three others also summoned by the ECP in the case were Asif Soni, Arif Soni and Iqbal.
The PTI leaders have been asked to explain their position about the role in ‘influencing’ the poll process on Feb 17 last year.  
The commission had also conducted a fact-finding inquiry followed by a regular inquiry against all those suspected of involvement in corrupt practices. During the proceedings of inquiry, certain facts were revealed by the witnesses and the accused, which require further investigation.
The by-election in NA-75 (Sialkot-IV) was marred by violence after two people were killed and three others injured in a firing incident at a polling station in Daska, and in a rare happening as many as 20 presiding officers remained untraceable for the entire night following the conclusion of polling.
Meanwhile, the ECP on Wednesday disposed of appeals against the fine imposed on former prime minister Imran Khan and PTI secretary general Asad Umar for committing violations of the code of conduct during local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
A four-member ECP bench heard the matter, but none appeared on behalf of Mr Khan and Mr Umar to pursue their appeals challenging the imposition of fine. Therefore, the bench disposed of their applications.  
The Dir district monitoring officer had initiated the case against the PTI leaders for violations of the code of conduct early this year.  
The commission imposed a fine of Rs50,000 each on both PTI leaders while disposing of the appeals.  
In a related development, the ECP bench dismissed a reference filed by ruling MNAs against Imran Khan with regard to alleged sale of precious gifts he had received from foreign dignitaries.  
During the hearing, the counsel for the PTI chief argued that since a similar reference filed by the National Assembly speaker was already being heard by the ECP, one of them should be quashed.  
The ECP disposed of the reference filed by the ruling lawmakers and scheduled the hearing on the Toshakhana reference moved by the NA speaker for August 29.

6,UNHCR gets $23.6m Zakat funds,"Over $11.7m in Sadaqah funds helped more than 596,000 beneficiaries in 10 countries in 2021, says report.","ISLAMABAD: The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in its 2022 annual Islamic Philanthropy report, says over $23.6 million in Zakat funds were received by the Refugee Zakat Fund in the year 2021 and more than 687,000 refugees and internally displaced people in 13 countries, including Pakistan, were assisted through the amount.
The report, released on Wednesday, said that hundred per cent Zakat distribution policy was pursued in the year 2021, assisting more than 1.2 million vulnerable beneficiaries. Similarly, over $11.7m in Sadaqah funds helped more than 596,000 beneficiaries in 10 countries.
UNHCR’s Refugee Zakat Fund distribution activities impacted lives of more than 1.2m beneficiaries in 14 countries. Generous Zakat and Sadaqah donations were received from institutional and individual donors. 
For the third year in a row, Sheikh Thani bin Abdullah bin Thani Al Thani Fund provided a sizeable portion of these donations, the report said.
In April 2019, Sheikh Thani Bin Abdullah Bin Thani Al Thani made a landmark Zakat contribution in support of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and displaced Yemenis through the fund. 
This was the largest contribution the UNHCR had ever received from an individual donor and the first major Zakat contribution of its kind in the organisation’s history.
The report said that several Islamic institutions and organisations provided additional endorsement to the governance and compliance of UNHCR’s Refugee Zakat Fund during 2021. The Muslim World League’s Islamic Fiqh Council, Al Azhar Islamic Research Academy, the International Sharia Research Academy (ISRA), and the Canadian Council of Imams (CCI) issued fatwas, further authorising UNHCR to receive and distribute Zakat among refugees and IDPs. 
Additionally, the Fiqh Majlis of Canada endorsed the receipt and distribution of Zakat towards UNHCR’s Aiming Higher Education Scholarships Programme.
In 2022, the UNHCR needs $8.99 billion to assist an expected 102.6 million refugees, IDPs and other people of concern (POCs), out of which $3.1 billion is needed in Zakat and Sadaqah to help 24.8 million refugees and IDPs. This year’s campaigns including Ramadan, Dhul Hijjah and winter will continue to be key drivers towards increasing the impact of Islamic philanthropy on the lives of vulnerable refugees and IDPs around the world.

8,Supreme Court sets aside objections to PTI pleas on voting rights,Imran seeks funding for Nadra to develop new i-voting system within a set time frame.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the court office to remove objections and place before an appropriate bench a set of petitions, separately moved by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan and Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, challenging recent amendments to the Elections Act 2017.
A two-judge SC bench comprising Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan and Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi set aside the objections raised by the registrar office with an observation that the Pakistani expatriates should be extended facilities on a priority basis as they remit around $30 billion to the country every year.
Prima facie, the matter relating to the voting rights of the overseas Pakistanis falls within the category of public importance and basic fundamental rights, the court observed. The Constitution treated them as citizens of Pakistan yet they had no say in the election arena, the court noted, while recalling a number of decisions have been announced by the court to grant rights of vote to the overseas Pakistanis.
But on the flip side, the court would also need to consider whether in view of the trichotomy of powers it could interfere in the legislative domain or not.

Imran seeks funding for Nadra to develop new i-voting system within a set time frame

Moved through Advocate Uzair Karamat Bhandari on behalf of the PTI and its chairman, the petition sought a direction for the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to provide effective right to vote to Overseas Pakistanis in the upcoming general elections besides necessary approvals and funds be granted to the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) for developing new i-voting system within a strict time frame so that it could be place for its use in the upcoming general elections.
Also, on behalf of former interior minister Sheikh Rashid, Advocate Sajeel Sheryar Swati pleaded before the apex court to declare Amendment to Section 94 of the Elections Act, 2017 ‘unconstitutional’ and order the government to allow the overseas Pakistanis to cast vote before the next general elections. The petition also argued that the vote was a constitutional right and was more fundamental than any other right as existence of a democratic society was dependent upon exercise of adult franchise.
Referring to the arguments that the right of vote to the overseas was not being granted due to the fear of rigging, the court observed, “We have proper laws to check the exercise of fake votes in rigging, also wondering if we should stop holding elections because of the fear of rigging in the elections.”
The PTI’s petition argued that questions of public importance in the petition had been raised with reference to the enforcement of fundamental rights conferred under Articles 17 (right to form association) and 25 (equality of citizens) of the Constitution. In fact the Supreme Court entertained similar petitions in its original constitutional jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution and passed 2014 and the 2018 judgments and therefore the present petition under Article 184(3) of the Constitution was competent, the petition argued.
The petition named the secretaries of parliamentary affairs, law and justice, overseas Pakistanis and human resources development and the foreign affairs, Election Commission of Pakistan and Nadra as respondents in the case.
The petitioner challenged the amendments to Section 94(1) of the Elections Act 2017, which was notified on June 22.
The PTI chairman believed that the amendments violated the fundamental rights to vote of over 10 million overseas Pakistanis as enshrined in the Constitution and as recognized by different judgments of the Supreme Court.
Also, Mr Rashid in his petition had contended that through the recent amendments in the Elections Act, the right to vote granted by the Constitution to the overseas Pakistanis had been hindered, delayed and actually blocked — something that was neither in consonance with the constitutional spirit nor democratic norms, nor could be justified on any constitutional standard.

Afzaal Hussain, originally a resident of Hujra Shah Muqeem in Okara, was one of the four victims of a recent murder spree in New Mexico. All four deceased were Muslims — two Pakistanis and two Afghans. 
“The monies will help provide a financial cushion since Afzaal was the sole family provider,” the city announced. The announcement also pointed out that Afzaal Hussain “loved education and community welfare and believed education empowers a person and a community”.
So, the funds will also be used to “initiate a quality modern school in Afzaal’s hometown in Pakistan, where poor and vulnerable children will be provided world-class education,” the city said, adding: “This was his dream.”
“We are planning to open a school in our village Hujra Shah Muqeem,” his brother Imtiaz Hussain said. “I assure you that we will utilise this fund for those who deserve it.” 
Afzaal Hussain was a former student leader at the University of New Mexico, where he studied architecture. 
He was also the first Muslim to head its alumni association. 
“It has been heart-wrenching,” said Chaitanya Korra, who was with him at the university. “He was very easy to talk to and was jovial. [Afzaal was] very kind and always ready to help.”

10,Govt expects $30m loan to tackle lumpy skin disease,"World Bank agrees to allow utilisation of undisbursed funds against $200m loan for locust control, official says.","ISLAMABAD: The World Bank is expected to approve $30 million for Pakistan to launch a comprehensive programme to control the Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) that has invaded the country’s livestock a few months ago.
The World Bank agreed to the government’s request to utilise the undisbursed funds against the loan of $200 million that was approved for the locust control project, claimed an official of the Ministry of National Food Security and Research while speaking to Dawn.
Since locust has been brought under control and there is no such threat in the near future, the government requested the World Bank to use the funds for LSD control programme.
Negotiations with the World Bank are at an advance stage, and a formal project document will soon be shared with the bank that has already evaluated the situation arising out of the LSD spreading in livestock, according to the official.

The official said the ministry sent a summary to the Economic Coordination Committee of the federal cabinet to declare emergency to tackle the spread of LSD in livestock. The ministry also requested the finance ministry to approve Rs700 million on an urgent basis for the purchase of vaccine.
Highest cases in Sindh
Statistics of LSD cases in Pakistan show the highest number of cases have been reported from Sindh, followed by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Balochistan. However, the rate of recovery of animals is also quite encouraging.
Pakistan has a total of 41,550,921 cattle population, out of which 152,270 cases were reported while 118,765 animals were recovered and 4,081 animals died of LSD. According to the latest data, 6,860,659 animals have so far been vaccinated and the mortality rate is 0.0098 per cent and morbidity rate 0.366 per cent.
Sindh had 53,668 cases followed by 46,343 cases in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 23,683 cases in Punjab, 22,225 cases in Balochistan and 6,351 cases in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Data for Gilgit-Baltistan was not available.
The Food and Agriculture Organ­ization (FAO) of the United Nations had warned the invasion of LSD on the country’s livestock that had emerged from Africa and infected animals in West Asia and Southwest Europe. The lumpy skin virus causes only in cattle and buffalo.
The ministry of national food security and research, in a statement on Wednesday, said that LSD has no public health implications, because the virus that caused the disease in cattle did not affect humans. 
Boiled milk and well-cooked meat from the affected cattle are safe for human consumption.
The ministry stated the Animal Husbandry Commissioner had already issued guidelines to the provinces that included information for the awareness of farmers and professionals related to the livestock. The government has already allowed the import of LSD vaccine for effective control in the country.
