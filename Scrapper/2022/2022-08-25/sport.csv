DUBAI: Pakistan had just finished their first training session for the Asia Cup at the ICC Academy here on Wednesday, when players from India arrived to being their practice. 
The arch-rivals are due to lock horns in a blockbuster Group ‘A’ opener on Sunday and while all talk ahead of the six-team Twenty20 tournament has surrounded that clash, Pakistan’s batting coach Mohammad Yousuf is looking beyond it. 
“The first thought is to win the Asia Cup and we’re focused on that goal,” Yousuf told reporters after the training session, when asked how the Pakistan team was gearing up for the clash. “The preparation is for the whole tournament. We’re not looking just at the India match rather we’re looking to win the whole tournament.” 
The last clash between the two teams was also in Dubai, when Pakistan beat India at the Twenty20 World Cup in October last year. That helped Pakistan end their jinx of never having won against India in a World Cup match. 
Yousuf said Pakistan players are heading into the Asia Cup high on confidence on the back of good recent results. Babar Azam’s men won three of their last four Twenty20 Inter­nationals since losing the semi-final at the World Cup to Australia last year. There have also been ODI clean sweeps over the West Indies and, more recently, the Netherlands. 
“Players have been performing, they are winning matches which is always good,” said Yousuf. “In our [coaching] roles, we’re trying to give them the best support so that they can excel on the pitch.” 
Yousuf had special praise for Pakistan captain Babar, who he reckons is doing an exceptional job both as a leader on the pitch as well as the team’s batting mainstay. 
“Babar has shown he’s a top cricketer and has performed in pressure situations to prove his greatness,” said the former batting maestro. He’s captain of the side in all three formats and continues to perform in both roles. The players respond to him and he’s performing exceptionally.” 
Pakistan are without pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi, who was ruled out of the Asia Cup due to injury. Yousuf, though, would not talk about how the team was planning to do without Shaheen nor would he comment on how his replacement Mohammad Hasnain was feeling on his return to the team as Shaheen’s replacement. 
“That’s not my domain,” he said. “You’d probably have to ask the bowling coach or the head coach about that.” 
UMAR TO ASSIST TAIT 
Meanwhile, Pakistan on Wednesday drafted in highly-rated bowling coach Umar Rashid to assist fast bowling coach Shaun Tait during the Asia Cup. 
The Pakistan Cricket Board said that Umar had been included in the player support personnel list on the recommendation of head coach Saqlain Mushtaq. 
Umar has worked with Pakistan’s emerging pacers at PCB’s National High Perfo­rmance Centre and crucially helped Hasnain in returning to international cricket after his bowling action was deemed illegal. 
Hasnain last featured for Pakistan in the T20 series against the West Indies at home in December last year and he will have a tough job on his hands to replace Shaheen, whose loss was described by Saqlain as a “big setback”.
Saqlain, however, backed his bowling unit to deliver the goods in his interview with the Press Trust of India news agency on Monday. 
“Obviously, losing Shaheen is a big setback to us before the tournament because he is someone who has proven himself at the top level and done well against the best batsmen,” Saqlain said. 
“It is never easy to replace a player like Shaheen because of his quality but the resources we have are good and we are backing them to deliver for us,” added the former spinner, who is pinning his hopes on youngsters Naseem Shah and Hasnain. 
“We are covered in all bases and though the fast bowlers are not that experienced but they have plenty of confidence and spirit.”

1,Injured Buttler eyes full fitness ahead of Pakistan T20s,He picked up a calf injury last week while playing for the Manchester Originals in The Hundred.,"LONDON: England’s white-ball captain Jos Buttler said he was aiming to return to action in next month’s seven-match T20 tour of Pakistan.
The 31-year-old is hopeful he can fully recover from a calf injury and hit top gear in time for this year’s Twenty20 World Cup in Australia.
Buttler picked up the injury last week while playing for the Manchester Originals in The Hundred and has been ruled out for the remainder of the tournament.
“It is frustrating to miss some cricket, I have really been enjoying playing,” Buttler, who missed a portion of the previous season due to an injury to his other calf, told Sky Sports in an interview published on Tuesday. 
“I actually did the same thing last year in my other calf so I had an idea what was coming. 
“I am going to be unavailable for the remainder of The Hundred unfortunately. Obviously we have got a big winter coming up with the World Cup on the horizon, we go to Pakistan before that as well. 
“I think I have to take it as it comes a little bit in the first few weeks and just manage that and hopefully maybe the back end of Pakistan and especially get fully fit for the World Cup.”  
England play three Twenty20 Internationals in Karachi before flying to Lahore for the remaining three from September 20 to October 2. 
The T20 World Cup will take place in Australia from Oct. 16-Nov. 13.

2,VVS Laxman named India’s interim coach for Asia Cup,Head coach Rahul Dravid tests positive for Covid-19.,"DUBAI: V.V.S. Laxman will take over as India’s interim coach for the Asia Cup after head coach Rahul Dravid tested positive for Covid-19, the country’s cric­ket board (BCCI) said on Wednesday. 
Laxman, who is also the head of cricket at the Nati­onal Cricket Academy, had led the second-string side that beat Zimbabwe in a three-match One-day Intern­ational series this month. 
Dravid tested positive on Tuesday before the team’s departure to the United Arab Emirates and will join them once he tests negative and is cleared by the BCCI medical team. 
“Laxman... will oversee the team’s preparation in the absence of Rahul Dravid, who tested positive for Covid-19 before the team’s departure to the UAE,” BCCI secretary Jay Shah said in a statement. 
“Laxman has linked up with the squad in Dubai along with vice-captain KL Rahul, Deepak Hooda and Avesh Khan, who travelled from Harare.” 
Dravid will join the team in UAE once he tests negative and is cleared by the BCCI Medical Team. 
The squad, led by Rohit Sharma, assembled in the UAE on Tuesday for the six-nation tournament, which also serves as a warm-up for the T20 World Cup in October. 
India will begin their Asia Cup defence with Sunday’s blockbuster clash against arch-rivals Pakistan in the six-team Twenty20 tournament. The tournament begins on Saturday, with Sri Lanka taking on Afghan­istan.

MANCHESTER: Ollie Robin­son, who last played for England in the final Ashes Test in January, has been recalled for the second Test with South Africa as the hosts bid to level the three-match series.
Sussex paceman Robinson replaces Matthew Potts for the match at Old Trafford which starts on Thursday. 
“Everything that we’ve seen in training and how he’s (Robinson) been around the group is exactly what we want,” said England captain Ben Stokes. “We all know the quality of bowler he is, because when he’s played for England his skill set is incredible.” 
Stokes added that Potts had taken the news remarkably well after playing in the previous five Tests. 
“For a 23-year-old to understand the bigger picture and not be throwing his toys out the pram was something that I think shouldn’t be overlooked,” said Stokes.
England will need a considerably improved performance following the innings and 12 runs thrashing inside three days at Lord’s in the first Test.
Robinson has 39 wickets in nine Tests at an average of21.28.
Following a poor Ashes series, where his approach to fitness were questioned in public by the England coaching staff, Robinson missed the subsequent tour of the West Indies with back spasms.
He was due to play for a County Select XI against New Zealand in May, only to miss out with a stiff back, before a bout of Covid-19 caused him to spend more time on the sidelines.
Stokes said he had spoken frankly to Robinson about his attitude to fitness. 
“I feel that’s something people deserve,” said Stokes. “Rather than just have a conversation to get through it easy, I’d rather let him know exactly where I stand. 
“It enables him to go away and work on what has been asked of him. All I can say is he’s done that to the absolute extreme. 
“All the feedback Robbo has got from myself, the coach, the people who have helped him get where he is now, has been nothing but positive.” 
Stokes has also retained faith with opener Zak Crawley despite another poor outing at Lord’s — scoring nine and 13.
In 35 innings as a Test opener, Crawley averages 22.25.
England’s defeat last weekend against the top-ranked Test side ended a run of four successive victories under red ball head coach Brendon McCullum and Stokes.
South African captain Dean Elgar believed his team’s fearsome pace attack will only get better as he admitted he was unsure of what the wicket holds for the second Test.
South Africa needed only 82.4 overs to take England’s 20 wickets in the first Test, with the majority of the damage done by the pace quartet of Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Lungi Ngidi and Marco Jansen. 
“I reckon they can get much better, theyre still pretty fresh,” Elgar told reporters on Wednesday. 
“The wicket assisted them at Lords, we must take that into account, but you have to put the ball in the right areas and they did that. 
“Our bowlers are leading our pack at the moment and they’re extremely hungry for success. The competition among them is brilliant and the way they go about things is the most professional behaviour Ive seen from fast bowlers.”  
Elgar suggested the tourists would likely retain the same XI for the second Test, with only spinner Simon Harmer a potential addition to the side, though there is not an obvious candidate for him to replace with Keshav Maharaj having also bowled well at Lord’s. 
“We have our 12, the same as the first Test and we decide on the day,” Elgar said.
He also admitted they expect a much-improved home team in the second Test with the series on the line. 
England XI: Zak Crawley, Alex Lees, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes, Ben Foakes, Stuart Broad, Jack Leach, Ollie Robinson and James Anderson.

4,"Caribbean conquered, NZ turn focus to Australia","BRIDGETOWN: After breaking new ground in the Caribbean, New Zealand have little time to rest before heading to...","BRIDGETOWN: After breaking new ground in the Caribbean, New Zealand have little time to rest before heading to Australia for a One-day International series that was repeatedly shelved due to Covid-19.
The Black Caps were midway through a three-day journey home on Wednesday after a fruitful tour of West Indies, where they notched their first one-day and T20 series wins against the hosts.
They will have a week’s break at home in New Zealand but then head back to Australia for another one-day series as they look to continue their winning momentum in the lead-up to the T20 World Cup in the same country.
New Zealand’s last white-ball tour of Australia ended abruptly in March, 2020, as the pandemic brought a halt to global sport.
Multiple attempts to reschedule the one-day Chappell-Hadlee Trophy backfired as governments in both countries slammed their borders shut and placed onerous quarantine demands on international arrivals.
With the last restrictions lifted this year, the three-match series can finally go ahead in Cairns from Sept. 6. 
“Every time we come up against the Australians, we have some pretty good games,” said New Zealand all-rounder Mitch Santner, man-of-the-series against West Indies in the one-day component. 
“We obviously haven’t played the series in a little bit now... We’ve played a lot of cricket but the week at home will be nice to get the lads freshened up, ready to go for another Chappell-Hadlee series.”  
Apart from the trophy, there is little at stake in the One-day International series, but both squads will have plenty of players set to feature in the T20 World Cup in October-November.
Beaten by Australia in last year’s T20 World Cup final in the United Arab Emirates, New Zealand will especially relish the chance to get one over their trans-Tasman rivals ahead of the global showpiece.

Number two seed Momota, whose career has been in free fall since a car crash more than two years ago left him badly hurt, limped out after another meek performance in front of a stunned crowd in Tokyo.
Momota, once badminton’s undisputed king, won a record 11 titles in 2019.
Prannoy will play in the next round against his Indian compatriot Lakshya Sen, who advanced with a 21-17, 21-10 win over Spain’s Luis Enrique Penalver.
Malaysian number five seed Lee Zii Jia also booked his place in the next round with a comfortable 21-9, 21-12 win over Portugal’s Bernardo Atilano.
Lee is aiming to become the first Malay­sian ever to win a world badminton title.
Defending champion Loh Kean Yew of Singapore had to fend off a furious second-game fightback from Guatemala’s Kevin Cordon before closing out their contest 21-12, 11-21, 21-12.

6,Players body flags talent drain from international game to T20 leagues,NEW DELHI: The head of the global cricketers union (FICA) warns the drain of talent from the international game to...,"NEW DELHI: The head of the global cricketers union (FICA) warns the drain of talent from the international game to Twenty20 leagues is a bigger concern than ever and the official 2023-2027 calendar will do nothing to address the issue.
Mushrooming T20 leagues have turned cricket’s labour market on its head, presenting a scenario where players can earn significantly more from these gigs than they possibly can from international cricket. 
“We have highlighted flight of talent away from international cricket as a critical issue for the game for a number of years, and it is now starting to impact on bigger countries, not just the smaller ones,” FICA chief executive Tom Moffat told Reuters. 
“Solutions to this issue require collective global thinking, collaboration, and compromise, to ensure a balanced global calendar that enables international cricket and domestic leagues to co-exist.”  
New Zealand pace bowler Trent Boult may already have set the trend earlier this month when he negotiated a “significantly reduced role” with the national team so he could prioritise Twenty20 cricket.
Many prominent West Indies players have turned Twenty20 freelancers, while the top Afghan players are mostly seen in franchise cricket.
Franchise-based Twenty20 leagues, offering fast-paced action and live music often with cheerleaders around, have proliferated especially after the success of the trend-setting Indian Premier League.
Competition among those leagues is only going to raise the money on offer and make them even more attractive for players tiring of the rigours of international cricket.
Leading players from top countries are clearly already struggling to cope with the demands of international cricket’s packed calendar.
South Africa’s wicket-keeper/batsman Quinton de Kock quit Test cricket last year, while England Test captain Ben Stokes dropped the 50-overs format last month citing an “unsustainable” workload.
NO RESPITE 
The International Cricket Council’s Future Tours Programme (FTP) for the next four years promises no respite, if anything packing in more international cricket than the previous cycle. 
“With this FTP, we have ended up with another situation of everyone wanting more of everything,” Moffat said. 
“Cricket has a small player employment market it’s the same group of players that are in high demand in both the domestic leagues and international cricket landscapes.   
“There is no doubt that the volume of cricket is unlikely to be sustainable for multi-format players, especially in the big countries, moving forward,” Moffat added.
The leagues themselves are jostling with each other in their battle for eyeballs.
Come January and two new Twenty20 competitions, in the United Arab Emirates and South Africa, will clash with the Big Bash League and the Bangladesh Premier League.
Asked if ICC should regulate those leagues, Moffat said member boards had always been fiercely protective about their own competitions. “Ultimately the game needs to make a decision as to whether it wants to come together to meaningfully regulate domestic leagues at a global level through the ICC,” he said. 
“When these discussions have previously taken place, countries have wanted control over their own territories.”

7,Jacobs and Warholm denied Diamond League finals wildcards,PARIS: Olympic champions Marcell Jacobs and Karsten Warholm have had the door closed on their hopes of a wild card...,"PARIS: Olympic champions Marcell Jacobs and Karsten Warholm have had the door closed on their hopes of a wild card entry for next month’s Diamond League finals in Zurich.
Jacobs, the 27-year-old Ital­ian who won the 100m in Tokyo, has been kept out of the Diamond League this sea­son by illness and injury but said after winning the Eur­opean title last week that he wanted a chance to have a go at the best Ameri­can sprinters.
His hopes of beating them and winning the world title disappeared when he withdrew before the semi-finals of last month’s world championships in Oregon.
Zurich’s co-meeting director Andreas Hediger said there was no way round the rules to allow either Jacobs or Norwegian 400m hurdles world record holder Karsten Warholm to compete in the climax to the season on September 7/8.
Hediger added Jacobs’s entourage had been told this.
“The Diamond League qualification rules state that there is only one qualification for the finals via collecting points at the 13 series meetings,” he said told AFP in an email.
“The best 6-10 athletes [depending on the discipline] according to the collected points then qualify for the final.
“There is no other way, no one can be invited who has not qualified. One can disagree in good faith about the sense or nonsense of this rule and it is also regularly discussed within the Diam­o­nd League.
“Currently, the majority opinion is that an athlete who has not earned any points during the season in the WDL should not take the ‘cherry off the cake’ from the other athletes at the finals, regardless of why no points were or could be earned.”
Warholm’s preparations for the world championships were also blighted by injury that restricted the Norwe­gian to the world championships.
Winners of each Diamond League discipline receive a trophy and $30,000.

8,Indian federation asks FIFA to lift suspension,MUMBAI: India’s football association has asked world governing body FIFA to lift the suspension imposed on it ...,"MUMBAI: India’s football association has asked world governing body FIFA to lift the suspension imposed on it after the mandate of a court-appointed committee to govern the sport in the country was terminated this week.
India’s highest court disbanded the All India Football Federation (AIFF) in May and appointed a three-member committee to govern the sport, amend the body’s constitution and conduct elections that have been pending for 18 months.
FIFA banned the AIFF this month, citing  “undue influence from third parties” and said the suspension would be lifted once the national body regains full control of its daily affairs.
On Monday, India’s Supreme Court ruled that the committee’s mandate  “stands terminated” and the day-to-day management of the country’s football affairs will be handed back to the AIFF.
In a letter sent to FIFA Secretary General Fatima Samoura on Tuesday said that the AIFF apprised the world governing body of the court’s ruling.
“We request the FIFA... to reconsider their decision of suspending the AlFF,” Sunando Dhar, AIFF’s acting general secretary, wrote in the letter.
“Since the conditions set out in your letter for lifting of the suspension stand satisfied, we request that a order to that effect be passed at the earliest for the AIFF to continue with the smooth running of football in India.”  
FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the AIFF letter.
India is scheduled to host the Under-17 women’s World Cup from Oct 11-30 but their hosting right is under threat due to the FIFA suspension.
The elections of the AIFF, formerly led by FIFA Council member Praful Patel, were to be held by December 2020 but were delayed due to an impasse over amendments to its constitution.
The AIFF elections are currently scheduled to be held early next month.

“I am absolutely thrilled at reuniting with my mate Javed Miandad at the Pakistan Junior League with whom I cherish some great memories from our playing days,” Richard’s said in a Pakistan Cricket Board statement.
“I think the Pakistan Junior League is a tremendous tool for further consolidating Pakistan cricket’s foundations by unearthing and developing quality talent.”
Richards has also been a part of Pakistan Super League side Quetta Gladiators’ campaign in six of seven PSL seasons and also helped them win the title in 2019.
COACHES HIRED
The PCB also announced the hiring of five foreign coaches for its Pathway Cricket Programme’s coaching project on Wednesday. The first phase of the programme is set to start at the National High Performance Centre here later this week, said a PCB statement.
“The PCB and Engro Corporation entered a three-year agreement earlier this year, on the basis of which, Engro Corporation is sponsoring the foreign coaches involved in the programme,” it added.
“South Africa’s Gordon Parsons and New Zealand’s Nicholas Webb join Julian Fountain, Julian Wood and Toby Radford who all hail from the United Kingdom.”
“The five coaches will provide specialist coaching and training to the participants in batting, bowling and fielding disciplines with a special emphasis on enhancing the power-hitting, spin and pace bowling skills.”

Nicolas Otamendi and Rafa Silva also scored in the first half as Benfica won 3-0 in the second leg in Lisbon for a 5-0 aggregate win. 
“From the first second we wanted to win and showed it. Now we are happy to be in the Champions League,” Benfica coach Roger Schmidt said as his side qualified for the 12th time in 13 seasons. “Let’s wait for the draw and then we’ll see. It’s never easy. I’m happy because we deserve it.” 
Dynamo, a storied name in European football, haven’t played a domestic game all year because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Champions League qualifiers are the only matches Dynamo have played and they beat Fenerbahce and Sturm Graz to get to the final round. 
The Ukrainian league started its new season earlier on Tuesday with Shakhtar Donetsk and Metalist 1925 drawing 0-0 inside Kyiv’s Olympic Stadium, which has a capacity of 65,500 but was without spectators amid the war. Dynamo’s first league game is on Sunday. 
Ukraine will have representation in Thursday’s group-stage draw in Istanbul through Shakhtar, who earned their place by being top of the Ukrainian league when it was abandoned last season because of the war. 
While Dynamo head into the Europa League group stage, Benfica — the European champions in 1961 and ’62 — will be part of Thursday’s draw along with Maccabi Haifa and Viktoria Plzen, who also qualified Tuesday. 
Milan Pavkov’s 90th minute own goal secured Maccabi’s spot as they beat Red Star Belgrade 5-4 over two legs. 
Jan Kliment’s 73rd minute effort booked Czech outfit Plzen’s place in the draw as they beat Azeris Qarabag by the same score on aggregate. 
The Dynamo players took to the pitch at the Estadio da Luz draped in the Ukrainian flag in a message of support to their compatriots back home. 
Dynamo were already trailing 2-0 from the first leg and they were always on the back foot against last season’s quarter-finalists. 
Neres set up the first goal in the 27th minute as his deep cross picked out former Manchester City defender Otamendi, who drifted away from his marker and emphatically headed home in front of a crowd of more than 58,000. 
Silva profited from a defensive mistake as he intercepted Oleksandr Syrota’s wayward pass and produced a neat finish. 
Goncalo Ramos then picked out Neres, who brilliantly bent the ball into the net to wrap up the scoring for the home side before half-time. 
In the second half Enzo Fernandez’s close-range effort was saved by Dynamo goalkeeper Georgiy Bushchan as Benfica wrapped up a convincing win. 
Maccabi were gifted an own-goal in the final minute to claim a 2-2 draw with 1991 European champions Red Star, securing a return to the Champions League for the first time since 2009-10. 
In that campaign, Maccabi lost all six games and didn’t score a goal. 
Aleksandar Pesic and Mirko Ivanic had put the Serbian side ahead in the tie but it was in the balance again when Daniel Sundgren pulled a goal back for Haifa just before halftime. 
It looked headed for extra time until the unfortunate Pavkov sliced the ball into his own net at a free kick. 
Plzen, who were last in the group stage in 2019, also came from behind to beat Qarabag 2-1 to book a place in the lucrative group stage. 
Second-half goals from Jan Kopic and Jan Kliment handed Plzen the win after Filip Ozobic had put the visitors in front after 38 minutes.

Djokovic has refused to take the vaccine and appears set to miss out on the year’s last Grand Slam due to current US rules that require travellers to show proof of full vaccination to board flights to and enter the United States.
The Serbian previously said he was prepared to miss Grand Slam tournaments that require participating players to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Djokovic remains on the entry list for the Aug 29-Sept 11 tournament in New York.
“I don’t think it’s fair,” McEnroe told reporters on Tuesday.  “I think it’s a joke.
“I would have had the vaccine and gone and played but he’s got very strong beliefs and you have to respect that.
“At this point, in the pandemic, we’re two-and-a-half years in, I think people in all parts of the world know more about it, and the idea that he can’t travel here to play, to me is a joke.”  Djokovic was unable to defend his Australian Open crown this year after being deported from the country over his vaccination status in January.
Rafa Nadal claimed victory in the tournament in Melbourne to move clear of Djokovic and Roger Federer with his 21st major trophy. Nadal then went on to add another Grand Slam title to his tally at the French Open, keeping him ahead of Djokovic, who won Wimbledon last month.
When asked if Djokovic’s chances of finishing above his rivals in terms of Grand Slam victories were being affected by his absences from major tournaments, McEnroe said,  “that’s the question that we all want to know the answer to.” 
“Obviously, Rafa Nadal has benefited from that. If a guy has won the Australian Open eight or nine times, you would think (Djokovic blew) a chance in a way.
“These three guys are already above everyone else. Rafa was able to pull off a miraculous win that not many people expected in Australia. Novak got there at Wimbledon and then Rafa got hurt.”

Marco Silva’s side are 83 places above League Two Crawley and beat Brentford 3-2 in the Premier League on Saturday. 
But the Fulham manager’s decision to make 10 changes backfired badly at the Broadfield Stadium as struggling Crawley upset the form book. 
Former Fulham striker Kevin Betsy, who has taken only a single point from his first five matches as Crawley manager, masterminded a memorable victory thanks to goals from Tom Nichols and Liverpool loanee James Balagizi. 
Silva handed debuts to Issa Diop, Marlon Fossey and 17-year-old academy graduate Luke Har­ris, while Shane Duffy and Kevin Mbabu made their first starts. 
But Fulham fell behind with 16 minutes on the clock when Nichols took Ashley Nadesan’s pass and drilled a low left-footed drive across Marek Rodak into the far corner. 
Just four minutes into the second half, Fulham midfielder Tyrese Francois conceded possession deep inside his own half and Balagizi seized on Nichols’ reverse pass to slot home. 
“From the first minute they wanted it more than us. We lost a bit of control of the game and started to make some mistakes, then they scored and everything was more difficult for us,” Silva said. 
The Premier League clubs involved in this season’s Euro­pean competitions have a bye into the third round, leaving the spotlight on Everton, Leicester City and Aston Villa in the other second round ties. 
Everton avoided any slip-up as they beat third-tier Fleetwood Town 1-0 to claim their first win of the season. Frank Lampard’s struggling side edged through to round three thanks to Demarai Gray’s 28th-minute goal. 
Leicester, who like Everton have started the season poorly, gained some relief as they scraped through 3-1 on penalties against Stockport County after a 0-0 draw. 
Steven Gerrard’s Villa fell behind at third-tier Bolton Wand­erers but hit back to win 4-1. 
The Premier League side were stunned as Dion Charles gave third tier Bolton a 24th-minute lead, but Douglas Luiz levelled directly from a corner. 
Danny Ings put Villa ahead with a 62nd-minute penalty and further goals from Lucas Digne and Leon Bailey eased Villa into the third round. 
Premier League Bournemouth required penalties to knock out Norwich City who were relegated from the top-flight last season. Norwich were poised for the third round as they led 2-1 at Carrow Road but Brooklyn Genesini equalised in stoppage time before the visitors won the shootout 5-3.

The changes represent the PGA Tour’s most serious response to the threat posed by the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf series that launched in June and has lured some big-name players away from the US-based circuit with staggering sums of money.
In announcing the changes, Monahan said he was inspired by the PGA Tour members and singled out those who held a players-only meeting last week to discuss a number of proposals in the face of the LIV Golf threat.
“It’s important to understand that this process represents a remarkable moment for the PGA Tour and showcases the essence of what being a membership organisation is all about,” Monahan said ahead of the season-ending Tour Championship in Atlanta.
“Those players rallied together to strengthen the tour platform, recognising that if fans are going to invest in the PGA Tour it means a hell of a lot more if they know the players are investing right back.”
Monahan said the top players, assuming they qualify, have agreed to at least a 20-event schedule consisting of the four majors, The Players Championship, three FedExCup events and 12  “elevated events”.
An additional four  “elevated events” that will have an average purse of $20 million are still to be announced.
For the 2022-23 season, a  “top player” will be defined as those who finish in the top 20 under the current Player Impact Program as well as those who finish in the top 20 under the revised criteria for the bonus pool.
The PGA Tour’s Player Impact Program, which was implemented in 2021 as way to compensate the 10 players judged through a series of metrics to drive the most fan and sponsor engagement, will reward 20 players for 2022 and 2023.
Eligible players who do not compete in the minimum required number of tournaments will be ineligible to receive any payout as part of the Player Impact Program.
So far, LIV Golf has scooped five of players who finished among the top-10 of the inaugural Player Impact Programme, a group that consists of Phil Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka and Bubba Watson.
When asked if players who joined LIV might want to return to the PGA Tour after seeing the latest changes, Monahan said he would not lift their suspensions.
“No. They’ve joined the LIV Golf series and they’ve made that commitment and for most of them they’ve made multi-year commitments,” said Monahan.
“As I have been clear throughout, every player has a choice and I respect their choice but they’ve made it, we’ve made ours, we’re going to continue to focus on the things we can control and get stronger and stronger.
“And I think they understand that.”
Among the other changes, the PGA Tour announced an  “earnings assurance programme” that guarantees players at the developmental Korn Ferry Tour priority category and above will earn at least $500,000.
The PGA Tour also said it will launch a travel stipend program that will see players receive $5,000 for every missed cut for non-exempt members.
