There was cheer all around on Sunday with churches decorated with colourful lights; midnight services were followed by morning services at churches of various places in the garrison city. 
The largest gathering was held at St. Joseph’s Cathedral. 
Congregations were informed about the birth and teachings of Jesus Christ and people prayed for peace and establishment of brotherhood throughout the world. Christmas trees were adorned with sparkling decorations and special meals were prepared.
Some members of the Christian community said spicy biryani and fried chicken was a favourite during the celebrations. 
“Singing parties and decoration in homes on Christmas was the main part of celebrations. Some people also arranged private family parties and visits to parks,” said Farooq Bhatti, a resident of Saddar. 
He said people also exchanged gifts on this day, adding during the last two years Christmas was celebrated inside homes while there were less activities in churches. 
He said children were especially thrilled as they had been bound to their houses and localities in the last two years. 
“The residents of slum areas are poor but everyone tries to take part in Christmas celebrations wholeheartedly and give gifts to their children according to their financial position,” said Eman Shaukat, a resident of Bhatta Naik Alam near Holy Family Hospital.  
He said that despite harsh weather, people gathered at Holy Family Hospital Church and offered their religious rituals, adding that the people faced problems due to low pressure of natural gas in their homes. 
The district administration sent cakes in all churches with good wishes to the community.  
The police made elaborate arrangements for security outside and inside churches by deploying personnel. 
The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), Rawalpindi Waste Management Company (RWMC), Rawalpindi and Chaklala Cantonment Boards held a ceremony for over 4,000 sanitation workers who belong to the Christian community.

2,CDA to engage Survey of Pakistan for fresh demarcation,Names being considered for zoning commission likely to be headed by retired high court judge.,"ISLAMABAD: In order to materialise its plan to amend regulations for Zone III, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has decided to engage the Survey of Pakistan for the “demarcation of Margalla Hills National Park and Zone III”.
Similarly, the CDA is mulling names for a commission, which will likely be headed by a retired judge, to make changes to zoning regulations.
Sources claimed that names of a retired high court judge, former general, National University of Science and Technology (Nust) faculty members, town planners and environmentalists are being considered for the proposed commission. They claimed that demarcation would be completed before the demarcation by the Survey of Pakistan.
“We have requested Survey of Pakistan for demarcation of boundaries,” said a senior official of the CDA. He said the CDA had also prepared estimates for boundary markers which would be erected after the survey report.

Names being considered for zoning commission likely to be headed by retired high court judge

Asked about the previous demarcation, the official said the CDA had completed the demarcation of reserve forests and military grassing land that falls in Margalla Hills and added that the civic agency did not have land falling in Zone III and Margalla Hills demarcated.
“Therefore, we have requested Survey of Pakistan for proper demarcation of the entire Margalla Hills and acquired land,” he said. Zone III, comprising about 50,000 acres, is spread over the Margalla national park area and private land. Out of the total area, at least 20,000 acres of land is private without any rules and regulations.
Commission for Zone III
The CDA board had decided to make changes to the zoning regulations for Zone III last month and a committee under the supervision of member planning was formed in this regard. However, sources said now instead of CDA’s committee, the changes will be made by the proposed commission.
Recently, the planning wing had prepared draft regulations under which it was proposed that old villages located in Margalla Hills would be preserved and there will be a ban on further development work in the area. The sources said the planning wing’s proposals would be shared with the proposed commission as well.
According to sources, Gokina, Talhar and Shahdara, which have not been acquired by the CDA, would be preserved. As per the proposals in the planning wing, the villagers would be provided civic facilities and asked to refrain from carrying out further development work in the vicinity.
According to sources, there would be no forced acquisition despite a ban on construction in the area. They added that locals would be informed that if they wanted to sell their lands, the civic agency would procure it for preservation.
Similarly, the sources said, it had been proposed that private areas which belonged to the locals such as Shah Allah Ditta will be included in Zone I and could be given a new name of Zone I-A.
Kot Hatyal and Bhara Kahu will be added to Zone IV with the addition of a new sub-zone. Similarly, as per the proposals, the area along Murree Road near Rawal Dam Chowk, where construction had already taken place, will also be made part of Zone IV.
The commission will also look into the issue of construction, including CDA’s housing schemes, already taken place within the two-kilometre radius of Rawal Dam. It may be noted that according to existing regulations, there is a ban on construction within two kilometres of the dam area.
As sources claimed that proposed amendments to zoning regulations would provide relief to the public, an official said commercial housing projects should not be allowed in Zone III.
There were reports that a top bureaucrat has been pushing the CDA to make changes to zoning regulations, but CDA denied these claims.

Fog and poor visibility-affected flights are being diverted to the IIA from Lahore, Multan and Sialkot.
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)’s task force constituted to facilitate passengers of diverted, cancelled or delayed flights due to the weather conditions at the IIA has been under pressure, but handling the situation very well, said a CAA spokesman.
He said due to the diverted departure and arrival flights, rush was a natural phenomenon.

Since Dec 21, more than 30 flights landed at IIA from other cities due to fog, says official

“The airport management is dealing with a somewhat difficult situation. The airport has full capacity to deal with all kinds of situations.”
The spokesman said they had accommodated 32 diverted arrival flights and handled 7,030 passengers from December 21 to December 25.
In addition, the CAA accommodated the same 32 flights for departure and handled a flow of more than 7,000 passengers of diverted flights.
He said the CAA had accommodated these flights while maintaining and facilitating the scheduled flights at the IIA without any significant delays or major hurdles.
The CAA has constituted the task force, led by the airport manager, for handling passengers of delayed, cancelled or diverted flights due to foggy weather.
The decision to form the task force was taken for the convenience of passengers of fog-affected flights at major airports of the country.
He said every year in the winter season poor visibility and thick fog caused delays, cancellation or diversion of flights leading to congestion at airports and inconvenience to passengers.
He said the task force was working to ensure coordination with airlines, Federal Investigation Agency and the Airport Security Force for timely clearance of passengers.
It also communicates with the traffic police so that there was no rush in the car parking and pick and drop lanes.
Besides, the task force coordinates with airlines’ staff to make arrangements for accommodation and food and transport facilities for passengers
Providing meteorological information (weather updates) to passengers and airport operators through electronic media for the benefit of passengers and visitors is also among its tasks.
The task force will ensure up-to-date information on flight information display systems and vigilant manpower at the airport during low visibility conditions.

4,IHC to move to new building next month,"At present, the IHC is functioning in a building in G-10, which was originally intended to house the district courts.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) is likely to be shifted to a new building on Constitution Avenue in G-5 next month.
Sources privy to the development told Dawn that the shifting process was scheduled to commence during the last week of December, however, the contractor failed to meet the deadline of handing over the premises for varied reasons.
According to sources, delay in the shipment of information technology-related equipment was another reason for the delay.
The sources, however, said the installation of necessary equipment, furniture and other gadgets would be completed by next month after which the IHC administration would start transferring record to the new building.
The administration has already devised the strategy of shifting voluminous judicial record, decided and pending petitions to the newly-constructed building.
In 2012, the Capital Development Authority had approved allotment of five acres for the IHC building.
Previously, the construction work on the new IHC building had hit snag in April 2015 when the allegations related to lack of transparency in the pre-qualification of the contractor firm ‘Interhome’ came to the fore.
The contract was cancelled for not being in accordance with rules of Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (Pepra).
At present, the IHC is functioning in a building in G-10, which was originally intended to house the district courts. It is expected the present building of the IHC will be handed over to the Sessions Division (East) of Islamabad. 
The sessions division (West) of Islamabad will be shifted to the newly-built District Court Complex in a couple of months as the building is being furnished these days.

5,"S.Korea wants to enhance cooperation in IT, energy sectors: envoy",TAXILA: South Korean Ambassador Suh Sangpyo has said his country was keen on enhancing manpower export to Pakistan...,"TAXILA: South Korean Ambassador Suh Sangpyo has said his country was keen on enhancing manpower export to Pakistan increasing cooperation in the energy and information technology (IT) sectors to boost trade and economic relations. 
Talking to journalists, Mr Sangpyo said Korea had increased manpower export from Pakistan from 1,500 to 2,500 per annum.
“I have proposed to the Korean government to additionally incorporate the construction sector as a viable occupation alongside the existing manufacturing sector within the employment permit system to employ more Pakistani workers,” he added. 
Mr Sangpyo said diplomatic relations between the two countries were based on bilateral diplomatic and trade ties that had deep roots in history and the Korean government was keen on enhancing its contribution in trade, investments, education, culture and sports. 
The envoy said Pakistani stakeholders should reinvest $1,000 million, which was provided by the Korean government under Framework Arrangement (2022-26), for execution of various development projects in health, communication, agriculture and energy with a special focus on information technology. 
He said as Pakistan’s economy had faced much tide in recent years, therefore, keeping in view the Korean model, the amount should be re-invested to benefit from this multi-million package to stabilise and reshape the economy.
The envoy said the Korean government was providing assistance to set up an IT park in Pakistan to train IT professionals in the country, adding that construction of this park was one of the key projects of the Economic Development Cooperation Fund of the South Korean government.
“Apart from this, the number of Pakistani students enrolled in Korean educational institutions is increasing with each passing day,” he said, adding that establishing a manufacturing unit of smart phones in Pakistan by a Korean company would further strengthen economic and trade ties between the two friendly countries.
He said that the Pakistani business community should explore more trade opportunities in Korea to strengthen trade besides overcoming their trade deficit as Pakistan imports South Korean products worth $1.5 billion each year while its exports stand at $400 million. 
These figures are proof of the fact that it is causing a bilateral trade deficit of approximately $1.1 billion and the Korean government is willing to facilitate Pakistani exporters of goods and services to bridge the gap, he added. 
Over the past 60 years, South Korea has increased its gross domestic product (GDP) by 410 fold and Pakistan should join hands with the Korean government to follow this role model.

The government will lose billions of rupees in terms of sales tax due to the reduced business hours.
In a statement, RCCI President Saqib Rafiq said that stakeholders should be consulted before making such an announcement, adding early closure of businesses, especially hotel, restaurants or food service, will add to the suffering of the masses.
He said that it was appreciable that the government was concerned about saving energy, which was a good initiative, but the government’s revenue of electricity bills may decrease due to reduction in power consumption during peak hours.
He demanded that the government should focus on finding an amicable solution to the problem by holding talks with all the stakeholders and avoid imposing unilateral decisions.
“Reduced business hours will further stagnate the economy and reduce revenues,” he added.
He said the business community was aware of the current economic situation, however, it was necessary to formulate policies in consultation with stakeholders.
The decision to close shops early to save electricity was also taken in the past but it had not yielded any significant benefit or results, rather officials of the district administration resorted to harassment, he added.
The RCCI president suggested that working hours should be fixed by consensus, applicable to all types of markets and shopping malls in the federal capital and all provinces.

10,CDA completes over 50pc work on Bhara Kahu bypass project,Work on QAU portion also expedited after dismissal of court case,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Sunday stated that more than 50pc work on Bhara Kahu bypass had been completed.
“Work on Bhara Kahu bypass is in full progress. More than 50 per cent of the work is completed. This project will reduce traffic congestion and pollution and will also facilitate the tourists going towards Murree,” the CDA tweeted on Sunday following the visit of its chairman to the construction site.
The CDA chairman, retired Capt Mohammad Usman, along with Member Engineering Syed Munawar Shah and others visited the project site.
The member engineering and director Rana Tariq briefed the chairman about the progress on the project.

Work on QAU portion also expedited after dismissal of court case

Sources said the CDA chairman directed the engineering wing to complete the project as soon as possible.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif while inaugurating the project in September this year had directed the CDA to complete it till February 10.
The sources said work was going on round the clock but it seemed the mega project cannot be completed by Feb 10. The sources said even if the project of around six kilometres road, which has one interchange, a bridge, three underpasses and more than one km flyover, was completed by the end of March it will be a big achievement for the CDA.
An official said after seeing the scope of the work, he believed that the project could not be completed till April 15.
The bypass project worth Rs6.5 billion starts from Malpur and also crosses from Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) land.
According to the CDA, 199 kanal land of the university falls in the alignment of the road while CDA in return has already offered 225 kanals to the QAU. However, the project faced controversy when QAU faculty members filed a court case and obtained a stay order which continued for around two months.
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) recently dismissed the petition of the faculty members. Following this, the CDA expedited the work at the QAU portion. Meanwhile, the QAU filed an intra-court appeal in the IHC.
The 5.6 km-long road (including a 1km flyover) starts from Murree Road at Malpur and culminates on Murree Road near the Jugi bus stop adjacent to Punjab Cash and Carry in Bhara Kahu from where the flyover begins till the end of the local bazaar towards Murree.
A CDA official said 100pc pile work had been completed and now the civic agency was focusing on pile capping work while underpasses were also near completion.

12,Action against violators of smog SOPs in full swing,RAWALPINDI: The administration is taking strict action in accordance with law against the violators of smog standard...,"RAWALPINDI: The administration is taking strict action in accordance with law against the violators of smog standard operating procedures (SOPs) and lodged 46 first information reports (FIRs) besides imposing fines amounting to Rs1 million on them during anti-smog operations conducted in the Rawalpindi Division in December.
Commissioner (Rawalpindi Division) Saqib Manan said that the officials concerned had been directed to ensure surveillance of the industrial units in their respective areas and also penalise owners of brick kilns for not using modern technology.
The industrial units causing pollution would be dealt with iron hands, he said, adding action would be taken against operators of units for using bad quality fuel or burning old tyres for fuel. The commissioner said efforts were also being made to take action against stone crushers, owners of brick kilns and vehicles for emitting smoke.
It is pertinent to mention here that with the onset of winter in November, smog started to increase, causing air pollution in different cities of Punjab including in Rawalpindi district. The government had formulated a 10-point policy to control pollution, which would remain in force until further notice. Fines against smog emissions have also been increased.
The government had issued a notification banning the burning of all types of crops and garbage, smoke-emitting vehicles, factories, brick kilns and stone-crushing plants in all districts including in the Rawalpindi district.
Transportation of uncovered building material, traffic obstructing parking and all types of dust-blowing activities have also been banned. The fine for crop burning has been increased to Rs50,000, the fine for smoke emitting brick kilns has been increased to Rs100,000, the fine has been increased to Rs2,000 for smoke-emitting vehicles and motorcycles and the fine for smoke-emitting factories, bakeries and stone crushing machines has been increased to Rs50,000.
According to a spokesman of the commissioner’s office, the Rawalpindi administration had also issued a notification instructing the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) to take action against smog-emitting set-ups and vehicles. The smog control policy had been put in place by EPD and accordingly squads and teams had also been formed to check violations, he said.
District administration officials said that an awareness campaign had been launched across the district apprising citizens of the negative effects of smog and the role they could play to mitigate it. Efforts are being made to make the awareness campaign effective so that citizens themselves could play a role in mitigating the effects of smog.
EPD officials said that there was a zero-tolerance policy in place against smog-emitting brick kilns, industries and stone-crushing plants. The staff concerned was monitoring the quality of smoke with a special gadget on the G.T. Road and near the motorway in collaboration with traffic police.
They added that the Punjab government had established special laboratories across the province to protect citizens from the dangers of smog. District emergency officer (DEO) Rawalpindi asked drivers to adopt all out precautionary measures in fog. He advised people to avoid unnecessary travelling in fog hours. Keep the fog lights of vehicles on and commute on roads slowly by keeping a reasonable distance between vehicles, he added.
Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Taimoor Khan urged people to take precautionary measures and follow traffic rules during smog season. Drivers should also attach dense fog lights on to their vehicles, he said.
According to experts, smog is a kind of air pollution which was originally named after smoke and fog mixed in the air. It affects visibility, human health and crops.
Dean of Public Health, Rawalpindi Medical University Professor Syed Arshad Sabir declared the situation dangerous for human health. He said that due to air pollution, problems could arise for residents when they breathe, especially people who have respiratory diseases. Air pollution is also harmful to the health of pregnant women, he added.
He stressed on the fact that citizens need to take special care, especially during smog season, adding that citizens should restrict their outdoor movements and should concentrate on breathing through their nose during smog season.
Elaborating on health hazards, he added that smog can cause irritation in the eyes and nose as it dries out the protective membranes and interferes with the body’s ability to fight infections.

13,‘Accelerated growth can pull country out of economic turmoil’,ISLAMABAD: The only way out of the economic turmoil that Pakistan has been stuck in is sustained and accelerated...,"ISLAMABAD: The only way out of the economic turmoil that Pakistan has been stuck in is sustained and accelerated growth.
Moreover, a political consensus in Pakistan is critical because implementing any new rules of the game in letter and spirit seems highly unlikely without a broad-based political consensus.
This is the crux of the ‘Charter of Economy’ presented by Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) amid continuous calls for a charter by different segments of society as well as the political leadership.
It is worth mentioning that the country’s economic indicators over the course of its entire history have fluctuated widely without a clear and sustainable growth trajectory. Despite experiencing extreme economic and political experimentation, the country fails to get on the road to development.
The report was shared by PIDE Vice Chancellor Dr Nadeemul Haque while talking to a group of journalists in Islamabad.
He said the focus had to be long-term, as short-term quick fixes had not worked, and it must start from somewhere.
“The only way out of the economic turmoil that Pakistan has been stuck in has to be sustained and accelerated growth. In this context, a political consensus in Pakistan is critical because implementing any new rules of the game in letter and spirit seems highly unlikely without a broad-based political consensus. First and foremost, the pre-requisite must be consistent policy making for at least the next 15 years. Once there is a political consensus, there should be no off-tracking from the set direction, whatever the case may be,” he said.
According to a press release, Dr Haque said that through the document, PIDE brought to the spotlight, real issues that mattered.
“PIDE views political uncertainty as the root cause of Pakistan’s economic problems. It is evident that policy inconsistency is due to rapid governmental changes and overlapping roles. The undefined jurisdiction of the arms of the state further magnifies policy bottlenecks. 
Hence, it is essential to make amends to the political set-up for better system and smooth economic performance. So, he added, the charter calls for empowered local governments and local police, new rules for the cabinet and parliament as well as electoral reforms. “Suggestions comprise putting limits on the number of cabinet members, limit of the term of parliamentarians, direct Senate elections and so on,” he said.
“Moreover, it is pertinent to note that economic growth is not limited to just traditional economic indicators. Instead, in modern times as has been practiced globally, growth is supported by seemingly minuscule but significantly important areas. This involves a modern civil service and a network of independent organisations across the economy. So, under sludge and regulation themes, the charter envisions a modern bureaucracy with digitisation at the centre, monetisation of perks and privileges, bidding farewell to colonial examination and lifetime job security, along with independent authorities with the sovereign board of governors instead of centralised bureaucratic control,” Mr Haque said.
He said that the charter must not be mistaken for a policy document, rather it was meant to set the direction for future policy frameworks.
