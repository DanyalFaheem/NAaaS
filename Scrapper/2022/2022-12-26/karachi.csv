7,Move to exclude social work graduates from Sindh govt jobs raises eyebrows,Candidates having master’s in social work degree become ineligible for assistant director posts in social welfare dept.,"KARACHI: The Sindh government’s decision to exclude master’s degree in social work as qualification for the post of assistant directors in the provincial social welfare department has sent a wave of resentment among the holders of degrees in the discipline, it emerged on Sunday. 
Informed sources told Dawn that a large number of young master’s degree holders in social work had been deprived of availing the opportunity to be inducted in the social welfare department, through the Sindh Public Service Commission, as the required qualification in a recent advertisement for the post of assistant director was master’s in sociology and the age limit for the candidates was 21 to 28 years. 
They said that the master degree in social work was surprisingly excluded from the eligibility criteria with any reason for the first time as historically all advertisements for the same positions since the inception of the provincial social welfare department was master’s degree in sociology or social work. 
The sources said that the age limit for eligible candidates was also reduced as earlier it was 28 to 32 years, thus adversely affecting a large number of people who had obtained their degrees in the last few years. 

Candidates having master’s in social work degree become ineligible for assistant director posts in social welfare dept

They said that retired officials of the social welfare department also termed it as injustice to holders of the master’s degrees in social work. 
The sources said that the Karachi University’s Department of Social Work had also raised the issue with provincial authorities requesting them to include the master’s degree in social work as required qualification for the post of assistant director in the provincial social welfare department. 
The department also pointed out that the average age for qualifying for any master’s degree was 22 to 23 year, while the maximum age of any SPSC exam was 30 to 32 years. 
It was also pointed out to the authorities that the social work was a professional subject and was most relevant to the domain of the provincial social welfare department. 
A senior teacher of the KU’s social work department said that the absolution of the social work subject from the field of social welfare was an injustice to many of the students holding degree in social work.

8,Karachi’s Christian community celebrates Christmas with zeal,St Patrick’s Cathedral hosts biggest congregation in city.,"

Christians attend a Christmas Mass at a church on Sunday.—APP

 
KARACHI: Christmas celebrations began at midnight with a jam-packed congregation at the biggest parish of the city, centrally-located St Patrick’s Cathedral, with prayers held in the vast grounds of the church under a tent set up to hold the big crowd. Special prayers were carried out for the country.
The first daytime mass was held at 7:30am inside the cathedral. Prayers were held and blessings showered over the sick and the deceased with the calling of each of their names. There were significant readings to mark the birth of Jesus Christ from the Bible, the church choir sang joyful hymns and parish priest Father Mario Rodrigues, also the rector of St Patrick’s High School, led the prayers.
The St Patrick’s grounds may not have the pine, spruce, fir, cypress or cedar trees, but the trees there were also beautifully decorated like any Christmas tree with stars, bows, stockings, sparkling glass balls, bells, reindeers, etc. The big Neem leading to the main cathedral entrance also had a number of gifts under it.
Father Mario mentioned in his sermon how the story of the innkeeper turning away Mary and Joseph is a sad one. He narrated an incident from when he was in Canada where some children were performing a school play based on the story of the birth of Jesus Christ.

St Patrick’s Cathedral hosts biggest congregation in city

“The innkeeper was being played by a little boy with Down’s Syndrome who had practiced for days his only line ‘There is no room in the inn.’ He read his line well during the performance but as Mary and Joseph turned to leave, he added something which was not in the script. He said, ‘But there is room in my house.’ The entire audience burst out laughing. But it was the compassion and love in his little heart for Jesus that made him do this,” Father Mario pointed out.
“Today all of you will say that you have a place in your homes for Jesus. But if you have your friend or a relative, even a cousin, at your house asking to stay there, you will say ‘Oh no, I have no room.’ Today, if you have the homeless, the hungry or the thirsty come to you, you say to them that you have nothing, that you are yourself struggling,” he pointed out.
“Let us go out, let us spread the message of love and do something special for someone. Let us be listeners, rather than just talkers,” the learned priest reminded before leading prayers for all the people of this world going through hardships.
Karachi administrator meets archbishop
Later in the day, the St Patrick’ parish was paid a visit by Karachi Administrator Dr Syed Saifur Rahman to meet Archbishop of Karachi Bishop Benny Mario Travas.
The administrator said that Christmas was one of the major festivals of the world and that he was glad to be celebrating it with the Christian community in Pakistan. “Our Christian brothers have played an important role in the construction and development of Karachi,” he reminded.
On the occasion, Dr Rahman also cut a Christmas cake with the Bishop and other members of the community.
While talking about interfaith harmony and how celebrations of the Christian community are being organised in Karachi, he spoke about how Sharea Faisal had been decorated for Christmas with the aim of making the Christian community realise that they had the right to celebrate their festivals according to the rights given to them under the Constitution of Pakistan. 
“Our religion also teaches us to respect other religions and provide them opportunities to perform their religious rituals according to their own beliefs,” he said.
Bishop Benny Mario Travas thanked the administrator for coming to the cathedral and joining in their festival. He also appreciated how it was for the first time after the creation of Pakistan, that the community was allowed to decorate Sharea Faisal for Christmas.
“We have been provided with the best security here for Christmas,” the bishop said while thanking the administrator and the civic administration and law enforcement agencies.
Also present on the occasion were Municipal Commissioner Syed Shujaat Hussain, heads of the departments of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, Justice Helpline head Nadeem Shaikh, Salim Michael and others.
It was said that all the Christian employees of the KMC were paid their salaries and pensions before Christmas so that they could celebrate the day happily with their families.

9,"Experts link colorectal cancer to dietary habits, lifestyle",Experts say cancer of large intestine is the second most common cancer in Pakistan,"KARACHI: The 6th international conference on colorectal cancer has concluded with experts emphasising the need for creating public awareness on the disease affecting a large population in the country.
The Colocon 2022 was organised by the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) in collaboration with the Colorectal Disease Patients Welfare Association here at a local hotel on Saturday.
The highlights of the sixth day included a hands-on workshop on advanced laparoscopy skills for medical staff at Civil Hospital Karachi OT Complex by Prof Amjad Parvaiz, and Prof Tas Qureshi — senior surgeons based in the UK — and scientific sessions on important subjects related to the disease.
A purpose of the conference was to raise funds for poor patients reported at CHK colorectal unit where treatment and diagnosis was provided free of cost.

Experts say cancer of large intestine is the second most common cancer in Pakistan

During the conference, the experts discussed the disease complications and the latest development in treatment options available in the world.
According to speakers, cancer of the large intestine — also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer or rectal cancer — is the second most common cancer in Pakistan. Unfortunately, however, there is not much awareness about the illness resulting in delayed reporting of the cases.
Majority of the patients report at hospitals when the disease has already progressed to the third or fourth stage and it makes treatment very challenging.
Dr Lajpat Rathore, a member of the event organising team, told Dawn that complete recovery was possible in early stage cancer.
About the risk factors, he said colorectal cancer was most commonly diagnosed in people above the age of 45.
“While it’s difficult to speak with certainty as multiple factors could be at play, the illness has been locally associated with our dietary habits and lifestyle. For instance, this form of cancer is more prevalent among people who are hooked to gutka. Consumption of contaminated water, cigarette smoking and fast food also seem to increase one’s vulnerability to the disease,” Dr Rathore said, adding that certain chemicals used as fertiliser had been also linked to the illness.
An early sign of the disease, he pointed out, was blood in stool. “Other symptoms are a change in bowel habits, persistent complaint of diarrhoea, constipation or feeling that the bowel doesn’t empty all the way and weight loss.”
The disease, he said, was common in both urban and rural areas of the country, though it had been found to be affecting men more.
The speakers at the conference included Prof Amjad Siraj Memon, Dr Nadeem Abbasi, Dr Raza Sayyed and Dr Najeeb Naimatullah.

Members of the All Pakistan Lawyers Inter-Provincial Coordination Committee said that at present, two posts of judges were vacant at the apex court while appointments had yet to be made on several such posts at all the provincial high courts.
Addressing a press conference the other day at the Karachi Press Cub, vice chairmen of all the provincial bar councils of the country said there was a huge backlog of cases in courts across the country and asked the JCP to fill vacant posts at the higher judiciary for timely disposal of cases.
They were of the view that one judge each from Sindh and KP high courts might be elevated to the apex court on the basis of seniority.
They also condemned a conviction handed down to Rana Asif, a member of Punjab Bar Council, by the Lahore High Court for contempt of court and asked the government to amend the contempt law in line with modern era. 
They were of the view that a rift was being created between the bench and bar and urged the Pakistan Bar Council and the Supreme Court Bar Association to play their roles in that regard.
They said that a meeting of the PBC had been convened for Dec 27 at Islamabad and warned that the legal fraternity would observe a boycott of courts if the apex body of lawyers could not address the issues of contempt proceedings against lawyers.

It further sought comprehensive details regarding 14 schools said to be opened and the recruitment process for which was also told to be initiated in order to induct more teachers till Jan 13.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed issued such directives while hearing a set of petitions mainly seeking implementation of the Sindh Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2013.

SHC seeks district-wise details of recently enrolled 300,000 students in province

At the outset of hearing, the secretary of the school education & literacy department filed a report stating that a mobile app had been developed and the same would be deployed as pilot project in seven districts Jamshoro, Qambar-Shahdadkot, Dadu, Kandhkot-Kashmore, Matiari, Hyderabad and Umerkot on Jan 15 and thereafter, based on the initial trial results, would be extended to further districts.
Such app will be installed on teachers’ smart phones and they will be able to mark their attendance using those devices while the app will tag the geo-location of a total 9,112 schools in these seven districts and 32,553 teachers, the report said.
The chief secretary submitted that a plan was being formulated to secure the biometric attendance of students and a proper report in this regard would be submitted at the next hearing.

13,Legislation stressed for parliamentary oversight of agencies,"Speakers at Ayaz Melo also call for across the board accountability of judges, generals","

PROCEEDINGS of the concluding session of Ayaz Melo under way at Sindh Museum on Sunday.­—Dawn

 
HYDERABAD: Speakers at the last session on the concluding day of the 8th Ayaz Melo held here on Sunday advised political parties and parliamentarians to use the admission that the ‘establishment did commit mistakes’ to bring ISI and other intelligence agencies under parliamentary oversight through legislation. 
They called for bringing reforms in the 1973 Constitution to address questions relating to peoples’ rights and ensuring across the board accountability of judges and generals. There was a particular mindset that wanted to unravel the 18th constitutional amendment which had empowered the parliament, they said at the session titled ‘new social contract’. 
Dr Arfana Mallah, who moderated the session posed some specific questions to which the speakers came up with very pointed replies. 
Ms Mallah sought a brief explanation of social contract between state and people from former Pakistan Study Centre head Dr Syed Jaffar Ahmed, who summed it up well, defining its three forms. This contract was reflected in the Constitution but it was a different debate how the things guaranteed in the document were given effect in practical terms. 

Speakers at Ayaz Melo also call for across the board accountability of judges, generals 

Former PPP parliamentarian Farhatullah Babar, who participated through video link, said in reply to the moderator’s question on the 18th amendment that it was carried out to do away with 100 amendments made to the constitution by dictators. The new Article had given more powers over financial matters, invoking of Article 6, elimination of 58(2)(b) as well as doctrine of necessity, which made sure that judiciary would not allow subversion of constitution, he said. 
But, he conceded, the amended constitution was not implemented and two premiers were sent packing by judiciary between 2008 and 2018. There was a particular mindset that did not like this amendment hence attempt was made to subvert it, he said.  
Popular fiction writer Noorul Huda Shah regretted that masses made politicians master of their destiny but unfortunately these very people often surrendered to establishment. 
Dr Nazir Mahmood, researcher and critic, called for removing flaws from the constitution which discriminated on the question of ‘nations’ and minorities thus the narrative of ‘separating church from the state’ started doing the rounds. 
Jaffar agreed with the moderator that there was need for a charter of economy with a clearer concept and political parties must pay heed to it because all laws were derived from the Constitution. The 1973 document was not an ideal one as a minority individual could not become head of the state yet the document said all citizens were equal, he said.  
“There is room for reform in the present Constitution,” he said, adding that Senate should be directly elected and parliament should scrutinize and approve military budget.  
Babar said that parliament did fail on the issue of missing persons and attributed the failure to the narrative of ‘security driven state’ as opposed to welfare-driven state.  
He said: “There is elephant in the room and we have to alter this process”. 
He said that it was high time all political parties, intellectuals, unions and civil society raised their voice. Although the psyche would not change overnight, the admission that the establishment had committed mistake should be used as leverage, he said.  
He said that political parties and parliament should bring ISI and other intelligence agencies under parliamentary oversight and also ensure legislation over the issue of missing persons. Across the board accountability of judges, generals, president and prime minster should be ensured, he said.  
He said that political parties should also make their own decision-making process more structured and the clause for voting by a member on a bill in line with the will of the party’s head needed to be reviewed so that members could vote as per their conscience. 
At another session moderated by Mehtab Ali Noor on flood in Sindh and rehabilitation phase, noted development expert and analyst Naseer Memon said that Sindh needed integrated floods management plan.  
He said that disaster management had become a science now that the country should learn from the world. “Should we keep mourning over this disaster and wait for the next one,” he said sarcastically and added the federal government should bear cost of damage from the current flood because it was Sindh that passed every deluge.  
Former Sindh planning and development board chairperson, Shireen Mustafa Narejo, said the devastations were in fact drainage failure and added that such a huge quantum of rainfall could not be controlled by anyone.  
Dr Ayesha Siddiqa spoke online at a session on Shaikh Ayaz’ poetry and said Ayaz was not inspired by anyone and had his own political thinking. He had even questioned communism and was different from Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Sibte Hassan. He opposed all forms of exploitations, she said. 
Sadiqa Salahudidn of Indus Resource Centre spoke about her organisation’s efforts in rain-hit Khairpur district.

It said that land grabbing was being facilitated in the name of housing schemes. It also accused Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah of being facilitator in the corrupt practice.
The meeting noted that Sindh Assembly had adopted a resolution to hand over authority over Sindh’s mineral and natural resources to the federation which, it alleged, was “treachery with the people of Sindh”.
It said that the decision negated principles of the 1940 Resolution. It added that on the one hand, the Sindh Assembly handed over the authority to the federal government and, on the other, the provincial government was facilitating influx of outsiders by providing them undue facilities. It rejected creation of a new ministry for Kashmiris. It also accused PPP of handing over authority of bigger cities to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakitan in lieu of its support for a no-confidence motion against outsted prime minister Imran Khan and for the sake of its own rule.

15,"British rulers destroyed Sindh’s ecology by laying irrigation system, says minister",Resolves to ensure revival of ancient Hakro river and its natural courses,"MITHI: Geologists, historians, literati and other scholars speaking at a conference held recently in Nohato village — known for its centuries-old historical sites — of Tharparkar district resolved to work together for the revival of ancient Hakro river and its natural courses.
People from different walks of life attended the event, titled ‘Hakro Literary and Cultural Conference’, organised by the Hakro Literary Forum. 
Sindh Minster for Culture Syed Sardar Ali Shah, Nasir Abbas Nayyar (from Punjab), Jami Chandio, Khalil Kumbhar, Dr Ishaq Samejo, Dr Fateh Mohammd Marri, Mir Hassan Arisar, Dr Adal Soomro, Tooba Qazi, Qasid Mallah, Mumtaz Bukhari, Mehboob Rana, Mumtaz Nohrio, Naseer Kumbhar, Bharu Mal Amrani and other scholars spoke at the moot.
Sardar Shah said it was totally wrong that British rulers had brought a revolution in the region by introducing reforms and laying an irrigation and railways network during the colonial era. “They, rather, destroyed or badly damaged Sindh’s historical sites in pursuit of their goal to plunder resources of the culturally rich region of Indus civilisation,” he added.

Resolves to ensure revival of ancient Hakro river and its natural courses

He said that the irrigation and railways network were laid by the colonial rulers for the benefit of their own East India Company and certain parts of the United Kingdom. “British rulers had dug up the Nara Canal using Hakro riverbed and disturbing the river’s natural course, thus stopping it from flowing towards Shakoor Lake, the ancient river’s natural destination,” said Sardar Shah.
Hakro’s natural courses were first destroyed during the Kalhora dynasty but British rulers caused more damage to them and the historical sites existing all along waterways to dig up Nara Canal, he said. He said the canal was meant for irrigating lands in various districts falling along (Indus river’s) right bank after Sukkur Barrage was built, he added. The last and lethal attack on Hakro river and its flows was inflicted by implementing the Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) project in the late 1980s.
The minister asserted that the LBOD proved fatal for natural flows as the courses of the once mighty river were badly disturbed and obstructed. 
“It’s necessary to restore the vanished [Hakro] river and its natural courses by clearing its occupied and encroached upon beds so that floodwaters could safely dispose of into its natural destination,” he said.
Mr Shah told the audience that research on the centuries-old historical site of Nohato had been undertaken in 2018 under the supervision of geologists and other relevant experts. “The Nohato civilisation resembles to that of Mohenjo Daro … we are trying to explore more such sites along the banks of vanished Hakro river,” he said, and added that once revived, the river’s flows towards Shakoor Lake would be restored by marshalling all available resources. 
The minister said it was the prime duty of his department, experts, historians and researchers to find ways to revive the pristine glory and grandeur of Hakro river. 
“It’s very unfortunate that with the destruction of such ancient rivers, not only the ecology and environment of the region was badly affected, but also the history was distorted. I am making my sincere efforts to get the history corrected and also rectify the damage done to historical sites,” he said. 
He resolved to go ahead with his mission and to clear the bottlenecks created to obstruct the natural waterways, he said, and urged experts of the field to help him accomplish the task.
Eminent novelist and Seraiki poet Riffat Abbas said that such events would help unveil hidden aspects of Sindh’s rich history, heritage and culture. 
Nasir Abbas Nayyar welcomed the resolve to restore and preserve all historical sites in Sindh.
Jami Chandio said it was the need of the hour to protect historical sites and discover more such sites in Sindh.
Partab Shivani, head of the Hakro Literary Forum, said that Hakro river had great cultural and religious significance. He called for a halt to unplanned urbanisation and ensure proper capacity-building of officials posted at various barrages and canals, besides producing early warning system for disasters, especially rains and floods.
