3,Tracing the roots of the crisis,"Export earnings and remittances are not enough to foot the consumption-led import bill, making economic growth unsustainable.","We, as a nation, produce much less than we consume. In the predominantly consumption-led economic growth, the domestic demand is met by imports that ballooned to $80 billion last fiscal year. And imports are not a component part of the Gross Domestic Product.
Workers’ remittances finance domestic consumption and are not channelled into productive activities. The brain drain deprives us of the skills and professionals needed to produce a value-added and diversified range of goods in demand in a transforming and fragmented international market.
And our export earnings and foreign remittances sent by overseas compatriots are not enough to foot the import bill. Debt-financed imports have become unsustainable. 
We spend more than we earn. We are heavily in debt because our domestic savings and investment rates are very low. We suffer from perpetual unmanageable fiscal deficits and an adverse balance of payments. The government’s current expenditures perpetually exceed its revenues, continuously slashing development spending. 
According to analysts, Pakistan’s economy is trapped in a vicious loop. First is the extremely high share of consumption in GDP. The second is the high reliance on imports to support that consumption, and the third is the major portion of direct and indirect taxes collected at the import stage.

Export earnings and remittances are not enough to foot the consumption-led import bill, making economic growth unsustainable

The foreign debt-funded imports with a perpetual balance of payments crisis and falling foreign exchange reserves in many countries are leading to regulatory cuts in imports and resorting to increasing protectionism worldwide. Even in the most developed countries, there is now some rethinking about the perceived benefits of the current pattern of the interdependence of nations. 
Viewing developments from a historical perspective, Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman says, “suddenly, interdependence doesn’t look quite as benign as we thought.” With a futurist outlook, an eminent economist and author say, ‘the rise of local, regional, and homegrown business is now at hand’. 
Yet another key factor contributing to the current economic crisis is the misplaced overwhelming reliance on monetary and credit policy for setting the economy on a correction course.
“Economic theory has demonstrated in an irrefutable way that a prosperity created by an expansionist monetary and credit policy is illusory and must end in a slump, an economic crisis,” reminds economist Muneeb Sikander. 
He adds: “it has happened again and again in the past, and it will happen in the future as well. For paper money and bank deposits are not a proper substitute for non-existing capital goods. This is precisely what has happened in the case of Pakistan.” As widely recognised, there is no alternative but to improve the economy’s fundamentals through structural reforms.
Referring to the faulty mode of reforms, economist Shahrukh Wani rightly points out: “in practice, reforms are a (democratic) political process, rather than a purely technical one. Technical appointees often lack the necessary knowledge of the coalition building needed to navigate a reform process.” All far-reaching decisions, such as the unanimously approved 1973 constitution and the 18th amendment were taken through consensus in parliaments under civilian rule.
An expansionary monetary policy tends to spur growth for a while, but sooner than later, the economy heats up with more money chasing fewer goods, fueling inflation. To fight inflation, a tight monetary policy comes into play that depresses domestic demand and slows down economic growth.
Import of textile machinery plummeted by 41.16 per cent in November, and textile and clothing exports fell by 16.15pc as compared to the same month of last year. To quote an analyst, it is a sign that expansion or modernisation projects were not a priority.
Large-scale manufacturing posted a negative growth of 2.89pc during July-October on a year-on-year basis this year compared to the corresponding period of last year. And during July-November, exports were down by 5.5pc at $11.93 as against $12.36 in five months of last year.
Empirical studies show that workers are increasingly feeling a disconnect from their employers. This is evident from the low level of productivity in Pakistan.
Foreign direct investment has also plunged by more than half to $430m from $884m in the first five months of this fiscal year compared to the same period last year.
The largest number of companies registered by the Securities and Exchange Commission is in the real estate and construction sector, followed by IT firms and then trading firms. In the past, we have been talking of the post-industrial era that resulted in pre-mature de-industrialisation.
In Pakistan’s prevailing economic model, it is easier to undertake trading than overcome a number of hassles involved in manufacturing and farming, including the rising cost of doing business. Thus stakes of a wide range of beneficiaries are deeply entrenched in the import business.
Banks prefer to finance foreign trade rather than take risks in funding industrial and agricultural production subjected to frequent boom and bust cycles. The devastation caused by floods also hit agriculture. The worse affected are the small business and small farms.
As manufacturers are also importers, they find importing their inputs more fruitful than replacing them with indigenous production. Fully installed capacity is not utilised and production and supplies are adjusted to the local market demand. Production is not geared to meet the needs of the people.
That tends to bring down the tax revenues. Despite the 25pc rate of inflation and higher prices of goods in a consumer-driven economy, the sales tax collection is increasing very nominally at 2pc.
We need to aggressively mobilise local resources and manpower to move, step by step, towards self-reliant economic development. For that to happen, it is equally important that we seek international cooperation for production-led growth that reduces debt-financed import bills and creates more trade surplus for exports.

4,‘Fishing’ for exports,"By diversifying products and markets, Pakistan’s seafood exports have witnessed modest growth this year.","Pakistan’s fish and fish preparations exports have shown a growth of 26 per cent in quantity and 23pc in value during 5MFY23 as efforts by the exporters to find new markets with product diversification, rupee devaluation against the dollar and high value of some species are finally paying off.
Industry sources say that exporters have made serious efforts to enhance exports without any support from the government.
Exporters shipped 71,659 tonnes ($186 million) during 5MFY23 compared to 56,731 tonnes ($150m) in the same fiscal period.     
“Some species like squids, cuttlefish and ribbon fish have fetched better prices in the world markets,” Vice Chairman of Pakistan Fisheries Exporters Association (PFEA), Mian Saeed Farid said.
China had imposed a sanction on imports of jellyfish from Pakistan during FY22, but from July 2022 onwards, it had been lifted, which is also contributing to improving exports. Pakistan’s fishery product exports heavily rely on China which enjoys over 50pc share of the country’s total fish exports.   

By diversifying products and markets, Pakistan’s seafood exports have witnessed modest growth this year

Like every year, China remains closed for holidays from January 15 to February 15. “We will complete fish shipments to China by January 10, 2023, to meet holiday season demand as shipments usually take one month to reach China,” Mr Farid said.
Recently, another Pakistani fish processing plant, Seagreen Enterprises (Pvt) Limited, has joined the European Commission (EC) list for fishery exports. This is the third company from Pakistan listed in the EC list. The EC lifted a six-year ban on Pakistan in 2013 and granted permission to two companies — Akhlaq Enterprise and A.G. Fisheries — to export fishery products to European countries.
EC had placed a ban on seafood export from Pakistan in 2007 due to shortcomings noted by the inspection mission of the EC during their visit to Pakistan. Mr Farid said, “if eight to 10 more fish processing plants get permission to export, then the country’s share of fish to European countries will increase, which is currently around 10pc.”
He said only three exporters were allowed to export to the United Kingdom. After the UK’s exit from the EU, the Marine Fisheries Department (MFD) needs to hold discussions with the UK government to allow more exporters to tap the UK market individually.  Pakistan has two fish exporting seasons — one from September to December 15 and the second from February 15 to June 15.
When asked if fish exports would remain brisk in coming months, he said the first half of FY23 had been promising, but it would be hard to say about the next season as much would depend on world prices and the losing value of the rupee against the dollar. Besides, most fishermen usually avoid catching fish in winter from December 15 to February 15.
From mid-September till the end of winter, consumers usually witness a steep rise in fish prices in the local markets due to high demand. However, Mr Farid said the local prices had nothing to do with the higher export volumes.
Technical Advisor World Wide Fund, Pakistan, and ex-director general Marine Fisheries Department (MFD), Muhammad Moazzam Khan, said that seafood exports from Pakistan are increasing despite a major decrease in marine fish landings. In 1999, total marine production was 477,397 tonnes which reduced to 313,141 tonnes in 2021, down by 34pc over 23 years.
Although a decrease in landings of important seafood commodities was noticed in the last 20 years, he said that the exports continued to soar mainly due to the diversification of the exportable commodities from Pakistan. In 1999, shrimp, lobsters and ribbonfish were the main exporting commodities despite the decrease in their landings.
He said the exporters have found new products and new markets for the commodities. Previously, only large cuttlefish (Pharaoh cuttlefish) were exported but now four additional species of cuttlefish are being exported, thus generating additional revenue.
He said previously, jellyfish were not harvested and exported, but currently about 3,000 tonnes were exported. Stingrays were dried and used for fish meal production, but about 10,000 tonnes of Stingray wings are being exported to Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.
In addition, large quantities of fish meal are exported to China for the aquaculture industry. Many modern fish meal plants have been established, producing high-quality fish meal for export and earning good returns. Export of shellfish such as whelks, clams and razor clams are now considered important seafood commodities which are exported in live, frozen and chilled forms earning additional foreign exchange in Pakistan, Mr Khan said.
He said a rise in exports in the last five months is mainly due to the adjustment of the industry to the post-Covid-19 situation. A major part of the consignment stuck up in various ports, mainly in China, has been released because of a change in Chinese policy for global seafood imports. 
He said Pakistani exporters have adjusted their marketing strategy to new markets and products that helped improve exports amid some bottlenecks in export requirements and conditions from Pakistan.
However, the Food and Agriculture Organisation/Fisheries Appraisal Report of 2016 warned that seafood resources are seriously dwindling, fearing the collapse of some of the important fisheries of Pakistan and suggested a major reduction (more than 50pc) in fishing fleet size. 
Despite this warning, the fishing fleet in both Sindh and Balochistan is still increasing rapidly. This is an alarming situation, and a major reduction in landings of lucrative species is expected, which may have serious bearings on export. 
There is an emergent need for the fish processing and export industry to proactively diversify their export, search for new markets and also enhance the export of value-added and ethnic seafood products from Pakistan. It is encouraging that the export of ethnic products to the US has already started from October 2022, which is an important achievement of the seafood processing industry of Pakistan.

5,"Saving water, one drip at a time",A drip irrigation system can allow upto 50pc water savings and improve yields by supplying water directly to the roots.,"There was a time when you could step into the bathroom and reasonably expect water from the tap. At least in most urban parts. Well, gone are those days and now something as basic as washing your face first requires making logistical arrangements and dealing with the tanker mafia. 
In fact, relevant authorities themselves have gotten into the tanker business instead of trying to get it delivered by line. Experts on the subject keep talking about the underpricing of water (or gas for that matter) in Pakistan, but the virtual absence of the state has created a private market for the utility — thus leading to price discovery. 
However, in limiting ourselves to domestic usage, the urban centres miss the forest for the trees. It’s the agriculture sector that consumes around 70-90 per cent of Pakistan’s water, in part due to water-intensive crops like sugarcane and rice. And to top it off, the segment is marred with wastages, thanks to the traditional flood irrigation system. 
One way to address this is through the drip irrigation system where low-pressure water is directly supplied to the root of the plant through valves and emitters. This allows up to 50pc of water savings in addition to improving crop yields, which is why some of the major agri economies like India and the US are switching towards it. 

A drip irrigation system can allow upto 50pc water savings and improve yields by supplying water directly to the roots

So the question is, why aren’t we making the move? Based on varying sources, 70,000 and 100,000 acres in Pakistan are currently on drip irrigation, accounting for less than 0.2pc of the total cropped area. Well, the answer is pretty simple: the cost of the system. 
Drip irrigation system has capital expenditure between Rs200,000-Rs300,000 per acre, which is too much to bear for our farmers, according to an official of the Punjab Irrigation Department. To address this, the provincial government introduced a 60pc subsidy on the upfront cost. 
However, even the remaining 40pc was still overwhelming, according to Shakeel Ahmed, Business Manager at Jaffer Brothers’ High Efficiency Irrigation Systems, which supplies the equipment for drip irrigation and reportedly has a 40pc market share. “There was also a high operational cost of energy, but the recent subsidy on solar by the Punjab government has helped address that bit,” he says. 
To address this, Nestle launched a program, Caring for Water — Pakistan, whereby it would pay for the remaining 40pc (farmer’s share) of the capital expenditure while the 60pc would be borne by the Punjab government. Through this initiative, around 205 acres of land was covered, starting from districts around Sheikhupura and Kabirwala, while sensors were installed on another 455 acres — reportedly leading to an estimated savings of a cumulative 368,000 cubic metres of water in 2021. 

Less than 0.2pc of the total cropped area is on the drip irrigation system in Pakistan

“A major reason why the high efficiency irrigation system (HEIS) is still limited to a small scale in Pakistan is the high capital costs. Almost all raw materials for the equipment, spare PVC, are imported and with time, have only become more expensive due to the rupee devaluation. If we want to expand the drip irrigation network here, we need localised production. This is how the technology took off in countries like India and Turkey,” says Mr Ahmed. 
It may take a while to set up domestic production, and until then, the World Bank has introduced a number of projects for the promotion of HEIS, including the $262 million Punjab Resilient and Inclusive Agriculture Transformation programme launched this year. Though there is massive room for growth, it still means Punjab is way ahead of other provinces in terms of drip adoption. 
Currently, Sindh accounts for 10pc of the drip-covered area at best, even though the provincial government had launched a six-year $185m project to promote the same with World Bank’s support back in 2017. The adoption in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan is even lower Nestle, for its part, is now working to increase the reach of the programme. “We plan to expand drip irrigation in 2023 to up to 100 acres of land, working with farmers for the first time in Sindh for banana, mango and jojoba crops,” according to the company’s Head of Corporate Affairs & Sustainability, Sheikh Waqar Ahmed. Meanwhile, Jaffer Group is also exploring ways to localise the production of the equipment, but given the macro challenges, they are cautious for now. 
Unfortunately, we don’t have much time. Reports have already projected Pakistan to be a water-scarce by 2025. Climate change has become starkly obvious even to the deniers. While climate change may not have been our fault originally, the responsibility to take remedies eventually falls on us for the sake of survival. Drip irrigation could be just one of those initiatives instead of dreaming about reparations.

6,Troubles lurking around every corner,"With no let-up in the present situation in sight, it is time people braced themselves for a tougher year ahead.","Pakistan will head into 2023 with an incredibly gloomy economic outlook and troubles lurking around every corner.
In the outgoing year, the people came around to an unprecedented price growth amid the country’s consistently deteriorating balance of payments crisis exacerbated by devastating summer floods and ongoing political uncertainty.
Next year we could see inflation entrenched further and the economy trek toward a deeper recession as the politically embattled coalition led by the PML-N struggles to revive its sour relationship with the International Monetary Fund for the resumption of its loan programme to overcome its dollar liquidity crisis.
Even though the finance minister, Ishaq Dar, continues to stave off International Monetary Fund (IMF) pressure to further tighten government spending, raise electricity and gas prices, and impose additional taxes to avoid the political fallout of such decisions, analysts believe that he does not have many options.
With the central bank’s liquid foreign exchange reserves plunging to their eight-year low to just above $6 billion amid drying foreign inflows, concerns over the government’s capacity to timely make its foreign debt payments without an early restoration of the IMF funding programme are resurging on the delay in the disbursement of the new tranche of $1.2bn.

With no let-up in the present situation in sight, it is time people braced themselves for a tougher year ahead than the one they just endured

The lender has postponed the ninth performance review of the bailout, which was originally scheduled for the end of October on differences over Islamabad’s post-flood fiscal projections for the current financial year. Pakistan has twice renegotiated the programme with the IMF — first under Imran Khan and later under Shehbaz Sharif — in the last year but couldn’t sustain its continuity due to political compulsions.
The IMF programme is meant to stabilise the economy that has been in a tailspin for almost a year now, and to provide comfort to the other multilateral, bilateral and commercial creditors. The top three global credit rating agencies have already downgraded Pakistan’s ratings into junk territory because of its growing external vulnerabilities in recent months.
Pakistan’s home currency has weakened more than 27 per cent since the start of the year and hit its weakest level of almost 240 to a dollar at the end of July, reflecting the country’s fragile financial situation.
The default worries were entrenched first because of a delay in the restoration of the IMF loan programme, which was originally signed in the summer of 2019 but suspended multiple times since, and later when new tensions emerged between Islamabad and the lender over the unmet fiscal and other targets in the aftermath of catastrophic summer floods that submerged a third of the country, displaced millions, and caused economic and infrastructural losses of over $30bn.
Indeed, the country has suffered from extreme external shocks like any other developing nation heavily reliant on imports of oil, gas, food and other commodities. But its present troubles are homegrown. The perpetually recurring balance of payments crises have their roots in decades of fiscal profligacy of Pakistan’s ruling elite. When a country runs high deficits to boost domestic consumption to achieve growth, it always ends up with unsustainable current account imbalances.
The average fiscal deficit during the last four years has been 7.23pc of GDP, with the current account gap growing in tandem and hitting almost 5pc of GDP during the last financial year that ended on June 30. Political instability, high global commodity prices, destructive floods and drying foreign inflows have only sped up the rot that was already in the making.
With the country’s external financing needs during the present fiscal year estimated by the IMF at nearly $34bn, the flood losses, recessional global environment and hyperinflation have together made the challenge of economic revival tougher than ever.
The government claims that it expects increased financing from other multilateral and bilateral lenders, including friendly countries like Saudi Arabia, China and the United Arab Emirates. But it is not helping the jittery markets.
State Bank of Pakistan Governor Jameel Ahmed’s reassurances that Pakistan’s full-year financing requirements of $32-34bn were fully covered and that the reserves will start building up in the first half of 2023 are not helping calm the market and quash default speculations. No wonder Nomura, a top Japanese investment bank, has placed Pakistan among seven countries threatened by a currency crisis over the next 12 months.
With a formidable foe like Imran Khan out on the streets demanding early elections, it is natural for a weak coalition government to avoid tough decisions in an election year. In an interaction with a group of senior journalists last week, former prime minister Imran khan, who is recovering from the bullet injuries he had sustained in an attempt on his life, summed up the government’s predicament when he predicted that the country could slide into a default in January or February.
“The (present) regime led by the corrupt politicians is doomed whether or not it gets a bailout from the IMF,” he insisted. “If the IMF dollars don’t come, the country’s going to default on its debt payments because we don’t have dollar liquidity.
“On the other hand, if the IMF agrees to finance, the government will be forced to significantly increase the cost of electricity and gas in addition to raising additional taxes of Rs1.5 trillion. That will be a death knell for the economy and the industry that is already shutting down. Only a government with a clear, fresh public mandate can steer the economy out of its present crisis.”
There’s no doubt the government is clearly in a bind regarding how it should meet the multiple challenges facing it. With no let-up in the present situation in sight, it is time people braced themselves for a tougher year ahead than the one they just endured.

7,Why is Pakistan’s food security so precarious?,"In 1961, per capita arable land availability was 0.66 hectares, which has now drastically decreased to 0.14 hectares.","According to many agricultural economists, current food prices, coupled with their high volatility and long-term rising trend, speak loudly about Pakistan’s precarious food security situation. Continued financial insecurity and, as a result, dwindling agricultural subsidies, along with the adverse impact of climate change on crop yield, are causing an increasingly uncertain situation for food supplies in the country.  
The government is supposed to ensure sustainable food availability in rural and urban markets at stable and affordable prices. However, in developing countries like Pakistan, which has limited financial resources, food security is a complex phenomenon involving several trade-offs. 
Therefore, striking a balance between various development goals and protecting the interests of different groups is a daunting challenge.
With over 220 million people, Pakistan’s population growth rate is 1.9 per cent — far higher than the world’s average of 0.9pc (World Bank data).
Unfortunately, expansion in the country’s agricultural land could not match the population growth rate, primarily due to scarcity of water — a major limiting factor. In 1961, per capita arable land availability was 0.66 hectares, which has now drastically decreased to 0.14 hectares. 

In 1961, per capita arable land availability was 0.66 hectares, which has now drastically decreased to 0.14 hectares while the population has increased

As a result, Pakistan has to rely primarily on increasing crop productivity (yield per acre) to feed its ever-increasing population. However, rising prices of agricultural inputs and the growing threat of climate change have made it really difficult to boost yields significantly.
Another viable option is to increase the area of wheat — Pakistan’s major staple food — by giving the farmers a higher support price. The arguments in favour include higher import parity prices of wheat due to excessive depreciation of Pak rupee, attaining self-sufficiency in wheat, saving foreign exchange, and enticing farmers to sow wheat who are inclined towards sowing oilseed crops, spring maize (corn), and sugarcane, as they are currently more remunerative. 
However, a higher support price to the tune of Rs4,000 per 40kg, as announced by the Government of Sindh, recalls the past rice policy of Indonesia and the Philippines in the 2000s, where high prices were given to rice farmers to alleviate their poverty, whereas most of poor and hungry in these countries were net rice buyers, hence price increase affected them adversely. 
Therefore, the government needs to strike a balance between expanding wheat production through higher support prices, alleviating poverty in the country, and allocating funds for safety nets to provide subsidised wheat flour to the poor. In addition, pro-poor economic growth and developing the agriculture sector are some other important objectives that must be taken into account.
Food price volatility (spikes and collapses) has become a critical issue in Pakistan. Even when average prices are affordable to the poor and provide sufficient incentives for farmers, price fluctuations pose risks and create a poverty trap for consumers as well as farmers. 
Volatile food prices have detrimental effects on vulnerable households as they frequently exhaust their financial and human resources in times of food crises merely to survive. As a result, they can’t utilise their own resources and skills to come out of poverty. In this way, the volatility of food prices harms the poor in both the long and short term.
At the macro level, with stable food prices, the implementation of poverty alleviation programmes is simpler and less expensive. Conversely, due to unstable markets, policymakers have to go for short-term crisis management through diverting available financial resources to stabilise food prices and provide safety nets rather than implement development strategies and make strategic investments for economic growth and alleviation of poverty. 
There have been some other developments going on at the global level that may have a deeper effect on the food security situation in Pakistan in the short as well as in the long term. Our policymakers should remain fully cognizant of such changes.
Climate change is affecting agricultural productivity in many parts of the world. In India, below average monsoons in the eastern and northern parts have curtailed rice production in 2022. In China, this summer’s heat wave in the Yangtze River region and the resulting drought have decreased China’s rice output. The heat wave in March 2022 affected Pakistan’s wheat crop negatively. Europe faced the worst drought in 500 years, during the summer of 2022, due to record high temperatures and low rainfall. 
Such adverse effects on agriculture are likely to drive volatility in global food prices, especially if some major producer opts for export restrictions, as India imposed restrictions on wheat, sugar and rice exports in 2022.
Several countries are undergoing a dietary transformation as their average income is rising rapidly. The proportion of starchy staples (wheat, rice, maize) in the diet is decreasing in favour of animal protein.
Furthermore, the diet in these countries is becoming more “westernised” with greater use of cookies, cakes, bread, buns and noodles. The trend is encouraging wheat consumption while decreasing rice’s share in the diet. In the future, it may cause an increase in global wheat prices. 
Increasing consumption of animal products requires greater quantities of livestock and poultry feed. Therefore, across the globe, larger land areas are increasingly being used for feed ingredients such as soybeans, maize, and canola, which would ultimately reduce the area of wheat and rice. Even in Pakistan, maize production increased from 4.92 to 8.9 million tonnes in just the last five years (2016-2021). 
Biofuel (derived from agricultural produce like maize, sugarcane, cassava, or vegetable oils) is a substitute for gasoline and diesel, but currently, its production is not feasible. However, if oil prices rise to the point where biofuel production is justified in terms of cost, it would turn out to be a major disruptor in the agriculture and food sector. 
Already, more than ten countries, including the US, Brazil, Germany and France, have significant production, collectively producing 1.747m barrels per day. At some point in time, if the US and Europe allow the use of food crops to produce biofuel to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in order to mitigate climate change, poor consumers of several countries, including Pakistan, would be at serious risk.
All the above mentioned developments reveal that in the future, food security will no longer be an agricultural issue but a trade and macroeconomic challenge that needs to be addressed by a comprehensive policy encompassing agriculture, international trade, economic development, and poverty alleviation. In addition, whenever fiscal spaceis available, Pakistan should build up its reserves of wheat, rice, and maize to ensure food security and to stabilise food prices in the country.

8,Finance: Ignoring fruitful avenues,"Despite insufficient support from the government, IT and ITeS exports tripled to $2.618bn in the last ten years.","Pakistan is facing a severe foreign exchange crisis. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has effectively stopped banks from retiring letters of credit or opening new ones if they don’t have enough foreign exchange of their own to do the same. 
The reason is the central bank’s forex reserves are too low to let banks and financial markets work normally. Only external debt repayments are being managed somehow. (On 16th December SBP’s forex reserves fell to a new low of $6.116 billion, barely enough to cover even five weeks of merchandise exports).
Businesses, already struggling with energy woes, continue to protest over forex control measures. Forex rates quoted routinely in the interbank and open markets have become irrelevant. Since dollars are too hard to find, the only relevant rates are the “going rates”. Banks and forex companies are selling dollars at “going rates” to those willing to purchase, but only when dollars are available.
Nothing can be done to ensure non-debt-creating forex inflows in the short term. Not even a fraction of the external financing gap of billions of dollars can come immediately through exports of goods or remittance, both of which are already showing declining trends. 
However, exports of services offer some hope. An additional few hundred million dollars may start pouring in every month through services export if the government and the SBP take all stakeholders into confidence, devise a “dollars inflow strategy”, and implement it religiously. 

Despite insufficient support from the government, IT and ITeS exports tripled to $2.618bn in the last ten years

A medium-term version of the same strategy can help boost non-debt-creating forex inflows in the years to come. Exports of IT and IT-enabled services have huge potential, which can be tapped immediately by offering whatever incentives this sector requires. 
The government has long been offering tens of billions of rupees every year to exporters of textiles and other traditional export items without linking this largesse with verifiable actual forex gains. Little wonder that our traditional export sectors, including textiles, lag behind their competitors. 
Their lack of resilience is exposed whenever serious challenges emerge in the global economy and our export earnings fall. That is exactly what Pakistan is witnessing now. 
What is more lamentable is that the successive governments not only chose to patronise traditional export sectors without ensuring actual forex returns but also ignored services exports. This stunted growth of services exports. 
Back in FY13, Pakistan had managed to earn $6.724bn through service exports. That had raised hopes that in the next ten years, the earnings would at least double. But sadly, services exports remain below $7bn — $6.95bn in FY22.  
One big reason the services sector exports have suffered in the past and continue to suffer is that, unlike our traditional merchandise export sectors, they are perhaps politically less important. Or that is what our short-sighted politicians think. 
Exports of IT and IT-enabled services (that are part of the overall services exports) have huge potential, and realising that potential in the short-term is very much possible. Despite insufficient support from the government, exports of telecommunication, computer and information services — the technical term used for IT and ITeS exports — stood at $803 million in FY13. Ten years later, in FY22, they more than tripled to $2.618bn.
For further growth, exports of IT and IT-es need little monetary incentives compared to what traditional export sectors continue to get. But a firm political and administrative will to address the real issues is a must.
Launching a free laptop distribution scheme — and that too with lots of politics (and yes, corruption) involved in it would not boost exports. The government must help educate Pakistani youths financially and technically in setting up call centres, software development houses and software consultancy services. And in so doing, it must rise above politics and keep strict checks on corruption/irregularities.
Simultaneously, it also must run nationwide skill enhancement programmes to ensure a steady supply of skilled workers. Despite all the lip service rendered in this regard by successive governments, skill development remains wanting on many counts and in many areas. 
Speak to any man or woman who has been running a sizable call centre in Karachi, and the first thing they’ll say about their business is that it is too hard to find young boys or girls who can speak English or some other foreign language with some confidence. And most of them also complain that it is equally too hard to find people who know how to use their computer/IT education at the workplace.
Should these things be a problem? Why can’t the government launch mass e-learning programmes in association with global educators for those interested in speaking English/ French/German/Chinese, and Arabic? And what prevents the federal and provincial governments from initiating programmes for young boys and girls in liaison with tech companies to train them in the practical application of IT knowledge? Such things can be easily done. Can’t they?

9,Short-sighted policies,Inappropriate and regressive policy provisions have accelerated gas supply reduction and depleted indigenous natural resources.,"Pakistan has not run out of gas overnight. At the turn of the 21st century, sufficient gas supplies and sources were available in Pakistan. As per a study by Hagler Bailey, there were limitations on the gas transmission system to lift gas from all the sources, but there was no gas shortage for any segment of the consumers. 
The said study, however, had a limited scope of finding a market for the newly discovered Miano gas field of Australian multinational OMV. To determine the overall demand and supply situation for the short or long term, a detailed and comprehensive study should have been done rather than relying on such a limited-purpose study. 
It seems that the federal government has wrongly taken the findings of such a study. It came up with the regressive Petroleum Policy 2001 in terms of fiscal terms offered to the riskiest exploration business in Pakistan regarding hydrocarbon prospects and cost of operations in remote areas with high-risk law and order situations. 
The reduced gas price than previously paid to the gas producers in Pakistan has caused the most damage to oil and gas exploration efforts. In total disregard of previous binding contractual obligations, the government forced owners of the already discovered but not producing gas fields to accept the unilaterally reduced gas price or let their investments remain stranded.

Inappropriate and regressive policy provisions have accelerated gas supply reduction and depleted indigenous natural resources

A typical exploration and production (E&P) cycle spans over seven to 10 years, from the initiation of geophysical data acquisition to the discovery and production of petroleum. This 2001 policy breached investors’ confidence and broke the E&P cycle for over 13 years until the new Petroleum Policy 2012 was notified on 1st September 2012. Petroleum Policies of 2007 and 2009 could not induce the required level of investment interest in E&P, as evidenced by the fact that even most of the then-existing foreign oil and gas companies operating in Pakistan had left the country one by one.
After observing the negative impact of the 2001 policy, instead of taking effective measures to restore and increase the pace of exploration in the country, the government introduced the damaging Natural Gas Allocation and Management (NGAM) Policy 2005. Effectively, this policy seeded the gas crisis in the country, which has kept growing with every passing day. 
As the title of NGAM policy dictates, it is based on the inherent premise that Pakistan was to switch gas supplies from one set of consumers to the other out of whatever is left. However, it did not take concrete measures to augment gas supplies through domestic and international resources. This has resulted in the reduction in gas supplies even to the priority consumers. 
The planners, executors and deliverers all have used the said policy as a pretext to justify their failure in service delivery. As if the non-stipulation of any guidelines for improving the gas supply situation was not enough, the said so-called policy did not even have any estimate of the time when sufficient gas supplies were expected to be available. 
The policy did not visualise its defenestration as such regressive measures can not become a permanent feature of any economy if it plans to grow.
In total disregard for the compelling gas supply situation, rather than imposing a moratorium, the policy also, under section six, provided for the government to facilitate augmentation of the natural gas network under the pretext of socio-economic development. 
The policy further provided gas supplies to economically backward areas that did not meet the cost criteria determined by the government. Inappropriate and regressive policy provisions further accelerated the speed of gas supply reduction and depletion of indigenous natural gas resources. 
Although on the supply side, there are numerous reasons which caused a serious gas crisis, this article only addresses the issues related to the consumer side, which consist of mismanagement of the gas utilisation, the huge percentage of Unaccounted For Gas (UFG) and irrational extension of the gas distribution networks. 
The extension of networks was irrespective of the restrictions imposed by the regulator under the terms of their respective licenses, whereby their exclusivity to undertake gas transmission and distribution business in their respective areas of operations ended in 2010. 
Not only did 2001 petroleum and NGAM policies hugely contribute to worsening the gas supply situation in the country, but the government also did not provide appropriate policy guidelines for the extension of the transmission and distribution network, although a large number of private parties have been granted licenses by the regulator for sale of gas. 
As a result, the two Sui companies continued to extend their transmission and distribution networks purely on political grounds rather than on commercial considerations. This has not only overburdened the most productive segment of gas consumers, i.e. the industrial sector, but has also caused the recovery of unjustified costs from consumers and the reduction of gas supplies. Over 18 years have passed and the situation has worsened, but the policy is still being used as a sacred revelation. 
It is acknowledged with pleasure and a sense of gratitude that the gas supply situation would have been worst than it is today if Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, the then prime minister of Pakistan, had not single-handedly taken the lead and got the two LNG Terminals up and running within a shortest possible time and secured sustainable LNG supplies from Qatar.
The most unfortunate state of affairs is that petroleum policies are originated and formalised by the Petroleum Division, which is run by civil service officers with no practical knowledge or experience of the oil and gas industry. Until policy formulation is done with strategic vision by sufficiently qualified experts, Pakistan is bound to remain in a crisis of all sorts.

10,CORPORATE WINDOW: Choosing electables over the electorate,Luxury cars for lackeys are allowed to slip in through the import restrictions while essential items such as medicinal chemicals,"It’s good that Prime Minister Shahbaz’s economic team has realised that substantial help may not arrive unless Pakistan convinces the world with actions of its seriousness to do all within its means to beat the current crisis. 
Before asking people and businesses to tighten their belts further and get ready to make sacrifices for economic survival or for donors to lend a helping hand, the government must lead by example. The public and business resentment looks perfectly logical when the government and its abnormally bloated machinery don’t appear to be austere. The donors also expect more measures to tackle the twin deficit.
“There is no defence for wasting public funds on avoidable travels, cars, plush offices, recruitment of pricy specialists when food, health, energy security of the country is at risk,” notes a business magnet. The donor of the last resort, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is reported to have asked for details of the government roadmap ahead to deal with fiscal/current account deficits and piling circular debt in the energy sector.    
The government’s recently proposed energy conservation plan to suppress the import bill has already been opposed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and businesses are expected to be affected by daylight saving measures (markets, restaurants, marriage halls, etc.)
It might serve the government well if economic ministers disentangle from politics to focus on sliding key indicators. High-level sources in Islamabad shared multiple instances when carefully designed briefs were ignored for weeks when every day matters.

Luxury cars for lackeys are allowed to slip in through the import restrictions while essential items such as medicinal chemicals are blocked

“After a detailed exercise, we put up a note on the economy in mid-November that we thought would set alarm bells in the government hierarchy and initiate a debate on the options mentioned. To our surprise, the minister, who we see debating actively on television every other day, didn’t bother even to open the file,” a senior bureaucrat told this writer.  
It is already hard for the economically distressed majority to trust a system that has delivered little beyond promises. Now, if they learn that the government is blocking imports of necessities such as medicinal chemicals but letting luxury cars slip in for lackeys, they might not pardon those responsible. 
The leaders need not be reminded that Pakistanis vote more independently than perceived. They are perfectly capable of turning tables on electable and their benefactors (e.g. the general elections in 1988). 
“Democracy may still be young in Pakistan, but the political instincts of Pakistanis are fairly advanced, history has demonstrated repeatedly. People are neither thankless nor stupid. They reward sacrifices by politicians but tend not to forgive disrespect.
“It’s, therefore, silly on the part of the government to appease electable at the cost of the electorate”, said a frustrated business leader angry over the clearance of a bunch of luxury cars at Karachi Port when his consignment was stuck for weeks. He not only ended up paying high demurrage, but the consequent disruption in production could lead to the cancellation of export orders.   
Discussing the lukewarm response of friendly countries, an expert remarked, “scaring allies with dire consequences of a failed nuclear state probably didn’t work in a world already threatened by fallouts of Ukraine war at the top of lingering effects of the pandemic. Begging and pleading in the name of the poor also falls on deaf ears when they see the government sharply chopping the development budget but indulging its brigade of ministers and loyalists in assemblies. 
“The pleas for leniency from the IMF may not yield results as long as a blanket tax immunity is afforded to certain segments such as retailers, feudal aristocracy and money minting realtors.”
Talking on a popular podcast host last week Dr Asim Khawaja, an economist teaching at Harvard University Business School and associated with multiple research outfits and projects in Pakistan, pressed for attention to the transparency of processes adopted for declared goals. 
He was frustrated over the gap between the economic potential and its actualisation in Pakistan but was hopeful that the current tough patch would pass eventually. His optimism, he said, was based on the trust in people and their skills to make the most of whatever was within their reach in an adverse situation.
“You can fool some people sometimes, but even the most wicked ones can’t expect to fool everyone all the time. The current coalition government may establish an upper hand over the opponents, but it can’t order economic indicators to fall in line. There is no shortcut. The government must take the pending issues by the horn and tackle them.” 
“If the IMF is not comfortable with the finance minister, then instead of servicing his ego, the task needs to be assigned to someone else,” advised an economist. “The fact is that even friends like China, Saudi Arabia and UAE are waiting for an IMF nod before proceeding on their help commitments.” 
A keen watcher of economic trends with his little finger in multiple pies shared his thoughts. “In the immediate term, I see no choice but to have a formally announced policy on rationing foreign exchange. It should not be ad hoc measures left to the State Bank of Pakistan; it requires a properly thought-through and well-debated cabinet decision.  
“In the longer term, we need to rethink our energy consumption, particularly as it relates to transportation and climate control in buildings, as well as sourcing energy. Given our dire straits, this is the best time to convert to greater use of public transport (make cars prohibitive) and use railways, both for goods and passengers. 
“For heating and cooling of buildings, I understand that a study at the Lahore University of Management Sciences indicates that 40 per cent of our entire energy consumption is for this purpose. If we design energy-efficient buildings, this consumption can be reduced significantly. Apart from focusing on renewables, and despite the negativity about coal, we must develop Thar, including its gasification.
“On the side of generating export earnings, as well as import substitution, the key is an investment in agriculture (higher exports as well substitute import of edible oils, lentils etc). If we can get our foreign exchange earnings and disbursements onto a sustainable balance, the other aspects of the economy should start falling in place”.

11,Why female financial inclusion matters,Pakistan’s financial inclusion numbers are the worst in the region for both males and females.,"Pakistan’s financial inclusion numbers are the worst in the region for both males and females. According to the latest data, about 8 out of 10 women in Pakistan do not have access to a bank account.
Given the relatively low rate of digital adoption, this means one of two things: women carry cards in the names of their male relatives, so all their expenses are open to scrutiny, or all their dealings are in cash, meaning they are dependent on ‘pocket money’ or ‘allowance’. In both cases, women do not have autonomy.
But why does it matter?
In simplest terms, financial inclusion means access to money with the right to spend it as the holder sees fit. Many males will guffaw at the statement, imagining women holding bags of branded clothing while strolling through malls for their next purchase. This is not what is meant by financial inclusion.  
Women’s financial inclusion can be understood through social and economic dimensions. Regarding social impact, access to finance has been linked to women’s empowerment by allowing them to create economic opportunities for themselves. In turn, this enhances the welfare of families since women tend to spend disproportionately more on the education and health of their children.
Be it grocery shopping or eating leftovers, women tend to prioritise family members, especially children, over themselves. When women are financially empowered, their families benefit.
The economic rationale for women’s financial inclusion rests on the untapped potential contribution women can make to the economy. Expanding credit to women-owned businesses can help such businesses grow, bringing the savings of such entities into the formal net.  
It is a cycle. Women’s low participation rate is because of inadequate financial inclusion, and without access to financing and employment opportunities, females cannot be economically productive. This perpetuates gender inequality, and Pakistan remains stuck in its regressive patriarchal society.

12,Data points,"For half the global population, menopause is a natural part of life. It also happens to overlap exactly","The stigma of menopause
For half the global population, menopause is a natural part of life. It also happens to overlap exactly with the age at which employees are most likely to be qualified to advance into top leadership positions — and new research shows that people experiencing menopause are often judged as less leader-like, creating yet another barrier that holds women back. However, research also found that when women talk openly about going through menopause, it can reduce this bias, helping them to come across as having high leadership potential regardless of menopausal status. What can managers do to help reduce the harmful effects of this stigma? 1) Normalise the open discussion of menopause. Many women are afraid to mention the topic at work. 2) Create psychologically safe workplaces that empower everyone to share and ask for support without fear of retribution or discrimination. 3) Proactively ensure that all employees feel supported — not silenced — as they progress through the phases of their careers and lives.

Displacing Hollywood in the Japanese box office
The US share of the world’s third-biggest box office has been dropping for years, a phenomenon that predates the pandemic and has only been aggravated by it. It’s part of a broader decoupling between Hollywood and Japan. But unlike the woes studios face in China, this is no ideological departure. Japan is a free market, with no equivalent of the quota Beijing places on US movies nor censors stepping in to prevent their release on moral grounds. Instead, Japanese audiences favour domestic fare. While the first Avatar was a box-office hit in Japan and the country’s 12th-highest-grossing movie of all time, tastes have shifted in the decade-plus since. Japanese animation these days is a big-budget affair, illustrated nowhere better than by the hits from director Makoto Shinkai, the creative force behind Your Name, the 2016 tale of body-swapping teens that is Japan’s fifth-biggest box-office blockbuster.

Branding: Harry & Meghan vs the royal family
You don’t have to be a royal prince to market yourself into the limelight these days. But notoriety often comes at the expense of the institution that paved your way. One of the reasons the public is obsessed with Harry and Meghan is that they represent an important economic trend that resonates well beyond the British royal family: the rising tension between individual branding and the power and prestige of being part of an institution. And it’s not just the royals; it’s a trend across all industries. The dynamic creates tension between being a star and being a good institutional team player is particularly noticeable in the media industry. The whole economy has changed. Many industries reward superstars — they get higher salaries, fame and can monetise their own brand while everyone else is left behind.

Blockchain as a behavioural tool
It wasn’t long after the developers of bitcoin first used a distributed ledger to record transactions in 2008 that the blockchain revolution was announced with all the fanfare that usually accompanies promising new technologies. Then, as often happens with emerging technologies, blockchain’s promise collided with developmental realities. Now, a decade and a half down the road, that early promise is becoming manifest. In his new book, Enterprise Strategy for Blockchain: Lessons in Disruption From Fintech, Supply Chains, and Consumer Industries, Ravi Sarathy argues that distributed ledger technology has matured to the point of enabling a host of applications that could disrupt industries as diverse as manufacturing, medicine, and media. Blockchain is a tool, but it’s also a new way of running a business.

13,At the terminal stage,"Further electricity tariff hikes, put on hold due to political considerations, are being discussed to generate additional revenue.","The cancerous disease of Pakistan’s power market is becoming terminal with each passing day despite overdoses of price shocks to consumers. At the start of the fiscal year in July, the PDM government came with a capital blow to increase electricity tariff by a massive 47 per cent (Rs7.91 per unit) to “clear the backlog” left behind by the previous PTI government in “violation of international agreements” with the International Monetary Fund. The circular debt, as of June 30, 2022, stood at Rs2.253 trillion.
The tariff increase was aimed to generate additional revenue and bridge a financial gap of Rs893 billion in 2022-23 in meeting annual revenue requirements of about Rs2.52tr of the power companies, excluding K-Electriic, besides providing a general sales tax of more than Rs425bn to the government. It was promised that such a massive increase would take care of the delayed tariff notifications in the past and prices would begin to go down in October.
On completion of first quarter financials, it became clear that despite those back-breaking cost increases, the financial gap would conservatively remain on the higher side of Rs706bn — almost 1pc of Gross Domestic Product — during the current fiscal year. With little ‘realistic’ estimate, the gap is set to go beyond 803bn.
In fact, about Rs393bn gap has already occurred in the first quarter (July-September 2022). And all this is because of bad governance, concedes an official presentation made first to the finance minister and then to the prime minister.
While explaining various heads for this surge and sharing blame among the power and finance divisions, the presenters had the guts to suggest an amendment in the law to impose a ‘special surcharge’ at proposed rates of Rs12.60 to Rs31.60 per unit, to avoid an Rs706bn additional charge on the federal budget as ‘subsidy’.

Further electricity tariff hikes, put on hold due to political considerations, are being discussed to generate additional revenue

The cost of bad governance was defined as low bill recovery, higher losses and theft, pending generation cost, the markup on debt, cost of zero-rated incentives, Kissan package, delayed notifications, lower demand and K-Electric subsidy. The relevant divisions presented four options to pass on the cost to the general industry, commercial, bulk and other customers at an average rate of Rs31.60 per unit to bridge the Rs706bn gap through surcharges.
The presentation clearly showed that the end tariff, including taxes for commercial consumers, would cross Rs94 per unit from the existing rate of Rs49.31 per unit. For bulk consumers, the end rate was proposed at Rs78 instead of Rs40.70 per unit, and for industrial consumers, it was suggested at Rs81 per unit from Rs40.15 per unit. 
The end rates for ‘other and general services consumers’ was proposed at Rs77.30 per unit from about Rs40 per unit a present without any change in the existing rate of Rs27.3 and Rs20.36 per unit for domestic and agricultural consumers at present, respectively.
Under the second option, a Rs12.59 per unit increase was proposed for all consumer categories. In that case, the commercial rate was proposed at Rs67 per unit, for bulk and industrial at Rs56 per unit, for others and general services at Rs55 per unit, Rs42 per unit for domestic and Rs35 for private agriculture. In both these cases, the required Rs706bn subsidy stood recovered.
The third option envisaged Rs2.27 per unit surcharge for all consumers along with an additional budget subsidy of Rs579bn, while the last and 4th options suggested Rs706bn additional subsidy and no increase in consumer rates.
The proposal did not get through at this stage because of political factors, but it puts bare the critical fault lines in the foundations of an economy already facing stagflation and has repercussions for the troubled International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme. 
The power division conceded that the scenario shared with the IMF for completion of the 8th review was massively flawed and was bound to fail, but discounted power rates offered to zero-rated industry, farmers, and staggering fuel costs have added fuel to the fire. The full-year impact of zero-rated relief is well over Rs118bn and unbudgeted.
The bill recovery target was set at 93.58pc with the IMF, but it actually stood at 83pc in the first quarter (July-September) with a financial impact of Rs104bn. This included a Rs25bn Kissan package, Rs20bn court stays, and Rs54bn spillover. Recovery has been claimed to have improved to 91pc by the end of November, but such numbers in the power sector have always been murky until these are consolidated or audited at the end of the quarter.
System losses were committed at 15.83pc but actualised at 17.42pc. A 1pc loss translates into Rs28bn in revenue loss per annum at current rates. The tariff rebasing of Rs7.91 was assumed on July 1, 2022, but Rs7 per unit was actualised by July 25, and the remaining 91 paisa per unit was kept pending. 
Moreover, the exchange rate parity was taken at 195 while it actually went beyond Rs224 most of the time, and the Kibor rate for borrowing was assumed at 10.5pc against the actual rate of over 15pc. The price shock also appeared to have played a part as electricity demand dropped to 40bn units against the targeted 45bn units. Subsidies payable to K-Electric were also massively underreported.
Private experts and the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) have been continually pointing out the governance issues in power companies to reduce losses and improve recoveries which are leading to circular debt but in vain. 
According to Nepra, the overall actual losses in FY22 stood at 17.13pc as against the actual loss of 17.95pc during FY21. This is much higher than the allowed transmission and distribution losses for FY22 at 13.41pc. The consumer end tariff is based on 100pc recoveries, but the actual recovery in 2021-22 was 90.51pc as compared to 97.30pc during FY21, i.e. almost 7pc less than the previous financial year. This is alarming, keeping in view the current average per unit cost of the billed amount.
No wonder the distribution companies’ receivables, including KE, amounted to Rs1.398tr in FY21 but increased to Rs1.68tr by the end of FY22, showing an increase of Rs282bn. The circular debt has meanwhile gone beyond Rs2.5tr by end-September.
