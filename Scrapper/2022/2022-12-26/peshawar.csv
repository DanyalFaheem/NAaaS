3,Govt doubles seats for students of tribal districts in medical colleges,Additional seats distributed among 14 medical and dental colleges in KP,"PESHAWAR: The government has doubled the number of seats allocated in medical and dental colleges for the students of tribal districts for the academic session 2022-23.
The decision, taken by Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC), has been conveyed to the provincial health department and Khyber Medical University (KMU), the admitting varsity in the province.
Sources told this scribe that PMC had reduced seats in medical colleges for the students of newly-merged districts which created unrest among them. They said that the allocation of seats in different public sector medical and dental institutes had been reduced to 136 from 290 for former Fata.
They said that the number of quota-based seats for Balochistan had also been decreased to 29 from 113. PMC has informed the vice-chancellor of KMU, Prof Ziaul Haq, about the number of eats in November of the current year.

Additional seats distributed among 14 medical and dental colleges in KP

The government had increased the number of seats to 290 in academic year 2021-22 while seats for Balochistan were enhanced from 29 to 113 in public sector medical and dental colleges of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The decision to enhance seats had been made through Federal Cabinet Division Islamabad in a meeting held on March 2, 2017 with the then prime minister in the chair. The meeting decided that the quota for students of tribal areas in education and health institutions in all provinces should be doubled and retained for 10 year after its merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In compliance with the same decision and letters by Higher Education Commission and Pakistan Medical Commission, the KMU implemented the directives for two years and double seats were allocated to the students in 2021 and 2022.
However, official sources said that reduction in seats by PMC for that academic session caused unrest among the students, who were demanding admission as per 2021 and 2022 policy.
The candidates and their parents started agitation and protest against the government as they were demanding increase in the number of seats. However, neither KMU nor the provincial government had the authority to increase or decrease the number of seats in any medical and dental college of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
It was the prerogative of PMC to allocate seats in any medical and dental college of Pakistan and KMU, the admitting university, would fill only the allocated number of seats, sources said.
PMC clarified that it would be one-time increase in the number of seats as it was made provisionally on the requests of the provinces and in the best interests of the students. In future, the colleges wanting to raise number of seats should make arrangements for mandatory inspections by PMC to stand eligible for the increase, it said. It added that increase in seats would be linked with inspections.
Sources said that PMC had been arguing that it would deteriorate the standard of medical education if it kept admitting more students in colleges with the present infrastructure that was meant for less number of students. They said that medical and dental colleges were being allowed specific number of seats after inspection and it was not a good practice to accommodate more students than the number permitted by PMC.
Prof Ziaul Haq told Dawn that not a single candidate could be enrolled into PMC’s portal over and above the allocated number of seats. He said that KMU was required to induct students on the seats notified by PMC.
He said that a final meeting of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and PMC recently decided to reinstate the quota for students of tribal districts. He said that the number of seats for Balochistan’s tribal areas was also doubled.
“The increased seats have been distributed among the 14 public medical and dental colleges in the province,” said Prof Zia.

They warned of staging a demonstration in front of the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi if their demands were not met within five days.
It merits a mention here that residents of Zafar Town had been driven out of their houses due to terrorist activities and consequent military operation to flush them out of the region. 
Addressing the protesters, ANP local leader Abdul Khalil said people of North Waziristan had vacated their houses due to operation Zarb-i-Azb. He said when internally displaced persons returned to their areas they saw their houses were destroyed. He said very small amount of compensation was being paid to the affected people, adding that PDMA provided meager ration to them. He, however, regretted that the disaster management body had stopped providing the local residents with ration for the last seven months.
The other protest leaders pointed out that the tribesmen had left their ancestral lands and houses for the sake of country and restoration of peace, but the authorities had failed to acknowledge their sacrifices.

9,PHC acquits convict in assault case on basis of compromise,The man solemnises nikah with victim and pays compensation.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court Mingora bench has set aside sentence of life imprisonment awarded to a man for assaulting a deaf and vocally impaired woman as he has married the victim on the basis of a compromise.
A two-member bench consisting of Justice Mohammad Naeem Anwar and Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan accepted an appeal filed by the convict, Dawlat Khan, a resident of Buner district, pronouncing that the appellant was acquitted of the charge on the basis of compromise.
An additional district and sessions judge/gender base violence court, Qaiser Khan Afridi, in Buner had convicted the appellant on May 17, 2022, and sentenced him to life imprisonment and fiend him Rs100,000 in default of which he had to undergo six months more imprisonment.
The occurrence had taken place in the jurisdiction of Daggar police station and an FIR was registered there under section 376 (rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code on August 24, 2020, on complaint of the victim’s mother.

The man solemnises nikah with victim and pays compensation

The complainant had told the police that her unmarried daughter, aged around 30, was deaf and vocally impaired by birth. She stated that on August 18, 2020, her daughter fell ill and she took her to a hospital in Daggar for treatment and after her examination the doctor told her that she was pregnant of six or seven months.
She said that she got information from her daughter through her gestures that six/seven months ago, when she was sleeping in a cattle shed, her neighbour Daulat Khan came there and fastened her hands with her scarf and repeatedly assaulted her.
About delay in registration of the FIR, the complainant stated that she was unaware of the law and a local jirga was involved in resolving the matter, but had failed.
Subsequently, the victim had given birth to a male child on November 9, 2020, and the DNA tests of the appellant and the baby proved that he was the child’s biological father.
The statements of the victim before the magistrate and the trial court were recorded with the help of an expert/interpreter named Ikramul Haq. In both her statements, she charged the appellant for the commission of the offence.
The father of the appellant and the victim along with their lawyers appeared before the bench and produced a compromise deed of October 24, 2022.
The appellant’s father stated that not only nikah of the victim was solemnised with the appellant rather the victim and complainant had also been compensated.
According to terms of the compromise deed, the jirga members fixed dower of the victim as two tolas gold besides Rs500,000 as compensation to her and the complainant and an amount of Rs50,000 for dowry articles of the victim.
The cash amount along with a tola of gold (prompt dower) was in custody of an elder of the area named Taj Mohammad, who also appeared before the court and admitted it.
“Thus without going into the controversy regarding the fact that the offence is non-compoundable, etc as the parties entered into a compromise when marriage of victim has been solemnised with the appellant, besides compromise appears to be in the larger interest of the parties, on acceptance of the compromise the appeal stands allowed,” the bench ruled.

“Work on Bhara Kahu bypass is in full progress. More than 50 per cent of the work is completed. This project will reduce traffic congestion and pollution and will also facilitate the tourists going towards Murree,” the CDA tweeted on Sunday following the visit of its chairman to the construction site.
The CDA chairman, retired Capt Mohammad Usman, along with Member Engineering Syed Munawar Shah and others visited the project site.
The member engineering and director Rana Tariq briefed the chairman about the progress on the project.
Sources said the CDA chairman directed the engineering wing to complete the project as soon as possible.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif while inaugurating the project in September this year had directed the CDA to complete it till February 10.
The sources said work was going on round the clock but it seemed the mega project cannot be completed by Feb 10. The sources said even if the project of around six kilometres road, which has one interchange, a bridge, three underpasses and more than one km flyover, was completed by the end of March it will be a big achievement for the CDA.
An official said after seeing the scope of the work, he believed that the project could not be completed till April 15.
The bypass project worth Rs6.5 billion starts from Malpur and also crosses from Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) land.
According to the CDA, 199 kanal land of the university falls in the alignment of the road while CDA in return has already offered 225 kanals to the QAU. However, the project faced controversy when QAU faculty members filed a court case and obtained a stay order which continued for around two months.
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) recently dismissed the petition of the faculty members. Following this, the CDA expedited the work at the QAU portion. Meanwhile, the QAU filed an intra-court appeal in the IHC.
The 5.6 km-long road (including a 1km flyover) starts from Murree Road at Malpur and culminates on Murree Road near the Jugi bus stop adjacent to Punjab Cash and Carry in Bhara Kahu from where the flyover begins till the end of the local bazaar towards Murree.
A CDA official said 100pc pile work had been completed and now the civic agency was focusing on pile capping work while underpasses were also near completion.

15,KP to generate Rs10 billion from ongoing energy projects: official,Work under way on six schemes in different districts,"PESHAWAR: Energy and Power Secretary Nisar Ahmad Khan has said that after completion, the ongoing energy projects in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are expected to generate the annual income of more than Rs10 billion.
“The ongoing economic ups and downs and security uncertainty in the country are worrying. A plan of action has been drawn up to resolve the issues,” he said.
He expressed these views while presiding over a review meeting on the progress of the ongoing energy projects in the province.
Mr Khan said that timely completion of ongoing energy projects in the province was the first priority of the government. However, he said that economic issues in the country were proving to be a major obstacle to completion of energy projects, for which an integrated strategy was indispensable.

Work under way on six schemes in different districts

He said that department of energy’s subsidiary Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organisation (Pedo) was a profitable enterprise that successfully completed various hydropower projects at a cost of Rs9 billion and brought an income of more than Rs32 billion to the province.
Pedo Chief Executive Engineer Naeem Khan told the meeting that work was currently under way on 42 energy projects of transmission line including hydro and solar power.
Several projects of Pedo have entered the final stages of completion. The projects are expected to generate more than Rs10 billion for the province.
The current security situation, closure of letters of credit and increase in taxes on import of machinery for Pedo’s hydropower and solar energy projects were matters of concern.
Pedo has successfully completed eight hydropower projects so far to generate a total of 172 megawatts of electricity. The province is getting an annual income of more than Rs4 billion from these projects.
Work on six projects including 84 megawatts Matiltan hydropower scheme in Swat, 69 megawatts Lawi scheme in Chitral, 40.8 megawatts Koto scheme in Dir, 11.8 megawatts Karora scheme in Shangla, 10.5 megawatts Chapri Charkhel scheme in Kuram and 6.5 megawatts Barando scheme in Torghar is going on rapidly. These projects will generate a total of 232.8 megawatts of electricity and an income of Rs10 billion for the province.
Similarly, 4,400 mosques, 8,000 schools, 187 primary health units are also being shifted to solar energy. The completed solar energy projects are saving millions of rupees annually in terms of electricity bills.
In the second phase, 291 mini micro-hydropower stations are also being constructed in the backward areas to generate 41 megawatts of cheap electricity.
Several energy projects have also been successfully completed in tribal districts. The transmission system has improved largely.
The secretary expressed his satisfaction with the overall performance of Pedo and said that issues with the federal government in some energy projects would be resolved on a priority basis.

Commissioner (Rawalpindi Division) Saqib Manan said that the officials concerned had been directed to ensure surveillance of the industrial units in their respective areas and also penalise owners of brick kilns for not using modern technology.
The industrial units causing pollution would be dealt with iron hands, he said, adding action would be taken against operators of units for using bad quality fuel or burning old tyres for fuel. The commissioner said efforts were also being made to take action against stone crushers, owners of brick kilns and vehicles for emitting smoke.
It is pertinent to mention here that with the onset of winter in November, smog started to increase, causing air pollution in different cities of Punjab including in Rawalpindi district. The government had formulated a 10-point policy to control pollution, which would remain in force until further notice. Fines against smog emissions have also been increased.
The government had issued a notification banning the burning of all types of crops and garbage, smoke-emitting vehicles, factories, brick kilns and stone-crushing plants in all districts including in the Rawalpindi district.
Transportation of uncovered building material, traffic obstructing parking and all types of dust-blowing activities have also been banned. The fine for crop burning has been increased to Rs50,000, the fine for smoke emitting brick kilns has been increased to Rs100,000, the fine has been increased to Rs2,000 for smoke-emitting vehicles and motorcycles and the fine for smoke-emitting factories, bakeries and stone crushing machines has been increased to Rs50,000.

The smog control policy had been put in place by EPD and accordingly squads and teams had also been formed to check violations, he said.
District administration officials said that an awareness campaign had been launched across the district apprising citizens of the negative effects of smog and the role they could play to mitigate it. Efforts are being made to make the awareness campaign effective so that citizens themselves could play a role in mitigating the effects of smog.
EPD officials said that there was a zero-tolerance policy in place against smog-emitting brick kilns, industries and stone-crushing plants. The staff concerned was monitoring the quality of smoke with a special gadget on the G.T. Road and near the motorway in collaboration with traffic police.
They added that the Punjab government had established special laboratories across the province to protect citizens from the dangers of smog. District emergency officer (DEO) Rawalpindi asked drivers to adopt all out precautionary measures in fog. He advised people to avoid unnecessary travelling in fog hours. Keep the fog lights of vehicles on and commute on roads slowly by keeping a reasonable distance between vehicles, he added.
Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Taimoor Khan urged people to take precautionary measures and follow traffic rules during smog season. Drivers should also attach dense fog lights on to their vehicles, he said.
According to experts, smog is a kind of air pollution which was originally named after smoke and fog mixed in the air. It affects visibility, human health and crops.

“Reduced business hours will further stagnate the economy and reduce revenues,” he added.
