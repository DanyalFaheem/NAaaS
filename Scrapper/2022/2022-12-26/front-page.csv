• PM pays tribute to security forces
QUETTA: Six security personnel, including a captain, embraced martyrdom while at least 17 people suffered injuries in different incidents of terrorism across Balochistan on Sunday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), a clearance operation was underway in Kahan after an explosive device targeted security forces. 
The military’s media wing said that an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) went off close to the leading party of the security forces. Cap­tain Fahad, Lance Naik Imtiaz and sepoys Asghar, Mehran and Shamoon were martyred in the blast. 
The statement further said that the sanitisation operation continued in the area to apprehend the suspects involved in the attack.
In another statement, the ISPR said that an operation against militants in the Sambaza area of Zhob left one security man martyred. One terrorist was killed, while two personnel were injured.
ISPR said the forces had started an operation in Sambaza on the basis of intelligence reports to deny militants the use of suspected routes to move across the “Pakistan-Afghanistan border to sneak into KP along the interprovincial boundary and target citizens and security forces”.

1,Pakistan ‘ill-prepared’ to combat new Covid variants,Experts urge NCOC to issue updated guidelines amid lack of screening at airports.,"ISLAMABAD: As new variants of coronavirus spread at a rapid pace in parts of the globe, including India, China, and the United States, health authorities in Pakistan seem to be ill-prepared to stop the arrival of the virus in the country.
Even though the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) claimed that the situation was being closely monitored, there have been no measures at airports, such as rapid testing and screening of inbound travellers, to detect positive cases of Covid-19.
NCOC member Dr Shahzad Ali Khan said the Centre was regularly holding its meetings. He added it was yet to be seen how new variants would behave in Pakistan since “viruses behave differently in different environments”.
“We have been closely observing the situation. It is a fact that a sudden spread [of Covid-19] has been observed in China because there were strict restrictions in place and an abrupt removal of these curbs allowed the virus to spread,” he said.
 
 

Dr Khan claimed that the immunity level of the citizens of Pakistan was better due to vaccination.

Experts urge NCOC to issue updated guidelines amid lack of screening at airports

“New variants may disturb those who are not inoculated, so I would urge people to get vaccinated and get booster shots. Although NCOC has not issued any guidelines, I would advise people that they should avoid social gatherings for some days,” he said.
Time for updated SOPs
On the other hand, independent experts believe that NCOC should issue fresh guidelines and give a “position statement”. Since the world has become a global village, the virus can enter the country anytime, they said, adding that people would prefer to travel following the new guidelines.
Microbiologist Prof Javaid Usman said that in China virus started spreading at a fast pace after restrictions were suddenly lifted. He added that currently, the atmosphere due to a lack of rainfall has become polluted, with dust acting as one of the major pollutants.
“Such atmosphere contains Influenza, swine flu (H1N1), non-Covid-19 coronaviruses, para-influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Due to the presence of all these other germs, it becomes difficult to tell if a person is suffering from Covid-19 or some other virus,” he said.
Dr Usman urged people to wear masks and take precautionary measures.
 
 

Prof Dr Javed Akram, a renowned general physician, told Dawn said that over the months, the transmissibility of the virus has increased, but so far there was no evidence if vaccines were effective against Covid-19 or not.
“I suggest that NCOC should regularly issue guidelines because it keeps masses and health authorities vigilant,” he said, adding that international organisations watch these steps very closely and people start travelling in the light of advisories.
While replying to a question, Dr Akram said that the immunity level of Pakistanis was high due to the Expanded Program of Immunisation (EPI). “Moreover, we have more experience with viruses because of hygiene and other issues. Although it is not good for our health, but in the case of Covid-19 it is good,” he said.
According to a document from the National Institute of Health, 15 new Covid-19 cases were reported across the country on Sunday. The case positivity ratio was 0.4 per cent and 16 patients were in critical condition.
At least 3,749 Covid tests were conducted: around 406 tests were conducted in Islamabad, 107 in Faisalabad, 920 in Lahore, and 321 in Peshawar.
The coronavirus strain spreading in China is a sub-variant of the highly infectious Omicron variant: BF.7 or BA.5.2.1.7, CBS News reported.
Following widespread protests, the country of 1.4 billion people this month began dismantling its “zero-Covid” regime of lockdowns and testing that had largely kept the virus away for three years — at great economic and psychological costs.
The abrupt change of policy caught the country’s fragile health system unprepared, with hospitals scrambling for beds and blood, pharmacies for drugs, and authorities racing to build special clinics.

2,"Elahi will dissolve assembly after trust vote, says Imran","“With the dissolution of Punjab and KP assemblies, the powers-that-be will be compelled to hold elections,"" says Imran.","LAHORE: Amid growing deliberations among Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) legislators that the party should seriously consider its ally PML-Q’s advice — apparently coming from the establishment — to delay dissolution of the provincial assemblies, PTI chief Imran Khan is confident Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi will dissolve the Punjab Assembly soon after taking a vote of confidence.
“With the dissolution of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies, the powers-that-be will be compelled to hold elections, and I foresee the polls in April,” Mr Khan told the media at his Zaman Park residence on Sunday.
“I am in touch with the new [military] establishment,” he explicitly claimed in the same breath.
The PTI wants the chief minister to take the vote of confidence before Jan 11 — the date when the high court holds its next hearing on the Punjab government’s plea against the governor’s ‘unconstitutional’ order to remove the chief minister and his cabinet.
Only a day earlier, Mr Khan saw the elections being held in March or April, while a day before that he had said the critical economic situation did not warrant taking the polls beyond February or March.
He reiterated his position why fresh elections were needed and how a public-mandated government in the saddle could rein in the plunging economy and bring it back on the path of progress and prosperity.
Though the PML-Q in the public is expressing full confidence and support for Imran Khan’s decision, CM Elahi has been vocal about delaying dissolution of the Punjab Assembly until its tenure is complete.
The chief minister’s son, Moonis Elahi, who is in direct talks with Mr Khan, has suggested the PTI hold its horses over the vote of confidence and first let the Lahore High Court decide whether the governor’s order to summon a session during an ongoing session as well as de-notifying the chief minister is valid or not.
Sources in the PTI said the party was also discussing whether it could gather the 186 members in the house required to win the vote of confidence – since some MPAs were abroad. The party was, however, confident that in the worst-case scenario, it would get Mr Elahi back in the chief minister’s office in a run-off vote count.
They also said the PML-Q leadership was right in cautioning that Mr Khan should first ensure he would get elections in Punjab and KP 90 days after both houses were disbanded.
In this context, the PTI chairman told the media that his party wouldn’t be bothered if elections were delayed as the incumbent federal government would continue facing the public wrath.
“The PTI did not dissolve the Punjab and KP assemblies immediately on Dec 17 because it had to convince its allies,” Mr Khan said in response to a question.
On Dec 16, a day before Mr Khan announced that the two assemblies would be dissolved on Dec 23, the chief minister had paid a quick visit to Rawalpindi, and returned carrying advice for the PTI chief to reconsider the decision to go ahead with the dissolution.
While stressing Mr Elahi would dissolve the assembly soon after taking a vote of confidence, Mr Khan observed restraint on a question about the intentions of the chief minister. “A good player is one who plays every ball bowled to him,” he remarked.
On the other hand, the PTI and PML-Q have been busy in deep consultations over seat adjustment since the latter plans to continue with the alliance. Mr Khan, in the meeting, however, did not give any clear response on the number of seats being adjusted.
While there are reports that the PML-Q wants a bigger share as compared to what it got in the 2018 general elections, the PTI says its ally would get seats where it showed its chances of victory.
Moonis Elahi has said the PML-Q wants both allied parties to decide about the seat adjustment, as the Punjab Assembly is going to be dissolved soon. He says the PTI chief constituted a committee, led by party Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi, which has met thrice and is discussing constituency-wise seat adjustment. 
Both allies have so far finalised matters on constituencies in central and south Punjab and Moonis brushed aside reports that the PML-Q is demanding 30 provincial and 15 National Assembly seats in Punjab. Mr Elahi hopes the PML-Q will get a large share of seats because this time “only politicians are in consultations”.
PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry on Sunday told the media that the PML-Q would not be able to win in the next elections without the PTI’s support. The PML-Q would get seats as part of an adjustment plan where it showed its strength to win, he stated.
“The PTI and PML-Q have so far discussed seat adjustment in Gujrat and Gujranwala districts,” he explained.
Earlier in the day, PTI chief Imran Khan tweeted a message on the birth anniversary of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. 
“One of the main reasons we have been unable to realise our Quaid Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s vision for Pakistan is absence of justice through rule of law, which ensures equality before the law for all citizens. This leads to Haqeeqi Azadi, true freedom and protection of citizens’ rights.”

 





 
In a consequent tweet, Mr Khan wrote: “This in turn protects them from elite capture of the State and government. Unfortunately, in Pakistan because rule of law was never allowed to be established, elite capture of the country allowed powerful institutions and mafias to remain above the law as if it was their right.”

 





 
Meanwhile, the PTI chief also chaired a media strategy committee meeting and decided to give a tough time to the Pakistan Democratic Movement government.
Sources said the PTI leadership decided to adopt an aggressive media strategy against the PDM government and planned to ‘campaign’ on the alleged anti-national steps of the incumbent rulers.
They also said the PTI would highlight the deteriorating economic situation of the country besides criticising the bad governance and failed foreign policy of the government. The committee also decided to raise its voice for Senator Azam Swati and censure the government for disrupting the accountability process.

3,Govt pins TTP’s rise on PTI chairman,Ayaz Sadiq also urges ex-COAS Qamar Javed Bajwa to reveal his “role” in 2018 general elections in “ensuring” PTI's victory.,"LAHORE: Amid an incre­ase in the number of attacks by militants in parts of the country, federal Minister for Economic Affairs Ayaz Sadiq on Sunday blamed former prime minister Imran Khan for the resurgence of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). 
While referring to rise in terror attacks and the dialogue with the banned outfit initiated by the PTI government last year, the PML-N leader said the nation had seen the result of Imran Khan’s strategy of opening talks with the Taliban. 
“Imran Khan (while in power) did not curb terrorism. Rather he allowed negotiations with those who had martyred children at the Army Public School (in Peshawar). And now a new wave of terrorism has begun because of those negotiations.”
The former speaker also urged former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa to reveal his “role” in the 2018 general election in “ensuring” the victory of the PTI. He said the Grand Demo­cratic Alliance (GDA) representatives said they were under pressure in 2018 to join the PTI.
He said the support extended by Mr Bajwa to Imran Khan when he was prime minister had never been given to any other premier in the past. But, the PTI chairman is “ungrateful to his benefactors” as he was now maligning the ex-COAS. He said Mr Khan did the same thing to Aleem Khan and Jahangir Khan Tareen.
He advised Punjab Chief Minister Parvez Elahi to remain “vigilant” while doing favours to Imran Khan since his “characteristics cannot change as I know him since the 1960s”. 
Mr Sadiq lambasted the PTI chairman for using the religious card in politics, abusing and victimising rivals, as well as preferring his personal interest over national interest.
“The one who had been talking of the state of Madina committed corruption by taking away gifts from Toshakhana worth Rs6 billion, declaring one of them (in his tax statement) and devouring the rest. The claimants of the Madina state would neither steal nor conceal (one’s wealth).”
He lamented that Imran Khan always foul-mouthed PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, who always addressed the PTI chairman decently. He alleged that Mr Khan got spying cameras installed even in the bathrooms of the jail where Maryam Nawaz Sharif was imprisoned.
The PML-N leader said those who brought Imran Khan to power were responsible for the financial damage caused to the country during the around four-year rule of PTI as the national debt doubled in the PTI regime, which took $44 billion in loans.
In reply to a question, he said while listening to the conversation between Parvez Elahi and his son Moonis Elahi one “gets the impression that the PML-Q got just 20 seats” in return for a promise to dissolve the Punjab Assembly at the directives of Imran Khan. 
He, however, cautioned the ‘Q’ leadership that the crutches available during the 2018 polls would be missing in the next general elections and they as well as the PTI would have to stand on their own legs.
Referring to U-turns often taken by the PTI chairman, he said on one hand Imran said that he would fight his political fight on his own, and on the other, he was requesting the establishment to intervene and save him from likely accountability.
In response to a question, the minister said if the PTI chairman intended to dissolve the Punjab and KP assemblies he would have done so at once after the announcement during a Pindi rally in November.
Answering a question, he said if the coalition in Punjab had the backing of the required number of MPAs to remain on his post then why was Mr Elahi trying to delay the trust vote.
He said that local government elections would be held in the month of April, while the general election would be held after Aug 15, 2023, when the assemblies would complete their five-year constitutional terms.

4,Speaker insists ‘resigned’ MNAs appear in person,PTI decides its members will visit Parliament House on Dec 28 ‘in a group’.,"ISLAMABAD: Although National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf wrote a fresh letter to the PTI recently, asking its lawmakers to come individually for the verification of the resignations they had tendered in April, he is unlikely to accept the resignations, apparently on the government’s advice. 
On the other hand, PTI has decided to make another attempt for its lawmakers to appear before the speaker “in a group”. Therefore, the party MNAs would go to Parliament House on Dec 28 to get their resignations accepted.
The speaker had already asked the party that according to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007, he was required to meet 127 MNAs of the party, including its chairman Imran Khan, individually to ascertain whether they had tendered their resignations freely and without duress.
The NA speaker wrote to PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi, asking him to send all party MNAs individually to verify their resignations.
Meanwhile, the NA Secretariat issued a press release on Sunday, reminding Mr Qureshi that the MNAs must appear individually.

‘Under pressure’ govt won’t allow resignations’ acceptance; PTI members to visit Parliament House on 28th ‘in a group’

The press release also mentioned Rule 43, which deals with lawmakers’ resignations and says that an MNA under Article 64(1) of the Constitution may, by writing under his hand addressed to the speaker, resign his seat if he hands over the letter of resignation to the speaker personally and informs him that the resignation is voluntary and genuine, and the speaker has no information or knowledge to the contrary.
Meanwhile, a government source told Dawn that the coalition government is “under pressure” and is said to have advised the speaker not to accept the resignations. The PTI has unintentionally provided a pretext to the government in this regard by deciding that its MNAs would not appear before the speaker individually.
PTI lawmakers submitted their resignations on April 11 after PTI chief Imran Khan was deposed as prime minister through a confidence vote in parliament.
The National Assembly Secretariat in its letter said that it summoned PTI lawmakers on May 30 and gave them time from June 6 to 10 to appear in person and confirm their resignations, but “none of them came”.
The speaker had accepted the resignations of 11 PTI MNAs in July — including Dr Shireen Mazari, Ali Muhammad Khan, Fakhar Zaman Khan and Farrukh Habib — without clarifying the reason for accepting them.
When contacted, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said PTI lawmakers had already tried to meet the National Assembly speaker, but Mr Ashraf skipped and left his office. “We are making another attempt to meet him on Wednesday,” he added.
He said PTI MNAs would not meet him one by one and would go to Parliament House in a group.
Mr Chaudhry urged the Supreme Court to look into the resignations’ case and said it was a “rare moment in the country’s history” that 127 MNAs tendered their resignations en masse on one call of PTI chief Imran Khan.
Drawing a comparison of the grip leaders have on their parties, the former information minister said: “PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz had once asked her husband’s elder brother and another MNA Safdar Javed Abbasi to resign, but they disappeared and switched off their phones.”
He said the country could only see political and economic stability only after free and fair elections.
Meanwhile, another source in the government said the National Assembly Secretariat had frozen salaries and allowances of PTI lawmakers since they resigned and the held amount had crossed over Rs200m.
“We cannot give them their salaries because if their resignations are accepted, they will be accepted with retrospective effect, and in that case, how will we recover the amount?” an official, who declined to be named, wondered.
He said some MNAs were still holding official accommodations.
