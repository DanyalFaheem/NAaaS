1,Assemblies shouldn’t be dissolved at an individual’s whims: Saad,Advises PTI chief Imran to return to NA to play role of opposition.,"LAHORE: Railways and Civil Aviation Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique says that elected assemblies come into being to take decisions for the welfare of the public and the country and not to be dissolved at the whims of any individual.
Speaking at a ceremony here on Sunday, he said dissolution of assemblies was not a child’s play. He stressed that the elected houses were meant to make decisions for the well-being of the public and the country and not to be dissolved at the whims of anyone who hated to be a part of the democratic system.
The federal minister said the culture of abusing one’s rivals had penetrated the country’s politics and those who introduced the ‘Project Imran’ knew well that he had the habit of using abusive language. He said those who thought that they would make their way through abusive language must know that they would fail to achieve their motives.

Advises Imran to return to NA to play role of opposition

In a reference to the establishment’s role in politics in the history of the country, Saad Rafique said there should be no more experiments as the country had enough of them and the people should be allowed to make decisions (on who should rule the country).
He said when Imran Khan was in power he crushed his opponents but the then opposition didn’t indulge in any conspiracy against the PTI government. He counseled Imran to be brave and stop crying day in and day out when he was out of the power corridors.
The federal minister also advised the PTI chairman to return to the National Assembly and oppose the incumbent government’s policies there. He said the issue of holding general elections would not be resolved through threats and abuses rather all parties involved would have to sit together and talk to reach an amicable solution.
He said there could be political differences but the politicians should understand their responsibility as the country had been seeing either martial law or people with a martial-law approach during its 75 years history.
Saad Rafique alleged that the country was suffering from the worst economic crisis due to Imran Khan’s government, which first struck an agreement with the International Monetary Fund and then backed out of it. He said that the PTI had its governments in four provinces in the country and it should serve the masses through these governments instead of indulging in baseless politicking.
Referring to the Wazirabad gun attack on Imran Khan, he thanked God that the attacker was caught; otherwise, the PTI would have blamed its rival parties for it.

The duo was lodged in the FIA lock-up here.

3,Parvez Elahi takes a U-turn on PTI’s Dreshak,Terms minister who faced his ire brilliant; says won’t accept his resignation.,"LAHORE: In a display of a change of heart, Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi on Sunday described the PTI’s Hasnain Bahadar Dreshak as a brilliant minister of his cabinet, saying that he would not accept his resignation as the cabinet member.
After an altercation and arguments in the sixth cabinet meeting on Dec 17, the chief minister had given a shut-up call to Dreshak, the minister for livestock and dairy development, and asked him to ‘get out’.
In a news channel interview on Dec 18, Mr Elahi himself explained that Dreshak had tendered his resignation and added, “resignation has been accepted forthwith”.
Mr Elahi had snubbed the minister in the cabinet meeting while he was attempting to speak, saying, “he should take permission before expressing views and show some discipline”.

Terms minister who faced his ire brilliant; says won’t accept his resignation

In his new statement, the chief minister said Mr Dreshak would continue performing his responsibilities as the provincial minister. Lauding the performance of the PTI’s minister, Mr Elahi said the legislator was running his ministry in a far better way. 
“Sardar Hasnain Bahadar Dreshak is like my son Moonis Elahi for me,” he added.
Last week, the chief minister was infuriated and was chiding every PTI leader from Imran Khan to Fawad Chaudhry and Musarrat Jamshed Cheema for speaking against his ‘benefactor’ retired Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa. The party leadership stopped speaking against Bajwa but Mr Khan continued his tirade against the former army chief.
Sources in the PML-Q told Dawn that Mr Elahi had softened his stance as both parties were now in critical discussion of dissolving the Punjab Assembly and seat adjustments in the next general election. 
They said Mr Elahi was also supposed to take a vote of confidence of all House members (PTI’s 177 and PML-Q’s 10 members) to retain his position as the chief minister. 
They say every vote counts as both parties plan to go for the vote of confidence even before Jan 11 when the Lahore High Court (LHC) will take up the case of the chief minister’s removal by the governor

4,The ‘might’ of a PSP officer,"Posted in Karachi, the SP used force of five police stations of Lahore to teach a lesson to his ‘adversary’ through a fake FIR.","LAHORE: The Punjab government has referred a case to the Establishment Division to initiate disciplinary proceedings against a superintendent of police (SP) under various charges, including misuse of power and misconduct, endorsed by a high-level inquiry.
The case against SP Hafeezur Rehman Bugti was referred to the ED on the recommendations of the Punjab Inspector General of Police who had ordered the inquiry and in the light of its findings declared that the police officer had brought a bad name to the department. In the same case, the police department dismissed from service four officials and awarded various departmental punishments to eight others, including two Station House Officers (SHOs) of Lahore, Wajihul Hassan and Imran Khan.
All these police officials, including Mr Bugti, were held guilty in lodging a fake case in Lahore against a private company’s chief operating officer, Sajjad Hashim, his relatives, including his brother-in-law, and a friend.
The ‘fake FIR’ against Mr Hashim was lodged by his former wife at the behest of the SP in question wherein she had accused him of hurling threats.

Posted in Karachi, the SP used force of five police stations of Lahore to teach a lesson to his ‘adversary’ through a fake FIR

The punishments were awarded in the light of a regular inquiry carried out by the then Lahore SSP Operations Mustansar Feroze when it appeared that the police officer had used his influence to teach a lesson to the complainant, Sajjad Hashim.
According to the inquiry report, BS-18 police officer Hafeezur Rehman Bugti ‘controlled ’ the Lahore police from Karachi, his current posting station, engaged more than a dozen policemen of five police stations of Punjab capital and got various raids conducted at the residences of Hashim’s relatives to arrest him and others.
The police teams arrested Hashin, his brother-in-law and friend, humiliated and allegedly tortured them, using police force of various police stations of Lahore, the report said.
“It is informed that on the recommendations of the Punjab IGP, the competent authority in the Punjab government has accorded permission to refer the case to the Authority concerned for initiation of disciplinary proceedings under the Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules 2020 against Mr Hafeezur Rehman Bugti,” reads a letter of the Punjab Services & General Administration Department.
Addressed to the Establishment Division Secretary, Islamabad, the letter stated that the draft charge sheet, statement of allegations, list of witnesses and relevant case material including inquiry report has been sent as sufficient evidence to proceed against the police officer.
Charge Sheet:
According to the charge sheet, the SP had directed the police officials of Lahore’s various police stations to arrest of the complainant and his relatives in the FIR registered with South Cantt police station of Lahore.
The police arrested him and others illegally outside their jurisdiction which showed non-professionalism, inefficiency and gross misconduct on the part of the SP.
“Being a senior member of disciplined force, your acts are not only spoiling the image of police in general public but also causing distrust of general public on the police,” reads the IGP letter.
It further stated: “By reasons of the above, you appeared to be guilty of charges of inefficiency and misconduct within the meaning of rules 2 and 3 (a) and 3 (b) of the Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules 2020 which may involve imposition of the penalty of dismissal from service prescribed under rule 4 of the rules ibid”.
Complaint Sajjad Hashim alleged that Hafeezur Rehman Bugti ruined his family and professional life while treating him like a ‘terrorist’.
The police officer turned hostile towards him, misused his connections, and the police force against him and his family members to teach him and his relatives a lesson.
Hashim said the a police team picked him up in April 2022 along with his friend Sohail Zafar from his office in the DHA, thrashed, physically tortured, snatched mobile phones, laptop and then shifted them to the South Cantt police station.
The police also raided the house of his brother-in-law Shaukat Ali Gill in Johar Town, thrashed and also misbehaved his (Sajjad’s sister) and his young nephews.
“Even heinous case criminals are not treated like the police physically tortured me, my relatives and friend in custody”, the complainant said.
He said that the officer was so much influential that he had evaded all the previous inquiries as most of the senior police officers would try to ‘rescue him’ being a member of the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP).
Police sources said inquiry against Bugti and others was carried out on the intervention of a senior official from a powerful institution.   
When Dawn contacted Mr Bugti for his comment, he refused to speak on the matter.

5,Punjab Notes: Tariq Mehmood’s compendium of tales,It is rightly believed that the officers of the Raj administration started the practice of writings treatises and...,"It is rightly believed that the officers of the Raj administration started the practice of writings treatises and books on diverse subjects that they found important as lynchpin of the vast colonial empire in India. But it’s also true that much before the advent of colonial era, we can see the traces of such a tradition with distinct indigenous stamp: inimitable Vishnugupta generally known as Chanakya Kautilya, for example, composed his immortal ‘Arthshastra’ on the statecraft and governance in the fourth century BCE.  
Chanakya was a Punjabi born in Takshashila (present day Taxila) and associated with its highly celebrated university that was glory of the ancient world. He was one of the main architects of Mauryan Empire. He helped Chandragupta in rise to power. He was adviser to both Chandragupta and his son Bindusara.
Taxila is not far-off from Sialkot from where Tariq Mehmood has come up with his autobiography titled Daam-e-Khayaal prefaced by Akram Malik and published by Sang-e-Meel, Publications, Lahore. He is a reputed ex-bureaucrat. But his rise to fame lies in his being a prominent fiction writer, translator and intellectual. His autobio doesn’t exclusively deal with the issues of statecraft but a number of prevalent issues of power politics and governance have been laid bare in his narrative. Since the author has served for decades in the higher echelons of our civil service, he has been in close touch with both public and power wielders.  
The position of bureaucracy as a legacy of colonial state invests it with immense authority. It’s in fact a permanent fixture in the power structure of the country. Fortunately, his autobio discreetly avoids being a chronicle of self-glorification as is the case with most of the books authored - usually ghostwritten - by individuals who have been in the business of power.
Its significance lies in its being a compendium of political, social and cultural life. Whatever is described is richly detailed and lucid that creates immediacy with its film like images moving at natural pace. The details are what makes his narrative realistic and lifelike. They expose the life as it actually is; messy and sleazy.  
Mundane nothingness when exposed through the lens of objectivity gets impregnated with some fresh meaning which usually remains hidden beneath the patina of staleness.  
Tariq Mehmood makes a real effort to go beyond appearance while depicting it. To grasp the difference between appearance and reality is what makes an intellectual or scientific undertaking worthwhile. And it wouldn’t be wrong to state that appearance if correctly understood and analysed would lead to a point wherein the path lies to reality.  
Life in our contemporary society is not as simple as it appears. It is indescribably complex and layered because of its incredibly long history spread over at least 6,000 years of urban dwelling. It has been simultaneously battered and enriched by near interminable stream of immigration from foreign lands that ended being absorbed. This has resulted into a staggering phenomenon of diversity, plurality and multiculturalism. Consequently we have mass psyche that is composite, variegated and convoluted the delectable samples of which can be seen in this book that make it fascinating. We come across innumerable characters of flesh and blood during the course of the narrative hailing from all classes; from the rich to the poor and from the powerful to the powerless with their distinct physiognomy, traits and behavioural patterns. Ridiculously interesting are ‘yes sir type’ servile subordinate members of staff at the beck and call of their ‘Saab’, the civil bureaucrat who are ever ready to do anything to appease him in the most obsequious manner. Then we encounter landlords and politicians who thrive because of their connections with the bureaucracy which put them on a higher pedestal vis-a-vis people. They are tyrants in their dealing with people but are petty sycophants before the bureaucrats through whom the power of the state and government is mediated. There is nothing personal about it. The relationship is purely functional bordering on transactional. The moment an officer is transferred, he/she becomes an alien for them. The newly-posted is the one to be saluted. Tariq paints such a hilarious picture of one of the landlords who was more interested in knowing whereabouts of his replacement for whom he carried gifts than saying him goodbye at his transfer. His sketch like portraits of powerful politicians, rulers and military strong men are equally revealing. He exposes them matter-of-factly by describing and depicting them as what they are. And one finds all such stuff in the details and anecdotes regarding their behaviour and public dealing.  
One event stands out when according to the instructions of ruthless dictator Ziaul Haq members of national assembly from some parts of Balochistan and Punjab were herded in district D.G. Khan and, stuffed into plane and dispatched to Islamabad as if they were to be delivered by parcel post.
Tariq’s fascination with erstwhile East Pakistan (East Bengal that’s now Bangladesh) where he spent some years as a student derives from his sincere attempt to know its people, their organic relationship with their language and literature, and syncretic culture which defy the peculiar ideological notion of state developed in the West Pakistan. The author clearly hints at the process that gradually led to the alienation of Bengali people from the state and its eventual dismemberment at a huge cost.  
Readers in our quasi-democratic society who have little access to the inner working of the power structure, will come across several serendipitous discoveries in Tariq Mehmood’s autobiography. It has the flow of a noiselessly meandering stream that carries much in its current for the discerning eye. The best aspect of this tome is the author’s worldview; it is rational and people friendly as it quietly unveils and cogently analyses what is hidden and not so hidden in our public life. It would be an enjoyably illuminating read if you are interested in deciphering the secrets of what happens in the corridors of power which impacts our private and public life. — soofi01@hotmail.com

The meeting was held at Alhamra Cultural Complex, Gaddafi Stadium a few days ago, presided over by Board of Governors Chairman Razi Ahmed.  
According to sources, the two upcoming festivals -- Faiz Festival and Lahore Literary Festival -- were also discussed in the meeting. Buying of new artworks for Alhamra’s Permanent Art Gallery was deemed praiseworthy. On the other hand, performing art productions were called equally important for their extensive reach to the masses in the shape of theatrical productions and musical concerts as compared to visual art.  
The board’s priority, the sources said, would be replacing commercial theatre at Alhamra with in-house productions for which theatre groups needed to be finalised that could perform quality productions regularly. It was also decided in the meeting that the cultural calendar, which was recently chalked out by the board, would be strictly followed and programming at Alhamra would be improved.  
The meeting also decided to use Alhamra Art Museum for exhibitions where renowned artist Imran Qureshi would exhibit his work in March 2023.  
On the occasion, board Chairman Razi Ahmed said the welfare of Alhamra employees was a part of LAC priorities for which the board was taking different steps to facilitate them. Apart from this, Mr Ahmed said since the last board meeting, significant efforts had been made to make the environment of Alhamra Arts Council more attractive, adding this process would continue with more enthusiasm.  
During the meeting, Alhamra Executive Director Zulfiqar Ali Zulfi told the board that buying new paintings for Alhamra Art Museum was the need of the hour.  
Board members, including Dr Naela Amir, Salima Hashmi, Qudsia Rahim, Imran Qureshi, Hamra Abbas, Nazish Attaullah, Raza Ali Dada, Muhammad Ali Baloch, Shahid Nadeem, Sumaira Jawad, and Mian Nauman Kabir, were also part of the meeting.  
Heads of different committees briefed the board on various issues, and the board members informed the meeting of their opinions, which would be part of the future action plan.

9,Women cops taking the lead in railways police,LAHORE: Nausheen Kanwal is the first female station house officer (SHO) in the history of the Mughalpura Railway...,"LAHORE: Nausheen Kanwal is the first female station house officer (SHO) in the history of the Mughalpura Railway Police Station. 
She is the 66th station house officer (SHO) of the police station but the only woman on the long list of the SHOs since its inception in 1982. She commands the beat from the Lahore Railway Station till the Wagah Railway Station. 
“I feel happy that I made history. I’m also happy to say that my performance, not my gender, got me this role,” she told Dawn.
Sub-Inspector Nausheen Kanwal joined the force in 2014 and until 2020 she oversaw the criminal record office. She was engaged as a law instructor in 2020 but now oversees the police station. 
She says that her appointment as the SHO has sparked a healthy competition among her male and female coworkers. But she is not the only woman serving in the railway police as there are many others as well. 
Constable Aneela Raheem holds the charge of the help desk at the Rawalpindi Railway Station while Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Saman Mukhtar is the in-charge of the support desk at Lahore.  
According to the railway police data, the railway police force currently employs 300 women. The total sanctioned posts in the force are 7,300 while of them, 4,600 are working now. 
A railways spokesperson said the visibility of policewomen in uniform at railway installations would increase with time.  
Earlier, the trend of deploying women officials in the desk-related jobs prevailed in the force or they frequently performed official tasks like record keeping. But now the trend is changing. 
For a few months, Inspector Naila Ashraf served as the acting DSP in Rawalpindi while now she is an inspector at the Central Diesel Locomotive Station. Inspector Tayyaba has a field position at the main station of Rawalpindi while SI Sidra is an investigating officer for the Havelian Railway Police. 
According to a spokesperson for Pakistan Railways Inspector General (IG) Rao Sardar Ali Khan, the department has a policy that supports women to work in the field.  
“The passengers have also started observing the presence of female police officials at railway stations,” he says and adds that a thorough strategy has been developed for the women police personnel to play a proactive role in the force. Now, every major railway station has two teams of women police officers on duty. Considering the importance of the safety of women travellers, Safar Saheli, a digital app, has been introduced to assist police in gathering reports of harassment at train terminals and on trains. A woman SI and two constables advise the female passengers about the precautions to be taken throughout the travel at the start of a railway trip, similar to what happens on aeroplanes. Additionally, the railway administration has introduced separate berths and seats for women passengers travelling alone. 
However, Nasuheen Kanwal has a word of warning for women passengers or those who are on the rail property. “Keep in mind that any crime or unforeseen circumstance can occur anywhere, any moment.”  
The best protection, in her opinion, is to book a seat in advance and keep one’s medical history and emergency numbers in the pocket or luggage. 
“There is no need to worry because no crimes have been reported in my beat since I took over as SHO last month,” she says. 
Nausheen attributes the efficient operations to her field vigilance and the assistance of her coworkers to spring into action whenever they receive a call for assistance.

10,Governor says will respect court order,LAHORE: Governor Balighur Rahman said on Sunday said he would respect the court decision in the case of denotifying...,"LAHORE: Governor Balighur Rahman said on Sunday said he would respect the court decision in the case of denotifying the chief minister.  
Mr Rehman had on Thursday last denotified Chaudhry Parvez Elahi as chief minister of the largest province in a bid to forestall former premier Imran Khan’s plan to dissolve the Punjab Assembly.  
Mr Elahi subsequently challenged the governor’s order in the Lahore High Court which suspended the order of de-notifying the chief minister, restoring him and his cabinet on the assurance that the provincial assembly would not be dissolved, at least until the next date of hearing on Jan 11.   
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also hinted at moving the Supreme Court against the restoration of Parvez Elahi as chief minister by the LHC.   
It is likely that the Pak­istan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition will challenge the LHC judgement in the Sup­reme Court in this week.   
“I had asked the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence and also de-notified him using my constitutional powers. Now this matter is in the court and I will respect its decision,” the governor said at a function organised in connection with the Quaid Day and Christmas at the Governor’s House here on Sunday.   
The event was attended by a good number of PML-N MPAs and workers.  
The governor said that the founder of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, lived on principles and always spoke of the constitution and supremacy of law.  
The guiding principles of Quaid-e-Azam, faith, unity and discipline were the guiding light for us, he said.   
Mr Rahman said the Muslim League-Nawaz always believed in supremacy of law and constitution. The change in the federal government also came in a constitutional manner and the country would progress when there was rule of law and constitution.   
Talking about Christmas, he said “According to the vision of Quaid-i-Azam, all the minorities living in Pakistan have equal rights. Protecting the rights of minorities is our duty and responsibility. The role of minorities in the establishment of Pakistan is commendable.”  
On this occasion, the birthday cake of PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif was also cut.

14,"Politics, vested interests delay model fruit market for14 years","RAHIM YAR KHAN: The model fruit and vegetable market, approved around 14 years ago, has only managed to get a...","


 
RAHIM YAR KHAN: The model fruit and vegetable market, approved around 14 years ago, has only managed to get a boundary wall owing to internal politics and financial interests of two groups of traders.  
According to agriculture department (E&N) sources, the market had been approved in 2008 by the then agriculture secretary, as the old premises near Government Girls Degree College Sukkur Adda were not big enough for both traders and customers.  
In 2013, documentation for the project was started and in 2014, its land acquisition completed. The administrative market committee made the first payment for the scheme to the revenue department in 2015, and in the same year, the department provided 14.5 acres on Shahbazpur Road near Maalikpur after completing all formalities.  
However, in 2016, the residents of Maalikpur went into litigation for reassessment of the price of land acquired for the market. Later, in 2018, Rs45 million was paid to the land owners on the orders of the Lahore High Court (LHC) Bahawalpur bench. 
In 2019, after the possession of land was completed, the construction of a boundary wall was started, which was completed at the end of 2020. In the meanwhile, its design had been changed, but not approved yet.  
Last week, during a visit to the old fruit and vegetable market, Deputy Commissioner Salman Khan Lodhi held a meeting with traders and the Market Committee officials and expressed annoyance over not shifting to the new market for being overcrowded here. He also questioned Extra Assistant Director Agriculture (Economics and Marketing) Mian Samiullah for not completing requirements for starting the civil works.  
Another reason for the delay in starting the civil works was said to be the establishment of a similar market in the private sector on Gray Minor Canal over 18 acres where most fruit and vegetable traders had purchased spaces for their shops at comparatively low rates.  
One group of traders was forcing the community to start building their shops there, while another did not want the market to be shifted to the new location as it was allegedly minting around Rs400,000 a month in rent from illegal stalls on the old premises.  
Mr Samiullah told this correspondent that Rs500m had been transferred to the department concerned for the civil works for the new vegetable market. Its design had been finalised and after a meeting of relevant officials next week, the construction work would be started soon, he claimed. 
ABDUCTEES FOUND: Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Aamir Zulfiqar Khan appreciated the local police for safely recovering four people who were kidnapped from the katcha area, according to a press release issued on Sunday.  
The IGP directed that action against criminals should be sped up and the process of protecting lives and property of citizens made more effective.  
As part of the Punjab police’s ongoing operations against criminals in the katcha area, the district police took timely action on Saturday night and safely recovered four abductees.  
District Police Officer Akhtar Farooq said kidnappers had abducted Dr Riaz Dashti and three relatives on the pretext of check-up of a patient late at night. On receiving information, a heavy contingent of police chased the suspects, who escaped by taking advantage of the fog and darkness, leaving the hostages behind. Police are conducting search operations in the area to trace the kidnappers.
