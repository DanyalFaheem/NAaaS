The finance ministry would immediately release the amount to the GPA at the rate of Rs250,000 per head to buy a boat engine for each fisherman. 
The decision followed a June 3 visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Gwadar Port when he announced that 2,000 engines would be provided to poor fishermen within three months.
The Prime Minister’s Office then asked the Ministry of Maritime Affairs to complete formalities to provide engines for fishing boats to deserving fishermen free of cost and to ensure that beneficiaries should be selected by transparent ballot based on well-defined criteria.
The maritime ministry processed a project case to the Planning Commission to provide 2,000 engines to the fishermen at the cost of Rs500m with an implementation period of one year.

Govt approves Rs823m for the purpose, six months after premier’s announcement

Subsequently, at a steering committee meeting on Gwadar initiatives held at the Prime Minister’s Office on July 6, a committee was formed to finalise the criteria for distributing the boat engines.
The Planning Commission was informed that the Gwadar Port Authority floated three tenders on July 6, Aug 17 and Oct 13 in the national newspapers, but none of the advertisements attracted an appropriate response according to the requisite criteria. 
Resultantly, all tenders had to be scrapped.
At a Nov 23 meeting to review the progress of the Gwadar project presided over by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, it was decided that the option of cash transfers to deserving fishermen for buying boat engines should be considered in view of the lukewarm response to the original equipment manufacturers or bidders and the non-availability of engines on time as reported by the GPA chairman.
The meeting decided that the GPA should complete formalities as per procedure in practice on priority.
Therefore, on the request of the maritime ministry, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet allowed last week to withdraw Planning Commission’s Form-1 (PC-I) and directed it to surrender the amount of Rs500m already allocated for the initiative in the budget.
The Planning Commission was also directed to surrender an additional Rs322.75m saved from other development projects. As a consequence, the ECC approved the reappropriation of the entire amount — i.e. Rs822.75m — as a supplementary grant to the GPA to enable it to disburse in full to all 3,291 fishermen registered with the Balochistan fisheries department at the rate of Rs250,000 per head for buying boat engines.
An official said the government machinery took more than six months to process the case already approved by the prime minister on June 3 for implementation in three months, and yet it was unclear if the fishermen would be able to utilise these funds appropriately.

1,"Moscow ready to negotiate over Ukraine, says Putin","Alleges West, led by US, trying to cleave Russia apart","MOSCOW: Russia is ready to negotiate with all parties involved in the war in Ukraine but Kyiv and its Western backers have refused to engage in talks, President Vladimir Putin said in an interview aired on Sunday. 
Russia’s Feb 24 invasion of Ukraine has triggered the most deadly conflict in Europe since World War Two and the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. 
There is, thus far, little end in sight to the war.
The Kremlin says it will fight until all its aims are achieved while Kyiv says it will not rest until every Russian soldier is ejected from all of its territory, including Crimea which Russia annexed in 2014. 
“We are ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solutions, but that is up to them — we are not the ones refusing to negotiate, they are,” Putin told Rossiya 1 state television in the interview. 

Alleges West, led by US, trying to cleave Russia apart

CIA Director William Burns said in an interview published this month that while most conflicts end in negotiation, the CIA’s assessment was that Russia was not yet serious about a real negotiation to end the war. 
An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Putin needed to return to reality and acknowledge that it was Russia which did not want any negotiations.
“Russia single-handedly attacked Ukraine and is killing citizens,” Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter. “Russia doesn’t want negotiations, but tries to avoid responsibility.” 
‘No other choice’ 
Putin said Russia was acting in the “right direction” in Ukraine because the West, led by the United States, was trying to cleave Russia apart. Washington denies it is plotting Russia’s collapse. 
“I believe that we are acting in the right direction, we are defending our national interests, the interests of our citizens, our people. And we have no other choice but to protect our citizens,” Putin said. 
Asked if the geopolitical conflict with the West was approaching a dangerous level, Putin said: “I don’t think it’s so dangerous.” He said the West had begun the conflict in Ukraine in 2014 by toppling a pro-Russian president in the Maidan Revolution protests. 
Soon after that revolution, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and Russian-backed separatist forces began fighting Ukraine’s armed forces in eastern Ukraine. 
“Actually, the fundamental thing here is the policy of our geopolitical opponents which is aimed at pulling apart Russia, historical Russia,” Putin said.
Putin casts what he calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine as a watershed moment when Moscow finally stood up to a Western bloc he says has been seeking to destroy Russia since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. 
Ukraine and the West say Putin has no justification for what they cast as an imperial-style war of occupation which has sown suffering and death across Ukraine. 
Putin described Russia as a “unique country” and said the vast majority of its people were united in wanting to defend it. 
“As for the main part — the 99.9pc of our citizens, our people who are ready to give everything for the interests of the Motherland there is nothing unusual for me here,” Putin said. 
“This just once again convinces me that Russia is a unique country and that we have an exceptional people. This has been confirmed throughout the history of Rus­sia’s existence.”

2,China stages ‘strike drills’ around Taiwan,BEIJING: China’s military said it had conducted “strike drills” in the sea and airspace around Taiwan on ...,"BEIJING: China’s military said it had conducted “strike drills” in the sea and airspace around Taiwan on Sunday in response to what it said was provocation from the democratically-governed island and the United States. 
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, said the drills showed Beijing was destroying regional peace and trying to cow Taiwan’s people. 
China staged war games around Taiwan in August following a visit to Taipei by then-US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, and on Saturday it condemned the United States for a new defence authorisation law that boosts military assistance for Taiwan. 
In a brief statement, the Eastern Theatre Command of China’s People’s Liber­ation Army said it had carried out “joint combat readiness patrols and joint firepower strike drills” around Taiwan, though it did not specify the exact location. 
“This is a resolute response to the current escalation of collusion and provocation from the United States and Taiwan,” it added, without giving details. “Theatre forces will take all necessary measures to resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.” 
Taiwan’s defence ministry said China’s actions “once again highlight its mentality of resolving differences by force and destroying regional peace and stability”.
“The Chinese Commu­nist’s ‘military intimidation’ acts are obviously aimed at cowing our people and are not conducive to (China’s) international image,” it added.

3,Migrants left outside Kamala Harris’ home in freezing cold,"“This latest drop-off is a political stunt by the Texas governor using people as pawns,” says aid volunteer.","WASHINGTON: About 50 migrants were dropped off outside Vice President Kamala Harris’ home on Christmas Eve and some didn’t even have adequate winter clothes to stay warm in subzero temperatures. More came on Christmas Day. 
The migrants were brought all the way from Texas by the state’s conservative governor to remind the federal government that their immigration laws were not strong enough to prevent immigration. The nearest Texas town is more than 2,200 kilometres from Washington. 
“This latest drop-off was a political stunt by the Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, using people as pawns,” said Amy Fischer, a volunteer with the Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network. 
“People are getting off the buses, they don’t have coats, they don’t have clothes for this kind of weather, and they’re freezing.” 
It was minus 14 Celsius in Washington on Christmas Eve. 

 





 
Ms Fischer said the network has been receiving migrants sent to Washington since the spring and was prepared for Saturday night’s arrival of about 50 migrants. The first bus arrived in April. 
CNN reported that Mr Abbott was one of at least three Republican governors who have been sending migrants to Washington to protest the Biden administration’s immigration policies. 
Initially, two busloads were taken to shelters in Washington. More buses arrived outside the vice president’s residence later on Saturday evening. 
A CNN team saw migrants being dropped off, with some migrants wearing only T-shirts in the freezing weather. They were given blankets and put on another bus that went to a local church. 
Another charity group, Sanctuary DMV, warned that “many unhoused folks (were still) sleeping outdoors in this freeze. So, please support our comrades distributing important supplies to our unhoused neighbor.” 
Remora House DC, yet another group of volunteers that looks after the homeless, distributed blankets, food, hand warmers, gloves, sleeping bags and tents among the new arrivals. “Keep checking … there’s still risk of hypothermia and frostbite,” it warned. 
Texas’s Republican governor, re-elected to a third term in November, is known for his anti-migration views. 
Gov. Abbott also criticises the Biden administration for policies that he says have led to the surge of unauthorised migration at the border. “While securing the border is the federal government’s responsibility, Texas will not sit idly by as this crisis grows. Texas is responding with the most robust and comprehensive border plan the nation has ever seen,” the governor said in a post on his official site. 
In November, Governor Abbott raised $400,000 from private donations to help fund his operation to bus migrants to Washington. Texas has already spent more than $20 million on the governor’s plan to transport thousands of migrants to Washington, New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia. The state has bused more than 13,200 migrants since April. 
In New York, a bipartisan City Council coalition has asked the White House to declare a federal emergency because of the asylum-seeker crisis. 
An emergency declaration would free up funding to house, feed and educate migrants. In a letter to President Biden, six Republican and two moderate Democrats, said such “bold steps” are needed immediately to provide essential services to migrants, with no end in sight.

4,World starving for peace: Pope Francis,VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis called for an end to the war in Ukraine and other conflicts in his Christmas message on...,"VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis called for an end to the war in Ukraine and other conflicts in his Christmas message on Sunday, saying the world was suffering from a “famine of peace”. 
Delivering the 10th Christmas “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) blessing and message of his pontificate, he also urged people to look beyond the “shallow holiday glitter” and help the homeless, immigrants, refugees and the poor in their midst seeking comfort, warmth and food. 
“Let us see the faces of all those children who, everywhere in the world, long for peace,” he said, speaking from the central balcony of St. Peter Basilica, the same spot from which he first emerged as pope when he was elected on March 13, 2013. 
“Let us also see the faces of our Ukrainian brothers and sisters who are experiencing this Christmas in the dark and cold, far from their homes due to the devastation caused by ten months of war,” he said, speaking to tens of thousands of people in the square below. 
“May the Lord inspire us to offer concrete gestures of solidarity to assist all those who are suffering, and may he enlighten the minds of those who have the power to silence the thunder of weapons and put an immediate end to this senseless war!” Francis said. 
The Ukraine conflict, he said, should not diminish concern for people whose lives have been devastated by other conflicts or humanitarian crises, naming among others, Syria, Myanmar, Iran, Haiti and the Sahel region of Africa. “Our time is experiencing a grave famine of peace...” he said. Francis called for a resumption of dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.

5,Three foreign NGOs stop work after Taliban ban on women staff,Germany seeks ‘clear reaction’ from international community over regime’s move,"KABUL: Three foreign aid groups, including Save the Children, announced on Sunday they were suspending their operations in Afghanistan after the Taliban ordered all NGOs to stop their women staff from working. 
The announcement came as top officials from the United Nations and dozens of NGOs operating in Afghanistan met in Kabul to discuss a way ahead after the Taliban’s latest restriction delivered a blow to humanitarian work across the country. 
Germany’s foreign minister on Sunday called for a “clear reaction from the international community” following the Taliban’s ban on women working for NGOs and on female university education. “Those who exclude women and young girls from work, from education and from public life not only ruin their country... 
We will try to get a clear reaction from the international community,” Annalena Baerbock said on Twitter. 

Germany seeks ‘clear reaction’ from international community over regime’s move

“We cannot effectively reach children, women and men in desperate need in Afghanistan without our female staff,” Save the Children, the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE said in a joint statement. “Whilst we gain clarity on this announcement, we are suspending our programmes, demanding that men and women can equally continue our lifesaving assistance in Afghanistan.” 
Saturday’s order issued by the Taliban authorities drew swift international condemnation, with governments and organisations warning of the impact on humanitarian services in a country where millions rely on aid. 
The latest restriction comes less than a week after the Islamists banned women from attending universities, prompting global outrage and protests in some Afghan cities. 
The Ministry of Economy on Saturday threatened to suspend the operating licences of NGOs if they failed to implement the order. The ministry, which issues these licences, said it had received “serious complaints” that women working in NGOs were not observing a proper Islamic dress code. 
A meeting of the Humanitarian Country Team, which comprises top UN officials and representatives of dozens of Afghan and foreign NGOs was being held in Kabul to discuss whether to suspend all aid work following the latest Taliban directive, aid officials said. 
The United Nations condemned the ministry’s directive and said it would seek an explanation from the Taliban about the order, which by excluding women “systematically from all aspects of public and political life takes the country backward, jeopardising efforts for any meaningful peace or stability in the country”. 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the ban would be “devastating” to Afghans as it would “disrupt vital and life-saving assistance to millions”. 
‘Hell for women’ 
“I’m the only breadwinner of my family. If I lose my job my family of 15 members will die of hunger,” said Shabana, 24, a woman employee with an international NGO working in Afghanistan for decades. “While the world is celebrating the arrival of the new year, Afghanistan has become a hell for women.” 
The ministry said women working in NGOs were not observing “the Islamic hijab and other rules and regulations pertaining to the work of females in national and international organisations”. 
But women employees AFP spoke to dismissed the charge. “Our offices are gender segregated, and every woman is properly dressed,” said Arezo, who works for another foreign NGO. 
It remained unclear whether the directive impacted foreign women staff at NGOs.
The international community has made respecting women’s rights a sticking point in negotiations with the Taliban government for its recognition and the restoration of aid. 
The ban comes at a time when millions across the country depend on humanitarian aid provided by international donors through a vast network of NGOs. 
Afghanistan’s economic crisis has only worsened since the Taliban seized power in August last year, which led to Washington freezing billions of dollars of its assets and foreign donors cutting aid. 
Dozens of organisations work across remote areas of Afghanistan and many of their employees are women, with several warning the ban would stymie their work.
“The ban is going to impact all aspects of humanitarian work as women employees have been key executors of various projects focussing on the country’s vulnerable women population,” said another top official of a foreign NGO in Kabul. 
On Tuesday, the minister of higher education banned women from universities, charging that they too were not properly dressed. That ban triggered widespread international outrage and some protests, which were forcefully dispersed by the authorities. 
Since returning to power in August last year, the Taliban have already barred teenage girls from secondary school. Women have also been pushed out of many government jobs, prevented from travelling without a male relative and ordered to cover up outside of the home, ideally with a burqa. They are also not allowed to enter parks or gardens.
