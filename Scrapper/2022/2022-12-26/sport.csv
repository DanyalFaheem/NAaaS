0,PCB revamp to come into play as Pakistan eye redemption in NZ Tests,New Zealand skipper Tim Southee says his team is wary about Pakistan’s ability to bounce back.,"KARACHI: Less than a week ago, captain Babar Azam was defending himself, his team-mates and coaches after the side’s defeat in the third Test against England in Karachi, which marked Pakistan’s first-ever whitewash at home.
Making it clear that he wasn’t ready to relinquish captaincy after Pakistan had lost four home Test matches in a row, the star batter had termed the national team’s management — led by head coach Saqlain Mushtaq — “the best”.
Babar had also backed the team selections, he had owned it.
On Sunday, on the eve of the opening match of the two-Test series against New Zealand, Babar spoke differently.
After all, there was too much to contemplate for the skipper, with an abrupt change at the helm of the Pakistan Cricket Board as Najam Sethi replaced Ramiz Raja as its chief, in an interim set-up.

“These things are happening off the ground, but for us as players, it’s important to focus on what can we do to win matches for Pakistan,” Babar told reporters in the pre-match press conference here at the National Stadium.
The changes in the PCB, unlike how Babar put it, will have an impact on the ground.
Match starts at 10:00am (PST)
Sethi sacked chief selector Mohammad Wasim two days into his second PCB stint to bring in former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi for an interim role in the position. And Afridi exercised his authority right away to add three new players — pacers Shahnawaz Dahani and Mir Hamza and spinner Sajid Khan — to the national squad for the New Zealand Tests, which was initially named by Wasim.
Babar, who used to have the final word in team selections during Ramiz’s time as PCB chief, said the final XI for the first Test will be decided after discussions with Afridi and his panel, which includes former Pakistan Test cricketers Abdul Razzaq and Haroon Rasheed.
Not long after Babar’s presser, Afridi suggested Hamza, who hasn’t featured for Pakistan since his debut against Australia in 2018, may be seen in action against New Zealand come Monday.
The decision seemed plausible to Afridi and company with frontline pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi out injured and fellow fast bowler Naseem Shah also coming back after nursing a shoulder niggle.
“Since we don’t have Shaheen, we need a left-arm pacer and Mir Hamza deserves a place, he has given performances,” said Afridi of the fast bowler, who boasts an impressive record of 376 wickets at a striking average of 21.76 in 92 first-class matches, while speaking to reporters at the venue.
Afridi also suggested there can be a different pitch at the National Stadium for the New Zealand games as compared to the slow turners made for the recently-held England series.
“We can make pitches like those in Austr­alia and South Africa,” said Afridi.
“We have to let go this old fashioned appr­oach of making batting- and spin-friendly pitches.”
For Babar, though, Pakistan will ride on their batsmen as their strength, who, he noted, underperformed during the England series.
“Batting is our main strength and it has done well in patches, but I think our batters will be back to their best and will help us in the New Zealand series,” said the 27-year-old.
“Our bowling resources are depleted due to injuries, but I’m hoping we’ll manage accordingly.”
New Zealand come into the series, having lost six of their nine matches in the ongoing World Test Championship cycle — a concerning record for the current holders.
Unlike Pakistan, the Kiwis aren’t under heavy scrutiny for their recent show. Howe­ver, the Pakistan series is a crucial contest for them.
Newly-appointed New Zealand skipper Tim Southee said his team was wary about Pakistan’s ability to bounce back after what England did to the hosts.
“I think England played some pretty special cricket in this series; Pakistan is a very good side, as they have shown for a long time, especially in these conditions,” said the fast bowler with 347 wickets in 88 Tests under his belt.
“We’re looking forward to the challenge. It’s a new series, and I’m sure Pakistan would be looking to bounce back after a tough series against England.”
England were rewarded for “Bazball” — their ultra-attacking approach — against Pakistan. Southee, however, said his team did not need to imitate England’s style of play and that the Kiwis would rather rely on their own strengths.
“We will be trying to look for ways that have worked for us as a side, and hopefully, we can put on a performance that works for our side,” noted Southee.
PAKISTAN: Imam-ul-Haq, Abdullah Shafique, Shan Masood, Babar Azam (captain), Saud Shakeel, Sarfaraz Ahmed (wicket-keeper), Agha Salman, Sajid Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Mir Hamza, Naseem Shah
Squads (probable):
NEW ZEALAND: Tom Latham, Will Young, Kane Williamson, Devon Conway, Henry Nicholls, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Blundell (wicket-keeper), Michael Bracewell, Tim Southee (captain), Neil Wagner, Ajaz Patel.

1,"Iyer, Ashwin to the rescue as India down BD in thriller to sweep Test series","DHAKA: Shreyas Iyer and Ravichandran Ashwin held firm as India beat Bangladesh in a thrilling second Test on Sunday,...","DHAKA: Shreyas Iyer and Ravichandran Ashwin held firm as India beat Bangladesh in a thrilling second Test on Sunday, dashing hopes in Dhaka of a first-ever win over their giant neighbours.
India needed just 145 to win the match and the series 2-0 but the visitors in the end won by only three wickets in a nail-biting morning’s play on day four at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.
Bangladesh overcame India in the preceding 50-over series but have never beaten them in a Test. India had won 10 of the teams’ previous 12 Tests, including five victories by an innings.
India won the first Test comfortably by 188 runs in Chittagong and were widely expected to romp home in the second game, cementing their position in second place in the ICC World Test Championship.
India bowled Bangladesh out on Saturday for a sub-par 231 but the home side’s spinners Mehidy Hasan and captain Shakib Al Hasan then reduced the visitors to 45-4 at stumps with 100 still to chase.
Shakib started the slide with the wicket of captain KL Rahul for two and then Mehidy claimed Chete­shw­ar Pujara, Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli — all for single-digit scores.
Bangladesh then reduced India to 74-7 when play resumed on Sunday but Shreyas (29 not out) and Ashwin (42 not out) put on 71 runs in an unbroken eighth-wicket stand to steer India home.
Mehidy was the stand-out bowler for Bangladesh in the second inn­ings, finishing with 5-63, which included two wickets in the morning.
Bangladesh dominated play in the opening hour as Shakib dismissed nightwatchman Jaydev Unadkat, who hit a six in the opening over but fell in the next after making 13.
Mehidy then trapped danger man Rishabh Pant leg before for nine before he bowled unbeaten overnight batsman Axar Patel for 34 runs.
Ashwin was dropped by Mominul Haque on one at forward short leg before he grew in confidence, with Iyer looking solid against spin at the other end.
After his three fours in two overs, Bangladesh were forced to finally bring pacers into the attack but to no avail.
Ashwin — named player of the match — took India close with a six after Mehidy changed his bowling end and wrapped up the contest with two more boundaries.
“[I’m] not going to lie, there was a lot of tension in the dressing room. It was a tough wicket to bat on, they put us under pressure in both innings,” said Rahul, who captained in place of injured Rohit Sharma.
The stand-in Indian skipper praised Iyer for his defiant batting.
“The way he batted today was phenomenal. He made it look really easy,”  Rahul told reporters.
Shakib rued the missed opportunities by his team.
“It is slightly disappointing, as other teams don’t miss the chances that we are missing,” said Shakib. “Those  made the difference. We could have bowled them out for 250 instead of  314 [in the first innings]. There was a chance in the second innings [too] ... maybe it happens due to lack of concentration or fitness. 
“Everyone contributed. We alw­a­ys knew that we had a chance... Very good Test cricket, that’s what the crowds love to see,” added Shakib.
“Both teams were really good. Credit goes to Shreyas and Ashwin, they absorbed the pressure well and built a partnership.”
Rock-solid Pujara was named player-of-the-series, with the Sussex star making 222 runs in the series.

2,Pele’s family gather at his hospital bedside,He is suffering from worsening cancer as well as kidney and heart problems.,"SAO PAULO: Family members visited the legendary Pele on Saturday at the Sao Paulo hospital where he is suffering from worsening cancer as well as kidney and heart problems, according to a social media post by his daughter.
Edinho, Pele’s son — who was recently appointed coach of Serie B football club Londrina, based in Parana in the north — arrived on Christmas Eve at the medical center, where he joined his sisters Flavia and Kely Nascimento.
He posted an Instagram photo of himself holding the football star’s hand, captioning it:  “Father... my strength is yours.” The ex-goalkeeper arrived a day after having explained his absence at his father’s side to local media.
“I would like to be present, but I am committed to my mission here. I’m not a doctor, I couldn’t really help much,” he said in an interview published on Friday by the daily Estadao.
That same day, Kely shared a photo of herself hugging her 82-year-old father in the hospital with the caption  “one more night together”.
Late on Saturday, Kely posted a picture of Pele’s wife Marcia Aoki and other family members gathered at the Albert Einstein Hospital where he is being treated. Pele was not visible in the image.
“Almost all of us. Merry Christmas. Gratitude, love, union, family. The essence of Christmas. We thank you all for all the love and light you send us,” Kely wrote.
On Wednesday, the hospital announced that Pele’s colon cancer was showing  “progression” and he needed  “more extensive care to treat kidney and heart failure.”
Earlier that day, his daughters had announced he would not be home for Christmas.
The atmosphere was calm outside of the hospital on Saturday, according to AFP.
Pele, born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, is considered by many to be the greatest footballer of all time and has received several messages of support since his hospitalization, including from the French star Kylian Mbappe, who called on followers to  “pray for the King.”
Pele was hospitalized in Sao Paulo on Nov 29 for what his medical team called a re-evaluation of his chemotherapy treatments, which he has been receiving since having surgery to remove a colon tumor in September 2021.

3,Boland retains spot for Boxing Day Test,Australian pacer Scott Boland (L) chats with captain Pat Cummins at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on ...,"

MELBOURNE: Scott Boland will retain his spot in Australia’s team for their Boxing Day Test against South Africa in Melbourne after an  “underdone” Josh Hazlewood failed to fully recover from a side strain, skipper Pat Cummins said on Sunday.
Boland slotted in for the injured Hazlewood in the second and final Test against West Indies as well as the Proteas series-opener in Brisbane, which Australia won by six wickets.
He grabbed four wickets at the Gabba and is a specialist at his home Melbourne Cricket Ground where he celebrated a seven-wicket debut in the Ashes last year.
“We gave Joshy [Hazlewood] every chance, it just got to a stage where [he] more than anyone else felt like he was a little bit underdone,” Cummins told reporters.
“It’s a mark of the man really, he himself said ‘don’t feel quite right’ so he kind of pulled himself out of selection. We talk a lot about how [as] a team we need a squad mentality and I think it’s another great example.
“We didn’t really get to the decision point, we gave it enough time and it played out. There would have been a part of everyone that would’ve felt a little bit aggrieved if Scott missed out.”
Veteran batter David Warner was also included in the team for the second Test. He will become the 14th Australian to have played 100 matches in the format.
Australia completed victory at the Gabba in two days and take a 1-0 lead into the second Test. The final match will be played in Sydney from Jan 4.
Australia squad: David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labu­schagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins (captain), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland.
Warner is just 78 runs shy of 8,000 Test runs and has vowed to get back to his best.
“This might be a wicket where I can go out and play like the old me,” he said.
After his batsmen largely failed to fire in Brisbane -- where they were bowled out for 152 and 99 -- South African captain Dean Elgar said a change could be afoot.
He was not willing to go into details, although middle-order batsman Theunis de Bruyn has been tipped to come in.
“The little bit I can give away is our bowlers retain their spots,” he said. “There’s probably a change amongst the batters.”
South Africa’s batting struggles in Brisbane followed some poor displays earlier in the year, with only Sarel Erwee and wicket-keeper Kyle Verre­ynne making centuries since the start of the 2021-22 season.

5,Queen of Spades clinches Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup,"In addition to the Gold Cup, the winning owner fetched a purse of Rs0.85m out of a total prize money of approximate Rs3.7m.","KARACHI: Long shot filly Queen of Spades lowered the colours of public fancy bay horse Royal Ransom in an exciting finish to bask in Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup glory before a full house in the winter Gymkhana race meeting here at the Karachi Racecourse on Sunday.
With Stewards Cup and Shah Mardan Shah Pir Pagara Memorial Cup under her belt, the victorious filly came from behind in home stretch to edge the 2020 Gold Cup winner by three-quarters-of-a-length recording two minutes and eight seconds for 10 furlongs.
While doing so, she made the trio of owner Syed Sibghatullah Shah Pir Pagara, trainer Mohyu­ddin and rider Zaki Zakir proud who all celebrated the day with a treble.
“I was confident of steering the horse home and lay my hands to [the] maiden Gold Cup,” a jubilant Zaki told Dawn.
The 40-year-old veteran who had served as camel rider in the UAE, dedicated the cup to his wife and three daughters.
It is pertinent to mention that the incumbent Pir Pagara won the Gold Cup for the second time, the other winner being Risk Free in 2014.
Chestnut horse Thunder Star came third by 11 lengths while colt Come On Champion completed the quartet another seven lengths away among half-a-dozen contenders.
In addition to the Gold Cup, the winning owner fetched a purse of Rs0.85 million out of a total prize money of approximate Rs3.7 million. The prize money was raised by Rs0.4 million on Saturday night. The rider and trainer also received their trophies in a ceremony held in the paddock amidst cheers.
The trio’s other success came in the Nursery Cup when rank outsider filly Time Game edged colt Ex Gambler by neck in a closely-fought race as favourite colt Sand Man came third and was followed by filly Cheer Leader. She romped home in one minute 18 seconds in the six furlongs contest.
They completed the feat when filly Angel Love outpaced filly Flaming Ember by two lengths in the 10th and concluding race of the day.
Rider M. Sajjad presented co-owners Syed Ismail Shah and Hamad Farooq Fikree with a splendid double while guiding favourites filly Queens Pride and bay horse Churchill to victories in the 2000 Guineas of Pakistan and the X-MAS Cup respectively. Both the horses were partnered by trainer Ghulam Shabbir II.
Queens Pride edged filly Silent Response by distance to post her fourth consecutive victory while Churchill obliged all and sundry by getting the better of Night Vision by three-and-a-half lengths.
Another favourite filly Chile made her mark while prevailing over mare Heer by four lengths to clinch the M. Rasheed Jung Memorial Cup that helped Sajjad and Shabbir to finish the day with a treble.
Earlier, chestnut horse Mehar­ban created quite a stir by sprinting to eight-and-a-half lengths victory over mare Soldier Girl to land the opening race.
In the other races, bay horse Raging Comet, colt Al Sabah and bay horse Azeem Choice returned victorious.

Right-handed Qasim, who was named player-of-the-match, smashed a 108-ball 131 studded with 12 fours and five sixes and in the process stitched a crucial 104-run partnership with opener Mohammad Faizan (51 off 53) after Central Punjab lost the first two wickets for no score.
Central Punjab were eventually bowled out for 240 in 43 overs as the next best score after Faizan’s 51 was 13 from Irfan Khan and Usama Mir.
Balochistan could muster 223 for nine in reply despite Haseebullah’s half-century (51), Bismillah Khan’s 49, Asad Shafiq’s 45 and 40 from Amad Butt.
Aamer Yamin took three wickets for 39 and Usama accounted for two batters.
At the UBL Sports Complex, Omair Bin Yousuf’s 99 not out off 129 balls (eight fours) helped Sindh chase a tough 273 against Northern.
Sharjeel Khan (69) and Danish Aziz (50) were other notable run-getters as Sindh chased down the target in 48 overs for the loss of five wickets.
Earlier, Anwar Ali took three wickets while Mohammad Hasnain and Asif Mehmood equally shared four wickets between them as Northern managed 272 for eight in the stipulated 50 overs.
Umair Masood and Umar Akmal, batting at seven and six, respectively, played crucial knocks of run-a-ball 68 and 65-ball 53 after the top order failed to click.
Omair was named player-of-the-match. 
Meanwhile, Sahibzada Farhan’s century and Arshad Iqbal’s four-wicket haul scripted a 36-run win for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over Southern Punjab at the NBP Sports Complex.
Sahibzada, who was declared man-of-the-match, made a 117-ball 107 featuring five fours and three sixes to lift Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to 265 for nine. Mohammad Haris (38) was the next best batter, while Waqar Ahmed and Adil Amin made 30 each.
Southern Punjab’s Mohammad Ismail took three wickets for 58 and Faisal Akram took two for 65.

8,Saim storms to six-stroke victory,"KARACHI: Saim Shazli couldn’t be caught. Four shots in front at the start of the final round, he would end up...","KARACHI: Saim Shazli couldn’t be caught. Four shots in front at the start of the final round, he would end up winning the amateurs’ contest of the SGA President’s Cup by six strokes here at the Defence Authority Golf Course on Sunday.
In a tournament he’s led from the start, albeit sharing the lead with Yashal Shah in the first round, Saim fired four birdies for a two-under 70 to finish at three-under 213 at the end of 54 holes. Yashal, who was his nearest rival heading into the final 18 holes, finished on 219 after he returned a card of 72 featuring three birdies.
Saim made a statement of his intent when he shot a birdie on the second hole and although he bogeyed both the fourth and fifth holes, he would go on to finish on a high with birdies on the 12th, 15th and 16th holes.
Yashal was faced with a difficult task of reeling in Saim and it eventually proved insurmountable. He briefly raised hopes with back-to-back birdies on the 10th and 11th holes but when he bogeyed the 14th, the final result was never in doubt.
Sameer Sayed (71) finished third with a gross of 225, five ahead of Arsalan S. Khan (75) and Arsalan Mughal (77). It was Arsalan Mughal, though, who would end up lifting the trophy and emerging as the tournament winner as the eight-handicapper finished with a net score of 206.
Aanga Farooq (74) won the two-round ladies event with a gross score of 148, finishing four strokes ahead of Abiha Hanim Syed (152). Anma Amjad, an 11-handicapper, was the net winner with 138.
Brig. Mohammad Qasim Changazi was the gross winner among the seniors after his 76 in the second round took him to 148 overall. The seven-handicapper would finish two ahead of Qazi Amir Hussain (73) and four ahead of Ahmed Jamil Siddiqi (76) and Maj. Mohammad Irfan (76). Mohammad Salman Ali won the net honours — the 12-handicapper finishing with a score of 135.
The nine-hole veterans’ contests over two rounds had been decided on Saturday. Group Capt. After A Khan emerged the gross winner in 75 years and above with Dr Zubair Mirza claiming the net title. Maj. Rizwan Farooq was the gross winner of the 70-75 years event while Mir Ali Raza took the net honours.

10,Conte not happy about quick Premier League restart,Hints at resting players for Tottenham's Boxing Day match at Brentford.,"LONDON: Tottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte is  “not really happy” that the Premier League will resume just eight days after the World Cup and hinted he might rest players for the Boxing Day match at Brentford.
Out of the 12 Tottenham players who featured in Qatar, Conte has ruled France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and Argentina’s Cristian Romero, who played in the final last Sunday, out of Monday’s game.
“It is a strange situation and honestly to play so quickly, only one week after the World Cup, I am not really happy,” Conte said in comments published in British media on Sunday.
“It is impossible to give them a lot of rest and for sure with the players that didn’t play the World Cup and we work for four weeks... Now they are at a level that is better than the players who finished the World Cup.
“For this reason I think I have to make the best decision for the game against Brentford,” Conte said, adding that the players who returned from the World Cup are  “not at the top” level at the moment.
Rodrigo Bentancur will miss the game due to suspension but has also been dealing with a hamstring issue while Richarlison will be out for three to four weeks due to a hamstring injury he picked up playing up for Brazil at the World Cup.
Conte said Lucas Moura has been  “struggling” with a tendon issue.
“It’s a difficult situation because I have a good player in my squad, but he’s never available. It’s like you don’t have him,” he said.
Conte said the players would be training on Christmas Day.
“It happened also last season,” he said. “We played on Dec 26 and then also on the first day of the New Year.”
You know, in Italy, for us, Christmas is an important period to stay with the family,” he said.“We  have to play and for this reason, on Dec 25, we will have the training  session, then have lunch with our relatives, then we have to go together  to stay in the hotel because the game will be very early on Dec 26.”
Tottenham are fourth in the table on 29 points after 15 matches, eight points behind leaders Arsenal who have a game in hand.
