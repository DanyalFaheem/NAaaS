0,PTI to move IHC against telethon ‘blackout’,"Fawad alleges efforts being made to ""physically eliminate"" Imran.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Monday slammed the government for allegedly blocking the transmission of the telethon that the party had arranged on Sunday night for collecting donations from the overseas Pakistanis and announced its decision to challenge the government move before the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The party also decided to take the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to the court for issuing notices to the party leaders in connection with the investigations into the foreign funding case in line with the decision of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
The decisions were announced by party’s senior vice-president Fawad Chaudhry at a news conference after former premier Imran Khan presided over a meeting of PTI’s political committee.
During the presser, which was also addressed by Special Assistant to Punjab Chief Minister Senator Sania Nishtar, Mr Fawad lashed out at PML-N vice-president Maryam Nawaz and JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, accusing them of trying to “physically eliminate” Mr Khan after failing to eliminate him politically.

Fawad alleges efforts being made to ‘physically eliminate’ Imran

He said Ms Nawaz’s media cell and PML-N’s strategic cell were busy in constantly targeting the PTI chairman.
Mr Chaudhry said PTI was the only party that had arranged two telethons drawing pledges for a total of Rs11bn donations for flood-affected people. He said there was no political agenda behind the telethons, which were arranged for the help of flood survivors. However, he said, the government and other institutions shut down four TV channels broadcasting the telethon.
He criticised government’s claim that it was not behind the suspension of the transmission and asked the authorities to disclose the identity of those behind the media blackout. Otherwise, he said, the PTI would drag the government to court where it would be asked to expose the names of those who made phone calls for the closure of the TV channels.
According to a press release issued by the PTI central media department, Mr Khan said the blackout of the telethon was “shameful”. Silencing of the media in such a shameful way in Pakistan could not be tolerated, he said, adding that the party would raise the issue of media censorship at all levels.
‘Hate campaign’
Mr Chaudhry, who had previously served as the information minister in the PTI government, alleged a ‘group of journalists’ was twisting various statements of the PTI chairman in an effort to create hatred against him on religious grounds.
“They are working on the plan to murder Imran and spreading religious hatred,” he said, adding that the PML-N-led ruling coalition was the only government that first registered blasphemy cases and then terrorism cases against its political opponents.
“They are trying to flare up religious hatred against Mr Khan by releasing his speeches in chunks,” he claimed.
About the committee meeting, Mr Chaudhry said the party expressed concern over worsening economic condition and the PTI chief formed an economic committee under the chairmanship of former finance minister Shaukat Tarin to come with proposals to steer the country out of the economic crisis.
About his reported meeting with the US ambassador and Mr Khan’s meeting with a former US diplomat Robin Raphael, he said: “We are not at war with the US ….. political engagements with the US will continue.”
The PTI leader said there was no harm in meeting the US ambassador, who had recently also visited Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Regarding Mr Khan’s meeting with Ms Raphael, he said he had not talked to the PTI chairman on this matter but added that she was a former diplomat and had nothing to do with the US government.
The PTI alleges that the party’s government was removed in April through the no confidence motion at the behest of a conspiracy hatched by the US.
Earlier in the day, Mr Khan after appearing before a court in a case had evaded questions of reporters about his meeting with the former US diplomat. In response to a question, he angrily said he should not be compared with the “thief Nawaz Sharif” and “terrorist Altaf Hussain” in the context of “minus-one” formula that the PTI claims was on the cards.

1,LHC full bench to hear Maryam’s passport plea,The matter will be taken up for hearing on Sept 14.,"LAHORE: Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court Mohammad Ameer Bhatti on Monday constituted a full bench to decide a petition of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) vice president Maryam Nawaz, seeking the recovery of her passport, which she had surrendered to the court for bail in a case.
The bench, which will be headed by Justice Bhatti himself, was constituted after several judges recused themselves from hearing her petition. The full bench now also consists of Justice Ali Baqar Najafi and Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh.
The matter will be taken up for hearing on Sept 14.
In her petition, Ms Sharif contended that it was a known fact that her father, Nawaz Sharif, was allowed to go abroad on account of his critical health condition.
She claimed her father had not regained his health so far as he was still undergoing the diagnosis process as per a medical report filed in the court after being duly attested by the Pakistan High Commission in London. She submitted that in the absence of any charge sheet or trial, she had not been able to exercise her fundamental rights for about four years on account of surrendering her passport in compliance with the court order.
The PML-N leader pleaded that she was in dire need to go abroad to attend to and inquire after the health of her ailing father. She asked the court to direct the deputy registrar (judicial) to return her passport in the interest of justice.
Earlier, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had opposed the petition seeking the return of Ms Sharif’s passport, which she had surrendered to the court when post-arrest bail was granted to her in the Chaudhry Sugar Mills case.

3,Ministry to inspect pharma units ‘hit by shortages’,"Abdul Qadir Patel accuses pharmaceutical companies of trying to ""blackmail"" him, says such tactics won’t work.","ISLAMABAD: In an announcement unlikely to be welcomed by drug manufacturers, Federal Minister for National Health Services (NHS) Abdul Qadir Patel disclosed on Monday that representatives of his ministry would sit in the production units of those companies whose medicines are short in the market.
The decision has been taken to ensure that production continues amid supply shortages.
The minister has also accused pharmaceutical companies of creating an artificial shortage of medicines, especially Paracetamol, and warned them none of their “blackmail” tactics would work on him.
Addressing a news conference at the office of Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), Mr Patel said an artificial shortage of medicines had been created to pressurise the government to increase the prices.

Patel accuses pharmaceutical companies of trying to ‘blackmail’ him, says such tactics won’t work

He also saw a political side to the situation, saying PTI Chairman Imran Khan’s frequent speeches had caused ‘constant headaches’ among the masses and thus contributed to shortage of Paracetamol in the country.
“I will not accept any pressure over the issue. I want to make it clear that during the tenure of PTI government prices of 570 medicines were increased by 179 per cent. The National Accountability Bureau even launched a case against PTI’s health minister Aamer Mehmood Kiani,” he said.
“I would suggest the media should criticise the pharmaceutical companies rather than government as companies have created an artificial shortage. Similarly, some politicians have been doing marketing of a pharmaceutical company and its brand rather than focusing on the issue of flood victims,” he said.
He pointed out that over 100 brands of Paracetamol were registered with Drap but unfortunately people demanded only one brand or active pharmaceutical ingredient.
“Because of rumours of a shortage, people also start collecting stocks of medicines which results in a real shortage. Besides, I have been facing pressure for increasing the prices but, being a poor political worker, I will never accept such pressure. I suggest we should all think about the flood-affected people and their issues,” he said.
In reply to a question, Mr Patel said it was the first time that the ministry was working on the registration of raw materials and their prices so that companies would not quote the price of imported raw material by their own.
He said Drap representatives would be appointed in the production units of pharmaceutical companies to ensure that they run at full pace.
Answering a question, he said: “I have offered the companies to contact for the licences and we are willing to issue emergency licences of Paracetamol.”
The minister said he had issued directives for a crackdown against spurious medicines and soon media would get news about actions in this regard.
PPMA’s stance over shortage
Soon after the minister’s presser, the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) said drug shortage had been caused by exorbitant increase in production costs.
“Several low-priced drugs other than Paracetamol are also facing production issues due to lack of financial feasibility such as anti-malarial drugs, gastroenterology drugs and anti-allergy drugs,” it claimed.
According to the association, in case of Paracetamol there is a Re1 per tablet loss for manufacturers vis-a-vis the selling price of the product.
Talking to Dawn, PPMA Central Executive Committee member Usman Shaukat said: “…in light of the current global economic turmoil, it has become imperative to re-asses the pricing of medicines in Pakistan to ensure uninterrupted supply of life-saving drugs to the masses.”

4,New case of poliovirus found in North Waziristan,It is the 18th case of the crippling disease detected in the country this year.,"ISLAMABAD: A three-month-old child was found on Monday to have been paralysed by wild poliovirus in North Waziristan. This is the 18th case of the crippling disease detected in the country this year.
Earlier, two cases of the poliovirus were found in Lakki Marwat. Other 16 cases of the paralysing disease were detected in children living in North Waziristan.
Last week, a positive environmental sample for poliovirus was detected in Karachi in addition to four others from Bannu, Peshawar, Swat and Lahore. Karachi, which is home to communities from across Pakistan, is a poliovirus reservoir and remains among areas categorised by the programme at high risk of wild poliovirus transmission.
Informed sources said that the humanitarian crisis, triggered by unprecedented floods, would pose graver challenges to Karachi and other areas of the country in the foreseeable future, as millions of people have been displaced by floods and they were moving to urban areas to take refuge.
“Despite extreme climatic conditions, the Pakistan Polio Programme conducted immunisation campaign wherever possible, and the programme is prepared to restart the campaign in flood-affected areas as soon as it becomes feasible,” Federal Health Minister Qadir Patel said.
“In the given circumstances, the risk of poliovirus has only amplified,” he said.
Meanwhile, National Emergency Operations Centre Coordinator Dr Shahzad Baig said the programme had established health camps in 32 districts of the country to support health needs of flood-affected people.
These health camps, he said, would provide basic clinical services, particularly the treatment of water-borne, vector-borne and skin diseases that are expected to be prevalent. “All routine immunisation antigens will also be provided to targeted children and pregnant women,” Dr Baig said.

5,NA body takes notice of ‘media drive’ against lawmakers,"Decides to direct authorities to take action against ""anti-state"" characters behind such social media campaigns.","ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Standing Committee on Information and Broadcasting on Monday took serious notice of “regular campaigns” being launched against parliamentarians on social media and partly on electronic media.
The committee meeting, held under the chairpersonship of MNA Javaria Zafar Aheer, noted that “malicious media campaign” mainly on social media had been launched against elected representatives and these campaigns should be probed and stopped.
The committee noted with concern that fake social media news was now in circulation about a secret meeting between the prime minister and Pakistani officials with Israeli officials in Doha.
The committee decided that official directives would be issued to the secretary of interior, director general of FIA, director of cybercrime wing, FIA, chairman of Pakistan Telecom­munications Au­­thority (PTA) and chairman of Pakistan Electronic Media Regu­latory Auth­ority (Pemra) to take action against “anti-state” characters behind such social media campaigns.
The secretary of information, Shahera Shahid, briefed the committee about malicious media campaign mainly on social and partly on electronic media about the parliamentary delegation’s visit to Canada in connection with the 65th Commonwealth Parliamen­tary Conference (CPC).
The committee members conde­mned this “planned” media camp­a­igns against NA delegation’s visit to Canada, the Prime Minister Office and news about a secret meeting bet­ween the prime minister/Pak­istani officials with Israeli officials in Doha. The members of the committee said they suspected Indian media campaign against flood relief activities of UN in Pakistan.
The chairperson of the standing committee, Ms Javaria Zafar Aheer, claimed that these media campaigns were not targeted against any party or institution, “but against Pakistan”.
“The parliament and parliamentarians require cooperation of the government and private media organisations as such campaigns have been launched to create a trust deficit between the masses and elected representatives and these are detrimental to the sanctity of the parliament,” she said.
The committee deferred three government bills: The Motion Pic­tures (Amendment) Bill, 2020; The Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2020; and The Associated Press of Pakistan Cor­p­oration (Amend­ment), 2020, as the Minister for Information and Broa­dcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb could not attend the meeting.
The chairperson of the committee said that these important legislative businesses would be considered by the committee when the information minister was present.
The committee meeting was attended by Armaghan Subhani, Saad Waseem, Nadeem Abbas, Zaib Jaffar, Maiza Hameed, Kiran Imran Dar, Dr Nafisa Shah, Zulfiqar Ali Behan and Naz Baloch.

6,Google launches international appeal to collect funds for flood victims,Austria announces $2m to support victims; Chinese envoy distributes relief goods in Dera Bugti.,"WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD: As aid and assistance from foreign countries continued to pour into Pakistan in the wake of flood devastation, Google on Monday launched an international appeal to collect relief funds.
The most used search engine in the world launched the appeal, asking its billions of users across the globe to donate $15, $25 and $50 each.
The appeal included a link to a report by the Centre for Disaster Philanthropy (CDP) and Human Rights Watch, endorsing the need for immediate financial and material support to the country.
The CDP report noted that the floods have affected all four provinces and approximately 15pc the population. The HRW report said “the floods show the need for climate action”.

Austria announces $2m to support victims; Chinese envoy distributes relief goods in Dera Bugti

“Pakistan is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change. It faces rates of warming considerably above the global average and likely more frequent and intense extreme climate events,” the report added.
Austria announces aid
The Austrian foreign ministry’s relief fund for disasters has announced two million euros in emergency support for the flood victims.
Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schal­lenberg said that the allocated funds would be disbursed under “2022 Pakistan Floods Response Plan (FRP)” created jointly by the UN and Government of Pakistan in August.
The support included life-saving measures in areas of food security, emergency agricultural aid, accommodation, medical first aid, protection for vulnerable population groups, water and hygiene, women’s health, and educational support.
Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said his government was supporting the humanitarian efforts and this support was in line with the country’s tradition of providing aid on the ground. The provided funds will go to the international aid organisations that are currently working to ease the suffering of those who are affected.
Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler said in his statement that the flood in Pakistan is another extreme weather event that demonstrates the rapidly accelerating effects of the climate crisis.
Chinese envoy distribute aid
In a separate development, Chinese Ambassa­dor to Pakistan Nong Rong on Monday distributed relief goods among the people displaced by floods in Dera Bugti.
Accompanied by Federal Minister for Narcotics Control, Shahzain Bugti, Mr Rong handed over 3,000 bags of relief goods donated by the Chinese government.
The ambassador said China was a time-tested friend of Pakistan and both countries have always helped each other in times of difficulties. He said the Chinese government and people can never forget the help extended by Pakistan during the 2008 earthquake in China.
At the moment, Pakistani people were facing the worst flood that has caused massive destruction, he said, adding that Chinese people were aware of the pain and difficulties faced by their ‘Pakistani brothers and sisters’ and were standing by them.
Partnership for resilience building
Meanwhile, the UN’s Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap) and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have formalised a partnership to promote resilience building in the wake of climate change.
At the ceremony to sign the memorandum of understanding at Escap headquarters in Bangkok on Monday, the heads of the both organisations said the ongoing floods in Pakistan demonstrated the need for “all-hands-on-the-deck” to be prepared for the uncertainty and damage from the impact of climate change”.
“It is time to capitalise on the untapped potential of regional and sub-regional cooperation to address the region’s shared vulnerabilities and risks,” said Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, the UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of Escap.
This combination is very powerful to address the global challenges we face — especially the sharp increase in climate-related disasters that can only be solved together,” affirmed Jagan Chapagain, Secretary-General of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
“When we join forces, we are more powerful than when we work alone. Together we combine the strength of governments with our global humanitarian network which includes our expertise, data, tools, knowledge, and human resources.”

7,Balochistan mill owners blame govt for flour crisis,"Food dept failed to procure 1m bags of wheat in Nasirabad division, millers say.","QUETTA: Balochistan’s flour mills owners have blamed the provincial government for the ongoing flour crisis in the province, alleging that the food department failed to procure wheat according the requirement for this year.
Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA) Balochistan chapter representatives Badaruddin Kakar, Asmatullah Kakar and Abdul Wahid Bareech said there was a huge gap between the demand and supply which created the crisis.
They said flour mill owners were being blamed for the crisis, while in reality, the provincial government has imposed an inter-provincial and inter-district ban on the transportation of wheat during the harvesting season.
They claimed the food department failed to procure one million bags of wheat in Nasirabad division as decided by the provincial cabinet.

Moreover, the authorities did not allow flour millers to purchase wheat from other areas and stopped trucks carrying wheat from other provinces, they said.
They added that the prime minister and Balochistan chief minister have issued orders to allow transportation of wheat but the law enforcement agencies continued to stop the vehicles.
This attitude would exacerbate the crisis and increase flour prices in the province, they added.
They rejected the government’s ‘propaganda’ against the flour millers, saying that the release of mere 300 bags of wheat per day by the government to the millers was not enough to meet the needs of the 3.5million people of Quetta.
The government has passed directives to procure wheat from Pakistan Agricultural Storage & Services Corporation (Passco) but the food department has yet to start the procurement, they alleged.

He held meetings with officials of the local administration and the health department to assess the most pressing needs of the displaced people.
Dr Palita said floods had caused massive destruction in Balochistan and the affected people badly needed special health facilities and attention.
He said the WHO had deployed teams in areas devastated by the floods to help the people protect themselves from malaria, diarrhoea and skin diseases.
“We will not leave the flood-stricken people alone in this difficult time,” Dr Mahipala assured families,
The WHO had established medical camps in several areas of Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan.
The director general of Balochistan’s Health Department, and the deputy commissioner of Nasirabad attended the meetings.
The two officials briefed Dr Mahipala about the flood situation and stressed the need for urgent measures to fight the spread of diseases in camps.
The WHO representative was informed that the provincial health department, the Pakistan Army and the Frontier Corps had established medical camps in all flood-hit areas and were providing the best available medical facilities to flood-stricken people.
At the same time, they said the magnitude of the devastation was so big that relief and rehabilitation work cannot succeed without the participation of organisations like the WHO.

Advocate Pervaiz Inayat Malik, who was a member of PBC during 2008-2009, in his petition raised a number of legal questions for holding dual offices by Mr Tarar.
He termed this against the dictum laid down by the Supreme Court in Dr Mubashir Hassan case and said that being a federal minister, Mr Tarar cannot appear before any court as an advocate, therefore, he could not be enrolled as practising lawyer with the PBC.

Petitioner seeks direction to AG to de-notify Tarar as PBC member

The petition also pointed out that the holding office of the PBC despite being a federal minister is against the Rule 108-O of Rule of 1976.
This rule requires that “an advocate having his name on the Roll of a Bar Council shall apply to the later that his certificate be suspended because he intends to join some other profession, business, service or vacation”.
The petitioner asked the court to issue a direction to the attorney general to de-notify Mr Tarar as PBC member.
The petition also requested the court to restrain the law minister from performing his responsibility as PBC member.
