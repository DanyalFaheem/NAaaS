India, the world’s biggest exporter of the grain, banned shipments of broken rice and imposed a 20 per cent duty on exports of various other types on Thurs­day as the country tries to boost supplies and calm prices after below-average monsoon rainfall curtailed planting.
Rice prices have jumped 5pc in Asia since India’s announcement and are expected to rise further this week keeping buyers and sellers on the sidelines.
“Rice trading is paralysed across Asia. Traders don’t want to commit anything in a hurry,” said Himanshu Agarwal, executive director at Satyam Balajee, India’s biggest rice exporter.

2,Market moves southwards as economic troubles mount,"KSE-100 index settles at 41,862.29 points, down 85.87 points or 0.2pc from the preceding close.","KARACHI: The shares market saw a range-bound session on Monday as investors remained concerned about mounting inflation as well as other economic and political challenges.

3,Nepra allows Discos to raise extra Rs69bn,Consumers to pay Rs4.34 per unit more for July usage in September’s bills.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Monday notified Rs4.34 per unit additional fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for ex-Wapda Distribution Companies (Discos) for electricity consumed in July to provide Rs69 billion additional funds to cash-starved entities in September’s bills.
The regulator “has reviewed and assessed an increase of Rs4.34 per kWh in the applicable tariff for Discos on account of variation in the fuel charges for July,” reads a notification issued by Nepra on Monday.
The notification said the additional FCA shall apply to all the consumer categories except Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and lifeline consumers of all the Discos and shall be shown separately in the consumers’ bills based on units billed to the consumers in July and reflect them in the current month’s bill.
The regulator worked out an increase of Rs4.34 per unit in FCA for all Discos (other than K-Electric) instead of Rs4.69 per unit demanded by the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) to generate supplementary revenue on account of the higher cost of electricity consumed in July. 

Consumers to pay Rs4.34 per unit more for July usage in September’s bills

The additional FCA is almost 53pc lower than that of a record Rs9.90 per unit in June because of a substantial increase in the base tariff, the improved share of cheaper domestic fuels, particularly priceless hydropower generation and inexpensive nuclear power.
The biggest contribution to the overall power grid came from hydropower. Its share showed a significant increase to 35pc in July compared to 24pc in June and May. The lower availability of expensive imported RLNG also came as a blessing in disguise to consumers.
The CPPA claimed that the consumers were charged a reference fuel cost of Rs6.29 per unit in July, but the actual cost turned out to be Rs10.98 per unit, hence an additional charge of about Rs4.69 per unit to consumers. 
The revised electricity rates would be charged to all consumers except to those using less than 50 units.
Data showed that the 64pc share of domestic fuel sources in overall power generation in July was significantly higher compared to 51.58pc in June which was slightly lower than 54pc in May. The share of domestic fuel-based power generation stood at 50pc in April and 45pc in March.
After hydropower, the second biggest 15pc contribution to the overall power supply came from imported RLNG-based power plants in July which was significantly lower than 24.43pc in June and 23pc in May. With the revival of the 1,100MW K-2 Nuclear power plant after a month-long closure for refueling, the share of nuclear power also increased to 14.2pc in July from 9pc in June. Nuclear power contributed 13pc share in May and 17.37pc in April.
The share of coal-based power plants was slightly lower at 12.74pc in July compared to 13.6pc in June and May. The coal-based generation has come down from 16.74pc in April and 25pc in March because of low coal stocks amid financial limitations of power producers and higher global prices.
The share of domestic gas in power generation stood almost unchanged at 10.36pc in July against 11pc in June and 10pc in May and April. The residual fuel oil-based generation stood at 6.2pc in July, significantly lower than 10.48pc in June because of improved production from nuclear and hydropower.
The cost of power generation from domestic gas increased to Rs9.96 per unit in July when compared to Rs8.9 per unit in June but was still lower than Rs10.12 per unit in May. Gas-based power cost was Rs8.4 per unit in April and Rs7.75 per unit in March.
Three renewable energy sources — wind, bagasse and solar — together contributed about 4.45pc power supply in July compared to 7pc in June and 6.5pc in May. Wind and solar have no fuel cost, while that of bagasse has been calculated at Rs5.98 per unit — unchanged.

4,Investors withdraw offer to buy Bahria Town-owned bank,Bahria Town Ltd owns 87.9pc of Escorts Investment Bank.,"KARACHI: Owing to a “lack of progress” in the proposed transaction, a group of three investors has formally decided not to proceed with the acquisition of more than 50 per cent shares in Escorts Investment Bank Ltd, a subsidiary of real estate developer Bahria Town Ltd, a bourse filing said on Monday.
The three investors made a public announcement of their intention in March to buy more than 50pc shareholding along with management control in the struggling investment bank.
AKD Securities was to serve as manager to the offer collectively made by Mian Javaid Akhtar, Mian Zeeshan Javaid and Mohammad Ali Kazmi. The first two potential acquirers were engaged in trading, construction, agriculture and import/export businesses. The third potential acquirer worked in commercial banking, insurance, treasury, trade finance, leasing and investment banking.
It’s the second withdrawal of a public announcement of intention to buy shares in the investment bank since the beginning of 2022. In the Jan-March quarter, Manager to the Offer M. Munir M. Ahmad Khanani Securities Ltd also withdrew a public announcement of intention on behalf of a potential investor.
Bahria Town Ltd told investors through Escorts Investment Bank Ltd on May 27 that it was “still desirous to sell its shares of the bank” to the group of three investors, even though it had already terminated the shares’ sale and purchase agreement with them.
According to a preceding notice signed by Malik Riaz Hussain of Bahria Town Ltd on May 1, the potential investors were required to fulfil certain conditions precedent — an event that must come to pass before a specific contract is considered to be in effect. “The purchasers have not made any progress to seek the required regulatory approvals and fulfil the conditions precedent,” the May 1 notice said.
Most commercial banks don’t extend home loans for Bahria Town properties given the disputed nature of their land titles. However, being a subsidiary of the real estate developer, Escorts Investment Bank was willing to extend long-term financing to home buyers in Bahria Town.
Bahria Town Ltd owns 87.9pc of Escorts Investment Bank while the general public and “others” control stakes of 10.2pc and 1.8pc, respectively.
The share price of the investment bank decreased 4.36pc on Monday to Rs5.27 apiece. The total value of the bank based on the current share price is Rs714.6 million.
According to its annual financial accounts, the bank generated more than 27pc of its “total income” in 2020-21 via house finance activities.
The bank has been running in loss since 2016, the earliest year for which earnings data is readily available. Its net loss amounted to Rs81.4 million in 2020-21. In the latest quarter, the bank’s net loss was Rs17.1m versus a loss of Rs20.9m a year ago.

5,Rupee nosedives amid dearth of dollar inflows,Currency experts fear drop in remittances,"KARACHI: The strong grip of the US dollar in both inter-bank and open markets pushed the rupee down further on Monday.
The dollar was traded at Rs229.82 in the inter-bank market on Monday — an appreciation of Rs1.64 — compared to the previous rate. The open market rate for the greenback, as reported by the Exchange Companies Association of Pak­i­stan (ECAP), was Rs236, an increase of Rs1.5 on the first day of the week. 
Talks in the market about the vulnerable exchange rate and the weakening of the rupee were more important than anything in the economy, particularly in the financial sector. 
While the day-to-day rise in the dollar rate against the rupee reflects the failure of the government to get a hold on the liquidation of the local currency, it also shows that Pakistan has not been supported with foreign aid that could improve dollar inflows.

Currency experts fear drop in remittances 

“After the IMF inflow of $1.16 billion, no inflow of dollars is disappointing while the flood has further damaged hope for economic improvement,” said Atif Ahemd, a currency dealer in the inter-bank market.
The government’s initial estimates of the loss due to flooding were around $13 billion. The Secretary General of the United Nations has asked the entire world to help Pakistan recover from the devastating effect of climate change while its carbon emissions are less than one per cent.
However, the government has yet to come up with any plan for the recovery of flood-hit people and the economy; it has not even asked the world to compensate for the losses it suffered due to climate change.
“The country will suffer on both external and internal fronts. The forced cut in imports has already slowed down the economy, while exports will see a drastic cut this year,” said Aamir Aziz, an exporter of readymade value-added cotton products.
“Fewer exports means fewer dollar inflows; fewer imports mean less economic growth and low revenue generation,” said Mr Aziz. 
He said the dollar remained the focal point to judge the performance of the economy while the flash flood had a devastating effect on the entire economy; the flood failed to become the focal point for the economy and its stakeholders 
The cotton crop of Sindh was lost while the overall production has gone down to its lowest level. A delegation of textile millers is visiting Tanzania to buy African cotton to keep their units running. 
Some currency experts fear that the inflows of remittances could drop this year for many reasons, including inflation in those countries where Pakistanis reside. Pakistan receives approximately $31bn in remittances, the majority of which come from the Middle East, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

6,"50m people living in modern slavery, says ILO",More than half of all forced labour occurs in upper-middle or high-income countries.,"ISLAMABAD: The ‘Global Estimates of Modern Slavery’, published on Monday says 50 million people are living in modern slavery in 2021, and of these people, 28m are in forced labour and 22m are trapped in forced marriage. 
The report from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) further says the number of people in modern slavery has risen significantly in the last five years. Ten million more people were in modern slavery in 2021, compared to 2016 global estimates. Women and children remain disproportionately vulnerable. 
The ILO report says no region of the world is spared from forced labour, and Asia and the Pacific is host to more than half of the global total (15.1m), followed by Europe and Central Asia (4.1m), Africa (3.8m), the Americas (3.6m), and the Arab States (0.9m). 
However, this regional ranking changes considerably when forced labour is expressed as a proportion of the population. By this measure, forced labour is highest in the Arab States (5.3 per 1,000 people), followed by Europe and Central Asia (4.4 per 1,000), the Americas and Asia and the Pacific (both at 3.5 per 1,000), and Africa (2.9 per 1,000). 

More than half of all forced labour occurs in upper-middle or high-income countries 

The report says more than half of all forced labour occurs in either upper-middle income or high-income countries. 
There are 27.6m people in situations of forced labour on any given day. This absolute number translates to 3.5 people in forced labour for every 1,000 people in the world. Women and girls make up 11.8m of the total in forced labour. More than 3.3m of all those in forced labour are children. 
The initial months of the Covid-19 pandemic were accompanied by widespread reports of forced labour linked to the crisis. Disruptions to income because of the pandemic led to greater indebtedness among workers and with it reports of a rise in debt bondage among some workers lacking access to formal credit channels. 
According to the report, 86 per cent of forced labour cases are imposed by private actors — 63pc in the private economy in sectors other than commercial sexual exploitation and 23pc in forced commercial sexual exploitation. State-imposed forced labour accounts for the remaining 14pc of people in forced labour. 
The five sectors accounting for the majority of total adult forced labour (87pc) are services (excluding domestic work), manufacturing, construction, agriculture (excluding fishing), and domestic work. Other sectors form smaller shares but nonetheless still account for hundreds of thousands of people. 
The number of men, women, and children living in forced marriages has risen globally. There was a 6.6m increase in the number of people living in a forced marriage between 2016 and 2021. During this time, the prevalence of forced marriage rose from 2.1 to 2.8 per 1,000 people. 
Nearly two-thirds of all forced marriages, an estimated 14.2m people, are in Asia and the Pacific. This is followed by 14.5pc in Africa (3.2m) and 10.4pc Europe and Central Asia (2.3m). 
When regional population is accounted for, the Arab States is the region with the highest prevalence at 4.8 per 1,000 people, followed by Asia and the Pacific at 3.3 per 1,000. The Americas has the lowest prevalence of forced marriage at 1.5 per 1,000 people.
