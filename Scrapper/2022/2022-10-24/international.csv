0,"Biden promotes biotech, cancer fight in new ‘Moonshot’ initiative",Biden is pushing for government-backed efforts to coordinate and fund a multilayered fight against cancer.,"BOSTON: President Joe Biden issued an executive order on Monday boosting the US biotech sector as part of his Cancer Moonshot initiative, which invokes the national effort to land a man on the Moon 60 years ago.
The president was in Boston for an address deliberately set to echo John F. Kennedy’s famous 1962  “Moonshot speech” in which he called for landing an American on the lunar surface — something achieved in 1969.
This time, Biden is pushing for government-backed efforts to coordinate and fund a multilayered fight against cancer, with the goal of halving cancer death rates in the next 25 years.
As he set off from Washington, Biden issued an order meant to bolster the trailblazing US biotech sector’s efforts to take on growing commercial rivals in China.
The order brings federal support for  “areas that will define US biotechnology leadership and our economic competitiveness in the coming decades,” a senior Biden administration official told reporters. The official said that while US biotech research leads the world, the industrial applications are increasingly in the hands of other countries.
“Unless we translate biotechnology innovation into economic and societal benefits for all Americans, other countries, including and especially China, are aggressively investing in this sector,” posing a  “risk,” the official said.
The White House says the US biotech industry is on the cutting edge of medical advances — recently seen in the rapid development of vaccines, tests and therapeutics to help manage the Covid-19 pandemic — but that the potential scope goes much further.
The official speaking to reporters cited studies suggesting that  “before the end of the decade, engineering biology holds the potential to be used in manufacturing industry that accounts for more than one third of global output.
That’s equivalent to almost $30 trillion in terms of value.” Growing areas for biotech industry include new plastics and rubbers, jet fuel, and environmentally friendly fertilizers.
The battle against cancer is personal for Biden: his son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015 when Biden was vice president to Barack Obama.
In his speech at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston, Biden will lay out how his administration is seeking to slash cancer rates through a systemic revamp of government funding and support for everything from medical research to improving access to healthcare and better environmental conditions.
The linkage to the Moon programme will seek to raise public awareness and support ahead of midterm congressional elections where the Democrats face the possibility of a Republican sweep in Congress, something which would severely complicate the next two years of Biden’s first term.
Caroline Kennedy, the US ambassador to Australia and daughter of the assassinated JFK, told CNN she approved of the parallels drawn by Biden in the struggle to conquer the deadly disease.
“Sixty years after my father challenged Americans to land on the moon, President Biden is welcoming great challenges as new opportunities by setting us on a bold course to end cancer as we know it,” she said. Biden’s focus on the cancer fight comes as Nasa is once again looking to return to the Moon.

1,EU watchdog okays vaccine targeting Omicron sub-variants,"The so-called “bivalent” jab, made by Pfizer/BioNTech, targets the highly infectious BA.4 and BA.5 types of the variant.","THE HAGUE: The European Union’s medicines watchdog on Monday approved a vaccine specifically targeting the new and infectious types of the Omicron variant amid fears of a new wave of winter infections.
The so-called “bivalent” jab, made by Pfizer/BioNTech, targets the highly infectious BA.4 and BA.5 types of the variant and is the first of its kind to be approved within the 27-nation bloc.
“This recommendation will further extend the arsenal of available vaccines to protect people against Covid-19 as the pandemic continues and new waves of infections are anticipated in the cold season,” the European Medicines Agency said.
The vaccine also targets “the original strain of SARS-CoV-2” and comes 11 days after the Amsterdam-based drug watchdog approved vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna against the original Omicron variant.
The latest shot is aimed at people over 12 and who have already received at least one primary vaccination against the coronavirus, and it is an adaptive version of Pfizer’s original vaccine.

2,Booming gun ownership triggers fears for Brazil’s elections,"RIO DE JANEIRO: Wearing a black T-shirt stamped with the word  “Bolsonaro” and a skull, Brazilian ex-cop...","RIO DE JANEIRO: Wearing a black T-shirt stamped with the word  “Bolsonaro” and a skull, Brazilian ex-cop Elitusalem Gomes Freitas takes aim with his .40-caliber rifle and fires, savoring the smell of gunpowder as he nails his target.
Clutching his bulky black rifle at a firing range in the Rio de Janeiro suburbs, a handgun strapped to his thigh, Freitas proudly repeats one of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro’s maxims:  “An armed populace will never be enslaved.” 
Freitas is part of a demographic that has boomed in Bolsonaro’s Brazil: since the former army captain became president in 2019, the number of registered gun owners has more than quintupled, from 117,000 to 673,000, as the administration has loosened gun-control laws. There are now more civilian gun owners in Brazil than police — 406,384.
That is making some Brazilians nervous as the country heads for a divisive presidential election on October 2 pitting Bolsonaro against his leftist nemesis, ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (2003-2010), who leads in the polls.
Citing fears of election violence, the Supreme Court temporarily suspended several of Bolsonaro’s gun-control rollbacks last week. The week before, the Superior Electoral Tribunal (TSE) banned voters from bringing guns to polling stations.
Like Bolsonaro, Freitas is no fan of the electoral authority, which the president accuses of allowing what he insists — without evidence — is rampant fraud in Brazil’s electronic voting system.
After inspecting the white silhouette target he has just filled with holes, Freitas, 42, explains he is ready to take up arms if necessary to defend Brazil’s  “freedom.”  “I can’t allow half a dozen people (the TSE’s judges) to decide our nation’s destiny against the people’s will. The right to bear arms is how we guarantee our freedom and defend our sovereignty against the internal enemy,” he says.
But he adds there is nothing to fear from Brazil’s burgeoning class of firearm owners.
“It’s not about arming everyone. It’s about giving good citizens the right to access a firearm and learn to use it.”
‘Cursed inheritance’
Security expert Bruno Langeani says hardliners ready to take up arms in the name of politics are a minority in Brazil.
But he emphasizes that  “even a minority can cause huge damage if it’s radicalised,” pointing to the rioters who stormed the US Capitol last year after the election loss of ex-president Donald Trump — Bolsonaro’s political role model.
Langeani says the massive expansion of gun ownership in Brazil will be a  “cursed inheritance” that could fuel violence for years to come.
“A civilian can now buy more powerful guns than the police,” he says.
“Licensed hunters, sport shooters and collectors can in some cases own up to 60 firearms per person, including 30 assault rifles.” There are 4.4 million firearms in civilian hands in Brazil, a country of 212 million people, according to the Brazilian Public Security Forum. One-third of them have expired permits.
Bolsonaro points to a fall in murders as evidence his gun policies are a success: last year, the number of homicides fell by 13 percent.
However, the number of murders with firearms increased by 24 percent, according to health ministry figures.
Around 1,000 shooting clubs — members-only firing ranges — have opened in Brazil since Bolsonaro took office, according to army figures cited by online news site UOL.
“When the government made it easier to purchase firearms, I said, ‘We have to jump on this,’” says former policeman Marcelo Costa, president of the club where Freitas practices, Mil Armas (One Thousand Firearms), which opened four years ago.
Costa operates the club with his two sons, both in their twenties and both fellow gun enthusiasts. His wife, a psychologist, is licensed by the authorities to perform the mandatory psychological evaluations of all new members.

3,King Charles promises to follow queen’s example,LONDON: King Charles told parliament on Monday he was  “resolved faithfully to follow” the example set by his...,"LONDON: King Charles told parliament on Monday he was  “resolved faithfully to follow” the example set by his mother Queen Elizabeth, addressing lawmakers and peers in what he described as  “the living and breathing instrument of our democracy”.
At a ceremony in Westminster Hall, the oldest building on the parliamentary estate, Charles used his address to the upper and lower houses of parliament to pay tribute to his mother and to pledge to uphold the principle of constitutional government.
“While very young, Her late Majesty pledged herself to serve her country and her people and to maintain the precious principles of constitutional government which lie at the heart of our nation. This vow she kept with unsurpassed devotion,” he told the assembled lawmakers and peers.
“She set an example of selfless duty which, with God’s help and your counsels, I am resolved faithfully to follow.”  The queen, aged 96, died at her home in Scotland on Thursday, setting in train a period of national mourning during which tens of thousands of Britons are expected to pay tribute to her. 
Charles, quoting William Shakespeare’s description of Elizabeth I, said  “she was ‘a pattern to all Princes living’.”  The ceremony, where the speakers of the House of Lords and the House of Commons address the monarch either on their accession or at a jubilee, has taken place in the Palace of Westminster since Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee in 1897.
Queen Elizabeth came to Westminster Hall on her own Diamond Jubilee, and Monday’s ceremony took place in the light of a stained glass window installed on its north wall to mark that celebration in 2012.
John McFall, Lord Speaker, told Charles the queen had been  “both a leader to, and servant of, her people.”  Britain’s system of constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy has operated since 1688, when parliament invited William of Orange to replace King James, establishing its primacy over the crown which monarchs since have had to respect.
Charles III accompanies queen’s coffin
A dog barking and sporadic gun salutes were among the only sounds as  hushed crowds watched King Charles III on Monday lead his siblings in  poignant procession behind their mother’s coffin through the historic  heart of Edinburgh.
Well-wishers packed along the Scottish  capital’s iconic Royal Mile, holding up their mobile phones in  near-silence to film the hearse carrying Queen Elizabeth II as it crept  out of Holyroodhouse Palace.
Kilted soldiers from the Royal  Regiment of Scotland marched slowly alongside the casket — covered with  a royal standard and wreath of white flowers — on the roughly  kilometre-long (0.6-mile) journey to the 14th-century St Giles’  Cathedral.

4,Trump’s lawyers oppose Justice Dept request on classified documents,Trump is under investigation for retaining govt records after leaving office in January 2021.,"WASHINGTON: Former President Donald Trump’s attorneys on Monday said they oppose the US Justice Department’s request to continue to review classified documents seized by the FBI from his Florida estate last month in an ongoing criminal investigation.
In a court filing, his lawyers also asked US District Judge Aileen Cannon to require an independent arbiter, called a special master, to include the roughly 100 documents with classification markings in its review of more than 11,000 records recovered during the court-approved Aug 8 search at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.
Trump is under investigation for retaining government records, some of which were marked as highly classified, at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office in January 2021. The government is also investigating possible obstruction of the probe.
His lawyers in the filing said Trump disputes the Justice Department’s claim that the 100 records in question are in fact classified, and they reminded Cannon that a president generally has bro­ad powers to declassify records.
However, they stopped short of suggesting that Trump had declassified the documents — a claim he has made on social media but not in any official court filings.
“There still remains a disagreement as to the classification status of the documents,” they wrote.  “The government’s position therefore assumes a fact not yet established.”  The clash between the Justice Department and Trump over how to treat classified material puts Cannon on the hot seat to make a decision. If she rules that the Justice Department cannot continue relying on the classified materials for its criminal probe or insists on letting the special master review them, prosecutors have threatened to appeal to the Atlanta-based 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
“In what at its core is a document storage dispute that has spiraled out of control, the government wrongfully seeks to criminalise the possession by the 45th Pres­ident of his own presidential and personal records,” Trump’s lawyers wrote.
“The government should therefore not be permitted to skip the process and proceed straight to a preordained conclusion,” they added.

5,Ukraine claims retaking more ground as Russia strikes back,"Moscow announces air, rocket and artillery attacks on reclaimed areas in Kharkiv region.","KRAMATORSK: Ukrainian forces said on Monday their lightning counter-offensive took back yet more ground in the past 24 hours, as Russia responded with strikes on some of the recaptured areas.
The territorial shifts marked one of Russia’s biggest reversals since its troops were turned back from Kyiv in the earliest days of the nearly seven months of fighting, yet Moscow signalled it was no closer to agreeing a negotiated peace.
The retreat of Russian troops in recent days has drawn weeping and relieved locals into bomb-cratered streets, including on Sunday in the strategic but heavily damaged town of Izyum.
“It’s not enough to say I’m happy. I just don’t have enough words to express myself,” said Yuriy Kurochka, 64.
Yet by Monday Moscow had announced air, rocket and artillery attacks on reclaimed areas in the Kharkiv region, a day after Kyiv said Russian strikes on electricity infrastructure caused power failures.
The retaliatory fire came as Ukraine said forces had retaken more than 20 additional settlements, claiming  “Russian troops are hastily abandoning their positions and fleeing”.
Kyiv had already announced the recapture of Izyum in the country’s east, while Ukraine said 3,000 square kilometers of its territory (1,158 square miles) had been prised from Russian control since September’s start.
“Ukraine has turned the tide in its favour, but the current counter-offensive will not end the war,” US think tank Institute for the Study of War tweeted.
Ukraine also said on Monday its forces recaptured 500 square kilometres (193 square miles) in the southern Kherson region which were in addition to the huge gains in the east at the weekend.
Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told French daily Le Monde, in an interview published on Monday, the war has entered a new phase with the help of Western weapons.
“We started by using the HIMARS mobile artillery systems [from the US] to cut off enemy supply lines and destroy fuel and weapon depots,” he reportedly said.
Moscow conceded having lost territory, which experts saw as a serious blow to its war ambitions, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saw no prospects for negotiations.
“The special military operation continues and will continue until the objectives that were originally set are achieved,” he added, using Russia’s terminology for the internationally condemned war.
Eastern parts of Ukraine were hit with widespread electricity blackouts on Sunday evening, which President Volodymyr Zelensky said deliberately hit civilian infrastructure. He blamed  “Russian terrorists”.
The blackouts hit regions with an estimated combined population of nine million people — including territory controlled by Russia.
The Russian strikes hit 15 locations on Sunday, from Kramatorsk in the east to Mykolaiv in the south and Dnipro in between, Ukraine’s military said. Ukraine had already lost all power from the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, threatened by shelling since February’s invasion.
The country’s nuclear energy agency said the final reactor at the plant, Europe’s largest nuclear power station, had been shut off as a safety measure.
Kyiv and Moscow have shown  “signs that they are interested” in creating a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia plant, the UN atomic watchdog said Monday.
“What we need here really is Ukraine and Russia to agree on a very simple principle of not attacking or not shelling the plant,” IAEA director general Rafael Grossi told reporters.

Since the Taliban seized power in August last year, they have imposed harsh restrictions on girls and women to comply with their austere vision of Islam — effectively squeezing them out of public life.
“There has been an emerging pattern of harassment of Afghan UN female staff by the de facto authorities,” the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a statement.
Citing an example, UNAMA said three Afghan women working for the organisation were  “singled out and temporarily detained for questioning” by armed security agents of the authorities on Monday.

“Arrangements for different leaders will vary depending on things like security risks, so we are providing guidance and information through embassies,” Prime Minister Liz Truss’s spokesman told reporters.
It follows news website Politico reporting that attendees have been told to take commercial flights and esco­rted private buses to reach the Sept 19 service at Lon­don’s Westminster Abbey.
As well as being told not to use their own vehicles to reach the country’s first state funeral since that of former prime minister Winston Churchill in 1965, they have also been advised against travelling over London by helicopter, the website said.
Instead, they will be transported by buses to the abbey from a site in west London, Politico reported, citing an official protocol message sent to foreign embassies.
“Tight security and road restrictions” were cited as the reasons, but the purported stipulations have raised eyebrows, with one London-based foreign ambassador telling the website: “Can you imagine Joe Biden on the bus?”

8,Queen’s coffin was crafted three decades ago,The casket will rest closed on a raised platform known as a catafalque inside Westminster Hall for 4 days.,"LONDON: Queen Elizabeth II’s coffin, which will lie in state in London for four days later this week before her funeral on Monday, was reportedly crafted more than three decades ago.
The casket will rest closed on a raised platform known as a catafalque inside Westminster Hall — the oldest part of the centuries-old parliamentary estate — from Wednesday, after lying at rest in Edinburgh for a day.
Here are more details about the coffin of Britain’s longest-serving monarch: 
English oak and lead
The queen’s coffin was made at least 32 years ago of English oak, which is increasingly rare these days with most wooden caskets now made from American oak, The Times reported on Monday.
It is lined with lead, a royal tradition to help preserve the corpse for longer after its burial in a crypt — on this occasion inside the King George VI Memorial Chapel at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, west of London.
Lead is said to make the casket airtight, helping to stop moisture from getting in but making it significantly heavier. 
The queen’s coffin requires eight pallbearers to move it.
It matches another made for the late queen’s husband, Prince Philip, who died last year and was interred at the crypt where she will soon be buried alongside him.
Leverton & Sons, the London undertakers for the royal family since 1991, told The Times they inherited the coffins at that time and are unaware who had crafted them before then.
“It is made from English oak, which is very difficult to get hold of,” Andrew Leverton, who runs the company, added to the newspaper.
“I don’t think we could use American oak for a coffin now. It would be too expensive.” 
Unique features
The coffin has been specifically designed to hold precious fitments securely on its lid.
At the lying in state and funeral, that will include the Imperial State Crown, orb and sceptre, representing different aspects of the sovereign’s powers.
Meanwhile, the brass handles on the coffin are also uniquely designed for royal caskets, with a company in the central English city of Birmingham responsible for them, according to The Times. “It is not something you can just make in a day,” noted Leverton.

Prepared over the past 18 months by France and Spain, the  “Year of Picasso” initiative will involve  “38 very important art institutions in Europe and the United States,” Spanish Culture Minister Miquel Iceta told reporters.
The aim is to  “show off all the facets” of Picasso, said French Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak, describing him as  “the most famous and emblematic modern artist”.
Picasso was born in the Spanish city of Malaga in 1881 and died in Mougins on the French Riviera in 1973.
A series of talks about him and his work will also be held alongside the exhibition.
The celebrations will begin on September 23 at Madrid’s Mapfre Foundation with the exhibit  “Pablo Picasso and the breaking down of sculpture” and will run until April 2024 with the closing exhibit at the Petit Palais in Paris.
Although most events will take place in Spain, France and the United States, others will happen in Germany, Switzerland, Romania and Belgium.
Among the institutions involved in the celebrations are the New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, Madrid’s Prado, the Guggenheim in Bilbao, the Pompidou Centre in Paris and the Picasso museums in Barcelona and Paris.

10,Oregon blaze latest major wildfire to engulf US West,"Active infernos in California, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and other western states have ravaged more than 1,200 square miles.","LOS ANGELES: A massive wildfire burned out of control on Monday in Oregon forcing residents to flee and threatening towns and thousands of homes, in the latest blaze to scorch the US West during a blistering summer.
Dozens of active infernos in California, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and other western states have ravaged more than 1,200 square miles, worsening air quality and highlighting the devastating effects of a historic two-decade-plus drought that has left the region parched.
The Cedar Creek fire east of the city of Eugene, Oregon experienced  “extreme” growth over the weekend and has now consumed 86,734 acres (35,100 hectares) — roughly twice the size of the US capital Washington — with zero percent containment as of Monday, according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG).
More than 1,200 firefighters and other personnel have converged on the steep mountainous terrain, much of it in US national forest land and hard to reach.
“They have been constructing firelines away from the active fire edge, along roads and trails, where they have a better chance of successfully stopping the fire,” NWCG reported.
Evacuations were ordered for Lane and Deschutes counties, and the Deschutes and Willamette national forests have been closed. More than 2,000 homes were under threat, authorities said.
Dense smoke has enveloped the region, and according to NWCG,  “smoke has created unhealthy air quality for communities east of the fire as well, including Bend,” a town that serves as a gateway for outdoor tourism.
“Get out of here as fast as I can,” Herman Schimmel, who moved to the small town of Westfir only recently, told The Oregonian newspaper.  “That’s all I was thinking about.” The western United States is more than two decades into a historic drought that scientists say is being worsened by human-made climate change. Much of the countryside is parched, creating conditions for hot, fast and destructive wildfires.
An even larger blaze was burning in northwestern Oregon, in a more remote region. The Double Creek fire, first detected on August 30, has consumed 155,000 acres and was 15 percent contained.
According to the National Interagency Fire Center, more than 90 fires were currently burning across seven states in the west: California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.
More than 1,200 square miles in total was burning — an area larger that Yosemite National Park — NIFC reported on Sunday.
The Mosquito Fire, California’s current largest blaze, has now swept through 46,500 acres in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, with several small nearby towns reportedly evacuated.

11,Six Syrians die in attempt to reach Italy,ROME: Six Syrians including two infants died of thirst and hunger as they attempted to cross the Mediterranean Sea ...,"ROME: Six Syrians including two infants died of thirst and hunger as they attempted to cross the Mediterranean Sea in a makeshift boat, the UN refugee agency said on Monday.
More than thirty people attempted the crossing on the vessel, with many of the survivors in an  “extremely serious” state of health according to UNHCR.
“Six Syrian refugees including children, women and teenagers lost their lives at sea. They died of thirst, hunger and severe burns,” Chiara Cardoletti, UNHCR official in Italy, wrote on her Twitter account.
“This is unacceptable. Strengthening rescue at sea is the only way to prevent these tragedies,” she added.
The victims included two children aged one and two years old, a 12-year-old child and three more adults, including a grandmother and mother also travelling with children who survived the journey, according to a UNHCR statement. The 26 survivors were being treated in Pozzallo, Sicily. It was not specified which country they had departed from.
Alarm Phone, a group running a hotline for migrants needing rescue, said some 250 migrants were in need of rescue off the coast of Malta.
The boat left Lebanon around a week ago, it said, and had now run out of fuel.
“Food & drinking water finished 2 days ago. The caller said his 3-month old daughter has died from thirst,” the group posted on Twitter.
Several hundred migrants have been rescued in the past few days in the Mediterranean by humanitarian groups.
German NGO SeaWatch said on Monday it had 428 people on board a ship, waiting for a port to be assigned.
“The civil fleet has rescued hundreds of people in the past days, who otherwise would have been pulled back to Libya or even drowned,” it said on Twitter.
According to the European border and coast guard agency Frontex, the central Mediterranean route was used by more than 42,500 migrants from January to July — an increase of 44 percent compared to the first seven months of 2021.
UNHCR says 1,200 people have lost their lives in the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year.

12,"HIV, TB, malaria fight saved 50m lives over 20 years: Global Fund","GENEVA: The fight against HIV, tuberculosis and malaria has saved 50 million lives over the past 20 years, the ...","GENEVA: The fight against HIV, tuberculosis and malaria has saved 50 million lives over the past 20 years, the Global Fund said on Monday, appealing for $18 billion to save millions more.
“We have made tremendous progress,” the global partnership created in 2002 to battle the three deadly diseases said in its annual report, with their death rates halved since then.
“But our fight is not over,” it cautioned, pointing to a range of colliding crises, including climate change, conflicts and the Covid-19 pandemic, that  “threaten to knock us backward”.
The Global Fund will next week hold a replenishment conference in New York, where it aims to raise at least $18 billion in funds to cover its programmes from 2024 through 2026.
The fund, which brings together governments, multi-lateral agencies, bilateral partners, civil society groups, people affected by the diseases and the private sector, estimates that financing would help cut HIV, TB and malaria deaths by nearly two-thirds and save 20 million lives.
Last year, the Global Fund warned that the pandemic in particular was having a  “devastating” impact on efforts to root out HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, leading to declining results across the board for the first time in the fund’s history.
But it said that the massive resources it had pumped to counter the downturn had paid off and  “recovery is underway”.
Since March 2020, the Global Fund said it had invested more than $4.4 billion to fight the pandemic and mitigate its impact on its programmes.
‘Back on track’
Fund chief Peter Sands stressed that  “although most countries that fight HIV, TB and malaria have started to recover from the ravages of Covid-19, we need to accelerate our efforts if we are to fully recover lost ground and get back on track towards ending these diseases by 2030.” He insisted that the 50 million lives saved over two decades was  “proof that global commitment and community leadership can force the world’s deadliest infectious diseases into retreat.” The Global Fund, which provides nearly a third of all international financing to battle HIV, said that the number of people who received life-saving antiretroviral therapy last year rose to 23.3 million, up from 21.9 percent a year earlier.
And the number of people reached with prevention services rose again after dropping in 2020, reaching 12.5 million people worldwide, it said.
But around 10 million people living with the virus do not have access to lifesaving medicine, it warned.
And while AIDS-related deaths have fallen by 50 percent since 2010 to 650,000 last year, that still falls far short of the target of reducing deaths to fewer than 500,000 per year by 2020.
Seeking $18 billion
The pandemic meanwhile had a particularly harsh impact on the fight against tuberculosis, with many resources diverted to battle Covid-19.
As a result, the number of people dying from TB rose for the first time in a decade in 2020, when it caused an estimated 1.5 million deaths, making it the world’s second biggest infectious disease killer behind Covid.
But the Global Fund, which provides 76 percent of all international financing for fighting TB, said the programmes had shown signs of recovery last year.
In 2021, the number of people receiving treatment ticked in at 5.3 million, including 110,000 treated for drug-resistant TB, it said.
The pandemic also initially took a heavy toll on the battle against malaria, with interruptions in services sending deaths soaring 12 percent in 2020, to an estimated 627,000.
But the Global Fund said a rapid scale-up of programmes had allowed them to bounce back, with some 280 million suspected cases tested and 148 million cases treated last year. At the same time, 133 million mosquito nets were distributed.

13,Germany in talks to buy Israeli missile defence system,BERLIN: Germany is in talks to buy a missile defence system from Israel as part of Berlin’s efforts to strengthen...,"BERLIN: Germany is in talks to buy a missile defence system from Israel as part of Berlin’s efforts to strengthen its armed forces after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said on a visit to the German capital on Monday. 
Germany has ramped up its military spending after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February, while shipping aid and heavy weapons to Kyiv as part of an international response. 
“Israel ... will play a part in building Germany’s new defence force, mainly in the field of air defence,” Lapid told reporters, speaking alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. 
“... it has to do with our total commitment to the safety of Germany, to the safety of Europe, to the ability of liberal democracies to defend themselves,” he added. 
Lapid described their talks as leading to a “future possible deal”, but declined to outline the cost.  
Scholz said Germany would strengthen its defences by buying more air defence systems in the future and called Israel’s Arrow 3 system a “high-performance offer”, but also declined to go into specifics. 
Arrow 3 interceptors are designed to fly beyond the earth’s atmosphere, where their warheads detach to bec­ome “kamikaze” satellites, or “kill vehicles” that track and slam into the targets. Such high-altitude shoo­t-downs are meant to safely destroy incoming nuclear, biological or chemical missiles. 
One German government source said: “Yes, there is the plan to buy Arrow 3, but nothing is signed.”
