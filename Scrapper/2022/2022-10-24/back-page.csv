0,Pakistan lacking ‘effectiveness’ on four FATF-linked goals,Islamabad has made moderate progress on one out of 11 immediate outcomes.,"ISLAMABAD: The Asia-Pacific Group (APG) on Money Laundering has rated Pakistan’s level of effectiveness as ‘low’ on 10 out of 11 international goals on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terror (AML/CFT), even though the country is now compliant on 38 out of 40 technical recommendations.
The Sydney-based regional affiliate of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) released an update, as of Sept 2, on the rating of its regional members suggesting that Pakistan had a ‘moderate level of effectiveness’ on only one out of 11 outcomes.
Under this ‘immediate outcome’, Pakistan extends international cooperation on appropriate information, financial intelligence, and evidence, and facilitates action against criminals and their assets.
A 15-member joint delegation of FATF and APG paid an onsite visit to Pakistan from Aug 29 to Sept 2 to verify the country’s compliance with a 34-point action plan committed with FATF at the highest level in June 2018.

Islamabad has made moderate progress on one out of 11 immediate outcomes

The task force had found Pakistan compliant or largely compliant on all the 34 points in February this year and had decided to field an onsite mission to verify it on the ground before formally announcing the country’s exit from the grey list.
Under the FATF-APG assessment mechanism, effective ratings on “Immediate Outcomes” reflect the extent to which a country’s measures are effective. The assessment is conducted on the basis of 11 immediate outcomes, which represent key goals that an effective AML/CFT system should achieve.

However, this has no direct bearing on an expected exit of Pakistan from FATF’s grey list during its Oct 18-22 plenary in Paris.
Last month, the APG had described Pakistan as ‘compliant’ or ‘largely compliant’ on 38 out of 40 technical recommendations of the FATF on anti-money laundering and combating financing of terror. It had, however, retained Islamabad on ‘Enhanced Follow-up’ until further progress was made on the two remaining recommendations.
This means that Pakistan has made major progress on FATF’s technical recommendations to qualify to be moved out of ‘grey list’, but it is still far behind FATF’s immediate outcomes on effectiveness.
10 ‘immediate outcomes’
The APG noted that Pakistan had a low level of effectiveness on 10 “Immediate Outcomes (IOs)” under international standards against money laundering and terror financing.
The first IO on which the effectiveness is rated as moderate is that money laundering and terror-financing are understood and, where appropriate, actions coordinated domestically to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism and proliferation.
There are nine other IOs on which Pakistan has been ranked as having a ‘low level of effectiveness.
Goal 7 & 8 require that ML offences and activities are investigated and offenders are prosecuted and are subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions are taken and proceeds and instrumentalities of crime are confiscated.
Likewise, target 9 & 10 demand that terror financing offences and activities are investigated and persons who finance terrorism are prosecuted and are subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions and terrorists, terrorist organisations and terrorist financiers are prevented from raising, moving and using funds, and from abusing the non-profit organisations sector.
The immediate outcome 11 requires that persons and entities involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are prevented from raising, moving and using funds, consistent with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.

1,Iran indicates it’s ready to work with IAEA,"Reveals drone capable of hitting major cities in Israel, foreign ministry asks IAEA not to yield to Israel’s pressure.","TEHRAN: Iran reaffirmed on Monday its “readiness” to cooperate with the UN nuclear watchdog, while also revealing a drone capable of hitting major cities in Israel, with its foreign ministry asking the UN’s watchdog not to yield to Israel’s pressure.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in a recent report said it “cannot assure” the peaceful nature of Tehran’s nuclear programme, after which France, Britain and Germany said they had “serious doubts” about Iran’s intentions to revive the deal curbing its nuclear programme in return for a lifting of sanctions.
Speaking after European powers expressed frustration with Iran’s intentions to salvage the agreement, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani urged the IAEA “not to yield to Israel’s pressure” over Tehran’s peaceful nuclear activities.
As the IAEA’s Board of Governors met on Monday, Iran said it is “ready to cooperate with the agency to clear up the false and unrealistic perceptions regarding its peaceful nuclear activities,” Kanani said in a press conference.
Tehran declares its “readiness to continue constructive cooperation with the IAEA”, Kanani added, also pointing to the agency’s “obligations”.
IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi after opening the board of governors meeting said he hoped Iran would start cooperating “as soon as possible”. “We are ready, we want this to happen, we are not in the business of aggravating or creating situations, we want this issue to be clarified,” he said.

2,Court allows Hindu women to pray at Varanasi mosque,NEW DELHI: A Varanasi court on Monday ruled in favour of five Hindu women who had sought permission to pray at a...,"NEW DELHI: A Varanasi court on Monday ruled in favour of five Hindu women who had sought permission to pray at a historic mosque in the city.
The order is said to have opened the door for other petitions, demanding more mosques to be treated similarly. It effectively rejected the objection by the Muslim side that had opposed the plea for the right to pray inside the Gyanvapi Mosque premises all-year round.
The Muslim side would now have to prove the ownership of what had hitherto been described as Waqf land.
The court fixed Sept 22 as the next date of hearing. Merajuddin Siddiqui, the advocate representing the Muslim side, said they would move the Allahabad High Court against the judgement, The Hindu reported.
According to an advocate, who was present in the courtroom, District Judge A.K. Vishvesh said: “In view of the discussions and analysis, I have come to the conclusion that the suit of the plaintiffs is not barred by the Places of Worship (Special Provision) Act, 1991, The Waqf Act, 1995 and UP Sri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Act, 1983, and the application 35C filed by the defendant no. 4 (Anjuman Intezamia) is liable to be dismissed.”
Five women had filed the petition seeking permission for daily worship of Hindu deities whose idols are claimed to be located on an outer wall of the Gyanvapi Mosque.
The Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee said the mosque is a Waqf property and questioned the maintainability of the plea. The judge had on Aug 24 reserved the order in the communally sensitive matter.
Meanwhile, the Allahabad High Court on Monday fixed Sept 28 as the next date of hearing in a case pertaining to a petition filed by Anjuman Intezamia Masjid challenging the maintainability of an original suit filed in 1991 in the Varanasi district court.
The original suit has sought the restoration of the ancient Kashi Vishwanath temple at the site where the Gyanvapi Mosque currently stands. The petitioners claimed that the mosque is a part of the temple.
As the news about the court order spread, some people who had gathered outside the court, distributed sweets to celebrate the verdict, The Hindu reported.
The district administration had issued prohibitory order under Section 144 of CrPC in Varanasi since Sunday in view of the court order.

3,"5 killed, dykes breached as rains lash Mirpurkhas, Tharparkar in Sindh",Strong winds blow away several makeshift camps of flood survivors; water level raised in Dhoro Puran and LBOD drains.,"MIRPURKHAS: Lightning strikes killed three men, two others drowned in floodwater as downpour continued to wreak havoc on parts of Sindh, with breaches in the dykes of two major drains inundating dozens of villages.
Strong winds accompanying the showers blew away several makeshift camps of flood survivors along the roads and worsened the situation in low-lying areas of Mirpurkhas and Tharparkar districts.
Unrelenting rainfall during the past two days raised the level of floodwaters in Dhoro Puran and Left Bank Outfall Drains, while local authorities were yet to drain water from graveyards, residential areas, parks and playgrounds.
No official help had reached the flood-hit people after the latest blow as only a few organisations were providing them food and relief goods. The district administration had provided mosquito nets to its favourites, complained flood victims to journalists in Sindhri, Hussain Bux Marri, Digri and Jhuddo talukas. Mirwah Gorchani, Digri, Jhuddo, Naukot, Kot Ghulam Mohammad, Sindhri, Phuladyyoon, Hingorno, Samaro, Pithoro, Kunri, Jhilori and Khaan received moderate to heavy rainfall.
Rain caused Dhoro Puran dyke near Roshanabad in Jhuddo taluka, which had been plugged earlier, to develop a 20-foot-wide breach at the same place.
An irrigation official said the fresh showers disrupted the work on plugging breaches and draining out stagnant floodwater from the district through spinal drain.
Sources said Nara Canal Area Water Board director Mansoor Memon had advised commissioner Syed Ajaz Ali Shah during a briefing on Monday that floodwaters could not be drained out completely from the district till the removal of encroachments on natural rain drains and illegal dykes around farmland.
He set up a task force to ensure removal of all encroachment from natural rain drains and said Rangers personnel would also help in the removal of encroachments.
LBOD dyke breaches
Dozens of villages were submerged after a 100-foot-wide breach developed in LBOD in the wake of heavy rain at Qazi village near Jhuddo, sending villagers fleeing to main roads to save their lives.
In Dhani Bux Marri village and Jhuddo bypass area, a man and an elderly woman drowned in floodwaters. Their bodies were recovered and shifted to hospital.
Also, three men, Mohammad Yaqub, Moosa and Deedar Shar, were killed in lightning strikes reported from near Diplo town and Sindhri taluka.
