0,Ideology trumps candidates in PP-7 by-election,Polling remains largely peaceful except for some minor clashes.,"RAWALPINDI:Polling in the PP-7 constituency of Rawalpindi remained largely peaceful barring some incidents of violence as residents of Kahuta and Kallar Syedan voted to elect their Punjab Assembly representative in the crucial by-election held after the de-seating of the dissident Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers across Punjab under Article 63-A.
At least six candidates contested the election. Raja Sagheer was fielded by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) whereas retired colonel Shabbir Awan was PTI’s nominee. Hafiz Mansoor of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), Raja Tanveer of Jamaat-i-Islami and independent candidates Engineer Raja Nazakat Hussain and retired colonel Wasim also took part in the much-hyped polls.
According to unconfirmed reports, the voter turnout remained around 30pc whereas the former PTI MPA, Arif Abbasi, put the percentage at approximately 38pc.
For 335,295 registered voters, as many as 266 polling stations comprising 787 polling booths were established by the election commission. However, voting at some polling stations was started later than the scheduled time as the female staff of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) reached late at these polling stations. Male staff, on the other hand, had to face problems at the polling stations where they had to spend the night.

Polling remains largely peaceful except for some minor clashes

The voters, mostly locals, showed preference for the political parties instead of candidates. A large number of people had chosen between the PML-N and the PTI. The candidates of political parties had set up camps outside polling stations to facilitate their voters. The candidates also distributed lunch among their supporters and arranged vehicles to provide pick and drop to them.

Rigging allegations
In some polling stations, the PTI workers alleged that the ruling party candidate “bribed people through cash and flour”. However, the PML-N rejected the allegations.
Former MNA and PTI spokesman Sadaqat Ali Abbasi told Dawn that polling remained peaceful but the police and the ECP staff allegedly forced people to cast votes against the former ruling party.
“By afternoon, the PTI supporters came out in large numbers from Kahuta to cast vote in favour of Imran Khan’s candidate,” he said.
On the other hand, PML-N Metropolitan President Sardar Naseem and Tahira Aurangzeb alongside local office-bearers visited the constituency as well.
“The election remained peaceful and no violent incidents were reported in Kahuta and Kallar Syedan till evening,” said former mayor Sardar Naseem while talking to Dawn.
“There is no evidence of rigging in PP-7 as the government believed in fair and free elections,” he said while rejecting rigging allegations leveled by the PTI. He added that the party made efforts to bring people from small villages to poll votes.
District Election Commissioner Roy Sultan Bhatty told   that the election commission received some “minor complaints” regarding the irregularities in voting. However, these issues were resolved with help of local party leaders, he added.
“No major clash was witnessed. The election commission provided ample opportunity to the people to use their right to choose [MPA] without any fear,” he said.

1,Bride among five killed in AJK road accident,MUZAFFARABAD: A bride and an infant were among five people who lost their lives after their car plunged into Neelum...,"MUZAFFARABAD: A bride and an infant were among five people who lost their lives after their car plunged into Neelum River at the border of Neelum and Muzaffarabad districts on Sunday reportedly due to some technical fault.
The groom and three children survived with critical injuries, police said.
The accident occurred near Chhakkar Nakka village, about 41 kilometres northeast of here in the jurisdiction of Panjgran police at about 11am, said Station House Officer (SHO) Mir Muzammil Hussain.
The vehicle with the newlywed couple and two adults and five minors aged between six months and five years on board was returning from Bata village, where the marriage was contracted, to Ambore refugee camp on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad from where thebaraat[wedding party] had started its journey in the small hours.
Except for the groom and his police constable cousin who was behind the wheel, the rest belonged to the bride’s family.
As the vehicle was passing through a landslide affected portion of the road, which was devoid of parapets or galvanised guardrail towards the riverside, it went out of the driver’s control and plunged into Neelum River.
Before the vehicle dived into the icy river and disappeared, all those on board were thrown onto the steep slope up to the riverbank or else there would have been no survivors, said SHO Hussain.
He said the marks of tyres on the road suggested that the driver had applied brakes several feet before the spot from where the vehicle fell down following some technical fault, but it did not work.
Rescuers who descended down to the riverbank found the 19-year-old bride Safina Latif, driver Nadeem Khan, 32, Amna, 24, wife of Mohammad Saleem and Shagufta, 30, wife of Mohammad Ayaz dead on the spot and remaining five alive with multiple wounds.
The injured, who were identified as 22-year-old groom Owais Khan, six-month-old Insha, daughter of Mr Saleem, Aima, 5, and Aimal, 2, daughters of Mr Ayaz, and Noor, 5, daughter of Abdul Qadeer, were shifted to the Combined Military Hospital Muzaffarabad where Insha succumbed to her wounds.
The condition of the groom was also critical as he had been put on a ventilator.
Expressing grief over the loss of lives, AJK Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas said in a tweet: “… theaccident has endorsed my emphasis on urgent and effective implementation of Road Traffic Safety Measures in AJK where, sadly, the havoc wreaked by road accidents has been colossal.”
Later in a statement, he said he had issued directions to the highway department to prepare and implement schemes for construction of safety walls along all arteries, particularly those running through the dangerous areas.

2,Afghan refugees turn F-6 children’s park into ‘tent village’,"Protesters say they are helpless, cannot return to homeland; CDA to seek local admin, police’s help to get area vacated.","ISLAMABAD: Owing to the negligence of authorities concerned, Afghan refugees have taken over a children park in Islamabad and are living there after pitching tents.
F-6’s newly-renovated children park has become a makeshift campground for the Afghan refugees mostly belonging to the Hazara community, who fled their country following the takeover of Kabul by Taliban.
Initially, the refugees camped outside the National Press Club and later started living in the red zone near Parliament House. However, police and administration managed to remove them from the high security zone.
The refugees then again established their camps outside the press club. However, those belonging to the Hazara community set up their camps in the children park across the road. Nearly 700 Afghan refugees, most of them women and children, have been sheltering in the park for the last few weeks.

Protesters say they are helpless, cannot return to homeland; CDA to seek local admin, police’s help to get area vacated

“We are living in a public park but we are helpless and shelterless and have no idea where we should go?” said Surya Mosawai, a university graduate from Herat.
She said the refugees had been facing lots of difficulties but no one, including developed countries and other champions of human rights, were paying any heed to their issues.
“Do you think we are living in this park by choice. No. We don’t want to live here but we have no other option. We have been demanding the international community and developed countries, including the United State of America, to provide us citizenship as we can’t go back to our country because of the Taliban,” she said.
Another refugee, Bakar Ahmed, said: “The United Nations High Commission for Refugees should help us.”
He said if developed countries were not ready to accept them, Pakistan should give them asylum.
It may be noted that Pakistan has already been providing shelters to more than 1.3 million Afghan refugees for decades.
Najma Nowrozi, another refugee, said camped life was highly tough as refugees had to go to nearby mosques for using washrooms.
“Even, we are facing shortage of water,” she said and added that some well-off local people had provided them two plastic tanks for storing water. It is a blessing for us but the water is insufficient,” she said, adding: “We are helpless and hopeless.”
Some of the refugees said there was a public toilet near their camps but they had to pay to the operator of the toilet for using it. Similarly, they said, they had to pay to shopkeepers for charging their mobile phones.
The park was recently renovated and restored by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) by spending millions of rupees. However, due to negligence of the civic agency, the same has been taken over by the refugees.
“We are not against refugees, they are our brethren. But we are against setting up of camps in a public park. The CDA and police should remove them from the park,” said Liaquat Khan, a local. Another local resident, Shabbir Ali, said unregulated camps posed a security threat to the locals. He raised questions over the efficiency of the CDA which is the custodian of the public parks.
“These camps should be shifted to some other place as people of the area have been deprived of their right to visit the park as it has been taken over by the refugees,” he said.
When contacted, CDA’s Director General Environment Irfan Niazi told Dawn that he would take up the matter with the capital administration and police to get the park vacated.
He agreed that the park was recently renovated, adding soon it would be vacated for the public.

Robberies, thefts, street crime and burglaries have surged manifold in these areas and a wave of fear and insecurity has taken over the residents of Gujar Khan as police’s performance to arrest the suspects and recover looted valuables remained below the mark.
Kaneez Fatima, a resident of Lahore, told Gujar Khan police that she and her two sisters were government employees and posted to Gujar Khan. When they went to Lahore on Eid holidays, burglars broke into their house and took away seven tola gold jewellery worth Rs800,000, a laptop and dresses worth Rs100,000. She said in February, two mobile phones worth Rs85,000 and Rs20,000 cash had been stolen from their house but no action could be taken so far.
Gujar Khan police registered the case on July 14 but no action could be taken so far.
Afshan Khalid, a resident of Ward No 8, reported to the Gujar Khan police that he had parked his motorcycle outside his house at around 1:30pm, but he found it missing after half an hour.
A resident of Laliyani village, Sarfraz Khan, reported to the police that he had parked his motorcycle outside the subway of a shopping centre in Gujar Khan city from where it was stolen.
In other incidents, thieves took away Rs50,000 cash, gold jewellery worth Rs190,000, a LED TV and power backup system worth Rs65,000 from a house in ward No 19 of Gujar Khan city in the absence of the residents.

5,Economic strength vital for taking independent decisions: Alvi,"Says Pakistani diaspora could contribute to add value to business, industrial, agri and services sectors","ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi has said economic and financial strength is vital for taking independent decisions.
He said the country could achieve accelerated economic growth by imparting skills to youth and women through short and extensive training courses in various fields, especially in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector.
The president made these remarks while virtually addressing the 45th annual convention of the Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America (APPNA), USA, from Aiwan-i-Sadr.
APPNA President Dr Haroon Durrani and members of the Pakistani diaspora attended the virtual convention.

Says Pakistani diaspora could contribute to add value to business, industrial, agri and services sectors

Dr Alvi said meaningful and active role of the Pakistani diaspora was imperative to uplift business and industrial sectors and impart skills to youth and women to help Pakistan achieve self-sufficiency which would enable the country to take independent political, financial and economic decisions for the betterment of the people.
He regretted that in the past Pakistan did not have the capacity to absorb its highly educated and productive human resource which resulted in its migration to developed countries where, by sheer dint of merit, they became high achievers in many high value sectors and contributed to the development and prosperity of their host country.
President Alvi said the Pakistani diaspora could contribute to uplift and add value to business, industrial, agriculture and services sectors of the country and in the development of non-productive population, such as the uneducated youth and women by imparting them technical skills and expertise in relevant fields.
He appreciated the Pakistani physicians in the US for earning excellent reputation in the host country and for their valuable contributions towards Pakistan’s development. He urged them to establish telehealth services in Pakistan in order to provide guidance and consultancy to the patients, especially to the poor and underserved segments of the population.
While identifying various sectors where Pakistan needed to make progress, he said” “We needed to provide further incentives to the ICT sector and equip our youth with marketable ICT skills.”
He said strong democratic institutions, curbing the menaces of corruption, nepotism and jobbery, empowering women financially and focusing on the skill development of its human resources were essential for Pakistan’s socioeconomic development.
He said Pakistan through its Digiskills online training programme had imparted IT skills to over 2.4 million youth and enabled them to earn a decent living for themselves. He said scale and scope of such fast-track training programmes needed to be enlarged and expanded across the country.
While updating the participants on salient features of Pakistan’s foreign policy, the president said Pakistan had shifted the focus of its foreign policy from geo-strategic to geo-economics and was promoting regional trade and connectivity by optimally utilising its unique geographic location, especially in the context of Central Asian Republics which were keen to link themselves to rest of the world to promote regional trade and economic cooperation.
Dr Alvi said Pakistan did not believe in polarisation and camp politics and was trying to maintain cordial relations with all its international partners.
He urged the Pakistani diaspora to address misgivings and misunderstanding about Pakistan in USA in the wake of the the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

6,Inter-provincial traffic on hold as rains damage under-construction bridge,TAXILA: Traffic between Punjab and Hazara division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained suspended as the ...,"TAXILA: Traffic between Punjab and Hazara division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained suspended as the under-construction bridge on Taxila-Hattar Road near Heavy Mechanical Complex (HMC) was swept away by flash floods caused by torrential rain.
The bridge, which is being reconstructed, was the only source of transportation between the inter-provincial Taxila-Hattar Road but recent flash floods damaged it causing problems for commuters. The employees of Heavy Mechanical Complex (HMC), Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), Hattar Industrial Estate besides students of University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila and Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (Tevta) and inhabitants of three major rural union councils comprising around 22 villages have been most affected by the current situation.
Travelling for their normal routines has come to a halt as there is no way of reaching Taxila from Thatta. Commuters have to now travel an extra 20 kilometres through the alternative Taxila-Khanpur Road where due to trucks, dumpers and trailers, there is extreme traffic congestion. 
Raja Babar, a social worker has said that residents of dozens of villages including Sakhoo, Massain, Kolian, Salargah, Usman Khattar, Kamra and others whose health, education, employment and trade completely depends upon tehsil headquarters have been cut off. He said scores of employees of various government defence industrial institutions especially Pakistan Ordnance Factories (POF), HIT, PMO, NDC and AWC besides students of various institutions suffer as they travel an extra 10kms to reach their respective destinations.
“The eroded bridge was the only mode of connectivity of dwellers of rural areas of three major union councils including employees and students,” said Ibrar Dildar Khan, a local politician.
PML-N leader Syed Imran Haider Naqvi claimed that the project for construction of the bridge and re-carpeting of the road was awarded to a company which was not technically sound to execute the project. This, he said, has resulted in ill planning and the suffering of so many people.
He said the administration seems to not be the least bit bothered about sufferings of people as no government official has visited the area so far.
When contacted, a spokesman for the Punjab Highway Roads Department said the contract of construction of the bridge was already awarded to a firm in the previous fiscal year. He said due to lack of funds, work on execution of the project was slowed down however in the new fiscal year, funds will be released so work can be accelerated.
Locals have expressed concern over this situation and they have urged the Punjab chief minister, commissioner and deputy commissioner to look into the matter in the larger public interest without any further delay.

9,"Ministry, IUCN working on action plan to build climate resilience",The govt and key stakeholders are developing the action plan after a comprehensive consultative process.,"ISLAMABAD: The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in collaboration with Ministry of Climate Change is working on developing a National Climate Change Gender Action Plan to build capacities through making a strong institutional mechanism.
With support from the green climate fund (GCF) and technical guidance from the IUCN and other key partners, the government and key stakeholders are developing the action plan after a comprehensive consultative process. 
It is being developed around six priority sectors including agriculture and food security, forests and biodiversity, disaster risk reduction, water and sanitation, integrated coastal management and mitigation, energy and transport.
According to a statement issued by IUCN, the process for development of the plan was led by Ministry of Climate Change and IUCN in order to enhance national capacity and focal groups and a cross-sector national action plan, fostering innovative project design to strengthen national and provincial climate change adaptation, mitigation and resilience through gender-responsive strategies and activities.
This initiative has enhanced existing and nascent policy and programming while elevating the country’s position as an international leader towards building inclusive sustainable development, climate action and resilience for all. 
This comprehensive process directly engaged approximately 300 women, gender experts, organisations led by women and key stakeholders from priority sectors and from all over Pakistan.
IUCN described the initiative as an important achievement of the government of Pakistan in multiple ways, particularly as it was the first ever Climate Change Gender Action Plan of Pakistan led by the Ministry of Climate Change and also being the first such initiative by GCF to ensure gender mainstreaming in upcoming projects.
“GCF will use lessons learnt as a guide for other gender-responsive readiness initiatives all over the world,” the statement added.
Upon completion of the document, launch of the Climate Change Gender Action Plan (ccGAP) document and Climate Change Gender Portal has been planned on July 20, 2022.

10,PC-I for upgradation of schools in Islamabad revised,"Total cost raised from Rs6.7bn to Rs7.7bn after increase in prices of construction material, says official","ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training has prepared a revised PC-I to upgrade and give a facelift to 167 schools and colleges in Islamabad besides providing them missing facilities.
For the fiscal year 2022-23, the government had earmarked Rs382 million for the three-year project with a total cost of Rs6.7 billion.
Officials in the education ministry said after revision of the rates of Public Work Departments (PWD) following an increase in the prices of construction material, the ministry has now prepared a new PC-I worth Rs7.7 billion.
They said soon the revised PC-I will be submitted to Planning Commission for approval after which the ministry will call tenders for awarding the work.

Total cost raised from Rs6.7bn to Rs7.7bn after increase in prices of construction material, says official

The officials said since only Rs382 million out of the total 6.7b had been earmarked for the current fiscal year, the ministry had decided that instead of carrying out the entire project simultaneously, only classrooms will be constructed initially.
In April this year, the ministry of education’s Project Management Unit (PMU) had pre-qualified three construction firms. However, later the ministry decided to cancel the pre-qualification process and said tenders will be called afresh after revision of PC-I.
“We have cancelled pre-qualification process. Now after approval of the revised PC-I we will call fresh tenders,” said an officer of the PMU.
Under the project, over 500 new classrooms, three auditoriums, 39 laboratories, 17 libraries, 148 toilet blocks and servant rooms will be built. The project will be divided into three phases.
Under the first and major phase, civil work will be done. The second project worth Rs268 million for procurement of furniture will be launched before the start of the last phase worth Rs589 million for purchase of equipment, computers, solar panels etc.
A source in the ministry said the project would be completed in three years and for the fiscal year 2021-22, the previous government had earmarked Rs409 million, which had been released.
Officials in the ministry and the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE), which regulate public schools and colleges in Islamabad, said most school buildings were in a bad condition and needed to be renovated.
A working paper of FDE stated: “The project was prepared keeping in view the fact that FDE has mostly retained educational institutions handed over by the government of Punjab in 1973 and 1985.”
A substantial portion of these buildings is in a dilapidated condition requiring rehabilitation on a priority basis to ensure safety of the students in a conducive environment for quality education.
“Whereas annual repair and maintenance of buildings is a recurring feature of civil work, however, no funds are allocated to schools and colleges of FDE for maintenance their physical infrastructure,” the paper stated.
An official of the FDE said that the project should be carried out on a priority basis as there is a dire need for repair and maintenance of school buildings and provision of missing facilities.
“We are hopeful that this project will be launched soon,” he said.

TLP district emir Syed Sarwar Saifi told Dawn the polling staff removed their covering candidate from the polling station at about 9am and did not allow him to enter it. At about 3pm, the polling staff asked everyone to leave the polling station, telling them that the polling time had ended, he said and alleged that the staff then started stamping votes in favour of the PML-N candidate in the voting register by closing the station door. 
Sources in the district police claimed that the TLP men had broken the law and unauthorised persons had entered the polling station by scaling its boundary wall. 
Mr Saifi said when the TLP workers suspected foul play they tried to go inside the polling station to inspect the matter; however, the police officials forcibly stopped them from going inside. He alleged that when they finally succeeded in entering the station, they saw the presiding officer casting fake votes while the voting register was full of stamped votes for the PML-N candidate without the entry of the computerised national identity card (CNIC) numbers. 
Mr Saifi claimed that they had caught a man casting fake votes in favour of the PML-N, which could also be verified from the CCTV footage of the polling station. 
Meanwhile, the TLP also recorded video clips of the incident, claiming that the voting register was stamped with the PML-N election symbol without the entry of the CNIC and posted it on social media. The clips made rounds on social media within no time. 
Fakhar Sukhera, the spokesperson for Bahawalnagar chapter of the TLP, alleged the same tactic was also used at several other polling stations, including Merzeka and Tahliwala.  
Bahawalnagar District Police Officer Faisal Gulzar and DC Bahawalnagar reached the spot and held negotiations with the TLP leaders. They assured the office-bearers of the party that action would be taken against the police personnel and polling staff. 
The DPO’s spokesperson Shehzad Ishfaq told Dawn that the DPO was personally looking into the matter and free and fair elections would be ensured at any cost.  
A senior police official, requesting anonymity, told Dawn the TLP workers broke the law and issued threats to police officials deputed at the Pir Garh polling station. He said the TLP workers had broken into the polling station by scaling the walls of the polling station. He claimed that the register which the TLP workers claimed to be the voting register was just an ordinary register of voters’ biodata.

The RMC converted the amusement park named ‘Bachon ki Dunya’ into a parking lot. The park was earning Rs425,000 per month from contractors who had installed swings there.

The RMC had planned to charge visitors for parking of their vehicles in the space. But former mayor Sardar Naseem made it a free parking space for the visitors. However, after the end of his tenure in December 2021, the RMC closed the parking space.
A senior official of the RMC told Dawn: “We are working to use the land to facilitate the visitors and shopkeepers of the main market.”
He said there was also a plan to use roadsides around Commercial Market for parking and for the first time electronic parking system would be introduced there.
“The visitors will be given e-tickets which will also end the chances of car theft from the parking area,” he said.
However, he added that the change of the local government was the main reason behind the postponement of the plan. He said some civic body officials wanted to impose a parking fee due to which the project was still incomplete.
On Sunday, Commissioner Noorul Amin Mengal, who is also the administrator of RMC, took notice of the issue and asked the RMC to open the parking space for the public as soon as possible.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Mengal said he would ensure the parking area is open for the visitors.
“Free of cost parking facility will be provided to the visitors and a squad will be deployed to provide them a secure environment,” he said.
He said the CCTV cameras would also be installed in the parking area. Apart from this, the administration also plans to construct two parking plazas in the city to overcome the shortage of parking space.
He said the government wanted to improve business opportunities and parking plazas will be constructed in Raja Bazaar and other commercial areas.
