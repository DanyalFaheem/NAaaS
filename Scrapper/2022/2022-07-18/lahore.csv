2,Voters make their presence felt in political heartland,"Sporadic incidents of brawls, irritants reported in Lahore; confusion as voters move from pillar to post to poll their votes.","LAHORE: The crucial by-elections in the four constituencies in Lahore on Sunday saw a good turnout during smooth and peaceful polling, except for sporadic brawls and an exchange of allegations.  
A major complaint by several voters was that they were unable to find their votes at the polling stations mentioned in the Nadra message service. The voters remained confused and moved from pillar to post to poll their votes. Some others complained that the votes of members of their families had been divided between two constituencies.  
Until the polling concluded at 5pm, the PTI and PML-N leaders continued saying the the polling process was held peacefully and no major law and order scene was witnessed across the province. PML-N’s home minister Attaullah Tarar said the polling process across the province was held peacefully and no serious law and order situation was reported.  
PTI’s former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry, earlier in the day, said polling was held in a peaceful manner, except brawls at some places. He said people had come out of their homes in droves to ensure Pakistan got “real independence” from the rule of foreign masters.  

Sporadic incidents of brawls, irritants were reported

Till the filing of this report when results were still pouring in, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf was winning three out of four seats in Lahore. The PTI defeated two turncoats – Nazir Chohan in PP-167 and Chaudhry Amin Zulqernain in PP-170 as its candidates Shabbir Ahmad Gujjar and Zaheer Abbas Khokhar, respectively, emerged winners.  
The PTI also turned the tables in PP-158 as its candidate Mian Akram Usman defeated PML-N’s Rana Ahsan Sharafat who was fielded on the seat vacated by Abdul Aleem Khan for being a turncoat. Aleem Khan, who continued pitching himself as Punjab chief minister in the PTI government, could not help the PML-N save the seat, posing a threat to the Hamza Shehbaz government in Punjab.
The PTI lost only PP-168 seat where turncoat Asad Khokhar on PML-N ticket defeated PTI candidate Nawaz Awan with a large margin.  
As per court orders, the Punjab chief minister’s run-off election will be held in the Punjab Assembly on July 22.  
The PTI leaders expressed their glee over the initial results but stuck to its announced policy for the party workers and polling agents to ensure that no polling station’s votes should be left unguarded until getting signed official results on Form 45.  
As vote counting was in full swing in the evening, PTI chairman Imran Khan tweeted around 7.30pm that the party would be winning at least 15 out of 20 seats as results were pouring in. “But it is very important for all people on duty in all polling stations not to leave their posts till official results have been obtained from the Returning Officers.”  
PTI Secretary General Asad Umer also asked the polling agents to actively guard the votes at the polling stations until official results were given. “Don’t leave guarding votes while getting carried away with the early good results,” he warned.  
PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry in a media talk in the evening had also expressed his reservations that the law and order situation had started deteriorating around 3pm as a fierce fight took place in PP-158, while party leader Shahbaz Gill was arrested and police tried to arrest former minister Shibli Faraz and Zulfi Bukhari. He said he himself was attacked by a TLP worker and his vehicle’s hind screen was broken. “The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), however, did not take any action,” he said.  
As a PML-N worker alleged that PTI leader Jamshed Iqbal Cheema’s accomplices had injured him in a brawl in PP-158, the PTI leaders asserted that police continued acting against the PTI and arrested its workers from the election camps.

3,Media surveys draw ire of Qureshi,Claims the PML-N used govt funds and transfer and posting of officials to manipulate the results.,"MUZAFFARGARH:  The by-poll results may not be regarded as an upset as government  candidates were facing hard questions from voters during electioneering  in south Punjab for eight South Punjab seats. 
Dawn learned that  during campaigns PTI candidates exploited the hiked petroleum prices and  inflation to the constituents, mostly farmers and the rural class. All  contests were neck and neck but the mother of all contests, however, was  PP-217 by-polls, where PTI’s Zain Qureshi was in the face of PML-N’s  Salman Naeem.
During pre-election surveys by different TV  reporters and anchors, Mr Naeem was leading. But PTI Chairman Imran  Khan’s massive rally in Alipur on July 11 turned out to be a game  changer and it changed the whole scenario. Mr Qureshi won the seat with  46,963 votes while the runner-up Naeem ended up with 40,104 votes. The  constituency was the centre of attention for the media and politicians  because the PTI candidate was the son of party Vice Chairman Shah  Mehmood Qureshi. PPP leader and Opposition Leader in the Senate Yousaf  Raza Gilani and his sons took part in door-to-door electioneering for Mr  Naeem. In the sportsman spirit, Mr Naeem accepted his defeat and also  visited Mr Qureshi and congratulated him. 
Elsewhere, according to  unofficial results, PTI’s Moazzam Jatoi inflicted defeat on PML-N’s  Zehra Basit Bukhari in the election for PP-272. Next door, PP-272 in  Alipur and PP-282 in Layyah, also showed similar trends.
When the  results started trickling in, PTI workers gathered at the office of Mr  Qureshi and celebrations ensued. Addressing the crowd, Shah Mahmood  Qureshi criticised the Pakistan Democratic Movement parties and the PPP  for creating political instability in the country.  
He also  criticised the media analysts as “most of them declared the PML-N  favourite”. He said the PML-N used government funds and transfer and  posting of government officials to manipulate the results but such  tactics failed. He also remembered slain prime minister Benazir Bhutto  and paid tribute to her struggle against tyrant forces, adding that the  legacy of Bhuttos had been ruined by Asif Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto  Zardari. He said the PPP was begging for seat adjustment with other  parties. He also praised Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, saying his agenda was  nationalistic and realistic. He said Mr Khan is standing alone and he is  capable of defeating the PDM and other forces. He said Mr Gilani and  his sons tried to defeat his son but failed. He said PML-N’s Abid Sher  Ali used dirty language against him during electioneering. Abid stayed  in Multan for several days and monitored elections on a daily basis.

7,Punjab Notes: Monsoon rains: absence and excess add to woes,"Rain in simplest terms is water in the shape of drops, sheets or hails falling from the sky. More than 70 per cent ...","Rain in simplest terms is water in the shape of drops, sheets or hails falling from the sky. More than 70 per cent of our earth’s surface is water-covered. Perhaps that’s why in many ancient cultures we find the idea that life originated from water.  
In Rig-Veda (composed by sages in the Punjab /1700-1500 BCE) we come across creation hymn (Mantra): “Then even nothingness was not, nor existence / There was no air then nor the heavens beyond it / What covered it? / Where was it? / In whose keeping? / Was there then cosmic water, in depth unfathomed? -- At first there was only darkness wrapped in darkness / All this was only unilluminated water… (Rig-Veda 10-129- Translation: A.L.Basham)”.  
We find a similar thought in the Middle Eastern religious literature. “In the beginning God created heavens and the earth / Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters…”, says the Bible.  
Ionian philosopher Thales (about 624 BC -547 BC) propounded the hypothesis that life originated from a single material substance and it was water.
The idea made sense, at least in those times, when science was in its mere infancy. Life without water was as impossible then as it’s today. Sources of water are sea, rains, rivers and aquifers. Sea water can neither be used as drinking water nor be funneled for irrigation purposes because it is saline. Having salt and other inorganic and organic materials it’s hardly suitable for human life. With advancement in technology, it has now become possible to turn saline water into freshwater which means it can be made drinkable and useable in agriculture through the process of desalination.  
Sea regardless of the composition of its water is a crucial source of water we have on our earth. Water in seas evaporates and goes up and turns into clouds. Cloud heavy with moisture rain. Water from clouds falling on high mountains turns into snow and ice. When temperature rises, the ice melts creating streams and rivers that usually rush into seas. Such is the natural cycle that keeps the earth and us literally hydrated. Rain plays an important role in this cycle especially in the regions with high temperatures such as ours which has an annual season of heavy summer rains called monsoon. Interestingly, the winds that bring annual monsoon rains to us come from Africa. If monsoon fails, we face calamitous situation. Agriculture suffers and livestock have to endure malnutrition and disease due to lack of grass and fodder. Such a situation or prospect of such a situation created piles of myths, rituals and folk beliefs.  
In ancient times Indra and Varuna were gods of sky, rain and thunder. If monsoon is delayed, certain rituals were/ are performed in the subcontinent to propitiate the concerned gods. Priests, for example, would assemble and perform Varuna Yajna by immersing themselves in the tubs of water and chanting name of god Varuna as a passionate prayer for rain.  
In Punjab we have its watered-down folk version. One can still witness in rural areas, at least, the practice of throwing buckets or jugs of water without any warning on men in an effort to appeal to the heavens to be kind and release the rains. 
When monsoon rains come, they completely transform the visual landscape: earth comes suddenly alive and things turns lush green with their innumerable hues. Baba Farid, the grand saint and poet, equates the month with lightning and rumblings of clouds (Sawan bijlian)”.  
Poet Shah Hussain hints at the transformation: “(Month of) Sawan with its colours has arrived; one can gaze at vistas of grass and water”. Birds gasping for breath after a long spell of unbearable heat, feel invigorated and fresh with the onset of the rainy month. Air is filled with so many bird songs and happy whistling of insects. It’s kind of a rebirth. This is perhaps what has haunted the poets and sages. “Raindrops raise their melody, listen you sister, Sawan is upon us”, is how Baba Guru Nanak welcomes the arrival of rain. Relief after searing heat lightens the mood and makes romantic and erotic impulses surge. “Throughout the month of Sawan the rain songs tinkle / Suffering inflicted by mischief-makers vanish/ Boys play and girls sing / And my handsome man of pleasure comes to my place/ My wishes have come true”, says Bulleh Shah in his poem on seasons.  
The most spectacular display of change can be experienced in an apparently lifeless desert which within hours of receiving rain becomes full of colour with fresh leaves sprouting from the bushes and birds fluttering along the dunes.  
Poet Khawaja Ghulam Farid graphically paints the scene of the desert called Rohi: “Monsoon rain falls on Rohi /Turn your camel back, my love / lightening illuminates the sky with its colours / raindrops land softly / Dark and grey clouds carry raging torrents/ Rolls of thunder sing of love /…Dunes and plains are wet and ponds overflow / …Easterly wind is pleasant and cold drops sound like songs / Koel, cuckoo and lark raise their make passionate noise for union”. Strangely, the predicament of our under-developed society is that it hasn’t learnt the art of managing things with poise and good feeling. We feel flustered when there is no rain because we don’t prepare ourselves to face a drought but we also feel flustered when there is rain because we don’t prepare ourselves to deal with the excess water.  
Monsoon/Sawan too has a contradictory nature which is best explained by a popular anecdote. Emperor Akbar, the Great, asked Birbal, a well-known wit at his court, which was the best season. “The month of Sawan”, came the reply. “And which is the worst?”, asked the Emperor. “The month of Sawan”. “Why it’s so?” “Your Majesty, it is the best if it’s windy. And it is the worst if it’s windless”. Windy or windless, don’t forget to enjoy your ‘Puraa (a kind of flat sweet cake made of meal which marks the celebration of monsoon) this Sawan. And please avoid banging your head against the wall if you come to know that even this monsoon no one is geared up for rainwater harvesting. — soofi01@hotmail.com

8,"Gill arrested, Qureshi served ECP notice on tense day","MUZAFFARGARH: It was a tense day for voters and police officials in the by-poll constituencies of PP-217 in Multan,...","MUZAFFARGARH: It was a tense day for voters and police officials in the by-poll constituencies of PP-217 in Multan, PP-272 and PP-273 in Muzaffargarh and PP-282 in Layyah on Sunday. The police arrested Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Shehbaz Gill in Jatoi for resisting police and keeping FC guards, while in Multan, PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi got a notice from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for ‘raiding’ a factory in the by-poll constituency. 
Tensions prevailed in Jatoi tehsil of Muzaffargarh where the police arrested Mr Gill who was present to oversee polling activities on behalf of the party. The police raided a cotton factory where Mr Gill was present with armed guards in the Frontier Constabulary (FC) uniform and arrested him. He alleged he was arrested without a warrant, and before the arrest, he was detained for three hours. He said the police action only aimed at wasting his time. The police, however, said they raided the place to send FC guards back to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A local police DSP said they were taking action on the orders of the ECP. 
An ECP statement said they ordered Gill’s arrest for violating sections 15 and 16 of the election code and that he was creating the law and order situation.
PTI workers and Mr Gill’s guards also resisted the police. Before his arrest, Shehbaz Gill was very active at polling stations. He said polling agents were expelled from polling station Nos 44 and 46 by the polling staff. Later, an ECP statement denied charges. Muzaffargarh Deputy Commissioner Ali Annan Qamar and DPO Tariq Willayat also sent their personal staff to check the status of FC guards. 
PTI candidate Moazzam Khan Jatoi alleged the police arrested his supporters and but the ECP and the DPO did not take any action. In Basti Ramzan, PTI and PML-N supporters fought each other where PML-N supporters Allah Wasaya, brother of a sitting DPO, and former PPP ticket holder Jameel Shah were allegedly polling fake votes for PML-N candidate Zehra Basit Bukhari. The Shah Jamal police arrested both and released them when learned that one of them was the brother of a DPO. They were released after they furnished a surety bond.
In Multan, the ECP issued notice to PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi for ‘raiding’ a factory in the PP-217 constituency. The ECP asked him to explain the raid within a day. Mr Qureshi alleged workers had been detained inside the factory to favour PML-N candidates. 
He alleged some election polling staff was busy stamping ballots in favour of the PML-N candidate. The ECP denied the allegations. 
At polling station No 14, some women complained that the polling staff forced them to vote for the PML-N candidate. PTI workers gather outside the polling station and protested against the staff.

9,Doctors’ appointment at Services flies in the face of by-poll code,ECP takes notice on monitoring officer’s complaint,"LAHORE: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has taken notice of blatant violation committed by the Punjab Health Department by making appointment of ad hoc doctors at the Services Hospital despite a ban imposed by the ECP due to by-elections.  
The ECP acted when Punjab Specialized Healthcare & Medical Education Department Secretary Ali Jan violated the code of conduct, made ad hoc appointments of the 27 doctors and issued a notification for ‘political gains’. 
An official said he had ‘accommodated’ some office-bearers of the Young Doctors Association (YDA), Punjab, to get support for the ruling PML-N in the by-elections as they had been terminated from service during the PTI tenure in the province. He said then Punjab chief minister, Usman Buzdar, had terminated some doctors of the Services Hospital following an inquiry report which was launched when a young patient, Hamid, died due to alleged negligence of the medics.  
According to the inquiry report, the on-duty doctors had declared the patient “received dead” by allegedly changing his admission record while the CCTV footage later showed him entering the hospital on foot. Responding to the protest launched by the relatives and attendants of the deceased patient, some YDA men gathered there from various wards of the hospital and allegedly tortured them too.  

ECP takes notice on monitoring officer’s complaint

The official said the health department also ignored the qualified and experienced doctors who had conducted postgraduate training at the Services Hospital and preferred those who mattered in ‘political agitations’ and the motive was to win their support for the ruling elite.  
He said the health department appointed those having degrees from China’s medical colleges, ignoring those qualified and experienced doctors who graduated from local government medical institutes. Similarly, a majority of them were those who were key office-bearers of the YDA, including its Punjab chapter president, showing the scale of favouritism.  
The official said two YDA Punjab associations were operating in the public sector teaching institutions and other hospitals of the province. The health department accommodated one of these in the ad hoc appointments by adopting the policy of ‘divide and rule’, the official said.  
He further added that two former senior health officers who sit these days in the Chief Minister Secretariat also played a key role in these appointments. These two officers had been very close to the particular group of the YDA Punjab during the tenure of the PTI in the province, the official said, and claimed that Chief Minister Hamza Shahbaz was kept in the dark about violations by the health authorities.  
However, the immediate issue that had drawn the attention of the ECP towards appointment of 27 medics at the Services Hospital was “sheer violation” of the ban imposed by the ECP, he said.  
Lahore District Monitoring Officer (DMO) Adnan Iqbal brought this matter to the notice of the ECP late on Saturday. In a separate letter the same day, he also asked health secretary Ali Jan to withdraw the appointments of the medics forthwith.  
“This is contradictory to the direction issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan which clearly illustrates no government or authority shall post or transfer any officer in the district where schedule for by-elections has been issued on May 25, 2022 till the publication of name of returned candidate,” says a letter by the DMO.  
Punjab Health Secretary Ali Jan was not available for comment despite repeated attempts to get his version on the issue.

shared a video clip of the incident on the Twitter handle of Punjab inspector general of police (IGP).
The woman, Batool Ali, while sharing the video clip of the harassment incident, wrote on Twitter that she was travelling in a rickshaw near the local City Girl’s High School when a masked man riding a motorcycle started harassing her and making obscene gestures.

TLP district emir Syed Sarwar Saifi told Dawn the polling staff removed their covering candidate from the polling station at about 9am and did not allow him to enter it. At about 3pm, the polling staff asked everyone to leave the polling station, telling them that the polling time had ended, he said and alleged that the staff then started stamping votes in favour of the PML-N candidate in the voting register by closing the station door. 
Sources in the district police claimed that the TLP men had broken the law and unauthorised persons had entered the polling station by scaling its boundary wall. 
Mr Saifi said when the TLP workers suspected foul play they tried to go inside the polling station to inspect the matter; however, the police officials forcibly stopped them from going inside. 
He alleged that when they finally succeeded in entering the station, they saw the presiding officer casting fake votes while the voting register was full of stamped votes for the PML-N candidate without the entry of the computerised national identity card (CNIC) numbers. 
Mr Saifi claimed that they had caught a man casting fake votes in favour of the PML-N, which could also be verified from the CCTV footage of the polling station. 
Meanwhile, the TLP also recorded video clips of the incident, claiming that the voting register was stamped with the PML-N election symbol without the entry of the CNIC and posted it on social media. The clips made rounds on social media within no time. 
Fakhar Sukhera, the spokesperson for Bahawalnagar chapter of the TLP, alleged the same tactic was also used at several other polling stations, including Merzeka and Tahliwala.  
Bahawalnagar District Police Officer Faisal Gulzar and DC Bahawalnagar reached the spot and held negotiations with the TLP leaders. They assured the office-bearers of the party that action would be taken against the police personnel and polling staff. 
The DPO’s spokesperson Shehzad Ishfaq told Dawn that the DPO was personally looking into the matter and free and fair elections would be ensured at any cost.  
A senior police official, requesting anonymity, told Dawn the TLP workers broke the law and issued threats to police officials deputed at the Pir Garh polling station. He said the TLP workers had broken into the polling station by scaling the walls of the polling station. He claimed that the register which the TLP workers claimed to be the voting register was just an ordinary register of voters’ biodata. 
While sharing a video clip with Dawn, the officer further said the TLP men could be seen shouting at police personnel and pushing a senior police official at the said station. 
He added that last September, all the TLP men who had kidnapped three police officials and injured 21 during their sit-in in the Qadri Mill area were let off the hook.
