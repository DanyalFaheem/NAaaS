Her poetry is believed to...","LALLESHWARI, also known as Lalla Arifa, was a 14th-century woman mystic poet from Kashmir. Her poetry is believed to be among the earliest verses in Kashmiri language.
Aside from her mystic thoughts, she once wrote of her motherland Kashmir and what she said can roughly be translated as:
We were here and shall remain, The sun may keep rising and setting, But we shall remain and shall engulf the times.
Quoting these lines in his editorial, Dr Zafar Husain Zafar, chief editor of Arqam, has put them in perspective of today’s Kashmir: deprived of special status and rights but steadfast and determined to take it back. Dr Zafar says that though Kashmiris have been suffering for centuries at the hands of marauders but beneath the ashes the embers of freedom never died, nor will they now after India’s 2019 revocation of Article 370.
Arqam is an Urdu language literary journal published from Rawlakot, Azad Kashmir. Launched in 2007, the journal has been struggling all along but has been kept afloat by a team of determined editors. The current issue, dated June 2022, is a special one on Kashmir. It has been published against the backdrop of what India did in 2019.
On August 15, 2019, Articles 370 and 35a of Indian constitution were revoked, dealing a fatal blow to basic rights of millions of Kashmiris. The Article 370 of Indian constitution grants the state of Jammu and Kashmir a special autonomous status within the Indian Union. As a result of this constitutional provision, Jammu and Kashmir had its own constitution, enacted in 1956.
The Article 35a of Indian constitution allowed the state of Jammu and Kashmir to define and decide the ‘permanent residents’ of the state. Some special rights and privileges were attached to ‘permanent residency’. These privileges included employment, scholarship and right to own and buy property in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
BBC, while reporting the controversial step of revoking these constitutional Articles, said on its website on August 5, 2019, that “Top leaders have been put under house arrest, public meetings have been banned and reports say mobile networks and internet have been restricted”.
The current issue of Arqam is an endeavour to draw the attention of powers that be to the mass violation of human rights in Indian occupied Kashmir and to highlight the history, culture, language and literature of Kashmir. 
There are seven sections and they deal with: Kashmir’s history, the freedom movement, language and literature, tourism and culture. Remaining two sections include letters of some well-known personalities that discuss Kashmir. 
In this section some letters by Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, addressed to well-known Kashmiris have also been included. The last section offers book reviews and one of the pieces in this portion retells the history of Shiraza, a magazine launched by Jammu and Kashmir Academy of Art, Culture and Languages, Srinagar, in 1964. It is published in several languages including Kashmir’s local languages.
Some of the articles included in Arqam proffer some profound understanding and insight on Kashmir, its history and culture. 
For instance, on history of Kashmir, articles by Ilmuddin Salik, Masood Ahmed Khan, Dr Mumtaz Ahmed and some others tell us how Kashmir was taken over by different powers in different eras and what has happened in the region over the centuries, providing the readers with necessary knowledge to understand the Kashmir issue that has been a bone of contention between Pakistan and India since the independence in 1947.
The journal’s portion on Kashmiris’ struggle and movement for freedom also offers some valuable articles. For instance, Irshad Mahmood in his article has narrated the whole story of Jammu and Kashmir conflict through the years 1947 to 1990. Dr Rafiuddin Hashmi’s article pays tribute to Syed Ali Gilani, who never forgot, says Dr Hashmi, Pakistan and Islam in his struggle for Kashmir’s freedom.
Interestingly, the portion on tourism offers some scholarly pieces on travels to Kashmir taken in distant and recent by some well-known figures, such as Mian Muhammad Bakhsh, Munshi Ameen Chand and Maulana Ghulam Rasool Mehr.
A team of editors — that includes Fayyaz Naqi, Ejaz Naqi and Muhammad Saeed, headed by Dr Zafar Husain Zafar — deserves kudos for bringing out a compact issue on Kashmir.
Their message is: Kashmiris will survive and remain forever, as said Lalleshwari, the sun may set on occupying forces but Kashmiris will rise and take the reign of time in their hands, for you can imprison the bodies but cannot suppress the soul.

7,Pakistani delegation visits Kabul today to discuss trade issues,Delegation will hold talks with Afghan authorities on how to streamline coal supplies on permanent basis.,"ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani delegation is paying a 3-day (July 18-20) visit to Kabul for negotiations with the interim Afghan government for resolution of trade, transit and transportation issues facing the two sides, including night-time operations of border facilities for coal imports.
The delegation will be led by Secretary Commerce Sualeh Ahmed Faruqui and comprise senior officials of the ministries of power, interior, commerce and the Federal Board of Revenue and National Logistics Cell — the state-run logistic fleet operator, a statement issued by the Ministry of Commerce said on Sunday.
“Bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, transit, transport facilitation and border facilitation will be discussed during the meetings between Pakistani and Afghan officials in Kabul”, the Ministry of Commerce said, adding that issues being faced by traders in bilateral and transit trade between the two countries will also be discussed during the talks.
The meeting is a continuation of an ongoing process of bilateral engagements between Pakistan and Afghanistan in the fields of trade, transit, connectivity and economic cooperation, it added.
Pakistan decided a couple of days ago to relax trade conditions with Afghanistan, including barter trade and transactions in Pakistani rupee and wants border facilities to operate round the clock to facilitate coal imports from Afghanistan throughout the night. At present, trade facilities at border points operate only during day time and most of the time is consumed in movement of people and import of Afghan fruits and vegetables into Pakistan.
The federal cabinet on Friday approved amendments in Paragraph 3(1) of the Import Policy Order 2022 to allow import of goods of Afghan origin against Pak rupee and without the requirement of Importers Electronic I-Form (EIF) forms for a period of one year. However, Afghan exporters will provide a Certificate of Origin issued by Afghan Customs proving that the goods have originated from Afghanistan. 
The decision was taken in view of political and economic situation in Afghanistan. The absence of formal banking infrastructure transactions had badly impacted the trade between the two countries. Afghanistan would benefit from the relaxation that has already been in place for 14 items since April 14 this year to facilitate Afghan traders exporting fruits to Pakistan.
Also, on the request of the World Food Programme (WFP) of the United Nations, Pakistan has made a reservation of 120,000 tonnes of wheat for Afghanistan from the imported wheat stock of PASSCO on the latest import price in view of the situation in the brotherly neighbour and on humanitarian ground.
The amount of supplied wheat along with cost and incidentals would be charged in US dollar. The wheat will be locally ground into flour and supplied to Afghanistan by WFP, subject to relaxation of ban on the export of flour to the extent of the instant proposal of 120,000 tonnes of wheat, an official announcement said.   
Earlier this month, Pakistan started importing coal from Afghanistan for its power plants, particularly 1,320MW Sahiwal Coal Power Project in Punjab in view of record making coal prices in the international market.
Power Minister Engineer Khurram Dastgir Khan had reported on July 7 that a major progress on import of coal from Afghanistan had been made and 1,320MW Sahiwal Coal Power Project had reached an agreement with a private Afghan entity for coal supplies with active facilitation of Pakistan and Afghan governments. According to the power minister, another 1,320MW China-Hubco Coal Power Plant was in negotiation for the procurement of Afghan coal.
Mr Khan had, however, declined to share the details of the agreement, saying these would become public once these were submitted to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) for tariff approval. The minister had confirmed that the Afghan government had increased duty on coal export from $90 to $200 per tonne and still it was cheaper than international imports from elsewhere as coal prices had gone beyond $400 per tonne from $90 a few months ago. He said that the best thing was that the trade would be in Pak rupee which will help the government in saving foreign exchange.
The Pakistani delegation will hold discussions with Afghan authorities on how to streamline coal supplies on permanent basis and would request the interim Afghan government to ensure round-the-clock border operations to ensure uninterrupted coal supplies, particularly in the night. The delegation would also raise the issue of incre­ased duties on coal supplies to Pakistan.

8,Audio clip makes PML-N MPA Jalil Ahmed Sharaqpuri’s resignation ‘controversial’,Clip purportedly featuring Sheikh Rashid mentioning a “payment” to Sharaqpuri goes viral on social media.,"ISLAMABAD: A day after disgruntled Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) MPA Jalil Ahmed Sharaqpuri resigned from the assembly, an audio clip purportedly featuring Awami Muslim League (AML) chief Sheikh Rashid mentioning a “payment” to Mr Sharaqpuri went viral on social media on Sunday. 
Mr Sharaqpuri, the disgruntled PML-N legislator, along with MPA Faisal Khan Niazi had resigned from Punjab Assembly a day before crucial Punjab by-polls which were held on Sunday. 
In a video statement, Mr Sharaqpuri leader rejected the impression that he had received the money in exchange for his resignation and alleged that Sheikh Rashid was a “crook who was not sincere with PTI chief Imran Khan”.  
It may be mentioned that Mr Sharaqpuri was among the lawmakers who were expelled by PML-N Punjab president Rana Sanaullah in October 2020. He, however, had returned to the party’s fold in July this year following a meeting with Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz.
The audio clip featured Sheikh Rashid and another person named Gul Zaman who, as per the clip, appeared to be a resident of Lahore. During the conversation, Mr Rashid said that a “payment had been made to Sharaqpuri yesterday”. He did not mention the purpose of the payment, though.
Mr Zaman urged the AML chief to exercise caution on the telephone. But the former interior minister did not see any reason to be discreet. “I am not talking to India; what is the situation in the city? Rashid responded, asking Mr Zaman about the political situation ahead of by-polls.

PTI Central Punjab Information Secretary Musarat Jamshed told media that the incident occurred when Fawad was visiting the polling stations to inspect the polling process along with former finance minister Shaukat Tareen. 
She alleged that attackers broke the window shields of Fawad’s vehicle who luckily remained unhurt. 
Scuffles also broke out between political workers outside a polling station in the PP-158 constituency of Lahore. 
Following this, the ECP issued directives to the district returning officer (DRO) to inspect the location and receive a briefing from security officials when PTI workers claimed that they were not allowed to enter the polling station.

10,Imran’s statement on media freedom flies in face of reality: PFUJ,Describes Imran's claim of not having any hand in stifling media as against facts and reality.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) has described the statement of former prime minister Imran Khan claiming that he did not have any hand in stifling the media as against facts and reality.
In a statement issued on Sunday, PFUJ President Shahzada Zulfiqar and Secretary General Nasir Zaidi said Mr Khan’s tenure would go down in the history of Pakistani media as one of the darkest chapters. 
The two leaders said that under Mr Khan’s rule, journalists were beaten up, assassination attempts were made on critical journalists and several anchors lost their jobs for merely criticising the regime, which financially strangulated the media industry by stopping their ads and withholding ad dues. 
Mr Zulfiqar and Mr Zaidi observed that media persons were also implicated in fake cases and the editor in chief of Jang Group, Mir Shakilur Rahman, was imprisoned for several months on trumped-up charges. 
“If the memory of the former prime minister is not strong enough to remember the incidents that happened during his tenure, we would like to remind him that Matiullah Jan was abducted in broad daylight, senior journalist Absar Alam was shot at by unknown attackers, armed men entered the residence of Asad Toor beating him up brutally besides hurling threats at him and character assassination campaigns of anchor Asma Shirazi, Gharida Farouqi and other female media persons were also a routine during his tenure,” they said. 
They also observed that it was not only attacks that were carried out against journalists, but the government of Imran Khan also tried to amend the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act, which was challenged in court and the government had to face embarrassment. 
Mr Khan’s administration also tried to establish the Pakistan Media Development Authority to stifle all critical voices and create problems for the media industry, but it could not succeed because of the heroic struggle of the media community, they said. 
Therefore, Mr Khan could not exonerate himself from all the draconian steps that were taken against the media and journalists right under his nose, the two leaders concluded.
They observed that this was all in the knowledge of Imran Khan and his ministers, who defended curbs on the media claiming that controlling the media was important. 
The PFUJ leaders said Mr Khan could not claim innocence by distorting facts and hiding reality. 
“He should rather reflect upon the attitude of PTI workers towards media persons and make efforts to rein in his supporters who are still carrying out a lethal propaganda against journalists,” they said.

11,Raza Rabbani blames PTI for increased establishment role in govt affairs,Says civilian space ceded to the military during previous government’s tenure was “unprecedented”.,"ISLAMABAD: While holding the previous PTI government responsible for “an increased role” of the establishment in government’s affairs, PPP leader and former Senate Chairman Mian Raza Rabbani said that the civilian space ceded to the military during previous government’s tenure was “unprecedented”. 
In a statement released on Sunday, the PPP leader said that historically, civil-military relations have been heavily tilted towards the military, but the PTI government “was a government of the establishment, for the establishment and by the establishment”. 
He claimed that during the PTI-led government, Parlia­ment was controlled by “others” rather than the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker. 
“Motions, questions and other tools of parliamentary oversight were vetted by ‘the others’ rather than parliament’s staff,” Mr Rabbani alleged. 
He claimed that members’ presence in Parliament during voting on vital issues was ensured by the establishment. 
“Crucial decisions pertaining to or discussions on national security and foreign policy were taken outside Parliament,” he added. 
The establishment had a role in all major decisions and there was a greater militarisation of civilian institutions, Mr Rabbani alleged. 
He also said that the PTI-led coalition government was kept intact by the establishment.  
He said that during the previous government, 25 autonomous or semi-autonomous bodies and organisations were headed by retired or serving officers of the armed forces. 
While emphasising the need to address this disequilibrium, Mr Rabbani proposed three actions. 
“Firstly, all political parties should agree on a second Charter of Democracy. Secondly, all institutions functioning under or through the Constitution should respect the trichotomy of power as envisaged in the Constitution. Thirdly, an economic agenda [should be chalked out]. This will require an intra-institutional dialogue and Parliament should assume its role and set this process into motion,” Mr Rabbani said 
This statement came a day after PTI Chairman Imran Khan deplored the imbalance in civil-military relations and blamed previous the PPP and PML-N governments for ceding space to the army to `save their skin` in corruption cases. 
Addressing a seminar on freedom of expression, the former prime minister said because of this imbalance, a situation has developed that [now] the establishment isn’t realising [the consequences of] the actions it is taking. He was referring to a crackdown against his party following his ouster as a result of the no-confidence motion.

12,15-member body formed to oversee next-gen spectrum auction,"Headed by Miftah, auction advisory committee includes four other ministers and GHQ, ISI representatives .","ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet has constituted a 15-member auction advisory committee to oversee spectrum auctions for next-generation mobile services (NGMS). 
The committee — led by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail and comprising four other federal ministers, three federal secretaries and representatives from other telecom stakeholders, including the General Headquarters (GHQ) and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) — was constituted by the federal cabinet last weekend.
The committee would be responsible for examining and evaluating the market assessment report and spectrum demand and supply and recommendations of Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) for the release of available spectrum for NGMS in Pakistan.
The committee would also be required to examine and finalise the policy directive for the federal government for the release of the NGMS spectrum in Pakistan and oversee the spectrum auction and release process to be conducted by the PTA.

Headed by Miftah, auction advisory committee includes four other ministers and GHQ, ISI representatives  

Informed sources said the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication had proposed four federal ministers for the committee — including the finance minister as its chairman and three other ministers — for information technology, economic affairs and science and technology.
However, the nomination of the minister for science and technology was replaced and instead two more ministers — for power and commerce — were included in the auction advisory committee on the recommendations of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet.
Other members of the committee include secretaries for finance, IT and law divisions besides the PTA chairman, executive director of the Frequency Allocation Board, a representative of GHQ, technical director general of ISI, legal and telecom members of the IT ministry and any other person that the committee may wish to co-opt.
The spectrum auctions for NGMS in Pakistan were conducted in 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2021 under the policy directives issued by the federal government.
Consequently, the paired spectrum of 30 megahertz in the 1900/2100 MHz band, 29MHz in 1800MHz band and 10MHz in 850MHz band was auctioned and assigned to cellular mobile operators.
In October 2020, the government constituted an auction advisory committee to release the next-generation mobile services spectrum in Pakistan for improving mobile Broadband services amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which was later revised in March 2021 to include a representative of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan in the committee.
The IT and telecom ministry issued the policy directive on Aug 4 last year, after the federal cabinet ratified the decision of the ECC to approve the committee’s policy recommendations.
Subsequently, the PTA completed the spectrum auction process with the help of an internationally reputed consultant — Frontier Economics — in September.
The Pak Telecom Mobile Limited (PTML/Ufone) acquired 2x9MHz in the 1800 MHz band for 15 years while there was no bid for the offered spectrum in the 2100MHz band.
The IT ministry proposed that to increase the capacity and improve service quality, the federal government should issue a policy directive to undertake a spectrum auction under Section 8(2) of the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-Organisation) Act 1996 to offer the available frequency bands to all interested new and existing operators in an open, transparent and competitive manner. Therefore, the cabinet approved the constitution of a new auction advisory committee.
