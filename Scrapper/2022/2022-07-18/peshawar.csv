1,KP health dept to outsource over 50 more hospitals to private firms,The move is meant to improve patient care and ensure availability of staff.,"PESHAWAR: The health department has decided to outsource 58 more hospitals to private organisations to improve patients’ care through availability of human resources and medicines besides ensuring maintenance and provision of equipment and strengthening emergency services in these facilities.
The hospitals, to be outsourced, have been identified by a nomination and recommendation committee headed by Dr Shaheen Afridi, the director-general health service Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The committee took into consideration data of district health information system (DHIS) and Independent Monitoring Unit (IMU) against the targets of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) to identify underperforming health facilities and subsequently recommended their outsourcing.
“This is important to consider the far flung and hard-to-reach areas for outsourcing so that the health services are made available to entire population of the province,” said officials.
They said that in the existing system, the patients suffered in hospitals due to out-of-order machines needed for investigation, absenteeism of staff, supplies of medicines and administrative issues whereas the contracted out facilities were operated by private firms, which ensured maintenance of equipment for uninterrupted investigations, attendance of staff and availability of medicines.

The move meant to improve patients’ care and ensure availability of staff

They said that another important factor, being focused, was the improvement in the quality of care in the outsourced facilities. For the purpose, staff training, display of standards and protocols, robust monitoring and taking patients’ feedback have been made an integral part of this partnership.
Officials said that the facilities outsourced to private companies under Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public-Private Partnership Act by the Health Foundation (HF) because of their poor performance showed improvement.
The outsourced facilities are still under the control of health department but the administration is shifted to private parties, which work under the relevant district health officers (DHOs) and hospital review committees (RMCs). Headed by DHO, the RMC in a district is consisted of medical superintendent, additional deputy commissioner, project director of private firm, representative of district account office and district specialist co-opted member.
The committee, holds its meting within three months, provides oversight and review progress at local level whereas HF and IMU monitor these outlets at the provincial level.
Officials said that they were working on the plan and within few weeks, 58 health facilities in different districts would be advertised for outsourcing. They said that Expression of Interest (EoI) documents was being finalized. They added that most of the health facilities, being outsourced, included Type D hospitals besides few Type C and Type B.
A comparative assessment report released early this year shows that 19 health facilities outsourced to private firms one and two years ago have shown improvement as compared to the non-outsourced ones. The previously contracted out facilities are located in South and North Waziristan, Kohistan, Bajaur, Kurram, Khyber, Orakzai and Chitral districts.
The assessment, conducted by third party in 2021, covered each parameter of service delivery and noted that most of the services were available in both the outsourced and non-outsourced hospitals. Seven facilities including four non-outsourced and three outsourced were inspected for the assessment.
According to the report, the non-outsourced Category-D hospital in Gara Tajik, Peshawar, and Category-D hospital in Razmak, North Waziristan, did not have emergency and in-patients services. Only general OPD was available at Razmak hospital, with only one medical officer at the time of the assessment.
The bed occupancy rate of outsourced facilities was 22 per cent as compared to the 18 per cent of non-outsourced hospitals. The non-outsourced health farcicalities inspected for the assessment included district headquarters hospitals of Lakki Marwat.

6,PHC seeks report on handing over of assets to Mardan city govt,Bench also orders govt to furnish details of vehicles in possession of DCs.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has directed the provincial government to submit a report about steps taken by it for implementing the judgment wherein it had directed to hand over assets of the former Mardan district government to the city government.
A two-member bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Abdul Shakoor also again sought details from the provincial government about the official vehicles in possession of deputy commissioners in the province and their entitlement thereto.
The bench issued the order while hearing a contempt petition filed by Mardan city mayor Himayatullah Mayar against non-implementation of a judgment of the court delivered on March 17, 2022, wherein it had ordered the government to hand over assets of the former district governments to tehsil governments.
Few days ago, the court had ordered the government to hand over the relevant office to the city mayor, but that order had also not been implemented.

Bench also orders govt to furnish details of vehicles in possession of DCs 

Advocate Babar Khan Yousafzai appeared for the petitioner and stated that despite clear cut order of the court, the respondents including the local government department and Mardan district administration had not handed over the office of former district nazim to the Mardan city mayo and as such they had committed further contempt of court.
An assistant advocate general, Barrister Babar Shehzad Imran, said that the grievances of the petitioner would be addressed in the light of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Act, 2013 amended in 2022. He added that the issue had been taken up by the deputy commissioner with the provincial government.
He stated that KP Advocate General Shumail Ahmad Butt, who had earlier appeared before the court in like matters, would argue the case also. He added that as the advocate general had gone to perform Haj, therefore, the case may be adjourned till his arrival.
The bench decided to adjourn the hearing till July 26 with the direction to the assistant advocate general to file a report on the behalf of government, showing therein the steps taken by it to address the petitioner’s grievances and that to what extent the judgment of the high court of March 17 had been implemented in letter and spirit.
During the previous hearing, the court had also sought details about official vehicles in possession of deputy commissioners and their entitlement under the law. As the details were not submitted, the bench ordered the assistant advocate general to submit the same before the next hearing.
The secretary of local government, Syed Zaheerul Islam, the deputy commissioner of Mardan, Habibullah Arif, and the additional deputy commissioner, Samiur Rehman, also turned up in the case.
Babar Khan Yousafzai stated that so far the moveable and immovable properties of the former district government had not been handed over to the elected local government.
He stated that in March, the high court had ordered the government to hand over assets of the former district governments to tehsil governments and to issue the required notification within 10 days.
He said the government had produced a notification claiming that all assets of local councils had been handed over to the local governments. The lawyer, however, contended that the notification had not been implemented.
He said the offices of the city council had been occupied by district administration as well as chairman of the district development advisory committee due to which office had not been provided to mayor.
Mr Yousafzai claimed that the vehicles, which should be under the control of the mayor, had been given to the administrative officers.

In another such action carried out in Naran, the police seized many rafts being sailed illegally in the river by youngsters, putting their lives in danger. 
“We have launched a crackdown on youngsters swimming and taking bath in Kunhar River putting their lives in danger,” DSP Siraj Khan told mediapersons on Sunday. 
He said that police parties paid surprise visits to the riversides and arrested several persons under section 188 of the CrPC. 

Naran police seize rafts sailed illegally in Kunhar River 

“We are also warning tourists to stay away from the riversides and keep their children away from water and taking selfies,” he said. 
The DSP said the crackdown would be continued during the monsoon season as the Kunhar River and local streams swelled suddenly and could be dangerous at times for the visitors. 
“We have also warned the hoteliers who created recreational points alongside Kunhar River to abide by the ban and don’t allow tourists to go near the water,” Mr Khan said. 
The district administration had last week banned swimming and taking bath in the local streams. 
A police party also seized many rafts being sailed illegally in Kunhar River and handed them over to the Kaghan Development Authority. 
According to the police, the river rafting in monsoon could result in fatal accidents and as such rafting was also banned. 
TRANSPORT FARES: Transporters here are reluctant to slash fares after the price of compressed natural gas, which was increased by CNG stations last week, was brought to the previous level. 
“The local transporters increased the fares on their own last week, but now when the administration has restored the previous gas price they are not reducing fares,” said a resident Mohammad Ajmal. 
He said that the transporters had increased fares after the CNG stations in Mansehra had hiked the price of compressed natural gas to Rs236 per kg from Rs180 per kg. 
“The district administration after launching a crackdown compelled the CNG station owners to sell the gas at Rs183 per kg, but transporters are still receiving the same fares,” Mr Ajmal said. 
Another resident Nazakat Hussain said the district administration should implement the fares fixed by the Regional Transport Authority as the transporters were not following those fares.

Wajid Khan, Usman Shah, Liaquat Ali Khan, Asghar Khan, Usman Khan, Aziz Khan, Khalid Khan, Mohammad Ayaub Khan and scores of others called the decision of jirga against the basic human rights and freedom of movement. Some of them described the verdict an attempt to push back women to Stone Age.

The demand was made in a meeting held here on Sunday with Malgari Doctran president Dr Haidar Ali in the chair, according to a statement.
Speaking on the occasion, Dr Haider Ali said that promotion of doctors working in BPS-18 was overdue to BPS-19 in July 2018 but it was delayed owing to lack of interest by health and finance departments.
He said that most of the doctors retired from services while waiting for promotion. He asked the government to issue a notification for the promotion of the medics, who performed duty at hard places.
Dr Haider said that the representatives of doctors held meetings with the high-ups of the relevant departments in December 2019 wherein it was promised to expedite the process but to their utter disappointment, no progress was made.
Later in June 2020, they were assured by health department about their upgradation, but no avail.
Addressing the meeting, Dr Hamid Bangash said that on July 6, the department raised observations over the working paper for the promotion of doctors for the seventh time that sent wave of despair among medics working in different hospitals of the province.
He requested Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, Health Minister Taimur Khan Jhagra and Chief Secretary Dr Shahzad Khan Bangash to take notice of the delay in their promotion and hold accountable the officers concerned.
In the last meeting of Provincial Selection Board on July 6, he said, 62 doctors were promoted but those, whose promotion was long overdue from BPS-18 to BPS-19, were ignored. “We ask the government to issue a notification for promotion of doctors immediately,” he added.

They said Swat valley had hundreds of tourist spots with a combination of mountains, gushing streams and rivers, glacial lakes, roaring waterfalls, lush green meadows and dense forests, but recently a plethora of concrete buildings had not only defaced the pristine beauty but also made the resorts look unnatural.
“We recently visited Mahodand Lake but were shocked to see the unplanned constructions and camping tents coming up along the lake, which has distorted its natural beauty and charming look,” said Irfanullah Khan, an ecotourism activist and trekker.
Mahodand Lake is one of the most famous and beautiful lakes in Swat valley located 35 kilometres from Kalam. The lake is known for high-quality trout fish. In local parlance, Mahodand means fish lake.
“Not only the lake but the entire valley from Kalam to Mahodand offers diverse scenic locations, including emerald-coloured rivers, snowcapped mountain peaks, precious cedar trees, springs, and blue-water lakes. In short, the whole valley is a paradise for nature lovers,” said Talah Siddiqui, a tourist. 
“It is no more the same beautiful and serene lake amid haphazard camping and constructions. The government must stop such an activity, or the lake will lose its charm,” said Amjad Ali, a civil society activist.
He said unplanned constructions were underway not only in Mahodand area but in other tourist resorts of Swat.
The civil society members demanded that the government immediately take steps to stop the unplanned constructions to save the valley’s natural beauty.
“There must be proper laws for all the tourist resorts, and a ban must be imposed on the riverside and lakeside constructions,” said Fayaz Khan, a civil society activist in Mingora.
Assistant commissioner, Bahrain, Ishaq Ahmad said a proper campaign had already been launched by the district administration to discourage the irregular camping and construction of buildings around tourist resorts. “The district administration has imposed the Section 144 on the riverside constructions and encroachments,” he said.
Mr Ahmad said the district administration had also launched a social mobilisation and advocacy campaign to convince the people of Matiltan and other areas not to establish camping sites and raise constructions along the Swat River as well as along the Mahodand Lake.

For the fiscal year 2022-23, the government had earmarked Rs382 million for the three-year project with a total cost of Rs6.7 billion.
Officials in the education ministry said after revision of the rates of Public Work Departments (PWD) following an increase in the prices of construction material, the ministry has now prepared a new PC-I worth Rs7.7 billion.
They said soon the revised PC-I will be submitted to Planning Commission for approval after which the ministry will call tenders for awarding the work.

Total cost raised from Rs6.7bn to Rs7.7bn after increase in prices of construction material, says official

The officials said since only Rs382 million out of the total 6.7b had been earmarked for the current fiscal year, the ministry had decided that instead of carrying out the entire project simultaneously, only classrooms will be constructed initially.
In April this year, the ministry of education’s Project Management Unit (PMU) had pre-qualified three construction firms. However, later the ministry decided to cancel the pre-qualification process and said tenders will be called afresh after revision of PC-I.
“We have cancelled pre-qualification process. Now after approval of the revised PC-I we will call fresh tenders,” said an officer of the PMU.
Under the project, over 500 new classrooms, three auditoriums, 39 laboratories, 17 libraries, 148 toilet blocks and servant rooms will be built. The project will be divided into three phases.
Under the first and major phase, civil work will be done. The second project worth Rs268 million for procurement of furniture will be launched before the start of the last phase worth Rs589 million for purchase of equipment, computers, solar panels etc.
A source in the ministry said the project would be completed in three years and for the fiscal year 2021-22, the previous government had earmarked Rs409 million, which had been released.
Officials in the ministry and the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE), which regulate public schools and colleges in Islamabad, said most school buildings were in a bad condition and needed to be renovated.
A working paper of FDE stated: “The project was prepared keeping in view the fact that FDE has mostly retained educational institutions handed over by the government of Punjab in 1973 and 1985.”
A substantial portion of these buildings is in a dilapidated condition requiring rehabilitation on a priority basis to ensure safety of the students in a conducive environment for quality education.
“Whereas annual repair and maintenance of buildings is a recurring feature of civil work, however, no funds are allocated to schools and colleges of FDE for maintenance their physical infrastructure,” the paper stated.
An official of the FDE said that the project should be carried out on a priority basis as there is a dire need for repair and maintenance of school buildings and provision of missing facilities.
“We are hopeful that this project will be launched soon,” he said.

Last year, the Rawalpindi Metropolitan Corporation (RMC) converted an amusement park in the market at Satellite Town into the parking space.
But now the parking space is not being used and the administration is asking the visitors to park their vehicles on main roads. The visitors and traders have demanded that the local administration should open the space for parking.
The RMC converted the amusement park named ‘Bachon ki Dunya’ into a parking lot. The park was earning Rs425,000 per month from contractors who had installed swings there.
The RMC had planned to charge visitors for parking of their vehicles in the space. But former mayor Sardar Naseem made it a free parking space for the visitors. However, after the end of his tenure in December 2021, the RMC closed the parking space.
A senior official of the RMC told Dawn: “We are working to use the land to facilitate the visitors and shopkeepers of the main market.”
He said there was also a plan to use roadsides around Commercial Market for parking and for the first time electronic parking system would be introduced there.
“The visitors will be given e-tickets which will also end the chances of car theft from the parking area,” he said.
However, he added that the change of the local government was the main reason behind the postponement of the plan. He said some civic body officials wanted to impose a parking fee due to which the project was still incomplete.
On Sunday, Commissioner Noorul Amin Mengal, who is also the administrator of RMC, took notice of the issue and asked the RMC to open the parking space for the public as soon as possible.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Mengal said he would ensure the parking area is open for the visitors.
“Free of cost parking facility will be provided to the visitors and a squad will be deployed to provide them a secure environment,” he said.
He said the CCTV cameras would also be installed in the parking area. Apart from this, the administration also plans to construct two parking plazas in the city to overcome the shortage of parking space.
He said the government wanted to improve business opportunities and parking plazas will be constructed in Raja Bazaar and other commercial areas.
