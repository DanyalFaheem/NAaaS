Unicef Pakistan Representative Abdullah Fadil on Friday said that $37 million was required to extend the much-needed life-saving support to about 3.4 million children in the country.  
“We urgently need these funds and resources to allow us to continue to provide life-saving medical equipment, essential medicines, vaccines, safe drinking water, hygiene kits, mosquito nets,” Mr Fadil said. 
The organisation has already delivered $2 million worth of emergency supplies, he said while briefing international media in Geneva.

The Unicef representative also warned of a high risk of water-borne diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, dengue, malaria, which are already spreading in the affected areas.
Separately, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) in its latest estimations said the global humanitarian community aims to support around 5.2m people over the next six months.
Under its ‘2022 Pakistan Floods Response Plan’ UNOCHA will complement the government’s efforts to ensure aid for around 33m people.
Meanwhile, the World Food Programme (WFP) has said that it was supporting the government by providing assistance in the form of food relief, malnutrition prevention and livelihoods assistance.
UNHCR provides 7,000 tents
The UNHCR handed over 7,000 tents and other emergency relief items to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Authority on Friday.
UNHCR Spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh has said that the agency is further mobilising resources and staff to scale up its assistance and support local communities and refugees in flood-hit areas.

1,Probe reveals ‘dubious’ funds used for PTI media drive,"Documents show $625,000 were routed through Wootton Crick­­et Limited, $2.12m received in PTI’s accounts directly from Wootton.","ISLAMABAD: A probe into the ‘dubious’ money transferred to Pakistan by the former owner of Abraaj Group, Arif Naqvi, has revealed that a large amount in foreign funds was used for the media campaign of the former ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) during the 2013 general elections.
Documents obtained by the Fed­e­ral Investigation Agency (FIA), seen by Dawn, revealed that $625,000 were routed through Wootton Crick­­et Limited, a Cayman Islands registered offshore firm owned by Mr Na­qvi, who is currently facing trial in a US court for a $1 billion financial fraud. 
This is in addition to the $2.12m received in the PTI’s accounts directly from Wootton, as documented in the election commission’s Aug 2 verdict in the party’s prohibited funding case.
Read: Who contributed to PTI’s prohibited funds?
Documents show that the money was sent from Wootton Cricket’s account to “The Insaf Trust” account opened by PTI Chairman Imran Khan’s close friend, Tariq Shafi, in his capacity as the first chairman of the trust. Mr Shafi also received $575,000 in one of his personal accounts and transferred to a declared account of the PTI.
Interestingly, the declared objectives of the trust were to promote a sense of participative democracy and rule of law, democratic values and political awareness in the society, besides undertaking activities in various forms to promote health education and social order.
A clause of the trust deed included: “The trust, its funds or property or association of the trustees with the trust shall not be used for personal gain of any particular person or a group of persons.”
Other signatories of the trust’s bank account were the late Ashiq Hussain Qureshi and Hamid Zaman, both close friends of Imran Khan, and it was opened in May 2012 at the Habib Bank Ltd, Lahore Cantt branch.
On May 8, 2013, three days before the general elections, two media management firms — namely ‘Communication Spot’ and ‘Group M’ — were paid Rs36m and Rs25m, respectively, from the trust account for the PTI’s election campaign, the documents revealed. The account was used for just one transaction and has been dormant ever since.
The funding for the media campaign through the account of a charitable organisation is said to be a serious violation of the Political Parties Order 2002, besides drawing charges of money laundering. This amount remained concealed from the Election Commission of Pakistan.
Sources in the FIA disclosed that Tariq Shafi and others who had opened the trust’s account were iss­ued call-up notices thrice, but none of them turned up. They said the notices had also been issued to the two media management companies paid for the PTI’s election campaign.
“Group M”, in its response to the FIA’s call-up notice, confirmed that it had received an advance payment of Rs412m to run the PTI’s 2013 general elections campaign, out of which Rs375m were utilised and the balance was returned to the party via a cross cheque dated Sept 18, 2013. This amount was spent on media advertisements on different TV channels.

It further said the company had also provided similar services to other major political parties, including the PML-N. 
The company, it said, was not aware of the sources of the funds they had invested in the media. “In short, the company had a professional relationship with PTI,” its response stated.
The FIA probe revealed the refund was made via a cross cheque in favour of the PTI in its undeclared account, titled “PTI — National Ca­­m­paign Office”, maintained in then-KASB Bank — now Bank Islami Pakistan. A major chunk of Rs383m — out of the Rs412m — had been paid to the company out of this ac­­c­ount in the now-defunct KASB bank. The PTI’s central office account was used to contribute just Rs3.43m.
The other company, however, sought some more time to submit its reply.
Tariq Shafi has already approached the Lahore High Court that directed the FIA to continue its inquiry, but restrained it from taking any adverse action against him. Mr Shafi in his petition claimed the money was transferred through proper banking channels.
PTI senior vice president (finance) Sardar Azhar Tariq did not respond to repeated attempts by Dawn to seek comment.

2,Gill approaches IHC for post-arrest bail,Imran’s aide terms allegations against him ‘vague’ and based on ‘incorrect facts’...,"ISLAMABAD: Muham­mad Shahbaz Shabbir Gill, the Chief Staff Officer of PTI Chairman Imran Khan, who is facing sedition allegations, filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday seeking post-arrest bail. 
Earlier on Aug 30, a sessions court rejected his bail plea, saying sufficient incriminating material was available on record against the accused. 
In the fresh petition, Mr Gill pleaded that the bare reading of FIR made it abundantly clear that no offence had been made out against him since the allegations were “vague, misconstrued and based on incorrect facts and circumstances”. 
Islamabad City Magis­tra­te Ghulam Murtaza Chandiyo had registered on Aug 9 an FIR against Mr Gill on the contents aired on Aug 8 on the ARY News in which the accused had been invited as a guest. 

Imran’s aide terms allegations against him ‘vague’ and based on ‘incorrect facts’

But the petition pleaded that the true and actual facts of the case had been shrewdly concealed and suppressed by investigating authorities only for victimisation, blackmailing, arm-twisting and political score settling. 
It also said the petitioner had been critical and vocal of the incumbent government and its policies. 
Therefore, the petitioner said, he had been maliciously involved unjustifiably without any rhyme or reason and booked under technical, intricate, complex offences of mutiny and sedition, having serious ramification. 
The petition pleaded that the Aug 8 statement of the petitioner should be seen in totality to get the real context and meaning intended to be conveyed by him. 
The petitioner said that a plain reading of the statement made it evident that the petitioner addressed state institutions and the armed forces of the country with utmost respect and reverence and nothing degrading or demeaning had been uttered by him and his statement had been manipulated and fabricated to give it a new meaning and connotation only to rope him in the case. 
On Aug 17, he was medically examined by a medical board consisting of four senior doctors and professors of the Pakistan Ins­titute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, and in its report, it was held that the patient required monito­ring and assessment by cardiologist and pulmonologist.

KOHISTAN: After the floods washed away infrastructure in many parts of the country, residents of many areas are looking to the government to rebuild roads and restore connections to other parts of the country. 
But in Kohistan, locals have grown tired of waiting for the government to act and have taken it upon themselves to fix the roads with whatever they can find: wood, gravel and clay.
“If we wait for the government, it would take years for them to rehabilitate [the roads],” Habibullah, a former nazim of the Kalam valley in Swat, tells Dawn.com.
Habibullah is among some 200 locals who are repairing the road connecting Kalam to the Bahrain tehsil of Swat. A large section of the road was washed away by flood waters.
In the past, Habibullah recalls, it had taken the authorities very long to restore land routes. “So, we have decided to start the work ourselves and repair the road together with the use of small tools,” he said.
But even as he busies himself in the reconstruction of the main road leading to the valley, he feels that time is running out.
“If the road remains blocked, a shortage of food and medicines is imminent. People in the upper areas will die and the government will be responsible.”
The urgency is also not lost on Zubair Torwali, a resident of Bahrain. 
Torwali, a researcher of local languages, says that since the people of the area are essentially cut off, they have little choice but to make the dangerous trek across mountains to access food.
“People fasten bags of food on themselves and climb [mountains] with ropes here in Bahrain, as there are no signs of roads or pedestrian paths, all of which have been washed away by floods,” he said.
Despite their attempt to repair the road themselves, they still urged the government to restore links so the flow of much-needed help and medicines could resume to the remote areas of Kalam and Bahrain. 
Torwali stressed the need for sending medical teams to these areas, saying that flood victims there were in “dire need of the government’s and international assistance to be able to survive”.
The government should “rehabilitate roads, bridges and other structures on an emergency basis”, he added.
In the Kandia tehsil of Upper Kohistan district, roads have suffered the same fate as those in Swat, and its residents, much like the denizens of Kalam valley, have been patching a road up by themselves.
According to Hafeez Rehman, an educationist from Kandia, the main road in the tehsil has been washed away by rain-induced floods for the third time in a decade. This time, the residents have been cut off for about a week. 
When Dawn.com spoke to him on Friday, Rehman, his cousins and others from his village were repairing the stretch of road at Thoti (pronounced Too-tee) for the second day.
“My cousins and I left home early in the morning and walked difficult, mountainous terrain to reach Thoti [to repair the road],” he said.
Rehman and his companions hope that they will be able to get the road enough for at least a pickup truck to travel on it so that food can be transported to the areas and patients can be shifted to hospitals.
By Friday, he said, they had managed to repair a 200-metre stretch of the road.
Another resident of Kandia, Ghulam Murtaza, told Dawn.com that while residents had started repairing the road in Thoti, the relevant authorities have begun repair work further ahead on the road closer to the Japan Bridge. 
Upper Kohistan Assistant Commissioner Hafiz Muhammad Waqar confirmed that repair work had begun on that patch of the road.
Around 200 to 250 volunteers had joined hands to repair the road, Ghulam Murtaza says, recalling that they had done the same after the 2010 and 2016 floods.
“We are now hoping that we will complete the repairs within 10 to 15 days,” he said.
The timeline, however, makes the elderly Mushtahir Khan jittery, who says many homes in the area had run out of food, and medicines were no longer available at basic health units.
Doctors, too, had left, he lamented, adding that the three-year-old daughter of an acquaintance had died of cholera in Jishvi village. The disease, he said, was spreading fast in the area after the floods, forcing people to shift elsewhere.

4,‘Inadequate’ protection for Imran worries PTI,Party seeks details of security personnel and expenditure borne by govt on it; Fawad Chaudhry claims Imran facing life threats.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has expressed concern over the “inadequate” security provided to Chairman Imran Khan and sought details of security personnel and expenditure borne by the government on it.
The main opposition party’s Central Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry claimed in a statement that Mr Khan was the most popular leader of the country and he was facing life threats these days, but he was not being provided adequate security by the government.
Rejecting a claim of the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Islamabad, that over Rs20 million per month was being spent on the security of Mr Khan, he sought details of the money being spent on Mr Khan’s security and the number of security personnel provided for the purpose. 
“Since the imported government came into power, Imran’s life is in danger,” Mr Chaudhry said.
“Like any other citizen of the country, security of Imran Khan is the responsibility of the state,” he said, adding that the Sharifs had spent Rs364 million on the security of their palatial house in Jati Umra.
The PTI leader alleged that the Sharif family and PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari had misused the national wealth for their own security while Mr Khan saved millions of rupees in the head of security by living in his own house.
He said many letters had been written to the government and police for the security of Mr Khan, but nothing had been done in this regard.
The PTI leader said that the interior minister should provide details of the security of Mr Khan and expenditure incurred on it.
On Sept 1, Islamabad IGP Dr Akbar Nasir Khan said that the government was spending Rs240 million annually on the security of the PTI chairman.
The information was given at a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Interior which was chaired by PTI Senator Mohsin Aziz.
During the proceedings, IGP Nasir told the committee that besides the two private security companies, 266 personnel from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Islamabad, Gilgit-Baltistan police, Frontier Constabulary and Rangers had been deployed for Mr Khan’s security.

5,Balochistan minister rejects Rs10bn aid announced by PM,"Mir Asadullah Baloch says province has suffered financial losses of over 200b, grant nothing compared to level of destruction.","QUETTA: Balochistan Agriculture Minister Mir Asadullah Baloch on Friday rejected the Rs10 billion grant announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for the rehabilitation of flood victims in the province.
Speaking at a ceremony, he said according to initial assessments, the province has already suffered financial losses of over 200 billion as entire communication infrastructure and agriculture was destroyed by torrential rains and heavy floods.
This grant was nothing compared to the level of destruction in the province, he lamented. 
Criticising the grant announced by the prime minister, Mr Baloch said if philanthropists in Balochistan donate to help the victims, that amount alone will exceed Rs100b.
“The federal and provincial governments should be on one page to meet the challenge of rehabilitation,” he said, adding that around 1.3m people have become homeless.
Acres of rice, onion, tomatoes, barley crops and several fruit orchards have been washed away which would increase poverty and unemployment in the province, the minister said.
Mr Baloch suggested the provincial government to hold a donor conference in Islamabad to secure aid from national and international bodies.

6,"50 trucks bring vegetables from Iran, Afghanistan",Official says more consignments of onions and tomatoes will reach the country in coming days.,"QUETTA: Following a decision of the federal government to allow the private sector to import tomatoes and onions from Iran and Afghanistan, 50 trucks carrying the vegetables have crossed into the country through the Taftan and Chaman borders.  
“Over the last two days, 50 large-body trucks entered Pakistan through the Friendship Gates of Taftan and Chaman,” a senior official of the Quetta Customs Collectorate told Dawn on Friday. 
He said more consignments of onions and tomatoes would reach the country in the coming days. 
“We received 27 trucks of fresh tomatoes and onions from Iran on Friday which were carrying 660 tonnes of onions and tomatoes while13 trucks reached yesterday,” Arshad Hussain, a senior Customs officer told Dawn, adding these trucks were immediately dispatched to Quetta after completing legal formalities. 
Deputy Collector of Customs, Chaman, Malik Muhammad Ahmed, said 10 trucks crossed into Pakistan through Chaman border from Afghanistan. 
“The trucks loaded with the consignment of fresh tomatoes and onions were cleared after the routine checking,” he said, adding that the federal government had already announced a zero Customs duty on import of tomatoes and onions from Iran and Afghanistan.  
Meanwhile, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Balochistan welcomed the federal government decision to allow the private sector to import onions and tomatoes from the two brotherly countries at a time when unprecedented floods had destroyed the two crops in all flood-hit areas of the country. 
The prices of these two commodities and other vegetables had massively gone up and the entire country was faci­ng the shortage of vegetables because of the flood devastation across the country. 
“Because of the import of onions and tomatoes from the two neighbouring countries, prices of these two commodities would come down in the next two to three days in all markets across the country,” BCCI President Fida Hussain Dashti told Dawn.

7,ARY News ‘back on air’ after IHC order,IHC CJ seeks explanation on why channel was taken off air on Aug 8 and why no measures were taken to restore it.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court ordered the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) on Friday to immediately restore the transmission of ARY News at the position it was on Aug 7 or face consequences for defying the order. 
Chief Justice Athar Minallah ordered Information Secretary Shahera Shahid and Pemra Chairman Saleem Baig to appear before the court on Monday (Sept 5) and explain why the channel was taken off air on Aug 8 and why no measures were taken to restore it. 
The chief justice had taken up a petition moved by a number of journalists working for ARY Communications. The channel was back on air, at least in the federal capital, soon after the issuance of the IHC order. 
The petition was moved by Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan and Gohar Ali Khan on behalf of journalist Azhar Farooq and others, who said the Aug 8 suspension of ARY News transmission had put their livelihood in danger. 
At the outset on Friday, Justice Minallah asked the Pemra representative to explain why the transmission was suspended, but Advocate Haroon Dogal argued that the regulator had not blocked the channel. Not satisfied with the response, the IHC CJ said Pemra should put the channel back on air.

Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco) spokesman Afzal Baloch told Dawn that the supply was suspended after three pylons carrying 132KV transmission line were damaged due to torrential rains followed by heavy flooding. He said at least 23 grid stations were reconnected to the system after repair work was completed on the Sibi-Quetta double circuit line.
However, the supply of electricity and gas to the provincial capital could not be restored despite the passage of two weeks.
The power supply was suspended when several pylons carrying the Quetta-Sibi transmission line were damaged in Bolan and Sibi areas. Qesco officials said that repair work could not be started as large areas in Sibi and Bolan were still submerged.
However, pipelines at Bibi Nani area in Bolan river could not be repaired due to high flood in the river.
