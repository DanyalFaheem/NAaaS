0,"Ramiz defends PJL, says league to take inspiration from BBL",Ramiz says PJL was never about generating profits and suggested the PCB itself was ready to invest in the venture.,"KARACHI: Ramiz Raja has come out in defence of his brainchild — the Pakistan Junior League. 
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman had proposed the idea of the PJL as a first-of-its-kind franchise-based tournament for under-19 players soon after assuming the charge. 
The board announced on Tuesday that it would take “complete ownership” of the PJL after the six teams on offer went unsold in the bidding process for their ownership rights — hence reducing it to anything but a franchise league. 
Despite claiming back in April that feedback by potential investors showed “huge appetite for cricket and a strong commercial market”, Ramiz has said that the latest decision was taken because qualified bidders did not share PCB’s vision and objectives. 
“It is a misperception and misleading to say that the PCB was unable to sell franchise team rights for the Pakistan Junior League,” the PCB chief told Dawn.  
“The fact is we had the investors on the table, including foreign entrepreneurs, but the PCB called off the process because we felt our vision and objectives were not entirely aligned as far as some commercial aspects of the event were concerned.” 
Ramiz, who has repeatedly talked about creating “products” to attract more investment towards cricket, said the PJL was never about generating profits and suggested the PCB itself was ready to invest in the venture.  
“Before entering into this venture about 10 months ago, the PCB was aware that development tournaments are not profit-making or revenue-generating events,” said the former Pakistan Test skipper.  
“But, as we do for our domestic events, there will be no compromise on the quality of cricket and the PCB will continue to invest in its pathways cricket to make Pakistan a stronger and successful cricket brand.” 
PJL’s inaugural edition, set to be held next month in Lahore, will be inspired by Australia’s Big Bash League — of which all the eight teams are owned by the country’s cricket board — and the PCB expects the model will help in giving the players a competitive stage to perform. 
“…. in line with the BBL model, the PCB decided to take complete ownership of the teams so that we can produce and present the six best and equally balanced sides in a professional and competitive environment,” Ramiz said. 
“This, supported by PCB’s excellent event delivery, will result in a successful event and set high level benchmarks and standards for the future.” 
Ramiz, in a video posted on the PCB YouTube channel on April 29, had also claimed that “nearly 24 to 26 companies have come forward and expressed their interest in owning the franchises”.  
“The interest is unlimited,” he went on to say. 
However, Dawn understands only nine bidders, including owners of two PSL franchises, qualified technically and financially. The remaining bidders failed to make it because of what was deemed by the PCB as their low profile. 
The two PSL franchise owners eventually pulled out of the process since the six PSL franchises decided to either bid together or not bid at all. 
The PCB, it is understood, didn’t have many options but to go with the BBL model. 
According to sources, the lack of interest by bidders who the PCB would have deemed satisfactory to own the teams came as a surprise after it predicted that the PJL would be an attractive product after market research and analysis.
Experts had predicted otherwise. One of them, a sports management professional who has worked with the Pakistan Super League, took to Twitter last month and wrote a thread on how unlikely it was for “a new franchise, set up for players with a maximum life-cycle of two years” to create hype. 
The expert suggested it was more profitable for the PCB to join hands with the PSL franchises to run the PJL sides.  
“A Lahore Qalandars / Karachi Kings U23 / U19 will get way more traction and response than a Gujranwala Gujjars/ Hyderabad Hawks U23/ U19,” he wrote.  
“A new team / new identity is unlikely to be disruptive and create the buzz that a franchise-based tournament requires.” 
Dawn understands the PCB mentioned the PJL informally to the PSL franchises along with the possibility of the women’s PSL — planned to be inaugurated early next year.  
The idea may not have been expressly talked about but the impression that the franchises had that the PJL may be an extension of their existing products.  
Sources suggested the PCB intended on bringing in new owners for the PJL but there was lukewarm interest because of the concerns about the product’s cricketing and commercial potential. 
The PCB has also struggled to attract sponsorships for other commercial inventory of the PJL. According to local media reports last month, the board received less than 25 per cent of the reserve price for PJL’s title sponsorship rights.
The reports claimed only three companies participated in the bidding process. 
Ramiz, however, was confident that “cricketing reasons” were enough to consider the PJL as a promising venture that has attracted interest from players from across eight Test-playing nations.
“For the talented youngster, there is everything to gain from the Pakistan Junior League — from having iconic cricketers in their dugouts to high-quality playing facilities to top-notch logistical arrangements to broadcast quality coverage to player fees, which may be crucial for a number of under-privileged cricketers,” said the 60-year-old.  
“These cricketing reasons have earned an overwhelming support from the cricket-playing countries, including nine Test playing nations, who have recommended around 140 cricketers for the draft,” Ramiz concluded.

Jadeja, a left-hander who bats in the middle-order and bowls spin, played a key role in India’s victories over Pakistan and Hong Kong to make the Super Four stage.
Left-arm spinner Axar Patel will replace Jadeja in the squad ahead of Sunday’s clash against either Pakistan or Hong Kong. 
“Jadeja has sustained a right knee injury and is ruled out of the tournament,” the Board of Cricket for Control in India (BCCI) said in a statement.
They added Patel would join the team soon in Dubai.
Jadeja made 35 and put on a key 52-run stand with Hardik Pandya as India chased down 148 with two balls to spare against Pakistan.
He then returned figures of 1-15 while bowling in his side’s 40-run win over Hong Kong.
The six-nation Asia Cup tournament, hosted by the United Emirates, is a warm-up for this year’s T20 World Cup in Australia starting next month.

Bairstow was initially included in the selection but the England and Wales Cricket Board later said he had been ruled out of the rest of the summer and the T20 World Cup after suffering a lower limb injury in a freak accident while playing golf in Leeds on Friday.
Bairstow said in a post on Instagram that he was injured after slipping on the golf course and that he would need to undergo an operation.
Roy has been an integral part of England’s white-ball squad and his explosive batting at the top of the order embodied the team’s aggressive approach as they won their maiden 50-overs World Cup title in 2019.
The 32-year-old has struggled for runs this summer and hit 76 runs in total in his last six Twenty20 Internationals which made his position untenable for the World Cup and the preceding seven-match Twenty20 series in Pakistan.
Fit-again seamers Chris Woakes and Mark Wood, both of whom last played for England during the test tour of the West Indies in March, have recovered from their respective injuries to be in both squads.
England’s squad includes Chris Jordan (finger) and Liam Livingstone (ankle) who will skip the Pakistan tour to continue their rehabilitation, the ECB said on Friday.
Captain Jos Buttler, who is recovering from a calf injury, will tour Pakistan but will be available to play only in the later stages of the series.
“In Buttler’s absence, Moeen Ali will captain the side,” the ECB said.
Jordan Cox, Tom Helm, Will Jacks, Olly Stone and Luke Wood are the five uncapped players named in the England squad for the Pakistan series which begins on Sept. 20 in Karachi.
Former champions England begin their Twenty20 World Cup campaign against Afghanistan on Oct. 22 in Perth.
T20 World Cup squad: Joss Buttler, Moeen Ali, Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Sam Curran, Chris Jordan, Liam Livingstone, Dawid Malan, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Ben Stokes, Reece Topley, David Willey, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood.

3,Multan back as venue for HBL PSL 2023,PCB announces to hold premier T20 event from Feb 9 to March 19.,"LAHORE: Multan has again been included along with the venues of Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi for the eighth edition of the HBL
Pakistan Super  League (PSL) as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday announced to hold the premier T20 event from Feb 9 to March 19 next year.
Last time, Multan was included for the first time as a venue for the 2020 edition but later due to Covid-19 pandemic the city was ousted from the list.
Friday’s decisions were taken in HBL Pakistan Super League’s governing council which met here at the National High Perfo­rmance Centre. 
All six  franchises were represented along with PCB officials who are members of the GC. PCB chairman Ramiz Raja chaired the meeting.
“The meeting congratulated the GC on a hugely successful and record-breaking HBL PSL 7 which was the first one ever to be staged in Pakistan uninterrupted since the start of the league in 2016. The successful organisation of the tournament was made possible despite significant external challenges and record revenue and viewership was attained through the two action-packed leagues in Karachi and Lahore,” a PCB press release said.
“Some important discussions around the scheduling for the next edition of the HBL PSL were made. It was decided that the HBL PSL 8 will run from Feb 9 to March 19, 2023. At least four venues will be used for hosting the matches, including Lahore, Karachi, Rawal­pindi and Multan. Further discussions for firming up the detailed schedule will take place between the franchises and the PCB in due course,” it added.

4,ECB committed to tour despite flooding,"Matches are due to be held in Karachi and Lahore, with no changes currently planned despite the worst floods in Pakistani history.","LONDON: The England and Wales Cricket Board are committed to the forthcoming T20 tour of Pakistan despite the flooding that has ravaged the country.
England have not played in Pakistan since 2005 due to security concerns and pulled out of a planned series last year at short notice.
The Pakistan Cricket Board were furious with that decision, making England’s visit for a seven-match T20 series starting on September 20 even more significant for relations between the countries.
Matches are due to be held in Karachi and Lahore, with no changes currently planned despite the worst floods in Pakistani history, which have left a death toll of 1,200 and rising and a third of the country under water.
Asked about the situation on Friday, Rob Key, managing director of men’s cricket at the ECB, said: “It’s a moving picture at the moment, there’s been a hell of a lot of communication between people out there and the ECB, the PCA (Professional Cricketers’ Association). 
“But it’s a trip we’re desperate to go on and it’s going to take a lot for us not to get out there. 
“I think hopefully us going out there and playing will be a positive for what’s been a pretty harrowing time for the people of that country. 
“I’m really looking forward to getting out there.”

Nadal defeated Italy’s Fabio Fognini 2-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-1 but only after suffering a bizarre self-inflicted injury when leading 3-0 in the fourth set.
The four-time champion, and holder of a men’s record 22 Grand Slam titles, was hurt when his racquet bounced back off the court as he stretched for a ball and hit him squarely on the nose.
The 36-year-old Spaniard and French Open champion dropped his racquet to the Arthur Ashe Stadium floor and sprinted to the sidelines where he lay on his back with his nose bloodied.
He required a medical timeout to have the wound tended before resuming with a bandage across the bridge of his nose. 
“I was a little bit dizzy and it was a little bit painful,” said Nadal, who said he had suffered a similar injury in the past caused by a golf club.
Nadal said that despite being a set and 4-2 down, he was happy to have recovered after coming into the tournament still worried by the abdominal injury he suffered at Wimbledon.
For the first time since 2018, Serena and Venus Williams revived a partnership which has brought them 14 doubles titles at the majors.
However, their hopes of collecting a third crown in New York were dashed in a 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 defeat to Czech pairing Linda Noskova and Lucie Hradecka.
The loss leaves 40-year-old Serena free to focus on what is widely expected to be the final singles campaign of her landmark 27-year career before retirement.
Serena and her 42-year-old sister went down fighting, clawing back from 1-4 down in the second set before the Czech pair steadied the ship. 
Meanwhile, Victoria Azarenka triumphed against Marta Kostyuk 6-2, 6-3 in a match dominated by bitter exchanges over the conflict in Ukraine.
Last week, Belarusian star Azarenka was axed from an exhibition event aimed at raising money for the war-ravaged country.
Ukraine’s Kostyuk had refused to take part in protest at the presence of Azarenka who she has criticised for a perceived failure to condemn the invasion of her home country.
Belarus is a close ally of Russia and has allowed Moscow to use its territory to launch attacks into Ukraine.
The tension between the two was evident at the end of their tie on Court 17 with Kostyuk offering just a touch of racquets instead of the customary post-match handshake. 
“How did it make me feel? It’s not the most important thing in the world right now,” said Azarenka.
Away from the controversy, world number one and French Open champion Iga Swiatek cruised into the third round with a 6-3, 6-2 win over 2017 champion Sloane Stephens.
Paula Badosa, the fourth seed and potential semi-final opponent of Swiatek, suffered another miserable return to the city of her birth.
The Spaniard’s failure to get beyond the second round will stretch for another year after losing 6-7 (5-7), 6-1, 6-2 to Petra Martic of Croatia.
Sixth seed Aryna Sabalenka, a semi-finalist in 2021, came back from 1-5 down in the second set and saved two match points to defeat Kaia Kanepi, 2-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-4.
China will have four women in the last 32 for the first time at a Slam after Zheng Qinwen defeated Anastasia Potapova and Yuan Yue got the better of Irina-Camelia Begu.
Zhang Shuai and Wang Xiyu had already booked their spots in the next stage.
Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz dug deep to save 13 of 14 break points to defeat Federico Coria of Argentina.
World number four Alcaraz, a quarter-finalist in 2021, went through 6-2, 6-1, 7-5 on the back of 46 winners.
Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans reached the third round giving Britain four men in the last 32 in New York for the first time since 1933.

7,Bangladesh need more head than heart: Shakib,"""I don’t see any (world-class) bowler in Sri Lanka as well… we have at least two,"" the skipper said.","DUBAI: Skipper Shakib Al Hasan warned Bangladesh that they must keep their emotions in check after rivals Sri Lanka dumped them out of the Asia Cup cricket following a bitter war of words.
Sri Lanka won a do-or-die match in Dubai by two wickets and with four balls to spare on Thursday to move into the Super Four stage of the tournament, a prelude to the T20 World Cup.
Before the clash the two sides exchanged verbal volleys in media conferences with Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka saying Bangladesh lacked a world-class bowler other than Mustafizur Rahman and Shakib.
Bangladesh team director Khaled Mahmud hit back, saying: “I don’t see any (world-class) bowler in Sri Lanka as well... we have at least two.” The battle of words moved to social media with former Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene tweeting: “Looks like it’s time for (our) bowlers to show the class and batters to show who they are on the field.” 
Shakib denied after the defeat that ended their Asia Cup hopes that the off-field chatter had affected them, but admitted his Bangladesh team needed to play more with their heads. 
“We are very emotional. That is the other area we need to improve,” Shakib said, with the World Cup in Australia on the horizon in October-November. 
“Keep our emotions on the side and play the way we need to play. More looking to give our head in the game than our heart in the game.” 
Sri Lanka batsman Bhanuka Rajapaksa offered an olive branch to the Bangladesh players and said Shanaka’s words were misconstrued. 
“The statement that the captain made, I don’t think he meant any wrong,” Rajapaksa told reporters. 
“Of course, when you compare the (dangerous) Afghanistan bowlers, what we meant was we had a slight advantage facing the Bangladeshi bowlers.” Rajapaksa added: “Like India-Pakistan, Sri Lanka-Bangladesh is also a good rivalry, but we are friends off the field. 
“Some words could hurt the players and hurt the staff. But what the captain meant was not what went through the media.”

In the first match of the day, left-handed Shan continued his impressive form as his 39-ball 53 not out handed Balochistan the victory which was the first for a chasing side at the ongoing National T20 Cup.
Shan, who was named player-of-the-match, walked in the middle with Balochistan needing 103 runs in 14.3 overs after the dismissal of second opener Asad Shafiq (17 off 14) and displayed some fabulous strokeplay, hitting four fours and two sixes. The shot of the innings came when he reverse-swept Zahid Mehmood for a six that sailed over point.
Following quick wickets of Haris Sohail (10) and Hussain Talat (2) in the 15th and 16th over, Shan got the desired support from Amad Butt, who spanked three fours and a six in his 12-ball 25 not out.
Earlier Sindh, following their captain Saud Shakeel’s decision to bat, posted 142-7 with Saad Khan (31 off 27) and Sarfaraz Ahmed (29 off 23) being the notable performers with the bat.
Balochistan put up a disciplined bowling performance with captain Yasir Shah, left-arm orthodox spinner Kashif Bhatti and pacer Khurram Shahzad picking up two wickets each.
In the second match of the day, Southern Punjab simply outplayed Central Punjab who were dismissed for mere 79 in 14.3 overs thanks to a terrific show by off-spinner Salman.
Southern’s opener Zain Abbas smashed 65 off 44 (10 fours) helped his team reach gave Central Punjab a 166-run target.
Southern Punjab made 165-8 after Salman elected to bat first. Sharoon Siraj continued to add crucial runs in the middle, scoring 35 off 24. In the last two matches, he made 57 not out against Balochistan and 36 against Sindh.
Central Punjab openers Abdullah Shafique and Ahmed Shehzad once again failed as the latter was run out in the third over, but it was the seventh over that settled the match for Southern Punjab when Salman dismissed his opposite number Qasim Akram and Abdullah in a space of three balls. The scorecard, at the time, read 34-5.
Salman, in his next over, sent Irfan Niaz and Junaid Ali back to the pavilion on back-to-back deliveries, and dismissed Wahab Riaz in the 11th over as Central Punjab slumped further to 51-8.
There was no notable resistance from any Central Punjab batter as Usama Mir (17 off 13) top-scored for them.
Summarised scores:
SINDH 142-7 in 20 overs (Saad Khan 31, Sarfaraz Ahmed 29; Yasir Shah 2-23, Kashif Bhatti 2-23, Khurram Shahzad 2-27); BALOCHISTAN 143-5 in 18.5 overs (Shan Masood 53 not out, Amad Butt 25 not out; Sohail Khan 2-35)
SOUTHERN PUNJAB 165-8 in 20 overs (Zain Abbas 65, Sharoon Siraj 35; Ahmed Daniyal 3-27, Wahab Riaz 2-37); CENTRAL PUNJAB 79 in 14.3 overs (Salman Ali Agha 5-10).

Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc was fastest in the second session at the seaside circuit with a best lap of one minute 12.345 seconds.
Team-mate Carlos Sainz was second on the timing screens, a mere 0.004 slower, with Mercedes’ seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton third and 0.072 of the pace.
Red Bull’s runaway world championship leader Verstappen was only eighth but seemingly set on a race simulation with a full fuel load.
McLaren’s Lando Norris was fourth ahead of Mercedes’ George Russell, Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll and Alpine’s Fernando Alonso.
Verstappen did only seven laps in the first session before being sidelined by a gearbox problem that left him as much of a spectator as the ranks of orange-clad fans crowding the grandstands.
Russell was fastest around the tight and twisty layout in 1:12.455 in the first session, 0.240 ahead of Hamilton and Sainz.
“Something went with the gearbox,” Verstappen told his race engineer over the radio after stopping with 10 minutes on the clock.
“We lost drive whilst he took a shift from fourth to fifth,” said team boss Christian Horner.  “We have to get it turned around quickly for the next session.”
Verstappen’s Mexican team mate Sergio Perez was seventh and 12th in the sessions respectively.
Verstappen, 19th of 20 in the session, is 93 points clear of Perez with eight races remaining and will be chasing his 10th win of the season on Sunday.

Surprise leaders Arsenal travel to Manchester United aiming to extend the only perfect record in the Premier League this season, while Thomas Tuchel searches for answers to Chelsea’s struggles.
What a difference a week has made for Liverpool as the angst sparked by their three-match winless run has been replaced by the more familiar sight of Jurgen Klopp punching the air in front of a jubilant Kop.
When a pair of lacklustre draws against Fulham and Crystal Palace were followed by a dismal defeat at Manchester United, Liverpool boss Klopp faced some difficult questions about his injury-hit side’s struggles.
But the critics have been silenced over the last seven days as Liverpool hammered Bournemouth 9-0 to equal the Premier League’s record win, then stole a 2-1 victory against Newcastle thanks to Fabio Carvalho’s opportunistic strike with virtually the last kick of the game.
Releasing the pent-up frustration of Liverpool’s shaky start, Klopp celebrated wildly on the pitch after Carvalho’s goal, to the delight of fans all around Anfield.
Now Klopp wants Liverpool to channel that emotion into another winning performance on Saturday at Goodison Park against an Everton side still waiting for their first league victory this season. 
“It’s a massive boost from a frustrating night,” Klopp said. “One of the best nights we ever had, that’s how football is. 
“But we have to make sure we use these two days really well. The last two games we got six points, but we have to improve. 
“It will not be that Everton open up for us now. We know it will be tough so we have to be ready.” 
Granit Xhaka has urged his Arsenal team-mates to show the killer instinct required to maintain their blistering form.
Ahead of Sunday’s intriguing test at Manchester United, Mikel Arteta’s side sit two points clear at the top after five successive wins.
But their last two matches — a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Aston Villa on Wednesday and a gritty success by the same score against Fulham four days earlier — have left Xhaka concerned about Arsenal’s ability to turn territorial dominance into easy wins.
Swiss midfielder Xhaka is impressed by Arsenal’s spirit, but wants them to show a ruthless edge to avoid the need for more late drama. 
“We have to learn, you can’t always concede and come back like against Fulham or Villa, we have to try to finish and to kill the game before that,” Xhaka said. 
‘NO EXCUSES’ FOR CHELSEA SLUMP 
Tuchel insists there are no excuses for big-spending Chelsea’s troubled start to the season.
Tuchel’s men suffered their second defeat in five league games as they blew the lead in a 2-1 loss at Southampton on Tuesday.
Coming so soon after a wretched 3-0 reverse at Leeds, Tuchel felt compelled to question his players’ mental toughness following the Southampton debacle.
Chelsea are already eight points off the top and, aware his summer spending spree on new signings could have unsettled the squad, Tuchel called for renewed focus ahead of Sunday’s London derby against West Ham.
Asked if the change of ownership from Roman Abramovich to the Todd Boehly-led consortium could still be having a lingering effect, Tuchel said: “Yeah maybe, but we know the line is so thin between excuses and explanations. 
“So I better not go down this road, because I don’t want to give anybody any chance, myself, players, staff, any room for excuses.”
Fixtures: Saturday (1400 GMT unless stated) Everton v Liverpool (1130), Brentford v Leeds, Newcastle v Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest v Bournemouth, Tottenham v Fulham, Wolves v Southampton, Aston Villa v Manchester City (1630) Sunday (1400 unless stated) Brighton v Leicester, Chelsea v West Ham, Manchester United v Arsenal (1530).

Sancho provided a cool finish, rounding keeper Danny Ward and slipping the ball home in the 23rd minute after being set up by Marcus Rashford from a Bruno Fernandes break down the right.
James Maddison went close for Leicester with a superb free-kick which brought an excellent save from United’s David De Gea but the home side struggled to create chances.
After the break United took few risks and lacked a cutting edge with manager Erik ten Hag deciding to bring on Cristiano Ronaldo in the 68th minute.
Ronaldo, who had been linked with a move away from the club during the transfer window, went close with a bicycle kick and added some life to United’s attack.
Leicester had a late chance to level but full-back James Justin blasted high and wide from a promising position on the right as United collected back-to-back away victories.
The win moves United up to fifth with nine points from five matches, six adrift of leaders Arsenal and four behind second-placed Manchester City. Leicester stay bottom on one point. 
“It is another step forward so I am happy with that,” said Ten Hag. 
“We showed good team spirit. We had 11 players the on pitch who fought for each other and scored a lovely team goal. Still, there are improvements to make but that is normal at this stage of the season,” he added.
The transfer deadline leaves United with Ronaldo still on board and Brazilians Casemiro and Antony added to the squad and the Dutchman sounded positive about the club’s signings which also included defenders Lisandro Martinez and Tyrell Malacia. 
“We need a good squad and we needed numbers. There are a lot of games to cover. Once we have Cristiano Ronaldo and Casemiro getting fitter it will get better still — we need not only a team we need a squad,” Ten Hag added.
Leicester lost their key defender Wesley Fofana to Chelsea but manager Brendan Rodgers was pleased to have replaced him with Belgian Wout Faes from Reims and to have kept Harvey Barnes and James Maddison, despite reports of interest in them.

14,Pakistan crush HK to reach Asia Cup Super 4,SHARJAH: Mohammad Rizwan propelled Pakistan into the Asia Cup Super Four Stage as their bowlers skittled out minnows...,"SHARJAH: Mohammad Rizwan propelled Pakistan into the Asia Cup Super Four Stage as their bowlers skittled out minnows Hong Kong for a record low of 38 here at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Friday.
Pakistan scored 193-2 in a must-win Twenty20 International with Rizwan (78 not out) and Fakhar Zaman (53) putting on 116 runs after being invited to bat first on a slow and low pitch.
Spinners Shadab Khan and Mohammad Nawaz then shared seven wickets to bundle out Hong Kong in 10.4 overs and win by 155 runs — Pakistan’s biggest T20 victory margin by runs.
It was Hong Kong’s lowest T20 International total after their 69 against Nepal in 2014. It was also the lowest against Pakistan by any team after they bowled out West Indies for 60 in 2018.
Pakistan join Afghanistan, India and Sri Lanka in round two of the six-nation tournament that acts as a tune-up to the T20 World Cup in October-November in Australia.

“Our performance and effort is for everyone to see,” man-of-the-match Rizwan told reporters.
“Boys are putting in their 100 per cent and gelling well together and catering to the demand of our nation. The result is in the hands of God.”
Young pace bowler Naseem Shah struck twice in the third over of the Hong Kong innings including the wicket of skipper Nizakat Khan for eight.
“Naseem Shah is emerging to be in line as another fast-bowling superstar. No one can replace Shaheen Shah Afridi [out with a knee injury] but Naseem is shaping up well,” Rizwan remarked.
Hong Kong, who made the main draw by winning all their three matches in the qualifiers, could not recover.
Shadab returned figures of 4-8 from his leg spin and Nawaz took three wickets with his left-arm orthodox.
Earlier, Khushdil Shah hit five sixes including four in the final over to finish with a flourish in his unbeaten 35 off 15 balls as Rizwan watched the blitz from the non-striker’s end in a partnership of 64.
Hong Kong’s bowlers kept the Pakistan openers in check with a disciplined line and length and spinner Ehsan Khan got the key wicket of skipper Babar Azam for nine in the third over.
It was Babar’s second failure in the tournament after he made 10 against India in his team’s opening loss, but Rizwan said the star batsman remains a  “superstar” and a prolific run-getter.
Babar hit a four off Ehsan’s off spin but the bowler soon took revenge with a caught and bowled to silence a pro-Pakistan crowd.
The left-handed Fakhar joined Rizwan, a wicket-keeper/batsman, and the two rebuilt the innings.
Rizwan reached his fifty off 42 balls to raise the bat amid raucous applause form the crowd.
Fakhar also changed gears and reached his fifty with a towering six off Murtaza’s left-arm spin, but got out next over to Ehsan after a 41-ball stay.
Khushdil then tore into the opposition bowling and ended the innings with three successive sixes.
