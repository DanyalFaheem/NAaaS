0,Ministry of Defence disowns ‘unrecognised’ veterans’ bodies,"Accuses some military veterans’ bodies of “masquerading as” representatives of retired servicemen, warns them of punitive action.","ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Defence on Friday accused some military veterans’ bodies of “masquerading as” representatives of retired servicemen and warned them of punitive action.
“This office does not recognise or endorse the activities of certain associations of persons masquerading as (or claiming to be) ex-servicemen societies i.e. inter alia, Pakistan Ex-Servicemen Society (PESS) and Veterans of Pakistan (VoP) soliciting support and funds for charitable purposes, flood relief, public works or propagation of unwarranted ideas,” a statement issued by the defence ministry said.
It said the associations were “neither recognised nor authorised, on behalf of the Armed Forces of Pakistan” to act as ex-servicemen societies and claim association with the armed forces or its institutions.
“Comprehensive policy/guidelines” exist for “functioning/operation of ex-servicemen societies”, the ministry stated, while warning them that violation of those guidelines would be “culpable” and “entail penal consequences”.
The statement has been issued by the ministry instead of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), which normally issues statements on behalf of Joint Staff Headquarters, GHQ and other services headquarters.
PESS is headed by Lt Gen (retd) Amjad Shoaib, while VoP is led by Lt Gen (retd) Ali Kuli Khan.
According to the PESS website, the body was formed to look after the welfare of retired servicemen and is the largest veterans’ body.
VoP, the other major group, meanwhile, espouses political ambitions. Publicly denying recognition to the veterans’ bodies is so far the harshest action against these associations by the ministry.

• 470 dead in Sindh, 15m displaced, 3m houses damaged; CM says province needs 2m ration bags
• Dadu water level on the rise, gushing towards Manchar Lake and Johi
DADU / KARACHI: The water level in Dadu city — surrounded on all four sides — continued to rise on Friday as the overall death toll from the devastating floods, which have affected millions across the country, crossed 1,200.
The raised level is a consequence of a surge in the flow of water down Indus river, with monstrous floods leaving a trail of destruction in the country’s northern regions.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah told reporters the province was going through its worst floods, more destructive than even 2010 or 2011.
He said 470 people in the province had lost their lives and 1,074 were injured, besides 45,000 cattle deaths and nearly 3.17 million acres of damaged cropland. More­over, 15m people have been displaced after 3m houses were damaged or washed away by water, which he said “is not like a car that can be steered at your will”.
Record monsoon rains and melting glaciers in northern mountains have triggered floods that have killed at least 1,208 people across the country, including 416 children, and injured 6,082, according to the National Disaster Manage­ment Authority. It said 19 casualties were reported over the past 24 hours. 
The devastation is now spreading southwards, with floodwater gushing towards Manchar Lake and Johi in Dadu district on Friday.
Dadu city, the capital of its namesake district, is under water siege — with an inundated Khairpur Nathan Shah city to the north; Manchar Lake to the south; the Main Nara Valley (MNV) drain to the west; and the Indus to the east.
The MNV drain, some 8km from Dadu, is under full water pressure at its right embankment. Thousands of citizens in nearby villages of Dadu and Sehwan are braced for floods.
From the Indus river side, all eyes are on the Larkana-Sehwan (LS) embankment, some half a kilometre from Dadu city. Walidad Khushik, resident of Jan Mohammad Khushik village, said the LS water level had risen by a foot in just one day.
Irrigation official Mohammad Ibrahim said the water level was rising but he ruled out any threat, insisting that people and machinery were mobilised at the site to bring the situation under control.
As for water flows from Khairpur Nathan Shah, some 50km from Dadu and already inundated, the lifeline is Johi barrage, whose embankments were safe, according to locals.
The Manchar lake water level is also rising, Alam Rah­poto, superintendent eng­ineer at the Sindh irrigation department, told Dawn.com, but he said all protective dykes were strong.
He said 10,000 to 15,000 cusecs were being discharged from the lake into the Indus river on Friday morning while 70,000 to 80,000 cusecs were flowing into the lake from the MNV drain and FP Bund, a flood protective dyke.
Dadu Deputy Commissioner Syed Murtaza Shah told Dawn Pakistan Army, Rangers and district administration were jointly carrying out relief work, a rescue operation was launched in kacha (riverine) areas.
Keeping in view the impending threat, hundreds of families in the province have taken refuge on roads, the only dry land in sight for many. Many are headed for urban centres, like Karachi, which has for now escaped the flooding.
“We lost our house to the rain and floods, we’re going to Karachi to our relatives. No one has come to help us,” Allah Bakash, 50, who left Dadu on Thursday with his family and belongings loaded on a truck, told Reuters news agency.
Social activist Mohammad Bux Korai said flood-affected people from Khairpur Nathan Shah, Johi and Mehar talukas have come to Dadu. An MNA in Dadu said the city had 200,000 residents. Besides, it now houses 8,000 flood-hit families, according to a survey, but the actual number could be much higher.
No imminent threat to Dadu
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Friday said various protective dykes were under pressure and posed a threat to some major towns and cities.
He said the government was trying its best to protect various villages and towns. Still, “Abdullah Shah village, the birthplace of my father, has been flooded with the rising water in Manchhar lake,” he told a press conference at Chief Minister House, alongside Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon, and advisers Murtaza Wahab and Rasool Bux Chandio.
Mr Shah said Dadu city and its urban area did not have an imminent threat of inundation, but the rural areas were 80pc per cent inundated and efforts were under way to clear them.
Besides, 85pc of Khairpur Nathan Shah was inundated. Similarly, Johi city is being defended through a ring dyke which is being constantly monitored and patrolled by locals, but its rural area is 90pc flooded.
Nasirabad and Qubo Saeed Khan are safe as the water level is receding. Besides, “over 80pc of Sukkur’s urban areas have been cleared of rainwater and the remaining will be cleared in two days,” he said.
He said 151 camps had been set up in government buildings in Sukkur, where 12,000 flood-hit people were being provided two-time meals.
In Matiari, Saeedabad is completely submerged and its four union councils were inundated.
In Larkana, up to 90pc water drained out from urban areas but about 40pc of the roads connecting to main roads were underwater, he said.
Around 35,000 people were in relief camps and 300,000 displaced people were in roadside tents and mud heaps.
Major cities cleared from rainwater included Sanghar, Tando Adam, Shandapur, Sinjhoro, Shahpur Chakur, Khipro, and Hathungo.
Relief items
Talking about the demand-supply position of different items as of Thursday, Mr Shah said that against 471,900 tents, 119,757 had been provided to 24 districts. Of the 640,700 mosquito nets needed, 503,345 have been provided. The demand for tarpaulin sheets was 183,300, of which 76,810 had been distributed.
On the whole, one million tents, three million mosquito nets, two million ration bags for two months, one million jerry cans, one million kitchen sets, 500,000 plastic mats, 500,000 woollen mattresses, and one million tarpaulins were required.

2,Flood victims’ families to receive Rs1m each: PM,Illegal construction along rivers banned in Gilgit-Baltistan.,"GILGIT: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday visited a flood-affected village in Ghizer district of Gilgit-Baltistan and announced special packages for the victims of the climate disaster as well as rehabilitation work.
Accompanied by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Fahd Husain, officials from the National Disaster Management Authority and National Highway Authority, the premier arrived at Gilgit airport on Friday morning. 
He was received by his Adviser on Kashmir Affairs and GB Qamar Zaman Kaira, opposition leader in the GB Assembly Amjad Hussain, PML-N GB president and former chief minister Hafeezur Rehman and GB Chief Secretary Mohyuddin Ahmed Wani.
The PM visited the flood-hit Bubar village where he was briefed about relief activities. He was told that the devastating floods had killed 17 people and damaged 249 houses in the village. Moreover, 794 animals and several orchards were washed away.

Illegal construction along rivers banned in Gilgit-Baltistan

Mr Sharif met with the families of flood victims and directed the authorities concerned to pay compensation of Rs1 million to each family that had lost a dear one. He also ordered construction of a five-kilometre metal road to facilitate the villagers, besides announcing Rs100m for the rehabilitation of the village.
According to the GB chief secretary’s office, the PM announced Rs3 billion for rehabilitation and reconstruction in the region. He also directed the NHA to help build six damaged bridges in Ghizer district, adding families in the 10 affected union councils would receive Rs25,000 each.
Furthermore, PM Sharif annou­nced Rs5m for a differently-abled girl who had lost six siblings, her mother and grandmother in Bubar village. He also directed to create an endowment fund in her name as well as ensure her physical wellbeing. A statement from the CS office said the compensation amount would be handed over to the aggrieved families by Saturday morning.
Earlier at a ceremony at the airport, the PM distributed compensation cheques among those whose houses had been either completely or partially destroyed by the Shisper Glacier in Hunza.
Separately, the GB government protested over the PM ignoring the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led GB government during his visit. GB Chief Minister Khalid Khurshid Khan and his cabinet members visited Diamer to review relief work.
Addressing a press conference here, GB Information Minister Fatahullah Khan said a special committee had been formed to monitor the flood situation across the region. GB did not generate its own revenue and managed its financial matters through federal grants.
Meanwhile, the GB government on Friday imposed a ban on illegal constructions along rivers and nullahs. Reportedly, illegally constructed residential and commercial buildings along rivers and nullahs across GB had caused diversion of flood waters, creating disasters in residential or agricultural areas.
According to a statement, a three-member committee was constituted under the home secretary to work with all commissioners and deputy commissioners to remove encroachments that harmed public life. Using GIS technology and remote sensing, risk hot-spots would be identified and strict action initiated. Another committee was constituted to resolve issues related to land reforms. The local government and law department were asked to expedite legislation on building bylaws.

3,Three siblings killed as truck ploughs into survivors’ tent,BADIN: Three members of a rain-affected family were killed when a dump truck loaded with coal rammed into a tent set...,"BADIN: Three members of a rain-affected family were killed when a dump truck loaded with coal rammed into a tent set up for internally displaced persons near a nullah, some 14km from here, on Friday.
According to the police, the family belonging to the Sami community were sleeping in the tent adjacent to the road near Ameer Shah Drain, Allahdino Shah village, when the dump truck hit it. Inayat, 22, and his sisters Afshan, 12, and Waseema, 14, died on the spot.
There are over 40 flood-stricken families living in the temporary shelters for about two weeks on food and water being provided by the authorities.
Angry people blocked the highway by putting dead bodies over there and raised slogans against the district administration. They were demanding justice.
The government has constituted relief committees to reach out to the affected families and support them in a transparent manner. However, these committees have failed, claimed an area resident Advocate Zahid Hussein Chadhar, adding homeless people had been left to die on the streets. He demanded a murder case be registered against the officials concerned. Badin Deputy Commissioner Agha Shahnawaz Khan and other officials visited the scene of the accident. The protesters called off their protest, after an assurance was given to them that justice would be provided to them. The DC also ordered deployment of police in the area, the driver was arrested and the truck was impounded.

4,LHC strikes down FBR notices to hundreds of taxpayers,Petitioners argue that non-disclosure of bank details in tax returns not an offence under anti-money laundering law.,"LAHORE: In a landmark decision, the Lahore High Court has allowed hundreds of petitions by taxpayers challenging the notices issued by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) under anti-money laundering law. 
While pronouncing the verdict reserved on the set of petitions, Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza on Friday set aside the impugned not­ices issued to the petitioners. The court had earlier stayed implementation on the notices as an interim relief to the petitioners.
The taxpayers submitted that FBR had issued notices to them under the Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2010 over missing details of bank accounts in income tax returns.
They argued that non-disclosure of bank details in the tax returns did not make it an offence under the anti-money laundering law. 
Also, the petitioners reminded the court that the FBR lacked jurisdiction to invoke the law against money laundering in the cases from the period before 2020. The prosecution side further argued that the FBR had violated Supreme Court judgments by directly issuing the notices to the petitioners.
In his arguments before the court, the counsel for FBR opposed the petitions, insisting that the impugned notices had been lawfully issued to provide the petitioners an opportunity to be heard.

5,"Govt bound to hike gas prices, fuel GST under IMF deal","Pakistan will withdraw more tax exemptions, privatise 4 state-owned firms, get asset details of members of cabinet and parliament.","ISLAMABAD: The government has committed more utility price shocks under a straightjacket implementation plan with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) involving an over 53 per cent increase in gas rates, the revival of general sales tax on petroleum products and withdrawal of more subsidies.
The IMF released a deta­iled 112-page country report on Friday on the completion of the seventh and eighth reviews of the extended fund facility (EFF), under which Pakistan has also committed to ensure electronically filed tax and asset details of grade 17 to 22 officers and members of the cabinet and the parliament and make them available to “authorised entities” — not to the public — besides globally acceptable comprehensive review of the anti-corruption institutional framework, particularly the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).
The authorities have also given an undertaking to privatise four state-owned entities (SOEs) — a bank, a development finance institution and two LNG-based power plants — this year, besides immediately setting up a central monitoring unit in the finance ministry to control the financial management of other SOEs to improve their performance.
The government has also promised that as it had cleared the tariff backlog, would not tamper with the power tariff determinations to be given by the power regulator Nepra, and timely allow uninterrupted implementation of all revisions in annual base tariff, quarterly adjustments and fuel price adjustments.

Pakistan will withdraw more tax exemptions, privatise four state-owned firms, get asset details of MPs

On top of this, the government would stagger capacity payments to power producers, either through renegotiated power-purchase agreements or lengthening the debt repayment duration to contain rising circular debt, which stood at Rs2.253 trillion by the end of June even after Rs564bn budgetary payments.
The IMF found the provincial cash surplus commitments of Rs750bn and petroleum development levy (PDL) target of Rs855bn as potential risks given the political atmosphere, particularly ahead of an election year, and secured a contingency plan from the government to make up for slippages.
The Fund also pointed out the violation of more than a dozen structural benchmarks, performance criteria and indicative targets of the programme, mostly on the part of the previous government, and gave tacit approval to phasing out exchange controls and import curbs at the earliest but insisted on tighter monetary and fiscal policies albeit with full return to a market-based exchange rate. 
Read: A pyrrhic victory
The government has given a commitment to the IMF to recover about Rs786bn from gas consumers during the current year — about Rs120bn higher than 45pc increase in gas rates determined by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) for June to generate an estimated revenue of Rs666bn.
As a result, the gas tariff would be higher by 53pc to scale down the gas sector circular debt that the government put at Rs1.230tr as end-March.
Based on the receipt of Ogra’s determination, “we are now in the process of implementing more than the prescribed increase in consumer gas prices”, reads the undertaking given by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail to the IMF who promised a mechanism for regular updates of the end-user gas price, while also rationalising gas subsidies and implementing the structural pricing changes through the weighted average cost of gas.
The IMF report said the government had committed to priority measures, such as establishing an asset declaration system with a focus on high-level public officials, including federal cabinet members (end-March SB, reset to end-September), and publication of a comprehensive review of the anti-corruption institutional framework — NAB — by a task force with the participation of independent experts with international experience and civil society organisations (new end-January 2023 SB).
Under this target, to advance transparency, accountability, and integrity in the public sector, “we will issue regulations to establish an electronic asset declaration system that is comprehensive (i.e. covering assets beneficially owned or located abroad, including those of spouses, children and benamidars), centrally held with the Federal Board of Revenue, covering federal civil servants of Basic Pay Scale (BPS) 17 to 22, accessible to entities authorised by law (including banks for the limited purposes of conducting customer due diligence as required for the provision of banking services), and effectively verified”, it said.
Moreover, a task force, to be established by the law ministry and undertaken in consultation with the finance ministry, with participation and inputs from reputable independent experts with international experience and civil society organisations, will complete and publish a comprehensive review of the institutional framework of anti-corruption institutions to enhance their independence and effectiveness in investigating and prosecuting corruption cases, with proposals for legislative amendments as appropriate (new end-January 2023 SB).
Moreover, the government would strengthen financial institutions and other reporting institutions in improving their capacities to identify politically exposed persons (PEPs) and apply enhanced due diligence measures.
The IMF said the approved budget and the initial implementation of PDL increases and power tariff adjustment provided a strong signal of the authorities’ determination to implement commitments as agreed.

Yet, the fiscal risks to the programme were considerable, including from the government’s ability to raise the projected revenue from a number of novel taxes and staggered PDL implementation (with 90pc revenue generated in the last three quarters), the provincial commitment to deliver the historically high surpluses agreed, and the significant containment of current spending relative to GDP in a pre-election year.
In view of these risks, the government has committed to triggering contingency measures at the earliest signs of fiscal programme underperformance.
As soon as monthly data show signs of underperformance against programme revenue targets (for example, if data for an early month within a quarter suggest risks to quarterly performance), the government has committed to activating contingency measures as needed, including immediately increasing GST on fuel as a prelude to reaching the standard 17pc rate, further streamlining GST exemptions including on sugary drinks and other unwarranted exemptions, such as those benefiting exporters including those in financing facilities and energy prices.
The report said authorities were working with the World Bank on a “subsidy rationalisation for tube wells for large agricultural users and promised to submit a concrete reform proposal to the cabinet by November this year. The government has also committed to pursuing other reforms by increasing private participation in power distribution companies (Discos) to improve their governance and efficiency.

6,"Back off or we march on Islamabad, Imran warns centre","Squad car in PTI chief’s convoy catches fire on way back from event, no one hurt...","LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan on Friday issued a ‘fresh warning’ to the Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government about marching on Islamabad if it “continued to torture” his party’s leaders and workers. 
Addressing a public gathering at Gujrat’s Zahoor Elahi Stadium, Mr Khan said his chief aide Dr Shahbaz Gill was tortured in custody, while in Sindh, 27 FIRs have been launched against Opposition Leader Haleem Adil Sheikh. 
Using a cricketing analogy, Mr Khan said the current political situation was that point of a match where the PDM government cannot win against the power of people. 
Rallying the youth to be prepared to join his movement for haqeeqi azadi (real independence), he alleged that the ‘imported government was acting on the instructions of foreign powers’.

Criticising the government over the recently-approved IMF loan tranche, Mr Khan said during his government, then opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif used to say that the government has given up the country to IMF. 
He also said that despite oil prices going down in the international market, the “imported government” has increased the price of petrol to Rs236 per litre. 
He reiterated that he tried to pursue an independent foreign policy and said “absolutely not” to the US. 
Stating that the current government would never purchase cheap fuel from Russia, Mr Khan said that he feared the leaders would allow foreign forces to use Pakistan soil for their war. 
Talking about the devastation from floods, Mr Khan said that the funds of Punjab and KP chief ministers have already received over Rs5.5 billion. 
However, he added that the money will be distributed all over the country as per the needs and that he will soon collect more funds. 
“I am starting my visits to flood-hit areas,” he said, adding that he will also continue holding rallies as he is preparing the nation for his movement. 
As Mr Khan was on his way back from Gujrat to Islamabad, one of the squad cars in his convoy caught fire, apparently due to a short circuit, near Rawat police station, late Friday night. 
According to police officials, the security personnel travelling in the vehicle jumped out to save themselves and no one was hurt. 
Security sources said the PTI chairman’s convoy continued its journey towards Islamabad and the damaged vehicle was taken off G.T. Road.
