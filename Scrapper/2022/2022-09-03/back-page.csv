0,Alvi seeks ‘political pause’ amid floods as Imran campaigns,Says he will volunteer in personal capacity to mediate between political parties on major issues like elections.,"ISLAMABAD: President Arif Alvi on Friday urged political parties to pause their political activities owing to the devastating floods, saying any narrative that created divisions within national institutions was not in the national interest.
The president also urged all stakeholders to launch a nationwide drive to mobilise the nation of the country.
Dr Alvi’s comments came on the same day his party chief and former prime minister Imran Khan addressed a public meeting in Gujrat. Mr Khan had also held a rally in Sargodha on Thursday.
President Alvi said although as the president he did not have a constitutional obligation to play a role to defuse the current political polarisation, he would volunteer in his personal capacity to mediate between them over major issues like the next elections, a consensus-based economic charter, and the way forward on making key appointments.

President approves bill suggesting death penalty for drug trafficking

“Businesses, civil society and humanitarian organizations should assist the civil and military administrations in their rescue and relief efforts to rehabilitate the flood victims and for the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure,” the president said during a meeting with media persons.
In reply to a question, the president reiterated that no institution, including the judiciary and the army, should be used 
for political point-scoring as such comments were not in the greater national interest.
“We need to understand that any comment, narrative or analysis, having the potential to create divisions within institutions or between institutions and people of Pakistan, could never be in our national interest.”
Talking about the use of social media, Dr Alvi said certain users following a political party or a leader trolled and initiated derogatory trends against certain individuals and institutions without the knowledge or consent of the party or leader they supported. Such unverified attributions added to polarisation, he added.
President Alvi highlighted that the climate catastrophe had affected more than 33 million people, while 1,100 people, including over 350 children, had lost their lives. He emphasised the need for launching a nationwide drive for increasing forest cover in the country, shifting from fossil fuels to alternative means of energy and building delay-action and large dams to minimise the effects of climate change.
Moreover, he said, Pakistan had always pursued friendly and cordial relations with all countries. In reply to a question, he endorsed the Foreign Ministry’s statement and expressed concern over the allegations by Afghanistan’s acting defence minister regarding the use of Pakistan’s air space by US drones for operations insdie Afghan­istan.
In the absence of any evidence, as acknowledged by the Afghan minister, such unfounded allegations were highly regrettable, the president said, and reaffirmed Pakistan’s belief in the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states.
Anti-Narcotics Bill: President Alvi approved the Control of Narcotic Substances (Amendment) Bill 2022, making it into law, which suggested death punishment as a maximum sentence for drug trafficking. 
“The bill provides death or life imprisonment for offences related to the illicit trafficking of narcotics and psychotropic drugs of varying quantity, including heroin, morphine, cocaine and methamphetamine (ice),” said a press release issued by the Presidency.
The law provides imprisonment, which could extend to life imprisonment, but not less than 20 years with a fine not less than Rs1 million for offences involving heroin and morphine of four kilogrammes or more. It also provides a punishment of death or imprisonment, which shall not be less than life, along with a fine up to Rs2m but not less than Rs1.5m for offences involving heroin or morphine of 6kg or more.
The law provides for punishment of death or imprisonment for life not less than 20 years along with a fine of at least Rs2.5m for offences involving 5kg cocaine or more, and similar punishments for psychotropic substance methamphetamine (ice). 
It provides for maximum punishment if the offence involving a drug or psychotropic substance is committed inside or near an educational institution.

1,Hamza back from UK amid arrest fears,He left the country after his name was removed from the no-fly list by his party’s govt in the Centre.,"LAHORE: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s son, Hamza Shehbaz, on Friday returned to the country amid apprehensions of his arrest after staying for nearly a month in London where his uncle PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif has been living in self-imposed exile since November 2019.
Only a few party workers reached Allama Iqbal International Airport to receive the former chief minister.
While maintaining a low profile, Hamza had left the country after his name was removed from the no-fly list by his party’s government in the Centre. Before the PML-N-led coalition government took over in April, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government had stopped him at the airport from leaving for the UK.
The PTI leadership alleged that “brutal action” against its party leaders and supporters during the party’s May 25 long march on Islamabad was unleashed by Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and the then chief minister of Punjab Hamza Shehbaz. While PTI-PML-Q coalition government in Punjab registered a case against interior minister Sanaullah under terrorism charges, and booked 13 PML-N MPAs for hooliganism in the Punjab Assembly, it has not nominated the ex-CM in the case.
Despite securing warrants for their alleged involvement in the violence in the Punjab Assembly during CM’s election on April 16, the Punjab police earlier failed to arrest a dozen of provincial lawmakers belonging to the PML-N who managed to flee to Islamabad, where their party is at the helm of affairs. 
Some PTI leaders reportedly blamed the “poor strategy” of Punjab Home Minister Hashim Dogar for a botched operation to arrest the PML-N legislators.

2,Suu Kyi sentenced to three years for poll fraud,Latest sentence takes total jail time Suu Kyi is facing to two decades.,"YANGON: A Myanmar junta court sentenced ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi to three years in jail “with hard labour” on Friday, for electoral fraud in the 2020 polls that her party won in a landslide, a source said. 
The latest sentence, handed down by the closed court, takes the total jail time she is facing to two decades. She was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment with hard labour, a source with knowledge of the case said, adding that Suu Kyi, 77, appeared to be in good health. 
Her lawyers would appeal the ruling, the source added. 
Detained since a coup last year, Suu Kyi had already been convicted of corruption and a clutch of other charges by a closed junta court and sentenced to 17 years in prison. 
Ex-president Win Myint, who was on trial for the same charge, also received a jail sentence of three years, the source said. 
The military alleged widespread voter fraud during the November 2020 election, won resoundingly by Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD), although international observers said the poll was largely free and fair. 
The military has since cancelled the result and said it uncovered more than 11 million instances of voter fraud. 
Last month, junta chief Min Aung Hlaing said the military was being “lenient” on Suu Kyi and could have taken “more serious actions” against her.

3,SC to take up ‘hate campaign’ plea against Imran on 8th,Petitioner seeks appointment of commission to assess impact of the alleged party drive against national institutions.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court will, on September 8, resume hearing of a petition seeking the appointment of a commission to assess the impact and damage of the hate campaign allegedly being run by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leadership against national institutions such as the Election Commission of Pakistan, the judiciary as well as the armed forces. 
The petition, moved by Advocate Qausain Faisal through his counsel Hassan Raza Pasha, sought an order to restrain the respondents, including the PTI leadership, members and their official spokesmen, from making any public or private statement.
The matter will be taken up by a two-judge SC bench comprising Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan and Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi. 
During a chamber hearing on July 18, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah ordered fixation of the matter before the court while setting aside the objections raised by the registrar office regarding its filing directly before the SC without exhausting other forums first.

Petitioner seeks appointment of commission to assess impact of the alleged party drive against national institutions

Later on Aug 8, a two-judge bench, also headed by Justice Ahsan, heard the matter and questioned the counsel to convince how it fell within the criteria of public importance and could it intervene in a petition under Article 184(3) against private respondents on the grounds of public interest.
The respondents in the petition include the federation through the interior secretary, Mr Khan, former ministers Fawad Chaudhry and Shireen Mazari. It sought a directive for the formation of a commission to assess damage from the ‘hate campaign’ and suggest legal steps and proceedings to determine individual liability as well as collective responsibility and to stop the organised hate campaign against national security that adversely affected Pakistan’s relations with friendly countries.
The petition also a directive to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, Federal Investigation Agency, the regulatory bodies, law enforcement agencies and the ECP to check the alleged hate campaign immediately and strictly deal with the violators and contemnors. 
It argued it was a matter of public knowledge that since his ouster, former prime minister Imran Khan had been issuing alleged “unfounded, provocative, highly defamatory and derogatory” statements in interviews, political rallies or other means, in print and electronic media, including social media.
This alleged campaign, the petition contended, was designed and calculated to tarnish the public image and severely harm the good reputation of the judiciary, the armed forces and the ECP. 
It alleged Mr Khan organised and planned the hate campaign with active administrative and financial support of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and therefore the private and public elements in organisation, logistics and running of the impugned hate campaign were no more distinguishable. The respondents were ‘recklessly and wantonly’ issuing statements, which continued to damage and erode Pakistan’s good relations with established partners in the international community, it stated.

4,Top pro-Taliban cleric among 18 killed in Afghan mosque blast,FM Baradar condemns Mujibur Rahman Ansari’s killing...,"HERAT: A suicide bomber struck one of the biggest mosques in western Afghanistan on Friday, killing at least 18 people, including an influential prayer leader who earlier this year called for those who commit “the smallest act” against the government to be beheaded.
Images posted on Twitter showed what appeared to be blood-stained bodies scattered around the compound of Gazargah Mosque in Herat.
Violence has largely declined since the Taliban returned to power last year, but several bomb blasts — some targeting minority communities — have rocked the country in recent months, many claimed by the militant Islamic State group.
At least 18 people, including prominent pro-Taliban cleric Mujibur Rahman Ansari, were killed and 23 wounded in Friday’s suicide attack, said Hameedullah Motawakel, spokesman for the governor of Herat province.

FM Baradar condemns Mujibur Rahman Ansari’s killing

“The bomber came near Ansari and then set off his explosives-laden vest,” Motawakel told AFP.
Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Ghani Baradar, who had met Ansari just hours earlier in the day at a separate gathering in Herat, condemned the cleric’s killing.
“A strong and brave religious scholar of the country was martyred while performing Friday prayers,” Baradar said on Twitter.
“The perpetrators of this heinous act will be punished.” No group has so far claimed the attack.
Ansari, who was in his late 30s, was an influential cleric known for his fiery speeches.
In July, during a religious gathering in Kabul, he strongly defended Afghanistan’s new Taliban rulers.
“Whoever commits the smallest act against our Islamic government should be beheaded,” he said.
“This (Taliban) flag has not been raised easily, and it will not be lowered easily.” Even before the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, the ultra-conservative cleric had been calling for women to be fully covered in public, and for bans on musical concerts in Herat.
In his speeches, he used to regularly launch tirades against the previous US-backed governments.
Ansari is the second pro-Taliban cleric to be killed in a blast in less than a month, after an August 11 suicide attack targeted Rahimullah Haqqani at his madrassa in Kabul.
Haqqani was known for angry speeches against IS, who later claimed responsibility for his death.
He had also spoken in favour of girls being allowed to attend secondary school, despite the government banning them from attending classes in most provinces.
Several mosques across the country have been targeted this year, some in attacks claimed by IS.
At least 21 people were killed and dozens more wounded on August 17 when a blast ripped through a mosque packed with worshippers in Kabul.
IS has primarily targeted minority communities such as Shias, Sufis and Sikhs.
While IS is a Sunni militant group like the Taliban, the two are bitter rivals and greatly diverge on ideological grounds.
Government officials claim that IS has been defeated but experts say the group is the main security challenge for the country’s current Taliban rulers.

6,"Floods in Pakistan pose a threat to Afghanistan food supply, warns UN","""With roads that have been washed away, that presents us with a major logistical challenge,"" says WFP country director.","GENEVA: The devastating floods in Pakistan will place huge strains on efforts to get food into Afghanistan to relieve its catastrophic humanitarian crisis, the United Nations warned on Friday.
The UN’s World Food Programme said much of the food aid transited through Pakistan by road — a network that has been severely affected by the worst floods in the country’s history. “We’re focused absolutely on the needs of the people in Pakistan right now but the ramifications of what we’re experiencing here go wider,” WFP’s Pakistan country director Chris Kaye said.
“We’re becoming very, very concerned about the overall food security, not only in Pakistan in the immediate and medium term, but also for what it’s going to imply for the operations in Afghanistan.
“Pakistan provides a vital supply route into Afghanistan,” he said. Large amounts of its food enter via the port of Karachi.
“With roads that have been washed away, that presents us with a major logistical challenge,” Kaye told reporters in Geneva, via video-link from Dubai.
“WFP has procured over 320,000 tonnes in the past year to support operations in Afghanistan. The floods in Pakistan are going to put a huge dent in that capability.” 
He said there was a “major problem” in restoring agricultural production in Pakistan to feed its own people and continue supplying food to Afghanistan.
A further issue was that the wheat harvest was being stored in flooded areas of Pakistan, and “a large proportion of the wheat has been washed away”.
He said the food security situation in Pakistan was “grave” even before the floods, with 43 per cent of people food insecure and the country ranking at 92 out of 116 on the Global Hunger Index.
Monsoon rains have submerged a third of Pakistan, claiming more than a thousand lives since June and unleashing powerful floods that have washed away swathes of vital crops and damaged or destroyed more than a million homes.

7,India unveils first indigenously-manufactured aircraft carrier,INS Vikrant will formally enter service after 17 years of construction and tests...,"KOCHI: India debuted its first locally-made aircraft carrier on Friday, a milestone in government efforts to reduce its dependence on foreign arms and counter China’s growing military assertiveness in the region.
The INS Vikrant, one of the world’s biggest naval vessels at a length of 262 metres, will formally enter service after 17 years of construction and tests.
“Today, INS Vikrant has filled the country with a new confidence, and has created a new confidence in the country,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the ship’s commissioning ceremony in Kerala state.
“We’ve joined the league of those select nations who can construct such large aircraft carriers at home,” he added.

INS Vikrant will formally enter service after 17 years of construction and tests

Around 1,600 sailors will crew the Vikrant, which will initially service fighter jets re-designated from India’s only other aircraft carrier.
That vessel was bought second-hand from Russia, which has long been a major arms supplier to New Delhi.
Modi’s government has sought to wean the country off its dependency on foreign military purchases and build a domestic defence hardware industry.
It has invested heavily in local construction, with more than three dozen other naval ships and submarines currently being built in the country’s shipyards.
The outlay comes at a time of increasing concern among military top brass over the strategic challenge posed by China’s increasing presence in the Indian Ocean.
Last month New Delhi joined Washington in raising security concerns when Sri Lanka allowed a port visit by a Chinese research vessel accused of spying activities.
India and the United States are both members of the so-called Quad, a security alliance focused on the Indo-Pacific and aimed at providing a more substantive counterweight to China’s rising military and economic power.
“The security concerns of the Indo-Pacific and the Indian Ocean region were ignored in the past, but it is our top priority today,” Modi said.
New naval flag
Friday’s commissioning ceremony also saw the unveiling of a new naval flag without a British colonial symbol left over from India’s colonial era.
The new ensign replaces a prominent Saint George’s Cross, the national flag of England, with the royal seal of the Hindu warrior-king Chhatrapati Shivaji.
“It is a historic date, we’ve made history and discarded a sign of our subjugation,” Modi said during his address.
Shivaji is lauded by many for challenging the Mughal dynasty, which ruled much of the Sub-continent prior to British colonisation, and which Hindu nationalists see as an era of foreign subjugation.
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has also backed a $300 million, 210-metre-tall statue of Shivaji off the coast of Mumbai, to be unveiled later this year.
