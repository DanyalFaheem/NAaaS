1,13 new bus routes identified in Islamabad,Nine routes within the city and four in rural areas.,"ISLAMABAD: A study carried out by the National University of Sciences and Technology (Nust) was shared with Capital Development Authority (CDA) wherein 13 new bus routes connecting several areas of the city have been identified.
The study was shared during a meeting held at the CDA Headquarters which was attended by CDA Chairman retired Capt Mohammad Usman, PML-N leader and former MNAs Hanif Abbasi, Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Anjum Aqeel Khan and officials from the CDA and Nust.
Nust was engaged by the CDA to carry out the feasibility study to identify new potential routes. 
Sources said Nust officials informed the meeting that 13 new routes had been identified and if buses were plied on these routes, the entire city would be connected in a better way.

Nine routes within the city and four in rural areas

Nine new routes are within the city and four for rural areas that include Nilor to Khana, Tramri to Aabpara, N5 (GT Road) to D-17 and from I.J.P. Road to the metro station. 
The Nust officials gave a presentation and said they would provide a hard copy of their report to the CDA soon. The civic agency will then start working on preparing a PC-I for doing civil work on the routes.
Sources said 150 buses will be required for the 13 routes. They said that the CDA, after construction work on the routes, will try to engage private operators to ply buses on them.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had directed the CDA to start an intercity bus service within one month; therefore, the CDA is making efforts towards starting the service after launching three metro bus services.
On the other hand, they said, all three metro bus services – Orange Blue and Green - which were inaugurated by the prime minister in April and July, are still offering free rides to commuters as fares are yet to be fixed by the federal government.
The prime minister inaugurated the Orange Line Metro in April, which plies from Peshawar Mor to Islamabad International Airport. He had ordered the CDA to provide free bus service to people for one month. On July 7, the prime minister also inaugurated the Green Line Metro (from Bhara Kahu to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences) and Blue Line (from Koral to Pims) and ordered the civic body to run these services free for a month.
According to sources, in July, the CDA sent a summary to the interior ministry for getting approval of the fares from the federal government. However, the government has not taken a decision.
In its summary, the CDA had proposed Rs50 for Green, Blue and Orange Line services and Rs100 from N-5 station to the airport which means that a passenger will pay Rs150 to travel from Peshawar Mor to the airport.
Sources said recently the interior ministry verbally asked the CDA to reduce the proposed Rs50 fare to Rs30 for Green and Blue line services and also reduce fare of Orange Line bus service from up to Rs150 to Rs100. 
However, sources said that so far, the civic agency had not received any thing black and white from Ministry of Interior in this regard. 
“Whenever, we receive the official letter, we will start charging fare,” said an official of CDA.
The CDA had hired services of a bus operator against Rs147 per kilometre for Orange Line service. The operator was also engaged to run the Green and Blue bus services on a temporary basis until a new contractor was hired. 
CDA officials said that if the bus service on 13 routes starts, it will provide relief to people of Islamabad. 
They said that the capital city, after GT Bus Service (which was abolished in the early 90s) had no public bus service.

On the directives of Lahore High Court (Rawalpindi bench) Judge Sohail Nasir, the district administration formed a nine-member committee led by Deputy Commissioner Tahir Farooq to collect data about illegal water hydrants and make it reasonable for the citizens.
The meeting was held with Mr Farooq in the chair. It was attended by Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) Managing Director Mohammad Tanveer and other members. The meeting was informed that the district administration has completed the survey of illegal hydrants in the area under its administrative control and found more than 89 hydrants in the district while 59 came under the area of Wasa.
The citizens of Rawalpindi are facing a shortage of 17 million gallons daily which is likely to be 35 MGD due to 318 private housing societies. Despite the presence of Rawal Dam, Khanpur Dam and around 520 tubewells, the difference in supply and demand of water in Rawalpindi city has swelled and people have to buy water from private tankers. However, private water hydrants did not get any permission from any authority to extract water from underground sources. 
Talking to Dawn, Wasa Managing Director Mohammad Tanveer said that Wasa completed a survey of the area and found 59 illegal water hydrations in the city areas.
He said that the district administration formed committee to fix the rates of water tanker charges. He said that Wasa would play the role of monitor and regulator in this regard.
He said that the agency would ensure that clean drinking water is provided to citizens through these water hydrants, adding that the team will take samples of water supplied to the consumer and will dispatch it to the laboratory for examination. “After the report of the laboratory examination, a certificate will be issued that the water is good and may be supplied to people,” he said.
He said that under the law, the supply of dirty water is banned in the province. He said that waterhydrantswould be installed with the permission of Wasa.

4,Islamabad bus stops being used for advertising without paying fee to DMA,DC says will check record and take a decision that would be in the best interest of capital.,"ISLAMABAD: In the absence of a policy, the municipal administration is facing a huge revenue loss as private individuals have been allowed to use bus stops for advertising without paying any fee.
There are bus/wagon stops which could be used by the Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA) to earn revenue through advertising and branding of different products by private companies.
However, Dawn noticed that the DMA had allotted many of such places free of cost to individuals under the so-called Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). These individuals are earning millions of rupees monthly through the branding of national and multinational companies without paying to the civic agency.
“This is a big scam involving millions of rupees. The matter warrants a proper inquiry to expose all those involved in this scandal,” said an official of the DMA.

DC says will check record and take a decision that would be in the best interest of capital

A source said some elements, who were beneficiary of this system, never tried to formulate a policy so that the DMA could directly rent out the bus stops for branding after a competitive process.
Some officials alleged that after getting bribe DMA allotted the bus stops under the so-call CSR and the practice continued for the last many years.
When contacted, DMA DirectorShakeel Arshad confirmed to Dawn that there was no policy in place for bus stop branding.
However, he rejected the allegation of bribe and said the DMA was going to formulate a policy which will be finalised soon.
“During my tenure, I have formulated many policies and will finalise this one too,” he said.
On the other hand, an official said CSR was best if carried out in the interest of the government-owned organisation and residents of the city.
However, he asked what type of a CSR the DMA had allowed when owners of companies or persons affiliated with them were themselves seen running from one office to other to get approval for using the bus stops.
“DMA is a rich department which has sufficient budget. If there is a need for establishing and repairing bus sheds it can do it from its own resources. Why private people are so interested in such deals,” said another officer.
The DMA is part of the Municipal Corporation Islamabad (MCI), which is currently ineffective as the local government in Islamabad completed its term in February last year and elections are overdue.
In the absence of the local government, Deputy Commissioner Islamabad Irfan Nawaz is looking after the affairs of the MCI as the administrator.
When contacted by Dawn, the deputy commissioner expressed surprise and said he did not know about the matter at all. He said he will check the record and will take a decision that would be in the best interest of the capital city.
Another officer said like the DMA, CDA’s environment and other wings also allowed private individuals for the so-called CSR and there was a need to look into all those cases, which were not in the interest of the city and its residents.
“All types of branding and advertisements should be allowed after competitive auction for generating revenues,” the officer said and added that during the last few years without conducting any competition some individuals were allowed advertising and branding on a pick and choose basis.

9,New provinces proposal to destroy federation: Raza Rabbani,Sees making each division a province as a crude attempt to mend fences with establishment.,"ISLAMABAD: Former Senate chairman Mian Raza Rabbani on Friday criticised PTI chief Imran Khan’s statement to make each division in the county a province and said this was a crude attempt to mend fences with the establishment who have since long advocated for it.
Addressing a lawyers’ convention in Sargodha, the PTI chief said in his opinion every division of the country should be turned into a province. He said the country had a total of 32 divisions, with Punjab having 10, Balochistan eight and Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa seven each.
He said the country’s problems can be tackled effectively if every division was treated as a province.
In the wake of the statement, Mr Rabbani said: “Such a proposal shall sharpen the internal fault lines and destroy the federation. Provinces are created when there is a linguistic, ethnic and cultural affinity; not on the basis of administrative divisions,” he said.
“This will alter the federal structure of the Constitution of 1973. It is a attempt to revive one unit, not Ayubian style but Musharraf’s local government,” he said.
Mr Rabbani said the Ayubian and Mushrraf one unit style of government had been tried and failed. “This will create vertical and horizontal polarisation in the body polity and society,” he said.
“The natural resources of the provinces will be under the control of Islamabad - the federal government. Oil and gas, whose 50pc shares under the Constitution are with the provinces, will fall in into the hands of the federal government,” he said.
He said Article 160 of the Constitution, dealing with the NFC, will need to be amended. This is the main bone of contention. “It will be a rollback of the 18th Amendment,” he said.
Moreover, he said, the parliamentary form of government will cease to exist. “A quasi-presidential or presidential form of government will be introduced,” he said.
Mr Rabbani lashed out at Mr Khan and said sometimes he (Imran) talks about Pakistan being divided into three parts, what is the political agenda behind this? Is the establishment on board?
“Is the talk of PTI getting a two third majority in the next elections linked to giving it power to amend the Constitution, to relive the Ayubian era,” he asked.

10,NA body criticises HR ministry officials for failure to ensure rights of citizens,ISLAMABAD: Expressing grief over loss of lives and destruction of properties caused by the massive flooding across...,"ISLAMABAD: Expressing grief over loss of lives and destruction of properties caused by the massive flooding across the country, a parliamentary committee on Friday took up various human rights issues, including matters related to ease of access to public buildings for differently abled persons.
The meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Human Rights, headed by Mehreen Razak Bhutto, began with prayers for the citizens who lost their lives in the floods.
After briefing the committee, officials from the human rights ministry came under criticism for failing to ensure rights of citizens. Whether it was rights for the differently abled individuals or the matter of enforced disappearances, members of the committee felt that the ministry could do more.
As the senior officials from the ministry responded that its job was not enforcement, Minister for Human Rights Riaz Pirzada elaborated that his office didnot have the powers to twist anyone’s arm.
Mr Pirzadasaid that his officelooked to other ministries and the police for enforcement of law.
“If your job is not enforcement, then how will bills be implemented?” said MNA Shaista Parvez, while she complained that little had been done for the differently abled persons.
“May I be told whether the Ministry of Human Rights has ever played any role?” said MNA Naveed Jeeva, adding: “There are human rights violations in the country till today.Then they say that the international community is conspiring against Pakistan.”
Minister Pirzada said many departments had beenweakened. Many senior officers when summoned did not respond, he said, adding his office was like a paper ship.
Qadir Mandukhel said that human rights issues were not limited only in Islamabad. “What are you doing in other provinces?” he said.
The committee decided that wherever human rights violations took place, the members should take show cause notice. “It is our job to act on the violation of human rights,” said another member.
The fact that enforcement of human rights was an ongoing problem in the world, members suggested to follow European nations where the practice of human rights was much better, and not the US.
A resolution expressing solidarity and full cooperation with the flood victims was also passed.
The committee appreciated the international community and private institutions for full cooperation in a difficult time.Pakistan is currently facing serious threats from climate change, said the resolution the resolution.Coping with climate change is a shared problem of the international community. The resolution also said developed countries should take steps to deal with and recover from such disasters.
“In these situations, basic human rights such as food, health, education, housing and women’s rights are being affected,” the resolution said.
