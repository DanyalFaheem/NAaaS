0,One person got Rs90bn out of Rs570bn concessionary loan disbursements: Miftah,Hints at quitting before 13-party govt completes its term.,"KARACHI: Criticising the lopsided distribution of subsidised loans under the Temporary Economic  Refinance Facility (TERF), Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said on Friday  only one individual received as much as Rs90 billion through the  concessionary refinance scheme.
He was referring to the facility provided by the State Bank of Pakistan, which allowed industrialists to seek long-term funding at minimal interest rates during the pandemic for setting up new units, introduced by the Imran Khan government.
“One Pakistani got Rs90bn out of  Rs570bn disbursed under TERF. One Pakistani,” he said while addressing  the student body at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) where  the Wharton-educated economist has taught as adjunct faculty in the  past.
Mr Ismail railed against the perils of pursuing the import substitution model, which seeks to replace foreign imports with domestic  production. “It doesn’t do any good,” he said while emphasising that  the focus should be on the export promotion model, which allocates  greater resources to the export-oriented sectors without creating price  distortions in the economy.

Hints at quitting before 13-party govt completes its term

Giving a hypothetical example, Mr  Ismail said the government is wont to fork out Rs2bn to an industrialist  for setting up a factory against a promise that he’ll hire workers for  Rs20,000 a month each. But setting up the factory increases imports,  which widens the current account deficit. By the time the factory is up  and running, the economy starts heating up. The government then decides  to slow down economic growth to control the twin deficits. As a result,  the industrialist sacks the same Rs20,000-a-month worker in whose name  he’d received subsidised finance of Rs2bn in the first place.
Mr  Ismail said Pakistani industrialists lacked imagination and produced  goods for local consumption instead of foreign markets. Giving the  example of a business group that sought help from his government in  setting up a 500,000-tonne factory of polypropylene, a commonly used  thermoplastic, the finance minister said it demanded a 20 per cent duty  protection for 20 years as it knew it couldn’t compete against Chinese  counterparts.
“Our industrialists, including my own family, never  set up a factory to export,” he said, noting that manufacturers should  focus on making basic goods like sewing machines that can help increase  overall exports.
He said the floods have completely destroyed  cotton and date palm crops in Sindh. The damage to crops have caused  financial losses of Rs297.3bn, Rs3.6bn and 21.8bn in Sindh, Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, respectively.
Ismail, the politician
When  IBA Executive Director Dr S Akbar Zaidi asked the finance minister why  his economic planning sounded long term in nature even though the  current government is supposed to go home in a year, Mr Ismail responded  with a hint of resignation in his tone.
“The government has 13 months, but I may not even have that much,” he said.
At least three times during the talk, Mr Ismail referred to his imprisonment under the PTI government for alleged corruption in setting  up an LNG import terminal.
“You should ask your leaders (from the  PTI) why they incarcerated an innocent man,” he said after sensing —  rather correctly — that a sizeable number of students in the auditorium  were pro-Imran Khan. When the students laughed at his remark, he said  dryly that spending five months in solitary confinement was no joke.

1,Industry mulls strike over power tariffs: FPCCI,KARACHI: The business community is contemplating going on strike due to the government’s lack of interest in...,"KARACHI: The business community is contemplating going on strike due to the government’s lack of interest in addressing their concerns regarding the exorbitant and unbearable rise in electricity tariffs, the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) said on Friday.
In a statement, FPCCI President Irfan Iqbal Sheikh said there is no way that businesses can pay Rs55-60 per kWh or per unit of electricity when accounting for all billing components, i.e., base tariff, sales tax, income tax, excise duty, fuel adjustment charges (FAC) and fixed charges. 
He said the full impact of the increase of Rs7.91 per kWh has taken effect as of September 1, and now there is no justification left to keep levying fuel adjustment charges and fixed charges on electricity bills. These should be reversed and waived immediately, he demanded.
The statement said that the decision was taken after receiving feedback from 250 trade associations and chambers under the umbrella of FPCCI.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Finance Minister Miftah must assess the brewing frustration and impending bankruptcies among businessmen as soon as possible and begin the necessary consultative process with them; otherwise, there will be irreversible losses in employment, revenue collection, exports, and economic growth, the statement said, quoting the FPCCI chief. 
The FPCCI chief said that the government has been informed that higher power tariffs are forcing busines­ses, industry, and traders’ community to go on strike.
Mr Sheikh said he is under tremendous pressure from all trade bodies, associations, chambers of commerce and sectors to negotiate with the government on their behalf. This is the most unfortunate situation of my tenure as the president of the FPCCI, he added. 
He said that despite the fact that the business community is the most peaceful and law-abiding community and generates taxes and employment, they are being incessantly forced to resort to agitation and strikes. 
He urged the government to listen to the collective concerns of the business community at the earliest.

As a result, cumulative cement despatches  (local and exports) in 2MFY23 registered a drop of 35pc to 5.336 million  tonnes from 8.235m tonnes in the same period last fiscal year.
Domestic  shipments were 4.795m tonnes as against 7.261m tonnes in the  same period last fiscal, while exports shrank to 540,957 tonnes from  974,245 tonnes.
According to data released by All Pakistan Cement  Manufacturers Association (APCMA), north-based mills despatched 4.121m  tonnes domestically in the first two months of the current fiscal year  showing a reduction of 32pc than 6.033m tonnes during July-August  2021-2022.

Domestic despatches by South-based mills during  July-August 2021-2022 were 674,436 tonnes, down by 45pc over 1.228m tonnes during the same period last fiscal year. Exports plunged by  45.65pc to 378,747 tonnes during 2MFY23 from 696,823 tonnes.
The  APCMA spokesman, while emphasizing the government to come up with  industry-friendly policies, attributed sluggish cement demand to  economic instability, day by day increasing energy costs coupled with  the currency devaluation that is having serious implications on the  industry.
He said the floods, which have hit major parts of  the country, are yet another challenge for the government as  restoration of damaged infrastructure and rehabilitation of masses need  to be addressed on a war footing to bring the country out of the  difficult situation. 
According to data from the Sensitive  Price Indicator (SPI) for the week ending September 1, 2022, cement bag  price has risen by 53pc to Rs 1,035 per 50 kg bag from Rs 673  prevailing on September 2, 2021.
Total cement despatches during August fell by 24pc to 3.296m tonnes as against 4.336m tonnes in August 2021.
Local  cement sales during August 2022 were 2.90m tonnes as compared to  3.81m tonnes in August 2021, showing a drop of 24pc. Exports declined  by 26pc from 521,468 tonnes to 387,440 tonnes.

3,Weekly inflation hits record 45.5pc,Crop damages lead to shortage of vegetables...,"ISLAMABAD: Weekly inflation continued to rise unabated largely due to the increase in food and energy prices, reaching a record 45.50 per cent year-on-year (YoY) on the week ended on Sept 1, showed data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PSB) on Friday. 
Before this, the highest ever year-on-year increase in weekly inflation, measured by PBS’s Sensitive Price Index, was 44.58pc, recorded for the week ending on August 25 and 42.31pc in the week ending on August 18.
The latest data shows that the SPI rose by 1.31pc on a week-on-week basis, mainly because of higher food prices. The week ending July 28 saw the highest week-on-week increase in inflation, at 3.68pc. 
Soaring vegetable prices due to damage to standing crops after heavy rains and floods and a massive hike in electricity rates have also contributed to higher prices. The damage to standing crops will push up the prices of vegetables in the coming weeks.

Crop damages lead to shortage of vegetables

The government has exempted duty and taxes on the import of tomatoes and onions. The duty and tax relief per kg will be close to Rs10, with little impact on tomatoes. However, the import of these products will accelerate further in the coming days.
The government has set a modest annual inflation target of 11.5pc for the current fiscal year. However, the Federal Board of Revenue, which uses inflation as one of the measures to gather additional taxes from consumers, has projected inflation at 12.8pc. Independent economists estimate inflation to remain around 25pc to 30pc.
The International Monetary Fund said in its country’s staff report that the average Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation was expected to surge to 20pc in the current financial year while core inflation would also remain elevated due to higher energy prices and the rupee’s decline.
On Aug 22, the government also revived the National Price Monitoring Committee. However, the committee has since then met once.
The SPI monitors the prices of 51 essential items based on a survey of 50 markets in 17 cities across the country. During the week under review, the prices of 31 out of 51 items increased, three decreased, and 17 remained stable.
The highest week-on-week increase was noted in the prices of onions at 42.17pc, tomatoes 13.25pc, pulse moong 7.94pc, potatoes 6.97pc, eggs 3.84pc, chicken 3.25pc, pulse gram 2.89pc, wheat flour 1.49pc, pulse mash 1.26pc, and bread 1.22pc.
As for non-food items, the price of LPG jumped 4.45pc, diesel 1.19pc and petrol 0.88pc.
On a year-on-year basis, the items whose prices jumped the most included onions 240.15pc, tomatoes 219.99pc, diesel 114.08pc, petrol 98.73pc, pulse masoor 82.44pc, cooking oil 5 litre 70.60pc, mustard oil 67.50pc, washing soap 64.81pc, vegetable ghee 2.5 Kg 63.70pc, electricity 63.01pc, vegetable ghee 1 kg 61.16pc, pulse gram 58.54pc, pulse mash 49.36pc, and LPG 45.23pc.

4,Punjab’s tax revenue collection jumps,"The overall revenue collection during this fiscal year till August end stands at Rs27.8bn, says spokesperson.","LAHORE: The Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) collected Rs13.45 billion on account of sales tax on services in August 2022, which is 33 per cent higher than the previous corresponding month’s collection — Rs10.11bn.
“The overall revenue collection during this fiscal year till August end stands at Rs27.8bn which is higher than Rs20.59bn generated during the same period of last year showing a significant increase of 35pc. This indicates a promising performance during the first quarter of FY 2022-23,” said a spokesperson for the authority.
The authority did not resort to any coercive measures for the collection of taxes rather it focused on taxpayers’ education and facilitation through training workshops and PRA’s own online complaint/facilitation portal. 
It is also focusing on broadening of the tax base through the registration of new taxpayers.
The consistent upward trend in revenue collection suggests that the authority will achieve its assigned targets successfully through adopting strategies of taxpayer facilitation and education duly complemented by the broadening of the tax base.

5,"Farmers warn of milk, meat shortages",Association urges the prime minister to remove hurdles in the improvement of livestock to save the country from shortages.,"LAHORE: Cattle farmers have warned of milk and meat shortages as most of the livestock has fallen prey to floods and lumpy skin disease.
In a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Cattle & Dairy Farmers Association of Pakistan president Shakir Umar Gujjar fears that the country may face food security issues as the recent floods have not only devastated crops but also washed away the animals spared by the lumpy skin disease.
He cautions that the shortage of fodder and livestock will lead to a skyrocketing rise in prices of milk, meat and eggs affecting the purchasing power of the masses.
He urges the prime minister to remove hurdles in the improvement of livestock to save the country from shortage of milk and meat.
Mr Gujjar claims that Pakistan can meet only 45 per cent of the fodder requirements of its livestock and the government needs to meet the scarcity of animal feed by banning the export of husk of all crops, including wheat and rice.
He regrets that husk and stalks of various crops, rice polish and the residue of rapeseed and cotton were also being exported without any hindrance while the country was facing a shortage of fodder.
If not checked, he says, the farmers will have to use imported feed which will add to their production cost otherwise the undernourished livestock will fail to meet local requirements of milk and meat and thus an exorbitant hike in the prices of these kitchen items.

6,G7 to implement Russian oil price cap ‘urgently’,"The price cap may stop an important source of financing for the war and contain the rise in global energy prices, says German minister.","BERLIN: G7 industrialised powers vowed on Friday to move urgently towards implementing a price cap on Russian oil imports in a bid to cut off a major source of funding for Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
The G7 said it was working towards a  “broad coalition” of support for the measure but officials in France urged caution, saying a final decision could only be taken once all 27 members of the European Union had given their assent.
Households on the continent have borne the brunt of rising energy prices, with governments under pressure to alleviate the pain of the resulting high inflation.
“Russia is benefitting economically from the uncertainty on energy markets caused by the war and is making big profits from the export of oil and we want to counter that decisively,” German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said in a press conference. The price cap may “stop an important source of financing for the war and contain the rise in global energy prices, he added.
