The attack, which the economy minister called an assassination attempt, comes at a time of acute political and social friction inside Argentina.
It happened as Fernandez de Kirchner stepped out of a car outside her Buenos Aires home, where hundreds of supporters had gathered. 
Video footage showed a man holding a pistol next to her head. President Alberto Fernandez said the gun had been loaded with five bullets.
“This is the most serious event we have gone through since Argentina returned to democracy,” he said in a televised address, referring to the end of military rule in 1983.
“A man pointed a firearm at her head and pulled the trigger. Cristina is still alive because, for some reason yet to be confirmed, the gun ... did not fire.” 
Her suspected assailant, whom authorities identified as a 35-year-old man of Brazilian origin, was quickly arrested by police and the weapon seized.
A divisive figure inside Argentina who was president between 2007 and 2015, Fernandez de Kirchner is on trial for corruption linked to public contracts awarded in the early 2000s.
She could face a 12-year sentence and possible disqualification from public office if convicted on the charges, which she denies. She has been widely expected to run for Senate and possibly the presidency again next year.
Argentina is mired in a deep economic crisis driven by spiralling debt levels and inflation that has triggered street protests. 
“When hate and violence prevail over debate, societies are destroyed and situations like these arise,” tweeted Economy Minister Sergio Massa, who was recently appointed to tackle the national crisis.
Heads of state and political allies around the region, including Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro, Peru’s Pedro Castillo and Brazilian presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, denounced the attack.
They expressed solidarity with Fernandez de Kirchner and voiced relief that she had not been hurt.

1,"Russia scraps gas pipeline reopening, deepens Europe’s problems",Moscow says fault discovered in Nord Stream 1 pipeline during maintenance.,"FRANKFURT: Russia scrapped a Saturday deadline to resume flows via a major gas supply route to Europe after saying it had discovered a fault in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline during maintenance, deepening Europe’s difficulties in securing fuel for winter.
Nord Stream 1, which runs under the Baltic Sea to supply Germany and others, had been due to resume operating on Saturday at 0100 GMT after a three-day halt for maintenance.
But Gazprom, the state-controlled firm with a monopoly on Russian gas exports via pipeline, said on Friday it could not safely restart deliveries until it had fixed an oil leak found in a vital pipeline turbine. It did not give a new timeframe.
Moscow has blamed sanctions, imposed by the West after Russia invaded Ukraine, for hampering routine operations and maintenance of Nord Stream 1. Brussels says this is a pretext and Russia is using gas as an economic weapon to retaliate.
“This is part of Russia’s psychological war against us,” tweeted Michael Roth, chair of the German parliamentary foreign affairs committee.
Earlier, European Union Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc should impose a price cap on Russian pipeline gas to foil what she said were Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attempts to manipulate the market.
Wholesale gas prices have rocketed 400% since August 2021, hurting European industry and households, surging first due to recovering demand after the pandemic and then rising further because of the Ukraine crisis.
“We see that the electricity market does not work anymore because it is massively disrupted due to Putin’s manipulations,” Von der Leyen said, adding that a gas price cap on Russian pipeline supplies could be proposed at the European level.
Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow would turn off supplies to Europe if Brussels imposed such a cap.

2,Biden to host Pacific leaders in bid to counter China’s clout,White House has not provided details on which countries have confirmed attendance for summit scheduled for Sept 28-29.,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden will host leaders of Pacific Island nations at a Sept 28-29 gathering in Washington, the White House said on Friday, the latest US effort to step up ties with a region increasingly courted by China.
The summit will reflect the United States “broadening and deepening cooperation on key issues such as climate change, pandemic response, economic recovery, maritime security, environmental protection, and advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific”, the White House said in a statement.
An administration official said the White House had invited 12 Pacific Islands countries, including the Solomon Islands, which in April struck a security pact with China, heightening Washington’s concern about Beijing’s growing influence.
The Solomon Islands, which switched its ties to Beijing from Taiwan in 2019, is a focal point in the escalating competition between China and the United States in the strategically vital region.
The Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji were also invited, as well as the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, and Tuvalu, which Taiwan counts among its 14 diplomatic allies.
The White House did not provide details on which countries had confirmed attendance for the summit, which had been signalled as a priority by US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman during a trip to the region last month.
During that trip, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare skipped a planned appearance with Sherman at a World War Two commemoration, and later that month his government did not respond to a US coast guard vessel’s request to refuel.
The United States has stepped up engagement with Pacific Islands countries under Biden, sending several senior official delegations and announcing plans to open embassies in the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, and Tonga.

4,Six held after protest in British parliament,"Environmental groups says protesters were ""demanding a representative democracy to decide on climate and costs"".","LONDON: London police arrested six individuals after the Extinction Rebellion environmental group staged a protest inside Britain’s parliament on Friday, while it was not in session, gluing themselves around the speaker’s chair.
Four protesters who were present in the chambers of the House of Commons were “de-bonded” and arrested with no damage to the speaker’s chair, police said.
Two others — one who had climbed onto scaffolding outside parliament and another who had glued himself to the pavement inside parliamentary premises _ were also arrested.
Extinction Rebellion had posted a photo on Twitter showing five people inside the House of Commons debating chamber holding banners reading  “Let the people decide” and  “Citizens’ Assembly now”.

 





 
Parliament is not currently sitting, and the protest comes days before a new prime minister takes office.
Certain areas of the parliamentary estate are often open to the public, although access to the debating chamber is usually restricted to guided tours.
“We are in crisis and what goes on in this room every single day makes a joke out of all of us, we cannot afford to go on like this,” one of the protesters inside parliament said in a video.
The protesters were  “demanding a representative democracy to decide on climate and costs,” the group said on Twitter.

 





 
The group said 50 people were involved in Friday’s stunt, which kicked off the first phase of their September plans. They said three of the protesters had been booked on an official tour of the building.

6,Greenpeace drops boulders on UK seabed to curb harmful fishing,LAND’S END (UK): Greenpeace said on Friday it had dropped 18 large boulders on the seabed in a marine conservation...,"LAND’S END (UK): Greenpeace said on Friday it had dropped 18 large boulders on the seabed in a marine conservation zone off the coast of south-western England to prevent “destructive” industrial fishing.
The environmental campaigners sailed to the western part of the Channel between Britain and France, loaded with the boulders of Portland limestone, each weighing between 500 and 1,400 kilograms.
The giant rocks were dropped on Thursday from its Arctic Sunrise research vessel in an area known as South West Deeps conservation zone, some 190 kilometres off Land’s End, the most westerly point of mainland England.
“We are placing large limestone boulders on the seabed to create a protective underwater barrier which will put the area off limits to destructive fishing,” Anna Diski, an oceans campaigner, said on board.
The action would make it “impossible for them to drag the heavy fishing gear along the seabed, destroying the habitat and disturbing the carbon”, she added.
Artists created a giant ammonite sculpture — inspired by the fossil often found in Portland limestone — out of one of the boulders, which was also placed on the seabed.
The names of the action’s celebrity backers and supportive politicians were also inscribed on the rocks.
“Right now, there’s an industrial fishing frenzy happening in UK waters, and what’s our government doing about it?” asked Greenpeace UK’s head of oceans, Will McCallum.
“Greenpeace UK has created this underwater boulder barrier as a last resort to protect the oceans. We’d much rather the government just did their job.” 
McCallum said it was “outrageous” that bottom-trawlers are allowed to operate on the seabed in protected areas. “They destroy huge swathes of the marine ecosystem and make a mockery of our so-called `protection’,” he added.
The action comes after the latest round of UN talks to try to secure protection for marine life in international waters broke up without agreement.

7,UN inspectors to stay at Ukraine N-plant indefinitely to ‘ensure safety’,IAEA says site has been “violated” by fighting in Ukraine.,"KYIV: United Nations inspectors spent a second day on Friday at a Russian-held nuclear plant and at least two will remain on a permanent basis to ensure safety after the International Atomic Energy Agency said the site had been “violated” by the fighting in Ukraine.
A 14-strong IAEA team visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Thursday as global concern grew over its safety in a war raging ever closer to its six reactors.
Russian troops seized control of the site _ Europe’s biggest atomic facility _ in early March.
“It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” IAEA head Rafael Grossi said on Thursday as he and part of his team returned to Ukrainian-controlled territory after a productive first visit lasting around three hours.
Mr Gross said some of his inspectors would stay at the plant “until Sunday or Monday” to “dig deeper” into some of the observations the team had made to draw up a report.
He did not specify how many stayed behind, but said the agency would retain a permanent presence there.
“We have achieved something very important today, and the important thing is the IAEA is staying here.” 
Russia’s envoy to IAEA, Mikhail Ulyanov, said six inspectors had stayed behind and that two more would remain there “on a permanent basis”.
“Six (IAEA) employees will stay at the plant for a few more days and then they will return to Vienna (the agency’s headquarters),” he told Russian news agency RIA Novosti.
“Two people will stay at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on a permanent basis.
“We welcome this because an international presence can dispel the many rumours about the state of affairs at the nuclear power plant.” The Kremlin described the inspectors’ arrival at the plant as “very positive”.
“In general, we are very positive about the fact that, despite all the difficulties and problems... the commission arrived and started to work,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
‘Stop playing with fire’ 
A shelling attack on the area at dawn on Thursday had forced one of the plant’s six reactors to close in what Ukraine’s Energoatom nuclear agency said was “the second time in 10 days” that Russian shelling had forced the closure of a reactor.
It said the plant’s emergency protection system kicked in, shutting reactor five, with the attack damaging a back-up power supply.
The shelling left only one of the six reactors working.
Red Cross chief Robert Mardini had warned on Thursday the consequences of hitting the plant could be “catastrophic”, saying “the slightest miscalculation could trigger devastation that we will regret for decades”.  
“It is high time to stop playing with fire and instead take concrete measures to protect this facility... from any military operations,” he told reporters in Kyiv.
Both sides have traded repeated accusations over who was responsible for the shelling the area around Energodar, the town which lies next door to the plant on the south bank of the Dnipro River.
Ukraine has accused Russia of storing ammunition at the plant and deploying hundreds of soldiers there.
And it also suspects Moscow is intending to divert power from the plant to the nearby Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014.

8,Millions locked down in Chinese city following coronavirus outbreak,Long lines of residents queued for testing,"BEIJING: Millions were stuck at home in China’s Chengdu on Friday after a handful of Covid-19 cases brought the megacity to a standstill.
Supermarket shelves were stripped bare this week as locals in the city -- a powerhouse economic hub in China’s southwest that is home to 21 million people -- feared a repeat of the months-long lockdown in the eastern megalopolis of Shanghai earlier this year.
Long lines of residents queued for mandatory testing, while videos verified by AFP showed supermarket shelves cleared of produce.
One local, who asked to remain anonymous, told AFP he believed “everyone was crazily stocking up for goods” because of the experience of Shanghai, which was hit by food shortages during its lockdown.

Long lines of residents queued for testing

The 25-year-old said he had been in the eastern city during its shutdown and had since been “habitually stocking up” before Chengdu’s latest measures were announced.
Under the rules, in force until Sunday, each household will be allowed to send one person out to buy groceries and essential goods per day, provided they have tested negative for Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, an official notice said.
It added that all residents would be tested for the virus, urging them not to leave the city unless “absolutely necessary”.
The mood appeared calmer on social media on Friday, with some residents saying they were able to order food to be delivered to their apartment gates and to go out to buy groceries.
Others said they had resorted to sleeping at their offices in order not to miss work.
Authorities had initially sought to quash talk of a looming lockdown, with police saying they had detained a man for “creating panic” after he warned that the city could be shut down.
His case drew online attention on Friday, with many on the Twitter-like Weibo platform questioning his punishment and calling him a “hero” for warning his fellow citizens.
Authorities have ordered multiple rounds of mass testing between Thursday and Sunday, with the city reporting 150 local Covid-19 infections on Friday, 47 of which displayed no symptoms.
China is the last major economy wedded to a zero-Covid policy, stamping out virus flare-ups with snap shutdowns, mass testing and lengthy quarantines.
That has proved increasingly challenging since the emergence of the fast-spreading Omicron strain, with all of China’s mainland provinces reporting local infections over the past 10 days.
Five districts in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen closed bars and cinemas on Thursday, with rumours of a citywide lockdown prompting a run on online grocery apps.
Last month, travellers in the southern island province of Hainan protested after more than 80,000 tourists were stranded in a resort city because of a Covid-19 flare-up.

The government of the enclave on the southern tip of Spain said all diesel fuel from tanks of the beached OS-35 had been removed. On Thursday, authorities started pumping heavy fuel oil from the vessel whose hull broke on Wednesday night.
Drone footage showed an oil slick extending way past the boom installed next to the vessel, but authorities said the leak had significantly diminished, with only sheening visible within the boom, but not collections of black oil as on Thursday.
Skimming operations inside the boom have removed some 12 tonnes (13.23 tons) of a mixture of oil and water.
It also deployed clean-up teams to remove oil from the shoreline.

10,Liz Truss almost certain to win as Tories finish voting for leader,Result of runoff between Truss and former finance minister Rishi Sunak will be announced on Monday.,"LONDON: Voting finished on Friday in the Conservative party leadership election, with Liz Truss widely expected to be named the winner next week and succeed Boris Johnson as the UK’s next prime minister.
Online and postal polls of Tory members closed after a two-month contest that saw the two final contenders tour the country taking part in hustings and televised debates.
The result of the runoff between Foreign Secretary Truss and former finance minister Rishi Sunak will be announced on Monday, before the outgoing Johnson formally tenders his resignation to Queen Elizabeth the next day.
Conservative Party chairman Andrew Stephenson thanked both candidates for taking part in the often “gruelling schedule in good spirits”.
“I know our party is ready to unite around a new leader and tackle the challenges we face as a country ahead,” he said as the ballot closed.
Voting by the estimated 200,000 Conservative party members began early last month, four weeks after Johnson announced his resignation following a slew of scandals and resignations from his government.
Truss, 47, has consistently enjoyed overwhelming support over Sunak in polling of the members.
She has campaigned to slash taxes and prioritise economic growth above all else, just as Britain faces decades-high inflation and is tipped to enter recession later this year.
“I have a bold plan that will grow our economy and deliver higher wages, more security for families and world-class public services,” Truss said in a statement, as the curtain came down on the often bitter race with her 42-year-old rival Sunak.
“If I am elected prime minister, I will never let anyone talk us down and I will do everything in my power to make sure our great nation succeeds.” 
Sunak has assailed Truss’s plans as “reckless”, warning they risk heightening inflation and eroding the country’s standing in the eyes of international lenders and markets.
He has argued his experience guiding the country’s finances through the pandemic leave him best placed to lead the UK during its current economic woes.
“We face huge challenges ahead, but also huge opportunities,” Sunak said on Friday.
“I know what it takes to get through challenging times. I did it as chancellor and I will do it again as prime minister.” 
‘Better politician’ 
Tory MPs turned on their Brexit hero Johnson after months of mishandling controversies, and favoured Sunak over Truss as the more electable leader to take them until the next general election due by January 2025.
But the party’s rank and file have rallied to Truss’s right-wing platform, even if she is a former Liberal Democrat who opposed leaving the European Union in Britain’s 2016 referendum.
“She’s a better politician,” John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said after Truss stuck to a simple script over the long, hot summer of campaigning.
“Sunak has demonstrated some of the qualities you might hope to see in a good minister. But Miss Truss has demonstrated the qualities that you need in a politician,” Curtice added.
However, whoever wins, recent polls of the wider electorate show the Conservatives face a growing challenge to retain their 12-year grip on power.

Janus, who also has two hearts, two pairs of lungs and two distinct personalities, would not have survived long in the wild as he cannot retract his heads into his shell to seek shelter from predators. But at the Geneva Natural History Museum, where he hatched in 1997, Bourgoin and her team of carers — who believe he is the world’s oldest bicephalic tortoise — can cater for his every need.
They feed him organic salad and give him daily massages and baths in green tea and chamomile. For exercise, he goes for regular walks, sometimes with music, and rides on a custom-made skateboard.
“I think it’s because of the attention we give him and our devotion that he’s still here today,” said Bourgoin. Janus, a Greek tortoise named after the two-headed Roman god of beginning and transition, also has a special party to look forward to this weekend. But it’s not all plain sailing.
He is under constant surveillance in case he flips over, which could be fatal, and survived a bladder stone operation in 2020. His heads need periodic treatment with vaseline to stop them getting sore when they rub together.
Two personalities
His two personalities also generate different moods and tastes that can occasionally lead to conflict, for example over which direction to walk.
“The right head is more curious, more awake, it has a much stronger personality. The left head is more passive and loves to eat,” Bourgoin said, adding that one head was partial to endives and the other to carrots.
