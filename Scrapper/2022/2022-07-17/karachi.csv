PTI’s Sindh chapter president Ali Zaidi told a press conference on Saturday that the party chairman would address rally in Hyderabad on July 21 and the next day he would lead three different rallies in Karachi.
“The venues of Karachi rallies will be announced later,” he said. 
He said that his party was very clear about the upcoming local government elections and its candidates were very much confident to win their respective seats amid growing popularity of the party. 
Mr Zaidi said that the former prime minister would be here “among us for two days and his presence will definitely give boost to our campaign”. 
He said that the people of Karachi had been supporting the PTI for the past one decade and hope that this trend would continue.
He also condemned the recent violence in Sindh cites on ethnic grounds and held responsible the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) for creating unrest just for what he called its short-term political gains days before the local government elections.
“The PTI has always condemned politics of ethnicity and believes in unity of the people. Every part of this country is owned by its people regardless of their ethnic, religious or sectarian backgrounds,” added Mr Zaidi.
He also wondered over the accusations from the government circle against his party for exploiting the situation in different parts of Sindh and blamed the ruling PPP for igniting violence whenever it saw defeat in elections.
“The same we see in this local government polls,” he said. “The PPP used police force for rigging in the first phase of elections in different Sindh districts and now it deliberately stayed away from maintaining the writ of the state.”
“Why the police didn’t move in Hyderabad right after the first incident was reported? Why the police allowed certain elements to disturb the law and order? The PPP wants to disturb peace ahead of [local government] elections,” he said.
He said the PTI candidates despite facing threats and insecurity in Hyderabad stood firm to contest the polls on July 24 and the overwhelming support from people of the city and Karachi suggested major success to his party.

2,"New twist as police confirm Dua’s abduction, underage marriage","IO tells court call data record analysis put Zaheer in Karachi the day Dua went ""missing"".","KARACHI: Contrary to their previous claim that the case pertaining to kidnapping of teenage Dua Zehra and her marriage was false, police on Saturday informed a sessions court that 24 persons, including her purported husband Zaheer Ahmed, had been found involved in abducting her from Karachi and shifting her to Punjab, where they solemnised the illegal child marriage.
The investigating officer of the case, DSP Shaukat Ali Shahani, stated this in a progress report filed before Additional District and Sessions Judge (East) Muhammad Mehboob Awan.
The same court has already been seized with the hearing of an application of Dua’s father seeking removal of the IO from the case for allegedly being ‘biased and partial’. On Saturday, when the judge took up the matter, no comments/reply was filed on behalf of the additional inspector general (investigation) and SSP-East (investigation) as ordered by the court on the last date.
However, the IO Shahani, who had previously recommended to the trial court to dispose of the abduction case in “C” class for being false as nominated suspects were found innocent, changed his earlier stance after ‘fresh’ investigation into the matter.

IO tells court call data record analysis put Zaheer in Karachi the day Dua went ‘missing’

He stated in the progress report that in the light of the directives issued by the Supreme Court and the trial court a medical board had conducted ‘age estimation test’, which found Dua to be between 15 and 16 years, closer to 15.
He said the statements of witnesses were recorded and the call data record (CDR) of the cell phone of suspect Zaheer was analysed, which showed his presence in Karachi on the day when Dua Zehra went missing.
He further stated that in the light of statements, circumstantial, medical and forensic evidence, held suspects cleric Hafiz Ghulam Mustafa and Asghar Ali and Zaheer Ahmed and his 21 absconding relatives had been found involved in committing the offence of kidnapping punishable under Section 363 of the Pakistan Penal Code and offence of solemnising child marriage punishable under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2013.
The IO said that Dua was still not recovered and he had approached the Sindh home department for permission to travel to Lahore to obtain custody of the girl and suspect Zaheer.
He stated that the previous IO, Inspector Saeed Ahmed Thaheem, had visited Lahore and requested the relevant judicial magistrate to hand custody of the recovered girl and main suspect Zaheer to him, but the court not only declined, but also allowed her to go along and reside with her alleged husband. 
Subsequently, the IO Thaeem filed an incomplete charge sheet with the court and requested the judicial magistrate for granting more time to complete the investigation.
IO Shahani claimed that after the investigation of the case was entrusted to him on May 30, the Punjab police informed him that they had recovered Dua and Zaheer from Chishtian and subsequently the couple was produced before the Sindh High Court on June 8, where the girl testified that she was an adult of 18 years and left her parents’ home out of her own choice and solemnised free-will marriage with Zaheer.
Without passing any order, the ADJ Awan fixed the matter on July 19 for comments by the police high-ups on the plea seeking change of the IO.
The kidnapping and child marriage case is fixed before a judicial magistrate on July 20.

5,Enthusiasm for next week’s LG polls ‘conspicuous by its absence’,"Petition in SC, demarcation confusion, boycott and rains have a deadening effect on electioneering","THE countdown has begun. The party-based local government elections in the largest city and commercial capital of the country are just one week away. Yet, a traditional festivity relating to such a huge electoral exercise is amiss thanks to heavy rains that had paralysed life over the past one week and even during Eidul Azha.  
Major contesting parties are Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan with its election symbol kite; Pakistan Peoples Party (arrow); Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (bat); Jamaat-i-Islami (scale); Pak Sarzameen Party (dolphin); Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (crane); Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (tiger); Mohajir Qaumi Movement-Haqiqi (candle); Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (book) and others.  
The Altaf Hussain-led MQM, commonly called MQM-London, has announced the boycott of the LG polls on the grounds that it has been denied political activities for the past six years.  
The candidates of these contesting parties are very much in the field but their voter mobilisation campaigns in the form of holding public meetings, corner meetings and door-to-door canvassing is almost nonexistent till date. However, one can get some idea about election activities by watching ads on social media platforms by the Jamaat-i-Islami and posters shared online by a few candidates of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan.  

Petition in SC, demarcation confusion, boycott and rains have a deadening effect on electioneering 

Even in the PIB Colony area, where a by-election on a National Assembly seat, NA-245, is scheduled for July 27, ie three days after the LG polls, election activities of candidates of different political parties have eclipsed the campaigns of local government contestants.  
For the July 24 LG polls, different political parties and candidates have made seat adjustment deals even with their rivals in various parts of the city. However, no major party has so far made an election alliance for the LG polls.  
While the contentious issue of amending the Sindh Local Government Act of 2013 to make it an empowered law in compliance with the Feb 1 directives of the Supreme Court is yet to be resolved, the demarcation and delimitation of electoral constituencies and creation of 26 towns in the seven districts of Karachi division are also adding to the confusion among the minds of ordinary citizens. The people ask as to how the district and town system will go together or whether the deputy commissioner of a district would control all the towns in that district.  
The Sindh government earlier this year had announced replacement of seven district municipal corporations (DMCs) with 26 Town Municipal Corporations (TMCs), but later withheld the formation of TMCs till the new LG elections.  
At present, not a single town has been made functional and the seven city DMCs have also passed their budgets for financial year 2022-23.  
But complications aside, voters in Karachi will elect their representatives — a chairman, vice chairman, general councillor and councillors on seats reserved for women, peasants and minorities — in their respective union committees (UCs) in the July 24 elections.  
Karachi is divided into 26 towns and these towns are further divided into a total of 246 UCs. But, since towns are not functional, the 246 UCs have been divided district wise under which District Central got maximum UCs (45) followed by East (43), Korangi (37), West (33), Keamari (32), Malir (30) and South got 26 UCs.  
And the party that would manage to win 124 UCs in the July 24 election can be in a position to get its mayor elected from the house i.e. the City Council.  
However, given the complex situation of the metropolis as well as the division of “Mohajir vote bank”, it can be safely predicted that getting a simple majority in the City Council would be an uphill task for any one party including the MQM-P that had won a clear majority in the 2015 LG elections.  
Also, it is the MQM-P that had moved the Supreme Court for postponement of the LG elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions challenging the basic structure of local governments as well as creation of electoral constituencies that it said had been made only to suit the ruling party in the province. However, the SC is yet to take up the petition for hearing and it appears the MQM-P pins hopes on it.  
But, the Election Commission of Pakistan has already completed its arrangements for holding ‘transparent’ elections in seven districts of Karachi division as well as nine districts of Hyderabad division — district Hyderabad, Tando Mohammad Khan, Matiari, Tando Allahyar, Badin, Dadu, Jamshoro, Thatta and Sujawal — on July 24.  
A total of 9,848 polling stations have been set up in the Karachi and Hyderabad divisions and 2,573 of them declared highly sensitive.

6,"JI highlights flaws in voter lists, accuses ECP  of ‘supporting’ PPP",Hafiz Naeem says political parties trying to run away from July 24 LG elections,"KARACHI: Just a week before the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad, the Jamaat-i-Islami on Saturday came up with “documentary evidence” of flaws in voter lists and accused the Election Commission of Pakistan of supporting the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) through its recent administrative decisions and key documentation.
Speaking at a press conference at the party’s Idara Noor-i-Haq headquarters, JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman questioned the role of the constitutional body and its mandate which, he claimed, had already made the upcoming electoral process controversial through its decision.
“For instance, at least 40 per cent voters and their current addresses mentioned in the lists don’t match,” he said, showing the ECP document and the copies of voters’ written complaints. “It’s creating confusion and bringing so many difficulties for the voters and the contesting parties. It’s nothing but an attempt to favour favourite political stakeholder, which is PPP. The Election Commission is openly showing overwhelming support to the PPP and the Sindh government. Who would take notice of this?”
He said the ‘favour from ECP’, and then a political city administrator, who himself was the candidate of mayor from the PPP, showed the transparency of the electoral process. 

Hafiz Naeem says political parties trying to run away from July 24 LG elections

Being urban centre of the province, he said, the ruling PPP knew that it would not be able to go out for open rigging and bogus voting on the day of polling, so it was trying its best to ‘manoeuvre things’ through the ECP.
“A political administrator in the city is itself tantamount to pre-poll rigging, but the ECP doesn’t play a role in this regard, providing a leverage to the ruling PPP in Sindh,” said Hafiz Naeem. “But still, we are here in the field to face every challenge. Other political parties are trying to run away from the elections on different pretexts, but we are determined to fight on July 24 and would not let this polls delay.”
The JI chief announced a “million calls campaign” for the local government elections in Karachi, under which one million Karachiites would be approached over the phone and asked to vote for his party on July 24 for the development of Karachi and restore its lost glory.
He also appealed to overseas Pakistanis to become a part of the campaign and convince their friends and family members in Karachi through telephonic contact to vote for JI on July 24.

Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) leaders  MNA Wazir, Alam Zaib and Qazi Tahir have been charged with committing  sedition and inciting public sentiment against security establishment by  delivering speeches at a public procession in Sohrab Goth in January  2019.
On Friday, the ATC-XV judge, who conducted the trial in the  judicial complex inside the central prison, pronounced his order  reserved after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides.
The judge granted bail to MNA Wazir subject to furnishing a surety of Rs500,000. 
Prison authorities were told to release him forthwith, if his custody was not required in any other case.
The  judge fixed the case on July 25 for framing of an amended charge  against the suspects and report for attachment of the property of those  who are still absconding in the present case.
However, MNA Wazir  would not be set free since he is facing trial in an identical case  registered against him and other party leaders at the Boat Basin police  station.
According to the prosecution, PTM leaders, including Ali  Wazir, Alam Zaib and Qazir Tahir had held a procession in a ground  behind Al-Asif Square on Jan 20, 2019, where they delivered speeches,  inciting the public against the state institutions.
The Supreme  Court had granted bail to Zaib, who was arrested in Khyber Pakhtunkhawa,  and he was released in the present case. Tahir, who was arrested in  Karachi, was later granted post-arrest bail by the trial court in the  case.
A case was registered under Sections 147 (rioting), 149  (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in  prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in  discharge of public functions), 153 (wantonly giving provocation with  intent to cause riot), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups,  etc), 500 (defamation) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7  (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 at  the Sohrab Goth police station.
MNA Wazir along with others had  been incarcerated in the Karachi central prison since Dec 31, 2020  following registration of four identical cases pertaining to hate  speech, sedition and inciting public against the state. A fifth  identical case is lodged against him at the Miramshah police station.

8,Nationalist leaders continue to blame ‘foreigners’ for Sindh strife,"Call for ‘repatriation’ of immigrants, repeal of laws to regularise katchi abadis in province","HYDERABAD/DADU: Natio­na­­list parties continued to place the blame for the violence and strife in Sindh on “foreigners” and “illegal immigrants”, saying that they were disrupting the peace and have demanded their repatriation from the province. 
The demands were raised in the meeting of Sindh Action Committee (SAC), a group comprising various nationalists parties, in Jamshoro to chalk out a strategy in the wake of this situation which has risen after the killing. 
Demanding the arrest of Bilal Kaka’s killers, who was murdered in a brawl at a hotel in Hyderabad a few days ago, the parties asked the government to arrest those involved in violence and arson, as well who they claimed were “Afghan nationals residing in the province”. 
They also sought “effective legislation” to deny identity cards, domiciles and property ownership rights to immigrants arriving  in Sindh from other parts of the country for employment purposes.  

Call for ‘repatriation’ of immigrants, repeal of laws to regularise katchi abadis in province

The nationalist leaders claimed that the influx of a large number of immigrants was part of “a conspiracy to turn native Sindhis into a minority”. 
The meeting also demanded the withdrawal of a bill, passed by the Sindh Assembly, to regularise katchi abadis and other settlements in the province. 
The meeting, headed by convener Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah, was attended by Dr Qadir Magsi, Abdul Khaliq Junejo, Ayaz Latif Palijo, Riaz Ali Chandio, Lal Shah, Masroor Shah, Arbab Bheel and others.  
Addressing the meeting, Mr Palijo lamented that no action was taken against the miscreants who maltreated families in buses at Sohrab Goth during the violence two days ago.  
He said that “disharmony and conflict were being thrust upon people of Sindh,” and urged them to remain peaceful.  
Talking to journalists after the meeting, Mr Shah called Afghan refugees “a security threat” and demanded their immediate repatriation.  
He added that nationalist leaders had decided not to hold any talks with the Sindh government unless concrete steps were taken to address their concerns. 
Separately, PTI leader Haleem Adil Shaikh and Sindh United Party president Syed Zain met in Jamshoro where the two leaders echoed similar sentiments. 
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr Sheikh demanded the government to repatriate all foreigners to their native areas, calling it “the only solution” to allay the ethnic strife in the province. 
Meanwhile, Sindh ANP president Shahi Syed also held meetings with SUP chairman Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah in Jamshoro to discuss the situation. 
‘Illegal immigrants cannot reside in the province’ 
Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon, on Saturday, said that illegal immigrants cannot reside in the province and that the provincial and federal governments would take steps to expel them. 
Addressing a press conference at Hyderabad circuit house, Mr Memon said a few miscreants had tried to disrupt the peace after Mr Kaka’s murder. 
Talking about police’s action against those involved in violence, the minister said 28 suspects have been arrested while police and Rangers have been given “full authority” to take action against saboteurs. 
He added that Sindh police chief has written to the FIA to act against those who spread hate through social media.  
Separately, country’s various left-wing and left-leaning parties condemned the killing and the following violence and attacks on Pashtun-owned hotels and businesses.  
The declaration, signed by 13 parties, while demanding thorough probe into the killing and arrest of all accused nominated in the FIR also censured the inability of the provincial and federal governments to curb the violence.

In Mirpurkhas, it rained lightly coupled with lightning and strong winds in the city and its outskirts. Several trees and signboards were uprooted at different places by the winds.
The rain also lashed Mirwah Gorchani, Digri, Jhuddo, Tando Jan Mohammad, Naukot, Kot Ghulam Mohammad and Sindhri. 
Channels develops breach
Lal Khan channel developed 30-foot breach near Haji Sawan Marri village in Sindhri taluka early on Saturday morning in the wake of continuous heavy rain, inundating several villages and about 200 acres of farmland with standing crops of cotton, sugar cane and vegetables.
Villagers told reporters that the breach occurred late in the night most probably due to increasing pressure of water flows on the channel’s weak walls which gave way because of substandard material used in its construction.
They said the water current expanded the breach to 30 foot by the morning as water entered Haji Sawan Marri and other nearby villages besides submerging farmland.
They ran for their lives and immediately started to shift their families and cattle to safe places.
They informed irrigation officials concerned but they did not arrive. The villagers then began to plug the breach on their own after succeeded to plug it after 12 hours of hectic efforts without any help from irrigation department.
They said that some officials did arrive there but returned after assessing the damage and without providing any help to the villagers. The channel had been lined in recent past with substandard material, which eventually led to the breach, they said.
They demanded the irrigation minister, chief secretary, secretary of irrigation, chairman of SIDA and director of Nara canal area water board order an impartial inquiry into the breach and use of substandard material in the channel’s lining and award exemplary punishment to responsible persons.
It rained heavily with strong winds in Shaheed Benazirabad district on the second consecutive day on Saturday, inundating roads and streets and low-lying areas.
