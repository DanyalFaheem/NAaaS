0,WB to provide $200 million to help transform agricultural sector,"It will benefit about 190,000 small, family-owned farms and 1.4 million acres of irrigated land in rural communities.","ISLAMABAD: The World Bank (WB) has approved $200 million to support Pakistan in its efforts to transform its agricultural sector by adopting climate-smart technologies to improve water-use efficiency, build resilience to extreme weather events and increase income of small farmers in Punjab.
The ‘Punjab Resilient and Inclusive Agriculture Transformation’ (PRIAT) project, approved by the bank’s executive directors on Friday, will benefit about 190,000 small, family-owned farms and 1.4 million acres of irrigated land in rural communities in the province.
It will also provide training to small- and medium-sized farm owners on water conservation and more sustainable, climate-resilient agricultural practices, including for women.
Female farmers have assumed a growing share of responsibility for agriculture in Punjab, yet there are several factors leading to their lower productivity. Approximately 74pc of women depend on agriculture as a source of livelihood, but only 40pc are formally employed. Half of the rural women are engaged as farm and family labour and around 75pc of these receive no payment for their work
Since the project is located on the Indus River, it involves rehabilitation and enhancements to existing watercourses and farm channels. Overall, the project would have positive environmental and social impacts in contributing towards resource efficiencies, livelihood improvements, crop productivity, targeting small farmers and farmers in underserved areas, and reducing conveyance and application water losses, according to the project document.
The agricultural sector in Punjab is central to Pakistan’s economy and food security as it accounts for 73pc of the country’s total food production, and the project will increase agricultural productivity through efficient and equitable access to water for small farms. It will support farmers at the community and household levels to adopt climate-smart farming practices and technologies that improve crop yields and conserve water resources in Punjab.
“In recent years Pakistan’s agriculture sector has suffered losses in crop yields and livestock, damage to irrigation infrastructure, and food shortages due to climate change, particularly severe droughts in the Punjab province,” said World Bank Country Director for Pakistan Najy Benhassine.
“This project aligns with the Punjab Agriculture Policy 2018, which promotes massive expansion of water conservation efforts, enhancing sustainability and resilience in the wake of climate change, and private sector participation to help boost the productivity of the sector,” he said.
PRIAT will support farmers implement innovative, climate-smart technologies to help the Punjab government achieve economies of scale to transform the agricultural sector. The project will engage the private sector in sourcing appropriate technologies and providing training tailored for water user associations and individual households to improve water conservation practices and agriculture productivity.
“The agriculture sector has a huge opportunity to both build climate resilience and improve economic conditions by generating access to domestic and international markets,” said Task Team Leader for the project, Guo Li. “PRIAT will help accelerate the government’s efforts to transform the agri-food system through market-oriented production activities that add value, increase competitiveness and generate higher incomes for farmers,” he said.

1,Cotton growers lament Rs4bn loss this season,"Accuse ginners of artificially lowering cotton crop prices by Rs7,000 per 40kg.","HYDERABAD: The Sindh Chamber of Agricu­lture (SCA) has accused ginners of artificially lowering cotton crop prices by Rs7,000 per 40kg, causing producers to lose Rs4 billion this season.
The SCA, which met on Saturday under the chairmanship of its president Miran Mohammad Shah stro­­ngly reacted against lower cotton prices being offered to growers. The chamber said a price of Rs4,000 per 40kg was being paid to them, which was Rs11,000 per 40kg until recently.
The chamber said farmers were facing worse economic conditions and urged that Rs10,000 per 40kg cotton price should be offered to growers and action should be taken against ginners.
The meeting urged Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to take action against this exploitation of growers. The meeting noted that prices of commodities, including cotton, were dropping while farm input prices had increased substantially. The SCA said that cotton factory owners have established a cartel only to deny the just price of cotton to them. 
The meeting noted that, so far, cotton producers had incurred a loss of Rs4bn due to this artificial decline in price. The SCA vowed not to tolerate such heinous exploitation. It urged PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari to intervene and save farmers from losses, adding that prices of cotton in the international market remained stable. 
The chamber added that it is regrettable that Sindh’s chief secretary, divisional commissioners, and deputy commissioners remained silent over this exploitation.
Growers briefed the SCA that a substantial rise was witnessed in prices of paddy crop seed and pesticides, which showed that farmers’ commodities were bought for lower prices while input costs had been increased.The meeting was atten­ded by Zahid Bhurgari, Nabi Bux Sathio, Nisar Memon, and others.

3,Clients of Celsius face long wait over fate of their funds,Crypto lender freezes withdrawals after filing for bankruptcy,"WASHINGTON: Customers of crypto lender Celsius face a long and anxious wait to know how, when and even if they will get their money back after the company filed for bankruptcy, becoming one of the biggest victims of the collapse in crypto markets this year.
Citing extreme market conditions, Celsius froze withdrawals in June in a move that reverberated through the crypto world and beyond, spurring a $300 billion selloff in digital assets and leaving legions of retail investors cut off from their savings.
Celsius Network, which is based in the US state of New Jersey, revealed a gaping $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in New York this week.
Customers should now buckle up for a bumpy ride as they await some clarity over the fate of their money, six lawyers specialising in bankruptcies, restructuring or crypto told Reuters.

Crypto lender freezes withdrawals after filing for bankruptcy

With scant precedent for bankruptcies at large crypto companies, the prospect of multiple lawsuits against Celsius, as well as the high complexity of any restructuring, the Chapter 11 process is likely to be slow, the lawyers said.
“This could last for years,” said Daniel Gwen at Ropes & Grey law firm in New York.  “It’s highly likely there’s going to be a lot of litigation.”  Celsius did not reply to requests for comment.
‘Three-dimensional chess’
When crypto markets slumped this year as surging inflation rates sparked a flight to safer assets and two major tokens - terraUSD and luna - failed, the riskier bets by lenders on wholesale crypto markets turned soured.
US crypto lender Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy this month too after suspending withdrawals and deposits, while smaller Singapore lender Vauld and Hong Kong-based Babel Finance have also frozen withdrawals.
Chapter 11 bankruptcies allow companies to prepare turnaround plans while remaining operational.
While major crypto firms have failed before, most notably the Japanese exchange Mt. Gox in 2014, there is little precedent for the treatment of customers at stricken crypto lenders, the lawyers said.
“It is, at best, unknown how the bankruptcy code and bankruptcy courts will be treating cryptocurrency companies,” said James Van Horn, partner at Barnes & Thornburg in Washington.
Creditor committees formed as part of bankruptcy proceedings will likely seek to shape any reorganisation plan decided by Celsius, three lawyers said. Creditors can also make claims against the company even as it goes through the process.
“It’s probably going to take, given the complexity, six months, at a minimum just to develop a plan to come out of bankruptcy,” said Stephen Gannon, partner at Davis Wright Tremaine.  “This is going to be three-dimensional chess.” 
‘Last on the list’
Celsius said in court filings this week that it had more than 100,000 creditors.
As of July 13, it had some 23,000 outstanding loans to retail borrowers worth $411 million, backed by crypto collateral worth $766 million, it said in a filing on Thursday.
While Celsius listed its largest 50 creditors, it made no mention of the order in which they would be repaid and many of its 1.7 million clients are individual investors.
One of them is Martin Jabou, 27, who lives in Hamilton, Canada. He put crypto assets worth about $45,000 into Celsius, though they are now worth less than half of that.
“I think we’re going to be last on the list,” he said of any repayments from the bankruptcy.  “I don’t know how to afford rent or car payments, especially with the other debts that I have.” 
Crypto lenders such as Celsius acted in a similar way to banks. But unlike for mainstream lenders, there is no safety net for people such as Jabou when crypto platforms fail.
At US banks, deposits of up to $250,000 are insured by a federal body. Broker-dealer clients are insured for up to $500,000 in securities and cash by a separate body. Similar deposit protection schemes exist in the European Union and Britain.

4,Fresh price hike threatens consumers,"Milk, flour, vegetables become costlier.","KARACHI: A new wave of food inflation has emerged despite a cut in transportation charges on account of a drop in diesel rates.
Nestle Pakistan Limited (NPL) and FrieslandCampina Engro Pakistan Limited, the manufacturers of Milk Pak and Olpers, respectively, have announced a hike of Rs20 in the price of one-litre pack, taking it to Rs200  without citing any reason in the letters handed over to market retailers.
An Olpers 250ml tetra pack and pouch now cost Rs55 instead of Rs50.
When contacted, an official at Nestle Pakistan Ltd attributed the price hike to rising inflation.

Milk, flour, vegetables become costlier

Meanwhile, an official of the Pakistan Dairy Association (PDA) said the association cannot comment on the price hike and only companies can provide answers.
The five and 10kg bags of flour by brands Bake Parlour and Ashrafi, which were available at Rs490 and Rs960 before Eidul Azha, are now priced at Rs540-550 and Rs1,050-1,100, as retailers blamed manufacturers for jacking up prices.
In the third week of June, Sindh’s flour millers raised the prices of various varieties of flour by Rs6 per kg, taking the price of flour No.2.5 to Rs88 per kg, fine and super fine flour to Rs91 per kg, and that of a 10 kg bag from Rs785 to Rs885.
General Secretary Karachi Retail Grocers Group (KRGG) Farid Qureishi said the chakki flour rate now hovers between Rs105-110 instead of Rs100 per kg.
Mr Qureishi said a number of biscuit manufacturers have increased rates from Rs25 pack to Rs30, while the pack costing Rs5 now costs Rs7.
He said that in some cases, the number of biscuits have been reduced to three from four, thus keeping the price at Rs10.
Many companies have also curtailed the supply of biscuits in the markets to release fresh stocks with new price tags, he added. Mr Qureishi said soft drink makers have also increased the rates by Rs10.
Now, 500ml sells at Rs70, while one-litre and 1.5-litre bottles are selling at Rs100 and Rs130 against Rs90 and Rs120.
“Manufacturers are passing the higher transportation charges, packaging charges, and other expenses on imported raw materials, which have risen due to falling rupee against the dollar,” he said.
However, he urged the government to check manufacturers’s claims of high production costs that are being passed on to the consumers mercilessly.
The prices of onion has risen to Rs90-100 per kg from Rs80 per kg ahead of Eid. The price of Turrai (ridge gourd) and Lokki (bottle gourd) has surged to Rs200 per kg from Rs80-100 per kg prior to Eid.
During Eid holidays, retailers charged Rs400 per kg for shimla mirch (capsicum), which has now plunged to Rs200 per kg while it was priced at Rs160 per kg before Eid. The price of okra had also risen to Rs200 per kg from Rs150 per kg, while the tomato price had dropped to Rs80-100 from Rs160 during Eid days.
Green chillies were sold at Rs200 per 250 gram during Eid days, which had dropped to Rs60 per 250 gram.
Haji Shahjehan, president of the Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market Super Highway, attributed price fluctuations to demand and supply gaps caused by heavy rains in Sindh and Balochistan, as Karachi does not produce any vegetables other than Malir peas.
Mr Shahjehan said the government has various departments but they do not have any strategy to manage supply chain mechanisms more effectively to control prices in case of any emergency like situations caused by rain and floods.

5,Govt reshaping low-cost Mera Ghar scheme,"""No one will lose their money,"" assures Finance Minister Miftah Ismail.","KARACHI:  The government is reshaping the Mera Pakistan, Mera Ghar (MPMG)  low-cost housing scheme, stating that the interest rate has gone up to  15 per cent while financing was being provided at much lower rates.
In a tweet on Saturday, Finance Minister Miftah  Ismail said the government is reshaping the scheme and assured people that no one will  lose money.
“Many people are writing to me that their loans were approved in the Mera Ghar Scheme and that they have spent money based on that approval,” said the minister.

 





 
“I want to assure you that we are reshaping this scheme and no one will lose their money,” he said, adding that he would resolve this issue within the next week.
Investors are mostly worried about interest rates, which were subsidised by the previous government to boost the housing and construction sectors.  However, the new government engaged with the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) for an agreement and has withdrawn a number of subsidies in  different sectors. The most significant withdrawal of subsidies, which  sharply increased inflation, was the price of petrol and diesel.
The  State Bank of Pakistan also increased the Export Finance Scheme rate to  10pc from 7pc and long-term finance was also increased to 10pc from  7.5pc. The investors in the MPMG scheme are rightly worried about the interest, which has been increasing with an uptick in inflation.
The  MPMPG scheme offers 3pc for the first five years, 5pc for the next five  years and Kibor+ up to 250bps for the remaining financing tenor. The  offered rates now for low-cost housing look extremely lower than the  actual policy rate of 15pc, while the IMF seems to see a withdrawal of  all subsidies available for trade, industry, and the general public.
Banks  have approved loans of Rs180 billion for low-cost housing during the  calendar year 2022, till April 11, which was eleven times higher than the last year.
According to an SBP report, till April  11, 2022, banks received applications for housing finance amounting to  Rs409bn, which was merely Rs57bn a year ago, reflecting an increase of  more than 7 times. Out of these, banks have approved applications  amounting to Rs180bn and disbursed Rs66bn against the approved  applications.
This shows an increase in approvals of applications of  more than 11 times as, a year ago, till April 2021, the banks had  approved only Rs16bn.
Banks almost doubled their housing and  construction finance portfolios to Rs404bn as of March 31, 2022 from  Rs204bn a year earlier.
By the end of 2021, banks were required to  increase their housing and construction finance portfolio to 5pc of  their domestic private sector advances. As a result, banks’ lending to  the housing and construction sector increased to Rs367bn as of December  31, 2021 from Rs148bn as of June 30, 2020.

6,Indonesia removes palm oil export levy until Aug 31,The decision by the world’s biggest palm oil exporter could further depress prices.,"JAKARTA: Indonesia has scrapped its export levy for all palm oil products until Aug 31 in a fresh attempt to boost exports and ease high inventories, finance ministry officials said on Saturday, adding the move would not disrupt government revenues.
The decision by the world’s biggest palm oil exporter could further depress prices, which have fallen by about 50 per cent since late April to their lowest in over a year.
Indonesian palm oil producers have been struggling with high inventories since the country imposed a three-week export ban through to May 23 to reduce domestic cooking oil prices.
Since lifting the ban, Jakarta has implemented rules on mandatory local sales — known as the domestic market obligation (DMO) — to keep produce at home to be made into cooking oil.
At the same time, it has tried to clear up storage tanks by cutting export taxes and launching a shipment acceleration programme, but exports remained slow and companies have blamed the DMO rules, as well as problems with securing cargo vessels.
The levy removal is intended to further support exports, Febrio Kacaribu, the ministry’s head of fiscal policy agency, told reporters on the sideline of a G20 finance meeting in Bali.
“In the context of government revenues, (the impact) won’t be too big,” he said.
Finance Minister Sri Mul­yani Indrawati said a progressive palm oil export levy would be applied starting Sept. 1, with the rate set bet­w­een $55 and $240 per tonne for crude palm oil, depending on prices.
