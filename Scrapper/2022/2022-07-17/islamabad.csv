0,PP-7 to see close contest in by-poll today,"l  PML-N’s Raja Sagheer, Shabbir Awan of PTI among six candidates vying for Punjab Assembly seat  l  266 polling stations set up;","RAWALPINDI: A tough contest is expected between the candidates of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) as residents of PP-7 (Rawalpindi-II) constituency will go to polls today to elect their representative in the by-elections being held across Punjab amid tight security.
In PP-7 which includes Kahuta and Kallar Syedan, there are six candidates in total vying for the provincial assembly seat.
The PML-N has fielded Raja Sagheer, who had earlier been elected on Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) ticket in 2018 and was de-seated last month under Article 63-A for voting against party lines, whereas retired colonel Shabbir Awan will now be contesting from the PTI’s platform.
Hafiz Mansoor of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), Raja Tanveer of Jamaat-i-Islami and independent candidates Engineer Raja Nazakat Hussain and retired colonel Wasim are also taking part in the much-hyped polls.

l  PML-N’s Raja Sagheer, Shabbir Awan of PTI among six candidates vying for Punjab Assembly seat  l  266 polling stations set up; over 4,000 police personnel deployed

In 2018, both PML-N and PTI had lost the seat while Mr Sagheer, an independent candidate at the time, won by bagging 44,363 votes. He subsequently joined the PTI government but left after Jehangir Khan Tareen parted ways with the former ruling party.
“PML-N bigwig Raja Zafarul Haq’s son Raja Mohammad Ali always contest the election on PML-N ticket from Kahuta but this time, the party decided to give a ticket to Sagheer in return for his support to Hamza Shehbaz in the Punjab CM election,” said a senior PML-N leader.
He added that there were chances of PML-N’s victory in the by-polls.
On the other hand, the PTI also appeared hopeful. A senior leader said the former ruling party was in a comfortable position despite the defection of Mr Sagheer.
“There was an increase in the support for the PTI over the last few months,” he said, claiming that there were 90pc chances of PTI nominee’s victory.
Meanwhile, political observers were of the view that there would be a tough contest between the PML-N and PTI candidates but the position of the ruling party was better.
They said Mr Sagheer had won the elections in 2018 by bagging over 44,000 votes as an independent candidate. This time, the PPP is also supporting the former lawmaker, increasing his chances to clinch the seat, they added.
Residents were not happy with the PTI due to its performance when it was in the government. A major number of disgruntled PTI supporters had left PTI for the TLP. Though retired general and former spymaster Zaheerul Islam had expressed his support to the PTI, this would not impact voters who usually polled votes on the basis of their biradari (kinship).
266 polling stations set up
A total of 266 polling stations have been set up with 787 polling booths across the constituency that has 335,295 registered voters.
The authorities declared 23 polling stations “sensitive” and decided to deploy law enforcers to secure them on the day of the election.
District Election Commissioner Roy Sultan Bhatty told Dawn that all arrangements had been finalised with the help of the district administration and the police for fair elections.
He said the election material had been dispatched and the polling staff had reached the area, adding that security would be provided to the staff and voters.
Mr Bhatty said display of weapons, firing in the air and use of loudspeakers were prohibited and strict legal action would be taken against any violation.
Over 4,000 police officers and personnel, including over 600 women police, would be deployed at 266 polling stations, a spokesperson said while sharing details of the security arrangements.
According to the security plan, City Police Officer Syed Shehzad Nadeem, Senior Superintendent of Police (Investigation) Ghazanfar Ali Shah, SSP Operations Waseem Riaz Khan and other officers would remain present in the field to monitor the arrangements.
At least 37 Quick Response Force teams (QRF) of Elite commandos would perform duty to deal with any untoward incident, he added.
The spokesperson said 133 motorcycles and eight vehicles had also been provided to the security teams while 53 police mobiles would be on patrolling duties in the constituency on the polling day.
A total of 28 police pickets had been set up in the constituency, he added.
He said special security arrangements had been made for 76 sensitive police stations, while the constituency had been divided into two zones, five sectors and 15 sub-sectors to maintain law and order. He added that the implementation of the code of conduct issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) would be ensured at all costs.

1,CEC ‘not satisfied’ with personnel deputed for his security,Raja recently called the Islamabad IG and DIG to his office and expressed displeasure over his security detail.,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja has expressed reservations over the security detail deployed to protect him. 
A senior capital police officer told Dawn on condition of anonymity that CEC Raja recently called the inspector general of police (IGP) and deputy inspector general of police (DIG) to his office and expressed displeasure over the security detail provided to him at his office and residence for security.
In April, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had sought foolproof security from the interior ministry for the CEC at the Election Commission Secretariat, his residence, as well as during his movement due to threats to his life.
In view of the threats, a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) was appointed as the CEC’s chief security officer on July 4, police sources said, adding that besides this, a team of 14 Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel was deputed at the Election Commission Secretariat, while two officials were posted at the door of his residence.
A policeman was also deployed outside the building housing Mr Raja’s residence, the officials said, adding that a police squad, comprising four policemen and the vehicle’s driver, also guarded him during his movement.
However, officials said the CEC was unhappy with the deployment of FC personnel for this purpose and asked the two senior police officers to replace them immediately.
After the PTI’s May 25 march, a contingent of 1,000 FC personnel was given to the capital police for security, the officials said, adding that 16 officials from the contingent were deputed at the Election Commission Secretariat and Mr Raja’s residence.
When contacted, the capital police spokesperson confirmed that the IGP and DIG were called by the CEC and there was a discussion over the deployment of FC personnel. 
Mr Raja asked the officers to withdraw the personnel from his residence as he did not need them there, he added.
Earlier, the chief election commissioner had also asked his chief security officer, DSP Munawer Ali Maher, to withdraw the FC personnel from his residence but he replied that they were there for his security, the spokesman said.
He said besides the FC personnel, a bomb disposal squad combed the secretariat and Mr Raja’s residence in the morning on a daily basis.
When Dawn approached CEC Raja and asked whether he had sought the replacement of the FC personnel in his security detail, he said: “I have Islamabad police and FC both, Islamabad police and interior ministry both are more than cooperative.”

2,High turnout expected,ISLAMABAD: A high turnout is expected in the by-elections in most of the 20 provincial assembly constituencies of...,"ISLAMABAD: A high turnout is expected in the by-elections in most of the 20 provincial assembly constituencies of Punjab on Sunday (today).
An unprecedented enthusiasm has been seen in the constituencies. Moreover, loyalty with political parties and leaders and past performance of the contesting parties seem to be the major factors responsible for determining the voting behaviour.
Generational divide within households regarding choice of parties appears to have disappeared in the last few days.
This is the crux of a survey conducted by Pattan on July 15 in 15 of the 20 constituencies. 
Pattan said it used random sampling method to interview male and female voters. 
The survey was conducted in 148 localities. In each constituency, 25 men and women were interviewed in person. Besides visual observation, discussions were held with well-informed persons.
The survey found 95pc respondents claiming they would cast their vote on Sunday. 
For most respondents of the survey, good performance in the past and quality of leadership of the parties were the two major factors in determining the voter’s choice.
According to the survey, the biradari factor appeared to have lost significance at least for the time being. Similarly, importance of candidates also seemed to have declined.
As high as 82pc of the respondents said all registered voters of their families would vote for the same party.
Only 6pc respondents said there was split within their families regarding choice of candidates. This means the phenomenon of the generational split regarding choice of candidates has been weakened in recent days.
The survey, however, appeared to indicate though slightly that it was in fact the elders who had moved closer to the youth.
The survey also showed the phenomenon of vote buying. However, this should not be considered in isolation as it has always been part of a larger scheme of rigging. 
For instance, more than 15pc respondents mentioned other favours/incentives too while only 6pc of the respondents said they were aware of vote-buying practice in their area.
As many as 80pc of those who said they knew vote buying practice named the PML-N while 7pc blamed the PTI and 10pc both the parties. The range of money paid against one vote varied from Rs5,000 to Rs1,000, they said.
About 6pc of the respondents reported that some form of intimidation or harassment was being practiced by local influential people in their areas.
A significant percentage (18pc) of respondents stated that the vote of someone of their family members had been shifted to other areas.
Regarding free and fair conduct of election, 47pc respondents were likely to say elections were to be free and fair, 25pc said no and 28pc refused to reply. Whether police and administration were neutral, 52pc said yes, 16pc said no and 32pc didn’t reply.
Though a small majority of the respondents were likely to be satisfied with the role of the administration and police, 25pc said they were not satisfied.

4,Survey of open spaces in markets ordered to check their misuse,"Every second shopkeeper is using an open space for commercial purpose which is not allowed, says official","ISLAMABAD: The Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) has decided to conduct a survey of open spaces in markets to check their misuse as, an official said, every second shopkeeper or business centre was using an open space for commercial purpose.
The Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA) through a letter has asked the concerned assistant director to get the survey completed within 15 days.
“It has been observed that every second shopkeeper or business venue is using open space for seating/parking purpose while as per record very few permissions are available. So you are directed to complete the survey with details of location of open spaces, the use of open spaces, permission granted by DMA or otherwise and status of dues in both cases whether used with permission or without permission,” read the letter.
The DMA allots open spaces to shopkeepers against about Rs450 per square yard annual rent. Sources said open spaces were well defined and as per planning standards these were meant for beautification, not for commercial use.
However, the DMA, on the basis of a decision of the CDA board (as earlier DMA was part of the CDA), has been allotting open spaces to shopkeepers.
The sources said hardly less than 200 shopkeepers had been paying rent to the DMA for the open spaces while the rest were using them free of cost.
“The idea to allot open spaces was not bad. In Europe and other developed countries, you will find out seating places outside restaurants and shops. But here, people are misusing this facility and in many markets they have encroached upon footpaths and verandas,” said an official of the MCI.
“Just because of the failure of the DMA, in many markets shops and kitchens of hotels have been set up in verandas which are meant for public walk,” the official said and added that the DMA office was located in G-7 and Khadda Market and Sitara Market in the sector were full of encroachments and many shops had been built in streets and verandas. Similarly, the condition of other markets is not different, he said.
“So to restore the beauty of Islamabad, the DMA should get all open spaces (allotted or un-allotted) vacated from encroachers,” he said.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in January this year started a probe into encroachments in various markets of Islamabad.
The FIA’s corporate crime circle, through two letters, to the MCI had sought details of restaurants and cafes which were allegedly using state land.
“Reportedly, several restaurants/cafes/plazas in F-7, F-8, F-10 and F-11 Markaz are using government land specified for green planters in their front by making paved concrete sit-out platforms with fixed and permanent structures like tiles, Astroturf, benches, canopies, light poles, fountains and fences for private use,” read one of the letters dated January 15.
It sought details about six eateries, asking the DMA to share with the agency any permission granted to the restaurants for using green planters. Through another letter dated Jan 24, the FIA directed the DMA to submit additional information as well.
“Is there any mechanism to check whether all restaurants are occupying that portion of land which is allowed to them or they have increased encroachments?”
In almost all markets, encroachments have been made on state land. In G-9 Markaz, F-10 Markaz, Aabpara Market, Jinnah Super Market, Super Market and Sitara Market, street vendors and shopkeepers have set up their businesses on footpaths and verandas as well.
Even in G-7 Markaz (Khadda Market) and a market near the fire brigade building and Zero Point, motor mechanics have reduced the width of the roads. As a result, motorists have to face difficulty in crossing these markets but the DMA and the enforcement directorate have failed to clear the roads.
An official said in small markets, there were originally 10 shops in each centre, which have now expanded to 80-plus, as their owners have divided one shop into eight mini-shops. The official said the expansion of shops was one of the major reasons for the shrinking space at least in class-three (small) shopping centres.

“I have not seen such a large number of police deployment in a small area like Kahuta and Kallar Syedan in the past,” said a police official requesting anonymity. He said there will be no police personnel in other parts of Rawalpindi on Saturday and Sunday.

The number of POs rose to 4,480 from 3,273 since 2018mainly due to capital police lack of interest in their arrest, besides registration of more cases during the period, they added.

Nadra was also approached to get the CNICs of 85pc POs and court absconders blocked. Their details were available with the investigation wing, the officers said, adding that blocking of the CNIC forced the accused at large to surrender before the police.
Unblocking of the CNIC is a very difficult process and need verification from police and intelligence and security agencies, they said, adding that the SSP Investigation tasked his subordinates to collect the details of all the POs and court absconders as soon as possible and get their CNICs blocked by Nadra.
Besides, the mobile phone number of the accused and their family members are also being collecting through the CNICs and family tree to track and arrest them, the officers added.

He expressed these views while talking to a delegation of the Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Peshawar (WCC&IP) led by its president, Shahida Parveen, at Aiwan-i-Sadr.
Welcoming the delegation, President Alvi said women made up almost 50pc of the country’s population and ensuring their safety and security at workplace and providing quality education and skills to them should be the government as well as society’s priority.
“Local traditions and practices regarding women’s property and inheritance rights need to be changed and women should be given all property rights admissible to them as per our religion and the Constitution,” Mr Alvi said.

Says banks providing business loans to women under favourable and easy terms 

He said steps had been taken for their financial empowerment, and that legislation was passed to give their due share in inherited property, adding that as per law, if the property of a woman had been encroached upon, it would be gotten vacated by the government.

Rawalpindi Karyana Retailers Association President Saleem Pervaiz Butt said despite reduction in international price of edible oil, the vegetable oil companies did not reduce the prices.
He said that we contacted price control committee and elected representative to force the vegetable oil companies to reduce the price of oil and ghee for end consumers.
“The one kg pack of vegetable oil should be available at Rs390 but it is still over Rs500 per kg in the wholesale market,” he said and added that the government should take notice of the issue.
He said people criticised the shopkeepers for selling ghee and oil at higher prices but we were getting it on higher prices from the wholesale market. 
He said there was a need that the government should contact the private companies and ensured that they would sell it on revised rates.
He said that Punjab Traders Association President Mian Afaq Ansari also wrote letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz to take notice of the issue.
He said that the government had imposed fines on shopkeepers for selling the edibles including pulses and sugar on higher rates but failed to stop ghee mafia from increasing the prices.
On the other hand, the residents of the garrison city expressed their reservations over increase in prices of edibles in the open markets and said that the government appeared helpless to control the inflation.
Mohammad Akram, a resident of Naya Mohallah, said he bought the oil at Rs530 per kg and pulses on higher rates. Ahsan Ahmed, a resident of Murree Road, said that the prices of edibles was getting more expensive and it was difficult to manage the kitchen budget.
“The common man did not find any relief despite reducing the petrol and diesel prices,” he said.
“The fares of public transport were not reduced and people had to pay extra Rs10 for last month. In June, the Public transporters increased the fare from Raja Bazaar to Chaklala Scheme-III (Rs40 to Rs50) and they are still charging,” said Abdul Rasheed, a resident of Rehmatabad.

The rain has not only ensured water supply for the human as well as animal populations in the area, but also fed the grazing fields comprising plants and bushes for the herds for several months.  
Cholistan Development Authority (CDA) Managing Director (MD) Mahar Khalid Ahmed told Dawn that with the recent intermittent showers, the rainwater has also accumulated in the low-lying plains of Cholistan, converting them into temporary ponds that may dry up during the next week or so.  
He says that the rains during the last week have proved a boon for the Cholistani people and their livestock, who had been facing drought-like conditions during the previous months of May and June, creating an acute shortage of drinking water.  
He says that these showers have also a moderating effect on otherwise harsh weather in the area, hoping that it will the local population that had moved to relatively greener areas along with their livestock in search of water and fodder to return to their native places.  
The CDA managing director appreciated the role of various government departments and agencies, including divisional and district administrations, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), Rescue 1122 and some NGOs for taking immediate relief and rescue measures to provide drinking water in the desert area during the previous two months of scorching heat.
