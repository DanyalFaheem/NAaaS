0,Biden promises US won’t ‘walk away’ from Middle East,"""We will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia or Iran,"" he says in Jeddah.","JEDDAH: US President Joe Biden told Arab leaders on Saturday that Washington would remain fully engaged in the Middle East and would not cede influence to other world powers.
“We will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia or Iran,” Biden said during a summit in Jeddah, on the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia.
US ties to Gulf powers in particular have been roiled by multiple issues in recent years, notably Washington’s push for a deal to curb Iran’s suspect nuclear programme and its tepid response to attacks on Saudi oil facilities in 2019 claimed by Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels.
The summit, the final stop of Biden’s Middle East tour, brings together the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council as well as Egypt, Jordan and Iraq.

Saudi crown prince warns against ‘unrealistic’ policies to curb emissions

Biden had been looking to use the trip to discuss volatile oil prices and outline his vision for Washington’s role in the region.
On Friday he met Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler.
Biden told the assembled Arab leaders that “the future will be won by countries that unleash the full potential of their populations... where citizens can question and criticise leaders without fear of reprisal”.
Ukraine tensions 
Biden said the US would commit $1 billion in food aid to the Middle East and North Africa amid rising food insecurity induced by the war in Ukraine.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exposed a once unthinkable divergence between Washington and key Middle East allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the oil giants that are increasingly independent on the international stage.
The wealthy Gulf nations, which host US forces and have dependably backed Washington for decades, have notably refrained from supporting the Biden administration as it tries to choke Moscow’s lifelines, from energy to diplomacy.
Analysts say the new position reveals a turning point in Gulf relations with the US, long the region’s protector against neighbour Iran.
But Saturday brought some conciliatory gestures, with Biden inviting his Emirati counterpart to visit the White House before the year is up.
In his remarks at the summit, MBS said he hoped it would “establish a new era of joint cooperation to deepen the strategic partnership between our countries and the US, to serve our common interests and enhance security and development in this vital region for the whole world.” 
He warned that “unrealistic policies” to curb emissions could fuel inflation. “Adopting unrealistic policies to reduce emissions by excluding major sources of energy will lead in the coming years to unprecedented inflation and a rise in energy prices, while increasing unemployment and exacerbating serious social and security problems,” he said.
Push for oil 
Riyadh and Washington have signed 18 agreements on areas including energy, space, health and investment, including developing 5G and 6G technology, said a Saudi statement.
A separate joint statement said the two countries noted “the importance of their strategic economic and investment cooperation, especially in light of the current crisis in Ukraine and its repercussions, reiterating their commitment to the stability of global energy markets.” 
Saudi Arabia agreed to link the electricity networks of the Gulf Cooperation Council to Iraq, which relies heavily on energy from Iran, “in order to provide Iraq and its people with new and diversified electricity sources,” the White House said.
Washington wants Riyadh to open the oil floodgates to bring down soaring gasoline prices, which threaten Democratic chances in November mid-term elections.
But Biden tried to lower expectations that his trip would yield immediate gains.
“I’m doing all I can to increase the supply for the US,” he said, adding concrete results would not be seen “for another couple weeks”.

1,Body of slain army officer’s cousin found,"QUETTA: The body of Umer Javed, who was kidnapped along with his cousin Lt Col Laiq Baig Mirza from Ziarat four days...","QUETTA: The body of Umer Javed, who was kidnapped along with his cousin Lt Col Laiq Baig Mirza from Ziarat four days ago, was recovered during an operation by security forces in Ziarat’s Warchoom area, ISPR said on Saturday. 
Mr Javed’s body was found in a drain some 5km from Warchoom towards the Khalifat mountains, the military’s media wing said in a statement, adding that he was probably killed immediately after abduction. 
Security forces also identified and cleared another “hideout of terrorists” during the operation against the killers of Lt Col Mirza and Mr Javed. 
“During the exchange of fire, two terrorists have been killed and arms and ammunition have been recovered,” ISPR said. “After the clearance of the hideout, the entire area was sanitised,” during which Mr Javed’s body was found, it said.   
The forces, who swooped down on attackers’ hideouts in the mountains near Ziarat after Thursday midnight, continue to comb the area for the remaining three to four assailants who are still on the run.

2,Polling agent can be appointed from any constituency: LHC,The ECP had announced that polling agents for today’s by-elections shall be the voters of the respective constituencies.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Saturday suspended an ECP notification and declared that a polling agent could be appointed from any constituency.
The ECP had announced that polling agents for today’s by-elections shall be the voters of the respective constituencies. It said no candidate shall appoint any polling agent from outside the constituency.
PTI’s Punjab President Dr Yasmin Rashid had challenged the notification through a writ petition. The petitioner’s counsel argued that the ECP had unlawfully announced the condition for polling agents.
Asked about past practice, the counsel said there was no such restriction on polling agents in the past.
Justice Shahid Jamil Khan obse­rved that polling agents had certain responsibilities to discharge on the day of election. He said polling agents from the same constituency had the advantage of identifying voters.
However, the petitioner’s counsel argued that it was not necessary under the law to appoint polling agents from the same constituency.
The ECP counsel argued that the decision was taken to avoid any violence on polling day. He said there would be a likelihood of violence if voters from outside the constituencies were allowed to join the election activity as polling agents.
The judge, however, rejected the notion and observed that the voters of other constituencies were not “aliens”. The judge observed that the impugned notification was suspended temporarily and the ECP was free to make new rules for the appointment of the polling agents after the July 17 by-polls. 
Advocate Ahmad Awais, a senior member of the petitioners’ legal team, undertook that peace shall be maintained if the administration was also directed to remain within the sphere of law and implement the judgement of the apex court. 
The judge directed the advocate general of Punjab to ensure that directions by the apex court and this court, to police and civil administration, shall be followed and complied with in letter and spirit. 
“The administration shall respond to polling officer’s direction, general/special powers, if any attempt or act of disrupting the election process is brought to their notice,” the judge said in the order.
“Any instance of breach of undertaking, by petitioner’s political party, shall also be taken as contempt of court, if formally brought before this court,” the order concluded.

“A 10 per cent reduction is being done in economy class fares of mail express trains and similarly, a relief of 10pc is being given for both classes of PIA’s domestic flights,” he said in a video message shared on his Twitter handle. 
The new fares would be notified from July 17 (today) and would remain in force over the next 30 days, until Aug 17, he added. 
He said that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has been instructed to ensure a reduction in fares of private airlines following the decrease in fuel prices. 
He also urged provincial governments to ensure private transporters passed on the benefit of lower fuel prices to passengers by reducing fares. 
A day ago, the federal cabinet had also directed the federal and provincial authorities to ensure that the impact of the cut in petroleum prices immediately reached the people in the shape of reduced fares and transportation costs.

4,Jirga bars women from recreational spots in Bajaur tehsil,"Council claims no room in Islam, local customs for women’s presence in public places.","BAJAUR: A jirga of elders of the Salarzai tehsil in Bajaur tribal district on Saturday banned women from visiting tourist/picnic spots, and announced that if the government didn’t implement the decision by Sunday (today) the jirga members would take it upon themselves to impose it. 
The all-male jirga (tribal council), held at the hilly Danqool area, was organised by the local chapter of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, which is also one of the main members of the ruling coalition. 
The move comes just days after the World Economic Forum, in its Global Gender Gap  Report, ranked Pakistan as the second worst country in terms of gender  parity in the world as well as the region. 
Besides scores of elders from various tribes and areas of the Salarzai tehsil, a number of JUI-F leaders and religious figures of the region also attended the gathering, held after the JUI-F district leadership raised concerns during their presser on Thursday over what they called ‘unethical’ activities in the name of entertainment at Ragagan dam. 

Council claims no room in Islam, local customs for women’s presence in public places

Addressing the gathering on Saturday, JUI-F district chief Maulana Abdur Rasheed -- who also belonged to the Salarzai region, senior party leader Haji Said Badshah -- who is also the chairman of Khar tehsil council, and other speakers pointed out that the jirga was meant to discuss several issues of the region that emerged during Eid, and resolve them peacefully and amicably. 
The participants were told that it was noted that besides men, scores of local women either with their husbands and other relatives or separately had visited different tourist and picnic spots in the Eid holidays in the region, including Ragagan dam, to attend musical concerts and boat rides, which they claimed were against the local customs and traditions ‘based on Islamic principles’. 
The speakers further said women visiting the said places for tourism and entertainment was “totally unethical and unacceptable” as, they claimed, there was no room for such activities both in Islam and local traditions, adding that a result-oriented move was vital to discourage such “anti-customs” practices in the region. 
The participants, on the occasion, expressed concerns over women’s movement, and sought strict restrictions in this regard. The ban on women from visiting picnic sites was later announced by JUI-F’s Maulana Rasheed, calling it a “joint declaration” of the jirga. He said all the participants approved a complete ban on women’s visits to tourist spots -- with or without husbands. 
“We want to promote tourism in our areas as it is vital for socioeconomic development of the region. We are only against women visiting such areas as it was in contrast to our customs and traditions. Hence, the jirga banned it,” he announced, adding such activities could not be allowed in the name of tourism. 
He further stressed that if the government/district administration failed to take any action in this regard until Sunday (today), the jirga would enforce the ban itself. 
According to the Maulana, the jirga had also requested the residents of Salarzai region not to take women in their families to picnic places now. It also asked the local authorities to recruit local residents in various departments in the district instead of outsiders. 
There was no word from the district administration, nor was there any indication if the JUI-F-backed jirga decision had been endorsed by other political parties, or if it was indeed “representative” of the tribal council. The party has influence in the tribal district, but social activists said the announcement lacked any legal and constitutional backing.
