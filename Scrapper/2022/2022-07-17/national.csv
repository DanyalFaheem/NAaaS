3,Alvi wants expats to back fence-mending with US,"""Reach out to your congressmen, women and senators and explain to them why Pakistan is important,"" he says.","WASHINGTON: President Arif Alvi has said that the present government, like its predecessors, is trying to improve relations with the US and Pakistani Americans  should support this effort.
“Pakistan belongs to all and all parties, when in power, have tried to maintain close relations with the United States,” the president told the annual convention of the Association of Pakistani Physicians of North America (APPNA).
“I know that the present government, like its predecessors, is also trying to improve relations with Washington,” he said. “And what you can do, as Pakistani Americans, is to support this effort, no matter who is in power.”
President Alvi said that as he has lived in the US, he knew that Pakistani Americans maintained close personal and professional relations with other US citizens. 
“Use those relations to help Pakistan, remove misgivings and lobby for your homeland, “ he said. “Reach out to your congressmen, women and senators and explain to them why Pakistan is important. Why it cannot be ignored.”
He pointed out that abrupt US withdrawal from Afghanistan has caused “heartburn and misgivings” as Americans tried to understand how Kabul fell. “Play your role. Explain Pakistan’s position to your friends -- political or personal.”
The president said that on such matters, the Pakistani community should stay united and should not allow political differences to hurt key national interests.
But when a journalist suggested that former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s allegation of American interference in Pakistan’s domestic politics has undermined such efforts, he was silenced by PTI supporters who dominated the crowd. They also prevented the president from responding to his remarks.
President Alvi also said that Pakistanis, whether they lived in Pakistan or abroad, cannot remain silent to what’s happening to Muslims in India and in Kashmir.
“When you meet American lawmakers, let them know how the current Indian government is treating Muslims and other minorities, “ he said. “Explain to them how serious is the situation, how it threatens their very existence.”
Responding to a question about the diplomatic cable detailing the alleged US conspiracy to topple Imran Khan, the president said he has already referred the matter to the judicial commission and now the commission should play its part.
“Unfortunately in Pakistan, the results of such probes have never been made public, not even when it involved the assassinations of our prime ministers,” he added.
The president said that all governments have tried to fix the economy but unfortunately “We have not been very successful on this.”

4,A mushaira for changing times,"ATLANTIC CITY: As usual, the mushaira started late — around 10:30pm on Thursday night — and ended at three in ...","ATLANTIC CITY: As usual, the mushaira started late — around 10:30pm on Thursday night — and ended at three in the morning, but it was a testament to the love and respect that poets like Iftikhar Arif and Amjad Islam Amjad enjoy that many in the audience stayed till early Friday morning to listen to them.
The current atmosphere of open hostility in South Asia means that cross-border mushairay are rare, so Indian and Pakistani poets can only meet and share their poems in such settings, this one arranged by APPNA.
Most participants left their politics at the door; die-hard PTI supporters and staunch PML-N sympathisers could be seen sitting calmly under one roof.
Many poets recited ghazals, most of which had real-world underpinnings, des­cribing the political and social upheavals permeating both India and Pakistan. 
When popular Indian poet Manzar Bhopali talked about “how lamps are being given out to increase darkness”, it seemed like an obvious reference to communal violence and hate prevalent in today’s India.
Pakistani poet Ghazanfar Hashmi’s complaint that “the boat was already sinking, now the bank has moved too” was also seen as referring to the situation in his country. Abbas Tabish’s assurance that “Kufa-o-Shaam are phases and they shall pass too” was also interpreted as a reference to the current situation in Pakistan.
Poet Ashfaq Hussain’s com­plaint that “we too are responsible for writing meaningless words” was an obvious reference to self-censorship. Humorists Khalid Maso­­od and Khalid Irfan were more direct. Masood’s “lota once had other uses but now it is used to undo knots in parliament” needed no explanation. Khalid Irfan, too, was pretty straight-forward when he complained about the link between presidency and dentistry.

5,Judges’ elevation to SHC likely to be considered next month,"Absence of a member won’t be an excuse to adjourn session, JCP resolves.","ISLAMABAD: The June 28 marathon session of the Judicial Com­mission of Pakistan (JCP) which met to consider elevation of seven judges to the Sindh High Court (SHC) but remained inconclusive, was adjourned with an understanding that in future absence of a member would not be accepted as an excuse to adjourn the session, an informed source told Dawn.  
JCP’s next meeting is expected in the first or second week of August since some members of the commission were either abroad or had to go to perform Haj at that time. 
The chief justice of Pakistan, who heads the commission, presided over the JCP meeting remotely from his residence through video link since he was unwell at that time. Senior puisne judge Justice Qazi Faez Isa was hooked from Spain. 
Attorney General for Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf Ali could not attend the session since he too was reportedly unwell at that time. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, who also holds the portfolio of law minister, though attended the meeting, came out with an excuse that since he was involved in the budget-making process, he could not go through the antecedents of the nominees picked up for their elevation to the high court.  

Absence of a member won’t be an excuse to adjourn session, JCP resolves

The candidates selected to become SHC additional judges were: Amjad Ali Bohio, Muhammad Saeed Qureshi, Mohammad Abdur Rehman, Khurram Rashid, Rashid Mustafa, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Arbab Ali Hakro.  
These names were recommended by SHC Chief Justice Ahmed Ali Sheikh on the basis of their competence and capability to become additional judges of the high court and if they come up to the expectations of the JCP, they may be confirmed or dropped as judge of the SHC. 
Though the JCP discussed professional calibre and performance of the selected individuals, it could not come out with a definite decision since some of the members of the commission had a difference of opinion as they wanted either to drop the nominees or deferred consideration for the time being. 
However, the majority of the members were inclined to recommend to the Parliamentary Committee of the National Assembly to consider at least the nomination of three out of seven candidates.  
Consequently, the meeting was postponed to provide the members of the commission further time to examine the professional record, integrity and overall reputation of the nominees.  
Earlier, before considering the suggestions of the SHC chief justice, the commission had constituted a four-member committee under Rule 6 of the JCP Rules 2010 to verify the antecedents of the nominees. The members of the committee who were also members of the JCP consists of Justice Sardar Tariq Masood — judge of the Supreme Court, Senior puisne judge of the SHC Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, AGP Ashtar Ausaf Ali and Sindh Bar Council member Syed Haider Imam Rizvi.  
In addition to the four-member committee, the CJP had also constituted a two-member committee consisting of apex court judge Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan and the SHC chief justice to evaluate professional calibre, their conduct as a lawyer and performance.  
The June 28 meeting of the commission preceded before Justice Isa’s three-page letter in which the senior puisne judge had taken exception to the calling of the meeting with a suggestion that it should be postponed until the scheduled vacations of the court was over.  
Justice Isa had also emphasised that the Constitution places a heavy responsibility on all members of the JCP to abide by their constitutional duty. 
But they are not allowed to undertake their constitutional duties in a meaningful way, Justice Isa had regretted, adding the people of this great nation deserve much better. 
Likewise, on June 23, JCP member Syed Haider Imam Rizvi had written a letter to CJP highlighting the need of expediting the rule-making and settling transparent, consistent, well-defined appointment criteria since the vague and overly-broad qualities such as competence, integrity, capacity and temperament was not sufficient.

6,Rashid urges establishment to ‘stay away’ from by-polls,Assails govt move to pursue high treason proceedings against PTI leaders,"ISLAMABAD: A day before the crucial by-polls in Punjab set to determine who will be the chief minister in the July 22 re-election, former interior minister and Awami Muslim League (AML) chief Sheikh Rashid on Saturday asked the establishment to “stay away” from the by-elections and prove its “impartiality”.
“I want to discuss something important with the establishment. Tomorrow is a very important day. I have never seen such an election in the country’s history. I want to request them to stay away from the [by-]elections. The nation will not tolerate any rigging or ghunda gardi (hooliganism),” he said in a video message posted on Twitter.
“The establishment would have to prove its impartiality in tomorrow’s by-elections on 20 Pun­jab Assembly seats,” he added.
Sheikh Rashid also spoke about the government’s formation of a special ministerial committee to pursue high treason proceedings against top office-holders of the former PTI government, including former premier Imran Khan.

Assails govt move to pursue high treason proceedings against PTI leaders

“This is a detailed judgement, not a [fresh] judgement]. These people, who have been imposed on the nation through one or two extra votes, are foolish,” he said.
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan on Saturday warned PTI Chairman Imran Khan against inciting violence during the by-elections. 
“Imran Niazi and PTI must refrain from disrupting the peaceful proceedings of tomorrow’s by-elections by inciting riots or violence. The law will take its due course if anyone tries to sabotage the writ of the state by indulging in unlawful activities,” he tweeted.
The interior minister said he has received reports that over 500 miscreants of the party have been brought to Punjab to sabotage the elections process.
The plea seeking permission for appointing polling agents hailing from outside the constituency concerned was part of the conspiracy, Mr Sanaullah added.
“Imran Khan has lost elections and he is preparing to fight with the masses,” he said, warning the PTI chief and the party’s tiger force to keep themselves within the ambit of the law.
Lashing out at the PTI, the interior minister said that the party has made a plan of clashes between Pakhtuns and Punjabis. He accused PTI’s Pervez Khattak, Asad Qaiser, Ali Mohammad Khan and Murad Saeed of sheltering the “miscreants”.
Imran Khan would be responsible for the consequences if PTI’s tigers attempt to disrupt the elections, he said, adding that they would not be allowed to steal the mandate of the people in the 20 constituencies.
He vowed to ensure fair and peaceful by-elections in the province.
