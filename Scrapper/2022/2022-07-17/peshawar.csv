Police officials said two suspected terrorists riding a motorcycle opened fire at the checkpost in Arjali Nadi locality, critically injuring a constable and another man.
Both the injured succumbed to injuries while being shifted to a hospital, officials said, adding the incident took place when other policemen on duty at the checkpost had gone to a nearby mosque to perform afternoon prayers.
The attackers managed to escape.

Funeral prayers of the martyred policeman, identified as Said Karim, hailing from Shalobar tribe of Bara, were offered at the Shah Kas Police Training Centre.
Police termed it a targeted attack and said that investigations were underway to track down the culprits involved in the incident.
Officials said that as many as four policemen had been killed in similar attacks in Bara during the last four months. 
However, the police have so far failed to arrest any attacker.
Meanwhile, security officials in Tirah termed the Friday’s killing of a young man at the hands of security personnel as a mutual misunderstanding, and announced compensation for the family of the deceased.
They said that temporary security barricades had been placed to check the movement of suspected persons after some unidentified persons carried out a grenade attack on a security checkpost in the same vicinity.
The officials said when the security personnel signalled the deceased, Aurangzeb, and a man accompanying him to stop at one of these barricades they sped away on their motorcycle.
Subsequently, the security personnel had to open fire on the motorcycle riders, suspecting them of being the ones, who were involved in the attack, which took place minutes before the incident, the officials contended and added the incident was a result of sheer misunderstanding on both sides.

2,Petrol dealers to go on strike from tomorrow,Insist govt didn’t keep promise to increase their profit margin,"PESHAWAR: The Sarhad Petroleum Cartage and Dealers Association, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, on Saturday announced that its all members would go on a strike across the province from tomorrow (Monday) against the government’s ‘failure to keep its promise’ to increase their profit margin.
Association chairman Majid Khan and general secretary Gul Nawaz Afridi told reporters here that the distributors’ profit margin on petrol and diesel was 
four and three per cent, respectively, despite the government’s promise to increase it to six per cent.
“All petrol and diesel filling stations will remain closed from next Monday across the province. The strike will continue until our demands are met,” said Mr Majid, who was accompanied by all divisional presidents of the association.

Insist govt didn’t keep promise to increase their profit margin

The association chairman said the last PM Imran Khan-led government had promised to jack up the distributors’ commission to six per cent by June 2022 but that promise had yet to be fulfilled.
The association’s Kohat division president, Amjad Ali Shinwari, said petroleum dealers in the region fully backed the strike call on July 18.
He said it was not possible to do business with the current profit margin.
Association leader from Dera Ismail Khan Jan Alam Mehsud urged petrol dealers to forge unity to protect their interests.
Haji Rahim of the association’s Mardan chapter warned that petroleum dealers would suffer huge losses if they were forced to do business with the current low profit margin.
He endorsed the strike call.
Members of the association from Malakand division Khizar Hayat Khan and Sultan Rome and office-bearers from Chitral, Bannu and Hazara divisions also said filling station owners and petrol dealers in their areas would observe strike to protect their rights.
Earlier, the association members met at the Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry here to discuss strategy about the call given by the Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association for a countrywide strike.
Association central chairman Abdul Sami Khan told participants via video link that the last petroleum minister had promised him and other leaders to increase the petroleum dealers’ profit margin to 6 per cent by June 2022.
He said the demand was repeated during a meeting with the petroleum minister, but the association was forced to go on strike after the government’s non-seriousness attitude as the business was quietly difficult and impossible under the dealers’ profit margin.
“Not only product value increased but the dealers’ expenditure also surged, so the dealers should be united to raise voice to claim rights,” he said.
Mr Sami said petroleum dealers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would respond to the strike call by closing businesses on July 18.
SCCI president Hasnain Khursheed told participants that their demands were legitimate and that they had a right to use lawful ways and means to claim their rights.
He said that the SCCI hoped that the federal government would seriously consider issues of the petroleum association and address them amicably yet effectively.

They said that both the districts of Chitral faced the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glof), which posed threats to the human settlements and physical infrastructures and for this reason it needed special treatment to mitigate the sufferings of the affected area.

4,All set for first free transplant at Institute of Kidney Diseases,Medics undergo training in Islamabad.,"PESHAWAR: The Institute of Kidney Diseases at the public sector Hayatabad Medical Complex has planned to carry out the first free renal transplant under the Sehat Card Plus programme early next month.
The public sector IKD, a pioneer in renal transplantation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, conducted around 300 surgical procedures until 2022 but stopped them after retirement of lead transplant surgeon Prof Asif Malik.
The institute resumed transplantation last month after formally engaging senior transplant surgeon of the Pakistan Liver and Kidney Institute, Lahore, Prof Saeed Akhtar.
Under an agreement, the institute will conduct a couple of transplants every month under the supervision of Prof Saeed. The number will increase as the IKD’s surgeons have the required facilities to do surgical procedures independently.

Medics undergo training in Islamabad

Fifteen IKD staff members, including transplant surgeons, nephrologists, anesthetists, a nurse and an operating theatre technician, underwent a two weeks training programme in Islamabad last month and learned about renal transplantation and subsequent patient management.
Officials told Dawn that under its flagship Sehat Card Plus programme, the PTI government was providing free health services to 7.7 million families of the province and 1.6 million of tribal districts.
They said a total of 97 renal transplants had so far been carried out in the province under it.
The officials, however, said the IKD hadn’t done a single renal procedure under the SCP programme.
They said a total of 96 transplants had been performed in privately-owned Rehman Medical Institute and one at the North West General Hospital.
The officials said the government had been persuading the public sector institute to cover more and more patients under the scheme to earn more for distribution among staff and for service improvement.
They said the institute had approached the health department for the release of Rs10 million grant annually to do transplantation on a ‘sustainable basis’, but the grant was awaited.
Urologist Dr Fazal Manan, who is the focal person for renal transplants at the IKD, told Dawn that another transplant had been planned under the SCP initiative in August.
“We have the best facilities and human resources, which will benefit renal patients,” he said.
He said chairman of the Board of Governors Sahibzada Mohammad Saeed and IKD director Prof Mazhar Khan were in contact with the health department to begin free procedures on the premises.
“We are also waiting for availability of Prof Saeed Akhtar. The IKD will start doing procedures on its own after 10 cases supervised by him,” he said.
Dr Fazaql said the IKD would provide each patient with one-year immunosuppressant, which cost Rs40,000 per month in addition to the management of any emergency such as re- admission, management of rejection or any other complication free of charge.
He said the man, who underwent transplant last month, was an Afghan national and wasn’t eligible for free transplant under the SCP programme.
“Four patients, including residents of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, are on the waiting list for transplantation under the SCP initiative. We have sent the cases for approval to the Medical Transplantation Regulatory Authority and once that approval comes, we will go ahead with transplantation plans,” he said.
Officials said the health department established the MTRA in Feb 2018 with the public sector IKD becoming the first institute in the province to transplant kidneys.
They said the initiative was meant to control illegal renal transplants, register and equip hospitals for lawful transplants and train doctors to begin procedures in regional hospitals of the province.
The officials said the province introduced the Social Health Protection Initiative, branded as SCP under which each family is entitled to free medication of Rs1 million per year.
They, however, said the people requiring renal and liver transplantation were given Rs1.4 million and Rs5 million, respectively.
The officials said all 23 liver transplants had been done outside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as the facility wasn’t available in the province.

JUI-F’s central deputy chief Maulana Fazal Ali said at a meeting in Zarobi village that the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had so far done nothing for the flood-affected people except making announcements and tall claims.

Ihsanul Haq of Bamkhel village said the government should take prompt steps for providing relief to the people, as the time of empty pledges had gone. 
Former tehsil councillor from Marghuz, Rashid Sohail, said Asad Qaiser also belonged to their village, which had been affected by the flood. He said the most affected areas included Akakhel, Shamako Banda and Landai Banda where people had lost their cattle, grain and other commodities. 
He complained that officials of the district administration just visited Mr Qaiser’s residence for a meeting on flood damage, while steps for relief and rehabilitation were still awaited. 
Akhtar Zaman of Tand Koi village said he had lost a good stock of Virginia tobacco in the floods, but no one approached him and other affected people in the area to provide them assistance. He said that mere verbal assurances had no value on such occasions.

He was addressing a gathering at Sulimanzai Sherpao in Charsadda. 
The QWP chief said that Pakhtuns had played a key role in the development of Karachi, Hyderabad and other areas of Sindh. 
“The ethnic strife would undermine social harmony and create hatred between the Sindhis and Pakhtuns, which is not good for the country,” he said. 
About Imran Khan’s diatribe against the Election Commission of Pakistan, he said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader knew his party would face defeat in the Punjab by-elections so he was targeting the election watchdog in a face-saving effort. 

Says Imran trying to mislead nation by telling lies

Mr Sherpao said that Pakistan would have gone bankrupt had the PTI still been in power. 
Commenting on the Supreme Court verdict on the ruling of then National Assembly deputy speaker, he said it had demolished the so-called ‘regime change narrative’ of former prime minister Imran Khan. 
“Imran Khan had cooked up the so-called regime change theory to hide his government’s failure,” he added. 
Mr Sherpao added that Imran Khan was trying to mislead the nation by telling lies and half truths. “Imran Khan welcomes the decision of the court if it goes in his favour, but if the decision is against him he starts criticising the superior judiciary,” he said. 
He also expressed his concern over the prolonged loadshedding in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which produced cheap and surplus electricity. He said that long hours of power cuts had disrupted routine life in the province. 
Aftab Sherpao said that though the people paid electricity bills regularly, they were not being provided smooth power supply. He said the patience of the people was wearing thin and they would take to the streets if the government did not reduce the duration of loadshedding. 
He appreciated the government for lowering the prices of petroleum products, but said steps should be taken to give relief to the people in the face of skyrocketing inflation.

Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan of a single-member bench accepted the petition of suspect Mohammad Wali alias Kakay on condition of furnishing two surety bonds of Rs200,000 each.
The bench ruled that the offences faced by the petitioner didn’t fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, so he was entitled to the concession of bail.
The petitioner was named in an FIR registered at the Gandigar police station of Upper Dir district on June 11, 2022, under the Pakistan Penal Code’s sections 380 (house robbery), 420 (cheating) and 500 (defamation).
The woman complained to police that she had washed her clothes and burqa and spread them in the courtyard to dry up but didn’t find them next morning.
She said the petitioner later met her mother and claimed that he was a faith healer and knew who had taken away her daughter’s clothes.
The complainant alleged that her mother paid the ‘faith healer’ Rs3,000 to find for the missing clothes.
She said the ‘faith healer’ later told her mother that he had learned with the help of his supernatural powers that her daughter was unhappy with her husband, so she should divorce him to solemnise nikkah with him.
The complainant said her mother censured the self-proclaimed faith healer and insisted her daughter had a happy matrimonial life, so the latter began blackmailing them.
She claimed that some elders of the area requested the man to return clothes to her but he declined.
The police later took him into custody and seized the stolen clothes on his pointation.
The bench observed that in the given circumstances the petitioner had made out a case for the grant of bail.
Earlier, the bail petition of the ‘faith healer’ was turned down by an additional district and sessions judge in Upper Dir district observing that that he had allegedly stolen clothes of the complainant, which was a despicable offence in the conservative society.
ACQUITTED: An additional district and sessions judge has acquitted a man charged with possessing narcotics.
Judge Naveedur Rehman declared that the prosecution had failed to prove its charge against the accused, Wajid, so the court acquitted him in the case by giving him benefit of the doubt.
Advocate Iftikharuddin Yousafzai appeared for the accused and said that the prosecution had claimed that his client was riding a motorcycle when the police recovered 18kg charas from him near the Sheikhan Chowk in the jurisdiction of the Badabher police station on Sept 17, 2020.
He contended that the chain of events mentioned by the prosecution were in conflict with the evidence on record, especially the collection of samples from the seized contraband and its dispatch to the laboratory for chemical analysis.
The lawyer said that the statements of prosecution witnesses were in conflict with each other.
