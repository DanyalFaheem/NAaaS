0,"Rate hike, rupee’s fall and inflation",Demand-depressing effects on the interest rate tightening will continue which will mean lower-than-expected GDP growth for FY22.,"The rupee’s decline, triggered by the nerve-racking political uncertainty unleashed by the sudden Cablegate-led dissolution of the National Assembly (NA) on April 3, stopped on April 8. And, the local currency also made some appreciable recovery against the US dollar.
Earlier, on April 7, a landmark Supreme Court (SC) judgment restored the dissolved NA and brought the weeklong political turmoil in the country to an end. Also on April 7, hours before the SC judgement, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) “in an emergency meeting” raised the interest rate by 250 basis points. The move was primarily aimed at containing inflation — 12.7 per cent year-on-year in March up from 12.2pc in February 2022.
What is next? The rupee’s quick recovery on April 8 is due, in large part, to the dollar selling by a few commercial banks on the insistence of the central bank. Can the SBP, with its forex reserves inadequate to cover even two-and-a-half months of merchandise imports bill, afford to intervene directly in the market? Obviously, the answer is no. Can the central bank persuade a commercial bank to sell dollars to rescue the rupee whenever it is under pressure? Again, the answer is no.
Forex market should return to its routine business from April 11. The central bank will have to ensure that the exchange rate remains “market-driven”. Will the rupee be able to regain more of its lost value? Or will it start losing again? That depends on two things: how the higher interest rate depresses demand for import-dollars and how much “hot money” higher returns on government bills and bonds attract foreign investors and overseas Pakistanis. That, in turn, depends on how soon a constitutional political order is restored and stabilised in the light of the April 7 SC judgement.

Demand-depressing effects of interest rate tightening will continue as an undercurrent which would mean lower-than-expected GDP growth for FY22

It is true that the political events in the country took a heavy toll on the rupee’s health last week but that was just one apparent, temporary reason. Fundamentally the rupee remains weak because of the external sector problem. Essentially, the problem is that outflows of dollars were exceeding their inflows and as a consequence, the country’s forex reserves were also declining. (And this was happening amidst accumulation in forex debts whose servicing has become a big drag on SBP’s forex reserves and has been at the root of all external sector issues— including the much-dreaded widening of the current account deficit).
In just four working days (between April 3 and April 7) the rupee lost 2.23pc value to the US dollar. But it had shed 1.26pc value against the dollar just a week earlier. The recovery the rupee made on April 8 brought its value back to 184.68 to the dollar, up from 188.18 to the dollar — its all-time low. But behind this “managed” sharp recovery remains the fact that the local currency has lost more than 17.2pc value against the dollar since the start of this fiscal year on July 1, 2021. Meanwhile, the SBP’s forex reserves have also declined to just $11.319bn (as of April 1) from $17.299bn at the end of June 2021. 
For forex building, Pakistan is looking, once again, towards China hoping to attract placement of Chinese foreign funds into the SBP’s account or immediate forex support in any other form. Exports and remittances, two main non-debt creating forex inflows, are growing but are not enough to meet the country’s total import bill. Interest rate tightening cannot contain imports’ growth to the extent that export earnings plus remittances can pay for the overall import bill — not at least in the near future. 
For saving the rupee from further, “unmanageable” decline all hopes are pinned on extremely tight interest rates — now 12.25pc up from 9.75pc before April 7. 
But the problem is that the business community does not seem to have bought all the arguments of the central bank for a massive 250bps interest rate hike and a section of it wants the SBP to revisit its decision. 
The SBP, on its part, has said more than once that is ready to revisit its monetary policy as and when the situation demands. It means that a little softening of the interest rate after some time cannot be ruled out. But before doing that the SBP will have to watch exchange rates and inflation behaviour and it might take months or at least a month. 
The central bank will wait for the evidence of inflation moderating somewhat as a result of its full dose of monetary tightening. Inflation, on the other hand, has emerged as challenge number one to the global economy and cannot be expected to come down quickly in Pakistan. It is true that a 250bps hike in interest rate is enough to moderate domestic demand to some extent besides containing “imported inflation” to some extent. 
But all this would take at least a few months. This means that the rupee would continue to remain under some pressure and inflation would remain in double digits during the last quarter of FY22, April-June 2022.
Demand-depressing effects on the interest rate tightening would continue as an undercurrent which would mean lower-than-expected GDP growth for FY22. The most recent estimate of GDP growth — 4pc — has come from the Asian Development Bank. But that estimate is based on the pre-April 3rd situation. The political turmoil in the country is bound to decelerate the economic growth at least during the current quarter and that means GDP growth of lesser than 4pc. 
Below 4pc growth means more joblessness and double-digit inflation means lesser real income for the majority of the population. Tough times ahead!

1,It is time for devolution,Karachi contributes a major share of revenue to the provincial exchequer and it should be a matter of concern for MQM-P...,"The social, political and economic development potential of Sindh, now hamstrung by a deep urban-rural political divide, can be unleashed provided the PPP-MQM-P agreement is implemented on the basis of give-and-take, keeping in view the long-term interest of the province’s largest cultural minority and the people of the majority community who have been left behind in the march towards progress, as pledged by the accord.
Those are the industrialised urban centres that radiate growth in its immediate hinterland. The Karachi’s economy, the capital of Sindh, is integrated more with the national and the international markets whereas its role in the development of the rural markets in the province has been minimal. Rural industrialisation has been stifled. The pace of industrialisation of Sindh has fallen behind that of Punjab. This has resulted in painfully slow modernisation of agriculture and the sad plight of landless peasants that is worse than the deprived urban dwellers. 
A neglected Karachi, with millions of slum dwellers and its civic facilities in shambles, contributes big to the country’s economic progress and prosperity. It is the financial capital of Pakistan with the headquarters of the central banks and the country’s leading banks located in the city apart from many multinational companies.
Among the country’s big urban centres, the city contributes the highest revenues to the national exchequer while providing employment to displaced farm workers from all federating units. It bears the cost of infrastructure required by Pakistan’s foreign trade through its seaports. But there is rampant poverty in the province’s countryside.

Karachi contributes a major share of revenue to the provincial exchequer and it should be a matter of concern for MQM-P how the money is spent on the uplift of rural areas

Sindh’s political integrity is deeply linked with its economic progress and its fruits being equitably shared, without discrimination, by all its residents.
Notwithstanding the pledge of the two parties (PPP and MQM-P) to develop a long-term relationship to ensure harmony amongst the people for the wellbeing of those left behind, serious doubts are being expressed by many in view of past records whether the agreement will be honoured. 
However, things may be seen in the context of the current developments to reach a different conclusion. The present urban-rural divide gave an opportunity for the PTI-led federal government to intervene in Sindh’s provincial domain on the issue of empowerment of local governments with some success. There was also some political support for empowering local governments in rural-based parties. That persuaded the Sindh government to adopt a policy of reconciliation with other opposition parties in Karachi conceding to some of their demands. 
And it has been proved beyond doubt that aggravating civic problems of urban areas, particularly Karachi, cannot be resolved by the provincial government alone or together with the cash-strapped federal government, hence the imperative for devolution.
It may also be noted that repeated failures in enforcement of new ideas (read also agreements) is a natural process of gathering the critical mass that leads toward their final triumph. It took Pakistan more than a quarter of a century to produce the 1973 Constitution after the failure of the earlier constitutions. 
Instead of ten years as provided in the Constitution, the concurrent list was abolished some forty years later. And the 18th amendment and the 7th National Finance Commission Award have strengthened fiscal federalism and political, administrative and legislature autonomy of the provinces to a level never achieved before. In doing so, political parties have demonstrated a rare show of unity as they did also in reaching the Pakistan Water Accord signed by the chief ministers of four provinces in March 1991.
It is now the turn of local governments to be empowered as indicated by MQM’s tactical gain in securing guarantees provided by political leaders from three other provinces. It translates into countrywide support for the MQM’s ‘Charter of Rights’ with the two sides agreeing that the Supreme Court’s decision regarding local governments would be implemented in letter and spirit within one month and with mutual agreement. In this regard, one cannot ignore the fact that the country is currently engaged in a fierce battle to ensure that all provisions of the Constitution are strictly observed. 
While seeking the rights of the urban dwellers, MQM must also recognise its inescapable responsibility to defend equally strongly the rights of the most neglected living in rural areas to enlist their political support for the implementation of the agreement with PPP. The city contributes a major share of revenue to the provincial exchequer and it should be a matter of concern for MQM-P how the money is spent on the uplift of rural areas.
While actively helping the local governments resolve the problems of the people they encounter in dealing with the provincial government departments, the MPAs need to focus on the socio-economic development pertaining to the provincial domain. And similarly, the MNAs should treat the local bodies as their constituency but their main task is to help formulate and implement federal policies.
The PPP and MQM-P accord should also serve as an example for all parties to emulate in evolving a consensus on how to resolve persisting major problems facing the country. Business tycoons say they are more concerned with a change in policies rather than a change in governments. As Ehsan Malik, the CEO of the Pakistan Business Council(PBC), puts it “‘investors value policy continuity more than who happens to be in power.” This is the reason, he adds, the PBC advocates a Charter of Economy for a cross-party consensus on what is good for the country’s economy and its people. The economic challenges call for unity and consistency of direction.
The prerequisite for a workable long-lasting Charter of Economy and its effective implementation is a charter of democracy that is evolved within the constitutional ambit of a federal, democratic and egalitarian system, to salvage the central government from recurring political crises and instability. That will create an environment to enable both businesses and the people to prosper. The two charters have to work in harmony and not at cross purposes.

2,Making sense of the venture market,"When push comes to shove, many of the tech founders will throw their team under the bus at the first sign of distress.","For those involved in the startup or venture capital (VC) space, the better part of the past year was spent deliberating on the spiralling valuations across the globe. In Pakistan, the conversation involved a fair bit of apprehension about its sustainability given the market’s on-ground realities which are far too often beyond the control of everyone — founders, investors or customers.  
If the early signs are any indicator, there is already some cause for alarm. According to Crunchbase, global Q12022 funding fell quarter-on-quarter – something that hadn’t happened since Q12020 at least. Similarly, the investment amount raised by Asian startups declined even year-on-year. Of course, it’s entirely possible that this slowdown — if we can call it that in the first place — is no more than a blip. No matter what side of the argument you’re on, it’s fairly easy to cherry-pick data points to support your position. 
First of all, 2021 was an exceptional year and not business as usual so a slight correction from its peaks — that too on only a quarter-on-quarter basis so far — hardly suggests a reckoning for the venture ecosystem. Secondly, seed and angel deals amount continued unabated globally hitting a new peak during Q1 and whatever pullback came was on the back of late-stage and growth rounds. Meaning a healthy pipeline of new companies, with much more capital and far higher valuations than the five year average — is still on track. 
On the flip side, some of the most high-profile VC-backed startups to do an initial public offering in 2021 have been laggards. Let’s just look at neighbouring India where 11 companies listed themselves (including offer for sale). Of these, seven are still in the red and the median percentage change from their opening prices is at negative 33 per cent. Then of course there’s inflation and rate increases by central banks all around as many investors are reportedly negotiating deal terms. 

When push comes to shove, many of the tech founders — whose LinkedIn is full of posts about building the right culture — will throw their team under the bus at the first sign of distress

Regardless of what you want to believe in, there is confusion about what lies ahead and its repercussions for Pakistan. While the optimists believed our moment had come in 2021 and the pessimists raised questions about the truthfulness of it even, those in the middle had a more realistic approach: raise as much as you can while you still can. Before the investors start caring about due diligence, the local macroeconomic environment or the performance of companies on their radar. Many founders took it to heart and amassed more capital they could reasonably spend. 
Read: The mirage of tech growth 
The fear-of-missing-out wasn’t just on part of investors but the founders — at least those who understood this game well enough — were in it too. There’s nothing wrong with it, except that great funds come with greater responsibility. Someone raising $10 million would most likely (or should, I really hope) have more aggressive key performance indicators to meet than a counterpart seeking $1m. Of course, the former would have a longer runway and could buy growth with discounts or poach talent from competitors at exorbitant salaries. 
But the problem is that too often, expense far outpaces the scale and in order to sustain it, you need to keep raising follow-on rounds. Except that those get tricky when markets are bearish. Just last week, Fast — a much-famed one-click checkout fintech that had raised over $120m since founding in 2019 — shut down, laying off its 450 employees. Media reports suggest the company had made a revenue — not profit — of $600,000 in all of 2021 while the burn rate was about $10m a month. Yet the founder tried to get new funding at a $1bn+ valuation, never mind the underlying financials of the company. 
Or if you are looking for an example closer to home, go back a couple of years. KeepTruckin, a well-funded US-based startup founded by Shoaib Makani and with a sizable team based out of Pakistan, laid off around 20pc of the staff hardly a month into Covid-19 lockdowns. Did I mention they had built a very fancy office in Islamabad not long before that? The point is, when push comes to shove, many of these tech founders — whose LinkedIn is full of posts about building the right culture — will throw their team under the bus at the first sign of distress.
As for Pakistan’s investment landscape, it’s futile to predict (ask the research analysts at AKD Securities). But what we have are a few data points to try and make sense of the situation, as arbitrary as the approach may be. For starters, a significant share of local startups was raising money from high net worth individuals or small VCs instead of big-shot names, barring a few exceptions. 
What does that signify? Well, 2021 was a record year for micro funds which raised a cumulative $5 billion across 339 vehicles, according to Pitchbook. A lot of these investors happen to deploy capital very early on and outside the traditional startup hubs in order to stay competitive; both of which can bode well for Pakistan. However, when the prospects of follow-on rounds and valuation spikes seem dim, there will be reverberations for the early stage too. That takes us to all who can raise funds, at least Series A, soon-ish. 
As per Data Darbar, 67 startups that raised a total of 74 deals since 2021 might fit our criteria: 53 seed, 7 Pre-Series A, 11 Series A and three Series B. Using an unscientific approach — based on factors such as time since last funding, amount previously secured, sector operating in, and of course market whispers — I tried to categorise them in order of investment likelihood. With this arbitrary methodology, 15 companies should be closing in on deals while another 10 might be somewhere in the middle. 
Obviously, this exercise needs to be taken with a handful of salt but what we can say is that the higher you go up the stage, the more uncertain the situation becomes. Later rounds require much bigger cheques which usually come from large funds leading the deals. And they are apparently reevaluating their positions in view of the public markets so where does Pakistan fit into their strategy? We’ll find out in about time.

3,Floating in troubled waters,The ongoing transition entails a lot more uncertainty than meets the eye.,"The political uncertainty over the past couple of weeks coupled with the compromised decision making of a beleaguered government has exposed Pakistan’s economic fragility despite tall claims of the government to have secured strong fundamentals. 
The rupee value and shares market went down like ninepins in a matter of days. The Eurobond yield maturing in 2024 went beyond 18 per cent — a record as the International Monetary Fund programme (IMF) was virtually stalled and exporters tried to hold back receipts as long as possible. The resultant increase in debt levels that now stand at about Rs43 trillion and debt servicing costs will show up in the upcoming budget 2022-23.
The widening fiscal gap jacked up interest rates on local government papers above the 13pc psychological barrier understandably when perhaps for the first time the government of Pakistan is doling out a significant amount of public money to large populations to run their cars and buses at cheaper petrol and diesel rates. The petroleum consumption has increased by 23pc.
The market and public sentiments worsened and the central bank’s reserves fell below the $12 billion mark — just above the level in the 2018 crisis or less than two months of import cover — as the increasing trade gap took a toll on reserves amid widening current account deficit and higher debt payments. The fall in reserves has been rather higher than before, an $8bn fall since August 2021 when it stood well over $20bn.
Read: Traders and industry reject SBP's interest rate hike

It is not yet clear how long the budding political coalition would stay together and if all partners would be ready to share the blame for impending tough decisions

The trade deficit in nine months widened well above $35bn, again a record. It is much higher than the full-year budget target of $28bn. The full-year trade deficit of $37bn in 2018 was described by the PTI government as the mother of all ills for which it adopted measures that brought the economy to its knees — a net negative GDP growth rate for three straight years. 
The governor State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) advice only a couple of months ago that the current account deficit should be mentioned with pride as it did not affect foreign exchange reserves was as short-lived as a water drop that rolls down a leaf. Market interventions to the extent of $4bn did little help to block the rupee slide.
Last ditch efforts to secure over $21bn financing from China including some load rollovers yielded only $2.2bn although targeted leaks were made about rollovers of more than $4.2bn in the last days of March. Notwithstanding friendship ‘deeper than the sea, higher than the Himalayas and sweeter than honey’, Beijing like any other financier is also perhaps waiting for the new set-up to bank on. Another $2bn rollover from UAE did not help much either.
But even these challenging times exhibited the strength of decision making, time will tell how long lasting. The Supreme Court of Pakistan’s decision to restore the parliament brought back a sense of political clarity. Coupled with the SBP’s decision to hold an emergency monetary policy meeting to raise the policy rate to 12.25pc, the stock market recovered over 600 points and the rupee gained almost 2pc value against the dollar the very next day. 
The utilisation of development funds in the first nine months of the fiscal year has been limited to a miserly Rs405bn against a budget allocation of Rs900bn that would now have to be drastically slashed. Even this utilisation is mainly because of maximum use for foreign funds for development schemes — at Rs80bn against annual foreign exchange component of Rs100bn — otherwise, the utilisation was struggling at just Rs325bn in nine months. Interestingly, the government has overspent funds on the development schemes of parliamentarians.
On the other hand, the government committed Rs31bn out of budget in April to subsidise petroleum products for all without any differentiation between the land cruisers of the rich and motorbikes of the poor. For April, the out-of-budget subsidy is estimated well above Rs43bn. To be precise, the government is paying about Rs25 and Rs42 per litre on petrol and diesel respectively at present out of budget. Simply put, the government is selling petrol and diesel at about Rs150 and Rs145 per litre respectively against its own ex-depot landing cost of Rs175 and Rs187 per litre.
This is on top of the waiver on taxes of about Rs30 per litre petroleum levy and about Rs25 per litre sales tax assumed at standard 17pc. Reversing this price trend would perhaps be the biggest challenge for the upcoming government and of course unthinkable at this stage. After all, which political government could afford to increase petrol and diesel prices by Rs80-95 per litre and more so when it has to return to the people in less than a year for the next elections. 
But this is the cost that has crept into the system that the nation would have to bear in one way or the other. According to former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, the government had caused over Rs600bn loss to the budget in the last two months. He also includes the cost of electricity price cut in his calculations.
The challenge with the current uncertain situation is that decision making in the cabinet and its committees have come to a standstill. The principal accounts officers (PAOs), namely bureaucrats, have no powers to take major policy decisions except to authorise or stop funds already approved by the parliament and placed at their disposal. But in such times, they become overcautious and tend not to displease the incoming government.
In a precarious position are cash flows and financials of the power companies where circular debt is almost close to Rs3 trillion and many power plants are heading towards fuel constraints. Just imagine the country’s biggest fuel supplier — PSO — has over Rs500bn worth of receivables and is floating just because it is owned by the government. This happens at a time when the summer has just begun rather a little earlier and forecasts about water availability are depressing. How the consumers come across this peak harsh season is yet to be seen.
The ongoing transition entails a lot more uncertainty than meets the eye. It is not yet clear how long the budding political coalition would stay together and if all partners would be ready to share the blame for impending tough decisions, taken earlier the better. The delay would only spread cancer to an already fragile body — the Pakistan economy.

4,Business wants nothing but an end to uncertainty,"Though cautious with their words, business leaders are clearly unhappy over the failure to give the economy precedence over po...","


 
EXPRESSING concern over the upward revision of interest rate by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), business leaders believe that together with the lingering confrontational parliamentary politics and the potent threat of violent clashes between political rivals in the streets would cost the already fragile national economy a tad too much.
Cautious with their choice of words, they do convey their displeasure with the political class which, in their opinion, acts on impulses while discounting the need for a united stance in dealing with the mounting economic challenges. 
Some leaders are vocal and see the restoration of the National Assembly as a step in the right direction, but others refrain from offering a comment at all. They just want that the prevailing uncertainty to come to an end.
Irfan Iqbal Sheikh, President, Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said he was worried over GDP growth rate prospects in the current scenario of political turmoil and interest rate hike. “Things will take time to settle, but the Supreme Court decision has cleared the fog and shown the direction to get back to the normal.”

Though cautious with their words, business leaders are clearly unhappy over the failure to give the economy precedence over politics

Mentioning the Asian Development Bank (ADB) projection of a 4pc GDP growth rate against the government target of over 5pc, he feared greater deceleration if the government failed to contain the spike in the rising cost of production which is hurting the competitiveness of exports.
“Expensive dollars, rising logistical costs and global recession are already big challenges for local manufacturers aspiring for a bigger share in the local as well as export markets. The interest rate, the highest in the region at 12.25 per cent, will simply seal their fate. The SBP needs to review its decision and bring the cost of borrowing to the regional average,” he said.
He hinted at efforts of building the research and development capacity of the apex business body to assist the government in crafting a consensus economic plan to break out of the low-growth cycle.
Musadaq Zulqarnain, a reputable business leader, was clear and precise. “In any democratic country, the constitutional supremacy is non-negotiable. The Supreme Court decision is a victory for the Constitution. SC buried the doctrine of necessity after a long time.
“Having said that, in order to address the numerous problems, especially the economic meltdown, the country needs a government with a fresh mandate and one would expect that the new leader of the National Assembly will move towards fresh general elections for national and provincial assemblies in the shortest possible time.”
Khurram Mukhtar, Patron-in-Chief of Pakistan Textiles Exporters Association, thought it would have been better had the SC taken notice of the political defections which created doubts in the minds of the people about the quality of the democratic order.
“Yes, it’s good that the SC has acted, but the issue of floor-crossing should have been addressed at the same time.”
Nasser Hayat Magoon, former president of FPCCI, was happy that the SC decision has brought an end to the confusion over the legality of the government’s conduct on April 3 in the National Assembly. “At least, the uncertainty is over now which was damaging the country as it was left directionless.”
Majyd Aziz termed the SC decision ‘judicious’, but warned that the ouster of the prime minister through a no-confidence vote in parliament could set a precedence for a government change before it completes the term with adverse consequences for the economy and the country.
Abdul Aleem, Secretary-General, Overseas Chamber of Commerce and Industry, expressed his concerns over the quality of economic diplomacy. 
Regarding the choice of the parliamentary leader after the ouster of Prime Minister Imran Khan, he said: “Considering the immediate challenge to the economy, our wish will be to have someone with experience and good reputation, preferably an economist/technocrat, familiar with ways to deal with the international financial community. The immediate challenge is to re-align the fundamentals, take bold decisions to re-align prices to a realistic level, remove subsidies on items, like petroleum products, broaden the tax base and build the confidence of market stakeholders. The economics must take precedence over politics.”
Discussing the reluctance of some leading lights of the business community on the evolving political situation, the former prime minister and a leader of PML-N, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, was pragmatic. “The businessmen always want to be on the winning side of the political divide so they steer clear of any controversy. It is logical. In their position, I would do the same. Nothing can protect businesses from a hostile government.”

5,Finance: PSX through rose-tinted glasses,A research report prepared by Arif Habib traced back market performance from 2013 to date and concluded that even when...,"Stockbrokers are telling investors to jump right in if they want their investments to grow 10-15 per cent in the next couple of months.
The ever-optimistic lot of stockbrokers have been predicting nothing less than a bull run for at least five years now. This time it’s real though, they say. The index will rise and investments will grow despite the wild swings last week that saw the benchmark nosedive to 43,902 points on Monday only to rise in subsequent sessions to 44,445 points.
“Investors must take advantage when valuations are down. Anyone who doesn’t invest now will miss the opportunity of a lifetime,” said Shahid Ali Habib, CEO of Arif Habib Ltd, while speaking to Dawn. “I think the index will soon cross 48,000 points,” he said while forecasting an increase of between 10pc and 15pc in share prices by the end of 2021-22.
The KSE-100 index has posted a negative return of 0.66pc in the last 12 months. It has lost 0.34pc since the beginning of this calendar year.

A research report prepared by Arif Habib traced back market performance from 2013 to date and concluded that even when the index dipped by 10pc or more, the price-to-earnings multiple would still be higher than the one prevailing right now, indicating that it is a good time to buy stocks

The key to improvement in market conditions is foreign participation, Mr Habib said, noting that the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) needs “more and more” international investors with a long-term view, which will give confidence to local investors as well. “Our market is cheap in terms of the price-to-earnings (PE) multiple,” he said while referring to a widely used ratio that measures a company’s current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS).
A higher PE multiple signifies a share is expensive while a lower multiple means the opposite. The market is trading at a trailing PE multiple of 4.6, he said. “We’ve historically had an average multiple of eight.”
A research report prepared by Mr Habib’s brokerage traced back market performance from 2013 to date and concluded that even when the index dipped by 10pc or more, the multiple would still be higher than the one prevailing right now. For example, it cited the outbreak of Covid-19 in early 2020 (PE of 7.2), Indo-Pak border tensions in early 2019 (PE of 8.1) and the last interest rate hike and rupee depreciation towards the end of 2018 (PE of 8.8). “We do not foresee any major downside to the index,” the research note said.
Speaking to Dawn, Topline Securities CEO Mohammed Sohail said he expects a “partial recovery” in the benchmark index, which may go up to 50,000 points by the end of June.
“The country needs clarity on two fronts: economic and political. It looks like we’ve got political clarity to a large extent. Now our biggest worry is the rapid decline in reserves,” he said.
The country’s foreign exchange reserves have dropped 23pc in the last couple of months to $17.5 billion. 
Mr Sohail said the stock market is looking forward to the new government taking steps to arrest the rapid fall in foreign exchange reserves. It’ll be better for the PSX if the new government moves swiftly to convince the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the release of funds under the ongoing loan programme, he said.
In addition, the new government should negotiate with friendly countries like China, Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates for economic relief packages and rollover of maturing debt, he added.
With respect to the deteriorating outlook on inflation and the consequent hike of as much as 250 basis points in the key interest rate, Mr Sohail said a select few sectors of the PSX stand to benefit from the rare move by the central bank.
“In addition to commercial banks whose share prices are likely to appreciate following the interest rate hike, I think companies in textile, technology and exploration and production sectors will also see a positive trend. They’ll be better off because they either earn in dollars or have lots of excess cash sitting on their balance sheets,” he said.
Mr Sohail also advised the PSX management to simplify the documentation process for account opening and due diligence — something that’s become exceedingly tedious in the past couple of years and is inadvertently pushing potential investors away from the stock market.

8,Agriculture: Planting cotton under extreme water stress,Pakistan began the season with both of its major reservoirs exhausted.,"Pakistan starts yet another tough Kharif season. With water shortages, especially in the early part of the season, shooting beyond 30 per cent, threatening to go higher as river flows are receding with higher temperatures, Sindh and Punjab are disputing their share in this water poverty.
Statistical reality presents a gloomy picture. Pakistan began the season with both of its major reservoirs exhausted: Tarbella dam and Chashma at a dead level and Mangla Lake holding a paltry 354,000 acre-feet. Last year, the country started the season with 1.57 million acre-feet of water — some five times more than what it has to contend with this year. Even if taken against the last ten years’ average of over one million acre-feet, this year began with one-third of it. 
The last week only added to the paucity. On Friday (April 8, 2022), when these lines were written, Mangla Lake had dropped to 246,000 acre-feet and Tarbella and Chashma maintained dead levels. It was largely because the daily river flows failed to improve despite the high temperature in the catchment areas of both dams. On April 1, the total national rivers flow was recorded at 82,100 cusecs. On April 8, it stood at 82,700 cusecs: it reads against 104,900 cusecs last year on the same day, and 137,700 cusecs of the last 10-year average. During these eight days, temperatures in Northern Area jumped from 11 degrees Celsius to 22 degrees Celsius. As Mangla Lake level drop below its spillways’ crust level (1,091 feet), its outflow would be reduced further to 32,000 cusecs — putting additional pressure on the irrigation supplies to Punjab. 

Last year, the country started the season with 1.57 million acre-feet of water — some five times more than what it has to contend with this year

Though the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) is yet to announce final consensus shortages figures, it was already passing on the 30pc shortages to Sindh and Punjab: on Friday, against a demand of 77,400 cusecs by Punjab, it was getting 50,000 cusecs only. Similarly, Sindh received 31,500 cusecs against its indent of 44,700 cusecs — both absorbing 29pc shortages to be exact.
This is the water context in which Punjab plans to sow its biggest and nationally important cotton crop on 4.5m acres: though the federal committee on cotton has still not formally assigned the target to the province. Encouraged by last year’s better production, high rates and revival of farmers’ interest in the crop, Punjab is aiming for a 45pc jump in acreage from 3.1m acres last year to 4.5m acres this year.
Last year’s performance of the crop encouraged the province to aim much higher. Apart from better germination, the substantial increase in plant population (from 15,500 in 2020 to 17,800 per acre in 2021) boosted the average yield from 15.68 maunds in 2020 to 19.62 maunds per acre in Punjab last year. In Sindh, it was even better; 30 maunds per acre, pushing the national average to 25 maunds per acre. The official handholding only added to the economic sheen of the crop.
These factors helped put the crop back on the revival path and it was expected to retrieve the area it had lost to competing crops like rice and sugarcane in the province. However, water is turning out to be a big hurdle right in the middle of the sowing spree. To make the matter even more complicated, the entire crop is sown in the brackish water zone, completely dependent on canal water. 
“Water issues can cost up to one million bales,” warns Dr Saghir Ahmad, chief economist of the Cotton Research Institute (Multan). The water issue was one of the many reasons that pushed acreage down last year and it would do the same this year as well. It not only hits sowing but keeps impacting the crop throughout its lifecycle. At the sowing stage, it can deter sowing. At the fruiting stage, it can cause shedding and hit yield. If pest attacks weaken plants, the damage can be much higher than what would happen otherwise. Punjab may not get to the acreage figure it is aiming for. How much it loses, only time would tell. But, it certainly would, he forecasts.
“Though farmers’ surveys are indicating an increasing trend this year, that increase is over the last year’s acreage of 3.1m acres,” claims one of the employees of the Agriculture Department. “We are trying our best, but 4.5m acres — an increase of 45pc — seems to be too much to attain in any way, given exceptional water stress, along with other reasons like high cost of production. One hopes that increasing temperatures reduce shortages. However, even if the water situation improves in the next week or two, it would take another two weeks for the water to reach the south of Punjab — narrowing down the sowing window.
Abad Khan, a farmer from central Punjab, thinks that the coarse rice variety in central districts (Sahiwal, Arifwala, Pakpattan, or the potato belt), where the nursery is planted in March and goes to the field in April needs a massive quantity of water. Similarly, the maize crop has gained 1.5 to two feet in height and in this hot weather needs twice a week watering. All these crops are bound to suffer and are suffering at present.
The rice crop in the basmati belt may escape the brunt because its transplantation would go to the field in July when the monsoon would start supplementing supplies. But all other crops are under stress and would remain so till late Kharif when shortage, as per current Irsa calculations, drop down to 6pc, he predicts.

9,CORPORATE WINDOW: Hoping against hope,There is no doubt that the economy will have to bear a significant cost of the extended period of political instability but it...,"The drama unfolding in Islamabad since the submission of a no-confidence motion by the opposition political parties to topple the prime minister through a prescribed constitutional method, and Imran Khan’s refusal to allow the process to take its logical course does not inspire much hope of a resolution of the political crisis any time soon. 
If the Saturday morning parliamentary proceedings called for a vote on the no-confidence resolution on the order of the Supreme Court are any sign of the things to come, we may still find the ongoing political impasse in the country holding even today and the matter taken back to the judges for a fresh ruling. On the face of it, it was clear that Prime Minister Imran Khan isn’t ready to step down despite losing the confidence of the majority in the House, and is willing to drag his feet, irrespective of the costs to the country and its economy. 
The current political crisis has taken a massive toll on the economy, with no one in the administration willing to take the required decisions in such a situation. Even the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) after a significant delay, hiked its key policy rate by a huge 250 basis points (bps) to 12.25 per cent following an emergency meeting on Thursday in a bid to arrest increasing risks to the economy related to escalating inflation and deteriorating external balance. Although the rupee has begun recouping some of the ground lost over the last month, and the stock exchange recovering after the Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling, declared the cancellation of the no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Imran Khan as well as the subsequent dissolution of the National Assembly ‘contrary’ to the constitution, the recovery is not likely to last long unless a stable government is in place.

There is no doubt that the economy will have to bear a significant cost of the extended period of political instability but it will be worth paying if it makes Pakistan stronger democratically paving the way for long-term economic stability

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the SBP rightly pointed out that a “reduction in domestic political uncertainty and prudent fiscal policies should help ensure that Pakistan’s robust economic recovery from the Covid pandemic remains sustainable”.
“Since the last MPC meeting, the outlook for inflation has deteriorated and risks to external stability have risen,” the central bank said in the statement, adding that “heightened domestic political uncertainty has contributed to a 5pc depreciation of the home currency. This, in addition to a number of external factors, including the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and the expected, quicker increase in the US interest rates, has compelled the bank to revise the key lending rate, the SBP said.
As things stand, the price inflation is projected to stay elevated at above 11pc and the country’s fragile foreign exchange reserves have already depleted to $11.3 billion. Export refinance is also raised from 3pc to 5.5pc and the scope of cash margin requirement has been extended to imports of more finished goods to slash the country’s burgeoning import bill because of higher global commodity prices, including crude, according to the central bank. 
The International Monetary Fund has already stopped funding to Pakistan under its $6bn Extended Fund Facility as it waits for the political drama to end, and the installation of a new government to deal with. China, according to some senior officials, is also waiting for ‘stability to return to the country before rolling over its debt of $2.3bn’, which matured and was paid back a few days ago. The political situation is also contributing to delays in a planned $1bn green bond sale.
It is quite clear that it will not be easy for the future government of the country to put the economy back on the road to stabilisation, and the people will be asked to give more sacrifices. We may probably see more stringent austerity policies for the economy in the budget for the next fiscal year unless we are able to get emergency assistance from the global lenders and friendly countries. 
Every event leading to political instability and uncertainty such as seen in recent weeks imposes certain costs on the economy and the people, both in the short to medium term, and, sometimes, in the longer term. There is no doubt that the economy will have to bear a significant cost of the extended period of political instability caused by the opposition parties’ move against the prime minister and people are in for tougher times going forward. But it will be worth paying if it takes the country closer to a stronger democratic dispensation and longer-term economic stability.

10,"Cash poor, perk rich government officials",Nearly 80pc of public sector employees have more than three non-salary perks.,"Whether government officials are paid fairly is a frequently disputed question that has never been adequately researched as not all salaries and benefits in Pakistan’s government sector are listed on the pay slip. 
In this context, a study by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) on civil service remuneration, part of a more significant issue of public service reforms, provides valuable insights into the existing incentive system — a tangle of financial remunerations, in-kind payouts, and intangible awards, so it’s a difficult task.
Despite claims that bureaucrats are underpaid, a study by PIDE revealed that civil servants earn 20 per cent more than their private-sector counterparts. According to the study Cash Poor, Perk Rich! Civil Service Compensation: Incentives, Dissatisfaction, And Costs, bureaucracy was receiving massive benefits without disclosing on their pay slips, which in the case of Grade-22 officials, is ten times more than the average basic salary of the officer. 
The overall compensation package for each Basic Pay Scale grade of public servant has been calculated by combining pay, allowances, non-monetary perks and awards. The study was released two days after the federal cabinet agreed to enable bureaucrats to profit from the Management Pay Scale without quitting their positions in the public service.

Compared to their private-sector colleagues, civil officials do not have a salary disadvantage with nearly 80pc of public sector employees having more than three non-salary perks

By compiling statistics on cash compensation and the market worth of perks and privileges, the research seeks to calculate government officials’ entire costs. Remember that this is a lower bound estimate for various government agencies as only allowances available to all are included.
Including ministry-specific allowances will raise the estimates, making intra-government disparities appear inequitable. The study uses a variety of government papers and databases to calculate the overall cost, including wages, allowances, in-kind benefits, and intangible benefits.
Compared to their private-sector colleagues, civil officials do not have a salary disadvantage. A Grade 21 officer’s overall cost is 12pc more than a United Nations national officer. Non-monetary benefits are far more common in the public sector than in the private sector, with 80pc of private-sector employees receiving none. Nearly 80pc of public sector employees, on the other hand, have more than three non-salary perks. Perks are ineffective remuneration since they are unrelated to performance and efficiency.
Civil workers’ take-home pay consists of their wage plus allowances, which is the sum that shows on their pay slips. This salary includes a monetary wage, a rental ceiling, a medical allowance, a conveyance allowance, a monetised transportation facility (for Grades 20-22), and other general allowances easily accessible across ministries. Special pay, ad-hoc, senior-post, orderly and qualification allowances are examples of these. These allowances account for a significant amount of the money paid to federal officials. 
Surprisingly, according to the report, instead of indexing salaries and developing a proper payment system, various pay and pension committees have chosen to compensate for inflation by providing arbitrary allowances, with 74 such allowances typical across many government agencies and ministries. Allowances for mobility, haircutting, education, special travel, research, entertainment, firewood, washing, mobile phone, medical risk and fuel are a few examples. To simplify the pay system, most allowances should be integrated.
Additional perks and allowances raise cash payouts over basic salaries in different ways. House allowance adds 45 to 55pc to remuneration, ad-hoc expenses add 10pc, medical allowances add 15pc and special pay adds 20pc to the total. These allowances account for 54 to 57 pc of total compensation in Grades 17 to 19. Allowances account for more than 70pc of the overall income for officers in Grades 20-22. 
Federal workers get in-kind allowances or perks in addition to tangible monetary allowances, which contribute to the overall cost of maintaining a civil servant. In-patient medical costs are reimbursable upon receipt of invoices. There is a shadow cost for using an official vehicle despite the monetisation policy, the market rental value of government housing, government servants, paid utility bills and many more other benefits are available. These are unreported charges not included in the pay slip.
These perks contribute to the overall cost of working for the government: 39pc for grade 17, 34pc for Grade 18, and 38pc for Grade 19. By Grade 20, the percentage rise in monetary terms jumps to 53pc, 60pc for Grade 21, and 57pc for Grade 22. As a result, the share of cash allowances in compensation and quantitative benefits in the overall cost rises with increasing grades. Furthermore, the government housing facility, which is provided as an in-kind benefit, has never been included in the total cost of the civil servants’ salaries. 
The government’s opportunity cost has also never been estimated; officers in Grades 1 to 19 receive a total package (including allowances) of around 3-4 times their base pay. The overall compensation for Grades 20 to 22 is around 7-8 times their base salary.
In addition to their monetary income, Pakistan’s upper judiciary enjoys various benefits and privileges, including official cars, contingent employees and free utilities. According to the PIDE report, 15 judges and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan receive special pay packages, as do around 130 judges in provincial high courts. Their salaries range between Rs1m and Rs1.17m.
If allowances and benefits are monetised, the illusion of cheap compensation in the public sector would be debunked. As a result, monetisation can improve transparency and fairness while also lowering administrative costs and difficulties.
For any future civil service reform initiative in Pakistan, the report recommends the following:
Competitive compensation: To ensure that government officials’ well-being is not jeopardised, the reform should begin by appropriately rewarding them. Previous pay commission proposals were unsuccessful because they merely proposed an increase in salary and allowances while maintaining the current structure. The remuneration of government officials must be equivalent to those in the private sector. An annual survey must be used to alter the salary of public officials every year. The second component of the adjustment must be based on performance, with only those who meet a mutually agreed-upon and set efficiency criterion receiving a rise.
Monetisation: Housing provided by the government must be monetised. Starting with grade 19-22 personnel, the monetisation of the housing facility can be initiated successively by grades within set time restrictions. After releasing government housing assets in Islamabad to the private sector, the government may be able to obtain this value, estimated to be around Rs1.45 trillion.
Top-level public workers should be provided cars on a lease basis. The benefit of this strategy is that the relevant bank would monitor the asset.

11,Data points,"Criticism can increase creativity in a cooperative context. In an experiment, half of the brainstorming...","Cooperative vs competitive criticism
Criticism can increase creativity in a cooperative context. In an experiment, half of the brainstorming groups were told that all ideas would be presented to the planning committee. Those instructions cultivated a cooperative atmosphere, and we found that instructions encouraging criticism within these cooperative groups yielded not just more ideas, but more creative ideas. In a competitive context, criticism can decrease creativity. The other half of the brainstorming groups were told to select their group’s best idea to be prioritised above all the others, thus creating a competitive environment. We found encouraging criticism in these groups yielded fewer ideas and less-creative ideas as evaluated by judges. This suggests that criticism can indeed hurt creativity if the nature of the group or its task is competitive, mainly because the criticism may be construed as destructive and can trigger intragroup conflict.

The expensive world of digital fashion
The world’s biggest luxury brands have been dipping their toes into the world of digital fashion. The early evidence suggests there are eager buyers willing to pay premium prices for virtual products, like a virtual Gucci purse that cost more than its real-life equivalent and a one-of-a-kind electronic Dolce & Gabbana tiara that fetched over $300,000 at auction. The digital luxury market is in its very early days, analysts say. But if companies figure out how to engage a new generation of consumers, annual digital sales could eventually come to as much as 50 billion euros, equivalent to about $55.2bn, by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley. That would represent a 10th of all projected luxury revenues for the industry by then. Last year, Gucci made 400 digital versions of its Dionysus bags available in the gaming world Roblox for the equivalent of around $6 each. That sparked frenzied trading among Roblox players eager to customise their avatars with Gucci accessories. One paid the equivalent of over $4,000 — more than the bag’s real-life equivalent — to secure one.

Blood clot danger of Covid-19
The risk of developing serious bleeding or potentially deadly blood clots is elevated for months after experiencing even a mild Covid infection, Swedish researchers found. The researchers compared the medical records of 1m people who tested positive for the virus between February 2020 and May 2021 in Sweden to 4m of their peers who weren’t infected. Covid patients had almost double the risk of bleeding in the month after they were infected, according to the study, and almost five times the risk of deep vein thrombosis. The chance of suffering a pulmonary embolism, when a clot travels to the lungs and can kill, was significantly higher for four months. While the danger was highest for those with other health conditions and the most severe infections, the fact that many more people develop mild cases means they should also remain alert, the experts said.

Affording cloned pets
A cloned pet is, simply put, an identical genetic twin, separated by years, decades, perhaps centuries. The cloning of pets is controversial but growing in popularity despite its continuing high cost. That cost is out of the range of many, but several celebrities including Simon Cowell and Barbra Streisand have revealed in recent years that they have had their dogs cloned or were planning to do so. But animal welfare organisations have concerns about the sector, saying a cloned animal is never going to be an exact copy of the original pet, especially when it comes to behaviour. The Texas-based company Viagen Pets and Equine is the first and only US firm to offer commercial cloning of dogs and cats. It says it is now cloning more and more pets every year and has cloned “hundreds” since it first opened for business in 2015. The firm charges $50,000 to clone a dog, $30,000 for a cat, and $85,000 for a horse.

12,Business as usual for exports,"The political pendulum has swung wildly in the last few weeks, as it often does in the country, but exports and ...","The political pendulum has swung wildly in the last few weeks, as it often does in the country, but exports and trade prospects appear largely unaltered regardless of the shenanigans or the hike in the interest rate. At the time of writing, the results of the no-confidence votes were not announced but stakeholders appeared to consider the outcome a foregone conclusion and responded accordingly.
“With more stability, there will be more certainty and it is likely that the new government will push for regional trade to source raw materials such as cotton. If sanctions are lifted on Iran, Pakistan could import cheaper energy which would help across the board,” says Dr Manzoor Ahmed, a former ambassador to the World Trade Organisation.
Dismissing any threat of punitive actions by the United States, Dr Manzoor said that with the regime change, the risk has been averted. 
“As far as the US, UK and Europe is concerned, consumers purchase goods where they see value. If Pakistani products are competitive, they will be purchased regardless of political developments. The buyers are independent of the government and make decision based on commercial interests,” said Ehsan Malik, CEO of the Pakistan Business Council.
“Contrary to some people, the tariffs imposed on Pakistan’s textile products is the same as those imposed on competing countries. Since the buyers in the US are trying to diversify in anticipation of possible moves by various big players, Pakistan is a beneficiary of that as well. However, the major beneficiaries of US importer efforts of diversification are countries like Laos and Cambodia. 
“Obviously, when the government intervenes such as in the case of GSP Plus then the framework has to be complied with. For example, Cambodia failed to comply and was expelled from the programme a year ago.  
“What really needs to happen for managing imports is to withdraw the subsidy that was given on fuel and a physical rationing it because if the things continue as they are, we may end up alarming like Sri Lanka is today,” cautioned Mr Malik.
“The increase in interest rate is cushioned by the exchange rate adjustment,” says Khurrum Mukhtar, Patron in Chief of the Pakistan Textile Exporters. “Though rupee’s devaluation will make imported raw material more expensive, the human resource costs have gone down in dollar terms. Other than the overall slowing down of the global economy, there is no major impact on textiles exports of the economic and political turmoil in the country.” 
Pakistan Bureau of Statistics data shows textile exports increased by 35.72 per cent in dollar terms and 50.51pc in rupee terms in February 2022 over the same month last year, indicating that the devaluation has been in favour of the country’s main exports. As dollars fetch in more rupees, labour costs are mitigated even when accounting for increases in salary linked to inflation. 
The orders that were diverted to Pakistan from Bangladesh, India and Vietnam during the lockdown are still continuing, asserts Mr Mukhtar. “The order book is full as far as apparel is concerned though home textiles is suffering but as we go into peak period of May-September in the run up to the autumn-winter season and Christmas, things will improve.”
Furthermore, Walt Disney has accepted Pakistan as one of the permitted sourcing countries after the ban in 2013 through the Better Work Programme that focuses on improving textile sector’s labour conditions and competitiveness. This is a big development for licensed home textiles and apparel with business prospects of $500-800 million, he added.  
Pakistan’s share in apparel business is 1.5pc globally whereas share for home textiles in 17pc, he said while expecting some stability after the no-confidence vote.
While the story seems positive for textiles, the conditions for leather are not so sanguine. “At the moment, prospects for leather are not optimistic because post-Covid people have stop indulging in leather garments which are viewed as a luxury items. Leather garments are usually bought in person — as an expensive product people prefer to physically go to the shop to try it out and assess the cut and fitting. Thus, the boom of online shopping versus physical shopping has adversely affected leather sales. This has led to a decline in Pakistan’s leather exports of more than 26pc over the last year,” says Syed Shujaat Ali, former chairman of Pakistan Leather Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.
“The Asian Pacific Leather Fair is the world’s biggest leather show and has been around for over two decades, taking place in Hong Kong usually. It had not taken place for the last two years because of the pandemic lockdown. This year it was held in Dubai from March 30th to April 1st. It was a flop.
“Vendors from China did not participate, resultantly buyers from Europe and the US did not attend the fair either. I forsee a tough couple of years for Pakistan’s leather exports, especially since the measures taken for the promotion of textiles did not extend to the leather industry. The fault also lies with the industry for not taking proactive measures to market their products. In the face of falling exports, banks were hesitant to finance leather exporters as well,” he said.  
While the Ukraine fallout remains insignificant for rice exporters for whom Europe is a key market, shipping remains the biggest challenge especially on the European and African routes, said former chairman of Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan Safdar Hussain Mehkri. Devaluation is a boon as it makes Pakistani rice cheaper than its competitors such as India and always helps in the short run. 
“However, in the longer run, devaluation brings a higher cost of doing business,” he says. Other than the usual woes, crop availability and pricing is good he asserts confidently.
