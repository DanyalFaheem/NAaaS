0,Pro-Russia protesters rally in Germany,383 anti-Russian offences have been reported in the country since the Kremlin’s invasion on Feb 24...,"FRANKFURT: Pro-Russia protesters rallied in Germany on Sunday, with the country’s significant Russian-speaking population demanding an end to the discrimination it says it has suffered since war began in Ukraine.
Germany is home to 1.2 million people of Russian origin and 325,000 from Ukraine. Authorities fear the conflict could be imported into Germany and the protests used to promote Moscow’s war narrative.
Police have recorded 383 anti-Russian offences and 181 anti-Ukrainian offences since the Kremlin’s invasion started on February 24.
Around 600 people descended on financial hub Frankfurt on Sunday amid a sea of Russian flags to protest  “against hatred and harassment”, a journalist saw, and there was a heavy police presence.
“I came here because I support peace, children are beaten at school because they speak Russian, that’s not acceptable,” Ozan Yilmaz, 24, said.

383 anti-Russian offences have been reported in the country since the Kremlin’s invasion on Feb 24

“The war didn’t start this year, it has been going on since 2014 and so I find that speaking of an attack” against Ukraine by Russia is  “not really appropriate”, said Sebastian, 25, who was in the crowd. Police threw up a large cordon to separate the protesters — marching behind a banner 
that read  “Truth and diversity of opinion over PROPAGANDA” — from a pro-Ukraine counter-demonstration of around 100 people near the city’s central banking district.
Approximately 600 demonstrators staged a car convoy in the northern city of Hanover following an appeal by the Russian-speaking community, local police said.
Police said they were closely monitoring the convoy. A counter-demonstration in the city under the banner  “Support Ukraine!” attracted 3,500 people, according to police.
Similar protests were held on Saturday in Stuttgart and in the northern city of Lubeck, where around 150 people took part.
Lubeck police said they stopped a convoy of around 60 vehicles because it broke the law by expressing support for  “Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine” and using  “banned symbols”.
Police in Hanover said fences had been put up to separate the  pro-Russian protesters from the counter-demonstration and they added  that the protests had been peaceful so far.“We will  not allow our fundamental right to gather and protest to be exploited  for Russian war propaganda on German streets,” Lower-Saxony’s interior  minister Boris Pistorius told local media on Friday.
Russian  President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on what he calls a   “special military operation” to demilitarise and  “denazify” Ukraine.  Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.

1,Record 700-kilo meth haul netted in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG: Hong Kong customs officials have seized about 700 kilograms of suspected crystal meth sent from Mexico,...","HONG KONG: Hong Kong customs officials have seized about 700 kilograms of suspected crystal meth sent from Mexico, authorities said on Sunday, the biggest haul of the drug in the city’s history.
The meth was hidden inside two consignments of heavy industrial gear, said Lee Kam-wing, head of the customs department’s drug investigation bureau.
They arrived in the city by air and sea within one week in March.
The equipment was arranged to ship from Mexico with a mainland Chinese logistics company, which was also asked to find a Hong Kong company to receive and store it, Lee said.
“In that way the drug dealers did not have to show up at all... it’s very cunning,” Lee said.
Nearly 450 kg of liquid meth was found in three transformers — each weighing 500 kg — at the city’s airport.
That led officers to 253 kg of meth powder with a similar import pattern, which had been stowed inside shock absorption rubbers and had already been transported to a warehouse in a rural area near the mainland border.
Customs officers had to call in firefighters to saw their way into the equipment.
“The syndicate used such heavy industrial equipment with complicated structures that was difficult to open up for one single purpose — to avoid examination by customs,” Lee said.
Two men working for local logistics companies handling the shipments were arrested and released on bail, as Lee vowed to chase down the overseas syndicate in collaboration with mainland authorities.
Hong Kong Customs have seized 1.2 tonnes of various drugs so far this year, 4.6 times more than the same period last year.
Meth, the second most popular drug in Hong Kong, tops this year’s seizure list with 814 kg so far, an elevenfold increase on 71 kg in the first quarter last year.

2,Tax concession for ex-finance chief fuels fresh attacks on UK govt,Finance minister Rishi Sunak is seeing his once-rosy prospects of succeeding Prime Minister Boris Johnson ebb rapidly.,"LONDON: Britain’s beleaguered finance minister won fulsome backing from a cabinet colleague on Sunday but revelations about the past tax status of another minister gave new ammunition to government critics.
Policing minister Kit Malthouse denied that Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak’s political career was doomed after it emerged that his Indian wife benefits from  “non-domicile” tax status.
Akshata Murty, whose father co-founded the IT behemoth Infosys, said she would in future pay UK taxes on all her global income, after 48 hours of controversy that has still not dimmed.
After announcing a budget that was widely criticised for doing little to help hard-pressed Britons, Sunak is seeing his once-rosy prospects of succeeding Prime Minister Boris Johnson ebb rapidly.
“Rishi Sunak has been a remarkable force for good in this country over the last two years,” Malthouse told Sky News, highlighting Sunak’s financial support packages during the coronavirus pandemic.
“He is a smart, clever, committed politician who came into parliament with me (in 2015) and I have been deeply impressed by him ever since. I’m a big fan.”
Sunak stands accused of hypocrisy for raising taxes on Britons in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, while his own family has seen millions of pounds in Infosys dividends shielded from his own Exchequer.
Sunak has also been criticised for a lack of transparency, after he admitted to holding a  “Green Card” for US permanent residents until last year.
Possession of the card would oblige Sunak to keep the United States as his long-term home and pay US taxes, despite serving as Britain’s second-most powerful politician with designs on Johnson’s job.
The Independent newspaper meanwhile said that Sunak was listed as the beneficiary of offshore trusts set up in the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands to help manage his wife’s tax and business affairs.
Yvette Cooper, a frontbench MP for the opposition Labour party, said of Sunak,  “I think that ethics do matter when you’re in government, particularly as there may be a conflict of interest here as well.”
She demanded clarity from Sunak about the offshore trusts and about why he retained a Green Card years after working and studying in the United States, where he met Murty.
The couple often go back to their California home with their children but Malthouse told BBC television that it was a  “pretty rotten insinuation” to suggest that Sunak was not wholly committed to Britain.
Sajid Javid, Sunak’s predecessor as chancellor, revealed meanwhile that he had also obtained  “non-dom” status between 2000 and 2006, during a lucrative career in banking before he entered politics.
Javid, who is now Johnson’s health secretary, worked in New York in the 1990s and in Singapore from 2007 to 2009. He made the tax admission after an investigation by the Sunday Times newspaper.

3,W. Sahara’s Polisario breaks ties with Madrid,ALGIERS: The Polisario independence movement on Sunday announced a  “break” in contacts with the Spanish...,"ALGIERS: The Polisario independence movement on Sunday announced a  “break” in contacts with the Spanish government in protest at its U-turn on the disputed territory of Western Sahara.
“The Polisario Front has decided to break contacts with the current Spanish government” over its  “instrumentalisation of the Western Sahara question in shameful bargaining with the (Moroccan) occupier”, the movement wrote in a statement. It said the break will last until Madrid  “conforms with decisions of international legality, which recognises the Sahrawi people’s right to self-determination, and with respect for the borders of their country, as internationally recognised”.
Spain on March 18 said it had agreed to publicly recognise Rabat’s autonomy plan for the territory, ending a decades-long stance of neutrality.
In agreeing to a long-standing Moroccan demand, Spain sought to end a dispute which erupted in April 2021 when it allowed Western Sahara’s independence leader Brahim Ghali to be treated for Covid-19 at a Spanish hospital.
Weeks after Ghali’s hospitalisation, more than 10,000 migrants surged into Spain’s tiny North African enclave of Ceuta as Moroccan border forces looked the other way, in an incident seen as meant to punish Madrid.

4,Iceland chilled by violence worthy of its noir novels,"REYKJAVIK: Long considered the  “most peaceful country in the world”, Iceland’s tranquillity has been ...","REYKJAVIK: Long considered the  “most peaceful country in the world”, Iceland’s tranquillity has been shattered by a spate of shootings and stabbings involving criminal gangs.
The country of only 375,000 people is more accustomed to reading about murders in its famed Icelandic noir novels than in its morning newspapers.
“A gun for Icelanders symbolises sports” or hunting, said sociologist Helgi Gunnlaugsson.
“It’s very alien to the Icelandic mind that you would use a weapon to protect yourself or to point at people,” he said.
Iceland has topped the Global Peace Index ranking since 2008 thanks to its low crime, strong education and welfare systems, fair pay and an absence of tension between social classes. Only four people have been shot dead in more than two decades.
But four shootings have now taken place in a little over a year, one of which was fatal.
In February 2021, a man was gunned down in a hail of bullets outside his home in a neighbourhood of the capital Reykjavik, a murder that shocked the nation. The killing was linked to organised crime, police said.
“Criminal groups in Iceland are becoming more organised,” said criminologist Margret Valdimarsdottir.
“They have more ties to international groups than what we’ve seen before, which may be a challenge for our police force.” In February, two separate drug-related shootings took place in Reykjavik two days apart, one in the city centre. The gang violence is similar to that already seen in other parts of Europe.
“It takes five to 10 years for what is trending in Europe to show up in Iceland,” said Runolfur Thorhallsson, superintendent of Iceland’s elite police unit, known as the Viking Squad. “Of course this is a concern for us.”
Unarmed police
Iceland is one of the rare countries in the world where police are not armed in their daily duties.
However, patrol cars have been equipped with handguns in special safes since late 2015 after the bloody attacks by far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik in Norway in 2011.
Only a small number of police officers — the Viking Squad — are permanently armed with semi-automatic weapons as well as bulletproof vests and ballistic shields.
The squad assists the police when weapons are reported, with the number of such incidents rocketing almost six-fold since 2014.
“We see indicators that maybe people are less hesitant in this criminal world to use weapons. We see more of an increase in knives than firearms,” Thorhallsson said.
While he doesn’t have an explanation for the rise in violence, the interior minister is considering equipping police with tasers. The head of the police union, Fjolnir Saemundsson, welcomed the idea but called for more recruits and training.
With 682 police officers in 2021, Iceland has one of Europe’s smallest police forces relative to its population, second only to Finland and almost half the European average, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.
A safe country
Studlar, a government-run treatment centre for juveniles aged from 12 to 18, helps troubled youths with problems ranging from drugs to crime and behavioural issues.
Director Funi Sigurdsson said he has also seen a slight rise in violent incidents, with the centre confiscating an increasing number of knives.
He said with some of the young people it was often clear  “when they were six years old that they would end up here.

5,Iraqis clean up river as first green projects take root,"The green banks of the Tigris, popular for picnics by families and groups of friends, are usually littered with waste.","BAGHDAD: Garbage clogs the banks of Iraq’s Tigris River in Baghdad but an army of young volunteers is cleaning it, a rare environmental project in the war-battered country.
With boots and gloves, they pick up soggy trash, water bottles, aluminium cans and muddy styrofoam boxes, part of a green activist campaign called the Cleanup Ambassadors.
“This is the first time this area has been cleaned since 2003,” shouts a passer-by about the years of conflict since a US-led invasion toppled dictator Saddam Hussein.
The war is over but Iraq faces another huge threat: a host of interrelated environmental problems from climate change and rampant pollution to dust storms and water scarcity. The 200 volunteers at work in Baghdad want to be part of the solution, removing garbage from a stretch of one of the mighty rivers that gave birth to the ancient civilisations of Mesopotamia.
“It breaks my heart to see the banks of the Tigris in this state,” said one 19-year-old volunteer, who gave only her first name, Rassel, working under Baghdad’s Imams Bridge.
“We want to change this reality. I want to make my city more beautiful.” The task is Herculean in a country where it remains common for people to drop their trash on the ground. 
The green banks of the Tigris, popular for picnics by families and groups of friends, are usually littered with waste, from single-use plastic bags to the disposable tips of hookah pipes, especially after public holidays.
“There is a lot of plastic, nylon bags and corks,” said Ali, also 19 and an organiser of the cleanup event.
The group then handed their collected waste to the Baghdad City Council which took it away, bound for a landfill.

6,Tunisians take to streets against President Saied’s ‘failed dictatorship’,Members of parliament also participate in protest.,"TUNIS: Tunisians on Sunday protested against President Kais Saied, accusing him of imposing one-man rule in the North African country after he dissolved parliament last month.
A political crisis in the country intensified last month when more than half of the members of parliament held an online session to revoke Saied’s decrees.
“We are facing a failed dictatorship that is leading the country to an economic disaster.. We will continue to protest in the streets until a coup is forced to reverse its decisions,” Chaima Issa, an activist, said.
Many members of parliament participated in the protest on Sunday, which took place with a heavy presence of anti-riot police. Protesters chanted:  “The people want to overthrow the coup.”  
“We will continue to resist the coup and we will not retreat. We will not accept this dictatorship,” Samira Chaouchi, one of two deputy speakers of parliament, said.
After last month’s online session, which Saied dissolved, anti-terrorism police summoned the main 
opposition figure Rached Ghannouchi and other lawmakers for questioning, prompting criticism from abroad as well as at home.
Ghannouchi, who is the parliament’s speaker and head of Islamist Ennahda party, said other virtual sessions would be convened.
A delegation from the European Parliament will visit Tunisia on Monday to urge the return of the democracy established after the 2011 revolution that ended the autocratic rule of the late President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
Saied, took control of executive power in the middle of last year and has ruled by decree, which his opponents describe as a coup.
He has rejected his opponents accusations and said he would hold talks on political reforms, but that  “traitors and thieves” would not participate.
Saied has previously said he would form a committee to rewrite the constitution, put it to a referendum in July and then hold parliamentary elections in December.
The country’s two main parties Ennahda and Free Constitutional, which are bitterly opposed, have both said they will oppose those plans.

7,Hundreds of stuffed endangered animals seized in Spain,The private collection is estimated to be worth nearly 29 million euros.,"MADRID: Spain said on Sunday it seized over 1,000 taxidermied animals, including hundreds of endangered or extinct species, in one of the largest hauls of its kind.
The Civil Guard said the private collection, estimated to be worth nearly 29 million euros ($32 million), was discovered in a shed in Betera, near Valencia in eastern Spain.
Among the 1,090 animals seized, 405 are classified as protected, endangered or extinct, including the scimitar-horned oryx once found in parts of Africa.
A stuffed Bengal tiger, considered near extinction, was also found, along with cheetahs, lynxes, polar bears, white rhinos and 198 elephant tusks.
The Civil Guard said on Sunday it was the country’s  “largest haul of nationally-protected taxidermied animals and one of the largest in Europe”.
The owner of the collection is under investigation for smuggling and several environmental crimes.

8,14 nations to take part in Indonesia-US war games,JAKARTA: The annual military exercises between Indonesian and US armies will include more than a dozen countries ...,"JAKARTA: The annual military exercises between Indonesian and US armies will include more than a dozen countries this year, officials said on Sunday, as tensions with China continue to spike in the region.
The  “Garuda Shield” joint training will see militaries from 14 countries — including Britain, Australia and Japan — participate in ground drills and beach-landing exercises from August 1-14 in Indonesia’s South Sumatra archipelago and the East of Borneo island, the Indonesian Army said.
A US official said an estimated 3,000 soldiers will participate in the event.
That would make it  “the largest” edition since Garuda Shield was established in 2009, Albert Tambunan, an Indonesian military spokesperson said Sunday.
This year’s expansion of military cooperation signals an increase in defence ties between the US and some Asia Pacific nations, with tensions flaring in the disputed waters.
The region abuts up to the flashpoint South China Sea — a vital waterway that Beijing claims almost in its entirety, and has been a key point of contention between several Southeast Asian nations and China during annual meetings.
But Ian Francis, chief of the Office of Defense Cooperation at the US embassy in Jakarta, called the expanded war games a  “natural outgrowth of Indonesian military’s continuing capability and their willingness to work more broadly with partners”.
“This really demonstrates that the US has a growing security cooperation relationship with Indonesia,” he said.
A full list of participating countries has not yet been released.
The announcement comes after a visit to Jakarta last month by Admiral John Aquilino, who leads the Indo-Pacific command — which oversees all US military activities in the region.
Indonesia is not officially a claimant in the South China Sea dispute, but the tensions ensnare Southeast Asia’s 10-country regional bloc in annual meetings with Beijing.

9,Poland to approach courts over Stalin era massacre,WARSAW: Polish President Andrzej Duda on Sunday said he would pursue justice through international courts for the...,"WARSAW: Polish President Andrzej Duda on Sunday said he would pursue justice through international courts for the Katyn massacre in 1940 when Stalin’s police shot around 22,000 Poles.
“Genocide has no statute of limitations. Therefore, I will demand that this case be settled before international courts. We will submit the appropriate motions in the nearest future,” Duda said in a speech.
He did not say which court he would apply to, or who would be accused.
Poland on Sunday commemorated the anniversary of the 2010 Smolensk plane crash, which killed the then-president and 95 others, as well as the 82nd anniversary of the massacre which took place in Russia.
“Forgotten, unpunished war crimes, crimes against humanity, are fuelling the sense of impunity among the perpetrators. They are like a green light to their successors and followers,” Duda said.
“We can see this today in full scale as the brutal aggression from Russia against independent and democratic Ukraine unfolds.” Last week the Polish prime minister referred to a  “genocide” carried out by Russian troops in Ukraine, including in the town of Bucha.
Duda said Poland would support Ukraine in any legal or diplomatic effort to seek justice for crimes  “committed by Russians”.
“We will do our utmost to make sure that the Ukrainian victims do not have to wait for justice to be meted out for as much as 80 years!” After the USSR’s invasion of eastern Polish regions in September 1939 under the German-Soviet pact, 22,000 Polish officers — who were prisoners of the Red Army — were shot dead in Katyn forest and Mednoie in Russia as well as in Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine.
The Soviet Union for decades accused Nazi Germany of committing the massacre and it was not until April 1990 that then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev recognised his country’s responsibility for the killings.
“This was a crime of genocide committed by the Soviets on completely defenceless victims. It was never punished,” Duda said.
He recalled  “a brief episode” in the early 1990s under president Boris Yeltsin, when the Kremlin accepted that  “Stalinist authorities” were responsible for the massacre.
Duda regretted that no further action was taken.
“The investigation of Katyn was dropped, no perpetrator was ever punished.
Whereas (President Vladimir) Putin’s Russia has been glorifying Stalin and the Soviet Union again foryears,” he said.
“The Katyn lie has again got the upper hand.”

10,Australian prime minister calls elections for May 21,Polls show much of the electorate distrusts 53-year-old Scott Morrison.,"

SYDNEY: Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison called federal elections for May 21 on Sunday, launching a come-from-behind battle to stay in power after three years rocked by floods, bushfires and the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Morrison’s conservative government is struggling to woo Australia’s 17 million voters, lagging behind the opposition Labor Party in a string of opinion polls despite presiding over a rebounding economy with a 13-year-low jobless rate of four percent. 
“It’s a choice between a strong future and an uncertain one. It’s a choice between a government you know and a Labor opposition that you don’t,” Morrison told a news conference in Canberra. 
Polls show much of the electorate distrusts the 53-year-old leader, who fashions himself as a typical Australian family man and is unafraid of advertising his Pentecostal Christian faith. 
Aiming to end nine years of Liberal-National Party rule is 59-year-old Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese. The opposition leader started the six-week race to the poll pushing a message of optimism before highlighting bruising attacks on Morrison’s character emanating from his own government. 
“He’s running in an election campaign, whereby his deputy prime minister has said he’s a hypocrite and a liar,” Albanese told media in Sydney. “We can and we must do better. The pandemic has given us the opportunity to imagine a better future and Labor has the policies and plans to shape that future.” 
A recent Newspoll survey showed Labor leading the coalition 54 per cent to 46pc on a two-party basis. 
Morrison and Albanese were in a statistical tie as preferred prime minister for the next three-year term. 
Multiple surveys show the cost of living, with gasoline prices notably soaring since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, is a key concern ahead of the election, in which voting is compulsory. 
In a pre-election spree, the government announced an array of giveaways, including a fuel tax cut and a tax rebate for about half of the adult population.
But extreme weather events blamed on an overheating planet, and the government’s response, have also unnerved many Australians. 
High stakes
Morrison is a strident supporter of Australia’s vast fossil fuel industry.
He has vowed to mine and export coal for as long as there are buyers, touted a “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic, and resisted global calls to cut carbon emissions faster by 2030. 
As treasurer in 2017, he famously took a chunk of coal into parliament and told Labor: “This is coal, don’t be afraid.” 
Morrison has been panned, too, over his handling of climate-related disasters in Australia. 
During the 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfires, which killed more than 30 people, Morrison took his family on a Christmas holiday to Hawaii. 
After cutting his break short, Morrison memorably told reporters he was sure people understood that “I don’t hold a hose, mate, and I don’t sit in a control room”. 
“Morrison’s position was virtually untenable as a result of the Hawaii holiday,” said Mark Kenny, professor at the Australian National University in Canberra.
But the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic “changed everything,” he said, turning people’s minds to a new, global crisis. Morrison rightly injected “vast amounts of money” into the economy, but the vaccine rollout was painfully slow and he “messed up” the distribution of self-administered rapid antigen tests, Kenny said. 
More recently, a deadly two-week east coast flooding disaster in late February and early March left residents seething at a perceived lack of government preparation and emergency help.

11,‘Sonic’ sequel zips to top of N. America box office,LOS ANGELES: Paramount’s action-adventure film  “Sonic the Hedgehog 2” took in an estimated $71 million in...,"LOS ANGELES: Paramount’s action-adventure film  “Sonic the Hedgehog 2” took in an estimated $71 million in North America this weekend, a welcome sign for Hollywood that families are returning to in-person viewing, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations reported on Sunday.
“This is an outstanding opening,” particularly for a sequel to a video-based movie, said David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research.
The original  “Sonic” film, based on the popular Sega game involving a lightning-fast hedgehog, scored a $58 million opening in early 2020 at a time when Covid-19 was only beginning to register as a threat.
The latest hybrid production includes Jim Carrey in a live-action role, while Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Idris Elba (Knuckles) and Colleen O’Shaughnessey (Tails) voice animated characters.
Last weekend’s box office leader, Sony’s vampire flick  “Morbius,” placed a very distant second this weekend, taking in $10.2 million, a steep drop from last weekend’s $39.1 million. Jared Leto stars as a Nobel Prize-winner turned blood sucker in an adaptation from Marvel comics. In third was another Paramount film, action romance  “The Lost City,” at $9.2 million. Sandra Bullock plays a romance novelist kidnapped by a twisted tycoon (Daniel Radcliffe) who wants her to help him find a buried artifact on a remote, volcano-prone island.
Fourth spot went to a new Universal release, action adventure  “Ambulance,” at $8.7 million. Jake Gyllenhaal and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II star as adoptive siblings who steal an ambulance to escape after a bank heist.
And in fifth was dark superhero film  “The Batman” from Warner Bros., taking in $6.5 million in its sixth week out. Robert Pattinson plays the caped crime fighter.
Rounding out the top 10 were:  “Everything Everywhere All at Once” ($6 million)  “Uncharted” ($2.7 million)  “Dog” ($635,000)  “Spider-Man: No Way Home” ($625,000)  “Jujutsu Kaisen 0” ($500,000).

12,Yemenis fear Ukraine war will worsen shortages,SANAA: The wheat fields of northern Yemen stretch into the distance but they aren’t enough to nourish a country...,"SANAA: The wheat fields of northern Yemen stretch into the distance but they aren’t enough to nourish a country where millions go hungry.
Already teetering on the edge of famine, war-ravaged Yemen fears a shortage of the staple food ingredient because of a different war — in Ukraine, which is one of the world’s major suppliers of the grain.
In a bustling Sanaa bakery, Mohammed al-Jalal and his staff sell small loaves of bread to customers carrying them away in red plastic bags.
“Flour is available on the market but we worry about shortages because of the war between Russia and Ukraine,” Jalal said.
In Al-Jawf province, which borders Saudi Arabia, farmers are hard at work to harvest their crops before grinding the wheat and shipping it mainly to the capital, rebel-held Sanaa.
Most of Yemen’s roughly 30 million people will not be tasting this home-grown product, because the country depends almost entirely on food imports, with nearly a third of wheat supplies coming from Ukraine, according to the United Nations.
Across the Middle East and North Africa, people are struggling to secure even the most basic staples in view of soaring food and fuel prices triggered by Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine.
Jalal said authorities in Yemen  “should support farmers so they can grow more wheat in our country”.
After more than seven years of civil war, the Arab world’s poorest country was already suffering what the United Nations called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
More than 17 million people in Yemen face high levels of food insecurity, UN-backed assessments showed in March, and the total is likely to increase.
Famine conditions already afflict more than 30,000 Yemenis, UN agencies said.
Ali al-Kabous, an importer and trader of wheat, fears that,  “If the war between Russia and Ukraine continues, the price of wheat will increase here.”
Battle for survival
Food prices in Yemen have already doubled since last year and the country’s years of fighting have led to an economic collapse.
As his staff unload dozens of white sacks filled with flour, Kabous points to a related concern. As global oil prices rise, so will transport costs, and  “that will be an enormous burden on the people”.
The Iran-backed Houthis who control a large part of northern Yemen are fighting Yemen’s internationally recognised government which, since 2015, has been aided by a Saudi-led military coalition.
Accusing Iran of smuggling weapons to the Houthis — a charge Tehran denies — the coalition has enforced an air and sea blockade of rebel-held territory since 2016.
According to the Yemen Data Project, an independent tracker, the coalition has also carried out more than 25,000 air raids on Yemen since it intervened.
“Because of the enemy blockade but also the war in Ukraine, we should ensure food security from within the country,” Ali al-Khaled, spokesman for the rebel-controlled agency in charge of cereal production.
The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation reported last year that total cereal production in 2020 was estimated at 365,000 tonnes, a figure which takes account of  “conflict-related constraints” and which is almost 25 percent below the five-year average.
On April 2, a two-month UN-brokered ceasefire took hold, the war’s first nationwide truce since 2016.
As part of that agreement, the coalition agreed to ease its blockade to allow two weekly commercial flights into Sanaa. Fuel and more food shipments will also flow into the lifeline aid port of Hodeida, which is also rebel-held.
After more than 150,000 people were estimated to have died in the fighting, violence has dropped after the truce, which began on the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
But the battle to survive goes on as Yemenis struggle to feed themselves.

13,Egypt’s foreign reserves dip by $4 billion,Annual inflation rate reaches 12.1 per cent in March.,"CAIRO: Egypt’s annual inflation rate hit 12.1 per cent in March, official figures showed on Sunday, as foreign reserves declined by $4 billion during the same month, according to the central bank.
“The annual headline inflation rate recorded 12.1 per cent for March 2022, compared to 4.8 per cent for the same month last year,” the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics (CAPMAS) said in a statement.
The latest figure marks an increase of more than two per cent compared to the 10 per cent inflation rate recorded in February — already at a near three-year high.
This comes less than three weeks after the Egyptian pound depreciated against the dollar, losing about 17 percent of its value in one day.
The Arab world’s most populous country has been struck by mounting economic pressures since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February caused global commodity price to shoot up.
As the world’s largest importer of wheat, Egypt relied on the two countries for 85 percent of its supply, as well as 73 percent of its sunflower oil.
CAPMAS attributed the latest hike to a surge in food prices, specifically an 11 percent increase in bread and grain prices and a 36.2 percent increase in the price of cooking oil.
It comes after the Central Bank of Egypt said on Thursday that foreign reserves saw a $4 billion decline, registering $37 billion at the end of March 2022, compared to $41 billion in February.
It attributed the decline to its mobilisation of foreign reserves  “to calm the markets” in the wake of the Ukraine war. Egypt has rolled out a series of measures to mitigate the economic fallout from the conflict, including announcing a $7 billion relief package to shield society’s most vulnerable.
