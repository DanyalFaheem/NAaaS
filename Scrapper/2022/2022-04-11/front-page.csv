ISLAMABAD: PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif submits his nomination papers for the post of prime minister to the National Assembly secretary at the Parliament House on Sunday. — White Star

 
• PML-N president, PTI’s Qureshi file nomination papers
• 52 cabinet members de-notified
ISLAMABAD: As the National Assembly convenes today (on Monday) to elect prime minister after Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz president Shehbaz Sharif and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Sunday filed their nomination papers, the PTI seems divided over its erstwhile decision of en masse resignations by its lawmakers.
While the cabinet division de-notified 52 members of the federal cabinet — 25 federal ministers, four ministers of state, four advisers to the PM and 19 special assistants to the PM — after the historic vote of no-confidence by the joint opposition against ex-premier Imran Khan, Mr Sharif having bright chances to make it to the top slot said the new cabinet would be formed only after consultation with all allies.
As the PTI core committee remained indecisive in a meeting chaired by Mr Khan on Sunday whether to go for en masse resignations of MNAs or not, the party chairman called the parliamentary party meeting at the Parliament House at 12 noon on Monday to make a final decision. Whether Mr Qureshi will contest the election for the premiership or will resign along with other MNAs of the PTI and its allies depends on the outcome of the PTI parliamentary meeting.
However, the PTI decided to give a tough time to the upcoming government through street protests if the PML-N won the contest in the parliament for which voting would begin at 2pm.

On the other hand, Mr Sharif met the leadership of the Pakistan Peoples Party and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam and discussed the political situation. While all the parties kept their cards close to chest about the composition of the new cabinet, sources said PPP leader Naveed Qamar was the strongest candidate for the slot of National Assembly speaker, PML-N leaders Marriyum Aurangzeb and Rana Sanaullah could get the portfolios of information and interior ministries, respectively.
Nomination papers accepted
Earlier in the day, the PML-N and PTI came face to face once again when Mr Sharif and Mr Qureshi reached the Parliament House in separate groups comprising senior leaders of the two parties and submitted their nomination papers to the National Assembly secretary.
On the occasion, Mr Qureshi and Babar Awan became involved in an altercation with PML-N leaders Zahid Hamid and Atta Tarar.

The senior PTI leaders submitted objections against Mr Sharif stating that the latter was contesting election on the day of his expected indictment in a money laundering case. They were of the opinion that he did not deserve to be the new PM due to his “involvement” in corruption cases.
Responding to these allegations, Mr Tarar said since Mr Sharif had not been convicted in any case, his nomination could not be rejected merely on the basis of allegations. Mr Hamid reminded the PTI leaders that nomination could be rejected only on the grounds mentioned in the Constitution and Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly-2007 under which the candidate for the office of PM must be a Muslim, an MNA and signature of the candidate and his proposer and seconder must be genuine.
On this, the NA secretary accepted the nomination paper of both Mr Sharif and Mr Qureshi.

The NA Secretariat later issued the agenda of the NA session under which the election of the prime minister will be held at 2pm. “Election of the Prime Minister as required by Article 91 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, read with rule 32 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007,” stated the order of the day.
PTI divided on resignations
Meanwhile, an insider told Dawn that PTI leaders were divided on the issue of registrations as some of them believed all MNAs of the party and allies should resign immediately to bring the upcoming government in a tough situation, while others were of the opinion that the PTI and its allies should take opposition benches to resist any attempt to change elections laws, particularly regarding the use of electronic voting machines and voting rights to overseas Pakistanis, for the next general elections.
However, disgruntled PTI leader Raja Riaz said that 22 dissidents would not resign if the PTI opted for that. It is believed if they voted against Mr Qureshi, they could be disqualified under Article 63 of the Constitution.
A senior PPP leader told Dawn that PTI dissidents were minutely monitoring the situation and consulting legal opinion about whatever decision they would take. He, however, there was difference between abstaining from vote and absent on the day of vote. There were precedents that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had forgiven dissidents MNA who did not attend the voting session in the past, he said, citing the example of PTI’s former MNA Ayesha Gulalai.
Shehbaz meets PPP, JUI-F leaders
In later developments, Mr Sharif called on former president Asif Ali Zardari and chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and discussed the changing political scenario.
The PML-N president then also called on Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and expressed gratitude for extending his support.
During his visit to Zardari House, Mr Sharif thanked ex-president Zardari and the PPP chairman for their efforts to ensure the success of the no-confidence motion. They pledged to work together on all issues of public interest.
Talking to the media, Mr Sharif desired for peace in the region and peaceful relations with neighbouring India.
Asked if the cases of his elder brother and self-exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sahrif would be withdrawn, he said his [Nawaz] cases would be dealt according to the law.
Mr Sharif was accompanied by Saad Rafique, Ayaz Sadiq and Ms Aurangzeb, while PPP leaders Faisal Karim Kundi and Shazia Atta Marri were also present on the occasion.
Earlier, speaking on the floor of the House after the passage of vote of no-confidence against Mr Khan, the PPP chairman said: “Democracy is the best revenge.”
April 10 had its own significance, he said, explaining that on that date, Constitution was formed in 1973, former premier and PPP chairperson Benazir Bhutto had returned in 1987 to challenge Gen Zia’s dictatorship and in 2022 the person who was declared ‘selected’ by the opposition and who proved himself to be an ‘undemocratic burden’ on the country saw the end of his rule under a constitutional process.

1,PTI plans to kick off street protests on 13th,"""We are going to start a nationwide campaign from Wednesday from Peshawar,"" Fawad Chaudhry says.","ISLAMABAD: The PTI has decided to launch a countrywide protest campaign on Wednesday (April 13) against the removal of its government and the formation of the incoming administration, most likely to be headed by PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif.
“We are going to start a nationwide campaign from Wednesday from Peshawar,” PTI leader and former information minister Fawad Chaudhry told Dawn on Sunday.
Meanwhile, former prime minister and PTI chairman Imran Khan thanked people for coming out from across the country to support him and oppose the upcoming government.

 





 
“Thank you to all Pakistanis for their amazing outpouring of support and emotions to protest against US-backed regime change abetted by local Mir Jafars [betrayers] to bring into power a coterie of pliable crooks all out on bail. Shows Pakistanis at home and abroad have emphatically rejected this,” he said in a Twitter posting late on Sunday.

Conflicting statements emerge from party leaders over en masse resignations of MNAs

Mr Chaudhry said the ousted prime minister would address a public meeting in Peshawar on Wednesday.
He said the PTI’s core committee, which met on Sunday with Imran Khan in the chair, had decided that all party MNAs and its allies would resign after the election of the new prime minister on Monday (today).
However, another PTI leader and a former foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said the party had not made a final decision in this regard.
Earlier, while addressing a public rally in the federal capital on Sunday, Mr Chaudhry said public meetings would be held across the country, adding that nation would not accept a “corrupt and imported” government.
He said people had come out on the roads from all parts of the country on Sunday on the call of Imran Khan.
On the occasion, PTI leader Shahbaz Gill said it was a good sign that country’s courts were opened at 12am on Sunday night and questioned why the same could not happen for the people who came out of their homes against the removal of the PTI-led government.
He feared that a plot had been made to assassinate Imran Khan and to launch a “dirty” campaign against him and his family. “Fake videos will be run on social media for character assassination of Imran Khan,” he said.

2,"KP governor to quit, Imran Ismail may follow suit","""I will relinquish as the governor after Shehbaz Sharif be­comes the prime minister,"" Shah Farman says.","PESHAWAR/KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Shah Farman has decided to resign once PML-N leader Shehbaz Sharif is elected as the country’s prime minister, whereas Sindh Governor Imran Ismail is likely to follow suit.
The developments came amid reports that PTI lawmakers would resign en masse from the National Assembly on Monday (today), a day after former prime minister Imran Khan was ousted through a no-confidence resolution.
According to a brief statement issued by KP Governor House, Mr Farman said: “I will relinquish as the governor after Shehbaz Sharif be­comes the prime minister.”
“Being a governor, I will not be able to extend the required protocol to Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister,” Mr Farman said, adding that he would send his resignation to President Dr Arif Alvi.
An official in the governor secretariat told Dawn the KP governor had already started shifting his belongings from Governor House to his home.
Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail is also likely to quit his office, party sources said on Sunday, a move that would create room for the incoming government to adjust one of its allies in Sindh, where the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan entered into an agreement last month to move forward after the fall of Imran Khan’s government.
Imran Ismail “will definitely resign following the decision of the party’s high command”, a PTI lawmaker said when asked about the future of the Sindh governor.
“He will announce his decision soon. Once the decision about the National Assembly is finalised, we hope you will be hearing from the Sindh governor. Future decisions will follow afterwards,” the lawmaker said.
But the question remains: who will be the next governor?
“Things would become clearer once the decisions about a government in the centre are finalised,” a PPP leader said when asked about the possible name for the Sindh governor slot. “It’s not a big issue. It will be sorted out amicably.”

3,Cabinet okayed change in diesel price mechanism before ouster,Premium on HSD import has now been benchmarked on Pakistan State Oil’s average tendered premiums for the previous fortnight.,"ISLAMABAD: Days before its dissolution, the cabinet of former prime minister Imran Khan approved a change in mechanism of high-speed diesel (HSD) prices to replace the fixed negotiated premium of long-term supplier Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC) with a higher market-based weighted average.
The change was approved through circulation by the federal cabinet on the basis of an earlier decision of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) to ensure diesel availability during the harvesting season amid volatile international markets. This allows an increase in premium charged to Pakistani importers by spot traders for an interim period of three months — April-June.
In a communication to the Petroleum Division and Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), the Cabinet Division has conveyed the “ratification” of the ECC decision by the federal cabinet with a directive to report the implementation status of the decision to it.
Record shows the cabinet was informed that the Petroleum Division had after consultations with Ogra in a series of meetings concluded that the KPC premium should be excluded from price computation for the period from April to June 2022.
Accordingly, the premium on HSD import has now been benchmarked on Pakistan State Oil’s average tendered premiums for the previous fortnight.
In case there is no tender by the PSO in a particular fortnight, the premium from previous tender would be used for calculating HSD’s ex-refinery price. However, this arrangement may lead to some benefits for the PSO and local refineries, which would be adjusted by Ogra for recovery through inland freight equalisation mechanism (IFEM). “This mechanism would be reviewed on the recommendation of Ogra on a fortnightly basis,” the Cabinet Division said.
The ECC had in a special single-point meeting on March 25 cleared the mechanism to address a challenging market situation and avoid the shortage of HSD even if it was procured at a higher premium as a part of the additional impact of higher premium would be adjusted within the IFEM by the regulator and the remaining would be picked up by the government. The new mechanism would practically come into force after price review due on April 15.
Prices of all petroleum products, including HSD, have already been frozen for four months by the former prime minister. Under the decision, the HSD price calculation would not be based on the premium being charged by Kuwait Petroleum Company, PSO’s long-term supplier, but on average of the prevailing market-based premium.
Under the existing pricing mechanism for HSD and petrol, the base price is fixed on the basis of 15 days’ average FOB (freight on board) prices of the Arab Gulf market (published in the Platts Oilgram). For this base price, PSO’s last available average import premium and incidental charges (including bank charges for letters of credit, wharfage, port charges, etc) are added to arrive at C&F (cost and freight) prices for finalising the local consumer prices.
The premium (freight and supplier’s margin) is a lump sum cost of the supplier/exporter, which is either negotiated or offered in a tender process. The PSO, being a public sector company, is obligated to procure imports under the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and regulations.
As per the existing arrangements, the PSO imports its petrol requirements entirely through spot tendering, while the bulk of its HSD imports is made from KPC on the basis of a long-term agreement, which is revised or reviewed biannually.
The premium on a long-term basis is less than the tendered premium. Presently, the KPC premium for PSO’s HSD cargoes for January-June is $2.40 per barrel. In case, the KPC is unable to meet PSO’s HSD demand, the additional imports are procured from the spot market. When the PSO procures from both sources (KPC and spot market), the weighted average of KPC and spot premium is used as a benchmark to calculate consumer prices.
However, the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) had informed the government that the HSD premium for the industry had been historically higher than PSO’s, implying that the industry was importing HSD at a relatively higher premium as compared to PSO’s benchmark premium. Due to this, the remaining OMCs are at a disadvantage.
This difference has now risen significantly due to the prevailing geopolitical situation. PSO’s tender for the second fortnight of March opened at $8.45 per barrel, whereas premiums are even higher in the open market. The situation was such that the PSO did not receive any offer in their HSD tender for the first fortnight of April and the subsequent tender came with a $12 per barrel.
Since the current HSD price was benchmarked on the basis of substantial imports by the PSO from the KPC ($2.4 per barrel), any oil marketing company importing at the PSO-tendered premium ($8.45 per barrel) would incur a loss of up to Rs6.8 per litre, creating an unsustainable position for importers. “Therefore, there is a need for urgent review of the benchmarking process to save the industry from collapse,” the Petroleum Division had pleaded, insisting that OMCs would be unable to import HSD leading to a potential shortage across the country.

4,"PML-N, allies see smooth sailing in Punjab",Assembly to meet on April 16 to elect new chief minister; a candidate needs at least 186 votes to win the race.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and allied parties are convinced that unlike Islamabad, Punjab will not see any legal and procedural impasse that may warrant judicial intervention for electing the new chief minister of the province.
“The elements resisting and delaying the polls for electing the new Punjab chief executive are fairly weakened after abortive moves for manipulating the constitutional process in the National Assembly,” a senior PML-N leader tells Dawn.
Optimistic that the process for electing the new leader of the house in the Punjab Assembly will be held on April 16, if not earlier, he believes that Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, the speaker, will not follow in the footsteps of former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser and ruin his political career by going to the extent of contempt of court.
“Unlike Asad Qaiser, Parvez Elahi does not have such a deep affiliation with Imran Khan.”

Assembly to meet on 16th to elect chief minister

The vote for the CM’s slot was to be held on April 6 as per the assurance the Punjab advocate general had given to the Supreme Court during the hearing of the case regarding delay in the no-confidence motion against the prime minister. The opposition PML-N has moved the Lahore High Court as the Punjab Assembly officials violated the assurance given to the apex court. The case will come up for hearing on Monday (today).
The PML-N official claims that some common friends are trying to reduce distrust between the Sharifs and the Chaudhrys of Gujrat that increased after the latter decided to go with the ruling PTI instead of the opposition in the race for the formation of a new government in Punjab.
“The common friends of Mian Nawaz Sharif and Chaudhry Shujaat have contacted the PML-N supremo in London to find ways for a working relationship between the two political families in the future politics,” he disclosed.
PTI dissident groups led by Jahangir Tareen, Abdul Aleem Khan and Malik Asad held a consultative meeting at a local hotel where MPAs of the alliance are staying, to discuss their strategy for countering the ruling coalition’s plans.
The opposition leadership ignores the government threats of getting the dissident PTI MPAs disqualified from a court of law for violating the party policy.
Syed Hassan Murtaza, parliamentary leader of the PPP, says the Supreme Court has already settled the issue of disqualification by declaring that punishment for a crime can be handed down only after the offence is committed.
He says since the PTI has no parliamentary leader in the Punjab Assembly at present who can send reference against a `defector’ to the speaker as per law, there is no question of action against the defectors.
He says unlike in the National Assembly where PTI defectors were deliberately kept out of the no-confidence process by the opposition to save them from likely defection, all dissidents of the ruling party will be asked to vote for Hamza Shehbaz, the opposition’s nominee for the CM’s office.
In the 371-member provincial assembly, the PTI has 183 MPAs (including 25 dissidents), PML-N 165, PML-Q 10, PPP seven, five independents and one belonging to Rahi-i-Haq Party. One of the candidates, Jugnu Mohsin, has already joined the PML-N.
A candidate needs at least 186 votes to win the race for Punjab chief minister’s office.
