They held demonstration in front of SSGC office and press club and said that they were forced to buy meal from hotels for the past seven days. They registered a complaint at SSGC office but to no avail. SSGC officials supplied gas to hotels and industries which caused gas pressure for residential areas to become low, they said.

The protesters also vowed to resist what they called an “imported” government.
Taking out rallies from different parts of the city, a large number of PTI workers and supporters, including women and children, converged near Millennium Mall where the party leaders addressed the charged crowd and promised that the momentum would continue against the “international conspiracy”.
They also asked Karachiites to be ready for the next call of the protest and vowed that the campaign against the recent political development would be further expanded to other parts of Sindh.
Carrying party flags and chanting slogans, the protesters in cars, motorbikes and other mode of transport reached the venue of the protest, where many of them seen dancing to the tunes of party songs.
Addressing the protesters, PTI-Karachi president Bilal Ghaffar said that Karachiites would not forgive those who “betrayed” and sold out their votes” for their short-term petty gains.
“One can see that Karachi has turned up in solidarity with their leader Imran Khan and they would be out in the street every time he would call,” he said.
PTI leader Khurram Sher Zaman said the entire nation supported the principled approach of Imran Khan. “Traitors of Pakistan leading different political parties are exposed before the nation.”

3,No final resting place left in Karachi as grave crisis deepens,"At least six Karachi graveyards closed, exerting pressure on those still open.","KARACHI: As there is no more land available for burial in most graveyards of the city and a majority of cemeteries are under the control of mafias, the city authorities appear to have ignored the serious situation while two new cemeteries being established on city outskirts will prove to be insufficient for the purpose.  
Sources told Dawn on Sunday that six graveyards out of total 39 under the administrative control of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation had been closed for burial leading to a steep upsurge in burial ground prices across the city.  
The cemeteries which have been closed for burial are Tariq Road Graveyard, Yasinabad Graveyard, Model Colony Graveyard, Azeempura Graveyard, Paposhnagar Graveyard and Colony Gate Graveyard, where no more burial ground is left.  
They said that the repurposing of graves was frequently carried out in the city graveyards, including those which had been closed, as the city death rate was stated to be around 0.33 per cent of the total population per annum.  

At least six Karachi graveyards closed, exerting pressure on those still open

The sources in the KMC said that around 20 to 25 dead were buried in different cemeteries of the city, while over 100 bodies were taken out of the city to other parts of the country daily.  
They said that the number of bodies taken out of city had also declined considerably in recent years mainly due to remarkable increase in transportation charges.

The sources said that around 10,000 graves were needed every year in the city in view of the death rate.  
The sources said that while the city municipal administration had fixed a price of Rs9,000 for a grave, the price of burial ground could go up to Rs200,000, depending on the location of the graveyard and grave as many people wanted to bury their loved ones beside their relatives.  
Karachi cemetery committee convener and director information of KMC Ali Hassan Sajid told Dawn that two new ‘model’ cemeteries were under construction in Surjani Town and along the Link Road on Superhighway, adding that burial would be done free of cost in collaboration with welfare organisations Saylani Welfare Trust and the JDC and no money would be charged from the people.  
He said that the work at the 11-acre model graveyard in Surjani Town had almost been completed with levelling and dressing of the ground and construction of storm-water drain.  
“The model graveyard having capacity of over 20,000 graves will be operational in the next two months,” he added.  
Land mafia 
The KMC media director said that the work on the 22-acre second model graveyard along the Link Road on Superhighway was also in progress.  
However, sources told Dawn that the work on the cemetery was being hindered by a land grabbing mafia.  
Similarly, they said that the land mafia was also active at a 10-acre land KMC had acquired from the board of revenue for establishing a graveyard.  
The sources said that the municipal administration had approached the district administration and area police to get the land of the graveyard vacated from illegal occupants, but to no avail.  
They said that an eight-member central committee comprising Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) officers and representatives of welfare organisations, was set up to improve condition of cemeteries.  
The sources said that the committee had taken several steps under which gravediggers and other staff working in cemeteries would be registered and they would be issued regular identity cards.  
They added that it was also decided that children (people under 18 years of age) and females would not be eligible to perform any work in graveyard.  
However, the sources said that only 50 gravediggers had so far been registered with the KMC.  
They said that the purpose of setting up the central committee was to facilitate burial procedure and improve infrastructure, provision of street lights and tree plantation, prevention of bodies’ theft and issuance of burial certificates. 
The sources, however, said that there was no improvement at the city’s graveyards which were still under the control of different mafias.  
Besides KMC graveyards, there are also over 200 cemeteries managed by different NGOs and communities.

The action against the illegal hydrant was taken by the anti-theft cell of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) with the help of Mochko police.
Officials said that suspects Muhammad Khalid, Israr and Waqar had established an underground water tank to steal water from the main line and were illegally selling it through tankers.
They said that the suspects were also mixing water not fit for human consumption from ponds and puddles with the line water and supplying it to people in different parts of the city.
The KWSB directed the anti-theft cell of the water utility to expand its operation against illegal hydrants and water theft in the city and take strict action against the culprits.

6,Another attempt to oust senior DRAP officer amid chaos in Islamabad,Dr Obaid Ali is currently facing an official inquiry for allegedly availing leaves without obtaining permission.,"KARACHI: Amid administrative chaos in Islamabad, authorities at the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) are attempting for the second time to get rid of a senior officer of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) on trumped-up charges, it emerged on Sunday. 
Dr Obaid Ali, a grade-18 civil servant who is a deputy director of DRAP, is currently facing an official inquiry for availing leaves allegedly without obtaining permission. He had faced a same inquiry and was dismissed from services in January 2020, but later restored by Prime Minister Imran Khan. 
According to an April 2021 notification issued by the NHS ministry, with the approval of the prime minister being the appellate authority, the major penalty of dismissal from service imposed on Dr Ali, former deputy director DRAP, vide ministry’s notification dated Jan 10, 2020, was set aside and he was reinstated with immediate effect. 
However, considering his reinstatement as a threat, certain top officials of the health ministry in alleged connivance with a top bureaucrat sitting until last week at the Prime Minister Office started plotting against him and managed to get the same inquiry reopened in August 2021. 
Calling it a de novo inquiry, the charge sheet issued to Dr Ali states that he had obtained 11 days casual leaves in 2018, but joined the office after 107 days that too without any permission. 
Dr Ali had time and again refuted the allegation with documentary evidence and replied that during the period in question, he was suspended from service and there was no office for him to mark his attendance. 
But, the de novo inquiry moved forward and on Monday (today) he’s been summoned to Islamabad for a hearing before the secretary. 
At a time when there is no government or even the fully fledged prime minister or health minister, the timing of the final notice left a big question mark on the intentions of the bureaucrats running the show. 
It is suspected that the bureaucrats want to take an adverse action before the formation of the new government in a bid to take decisions of their choice in DRAP in his absence and leave him at the mercy of courts and the new government which would obviously take months to decide. 
However, despite attempts, NHS ministry federal secretary Amir Ashraf Khwaja was not available for comments.  
Karachi-based Dr Ali is known to have highlighted several incidences of malpractice and corruption as he had approached the Supreme Court and the prime minister on exorbitant medicine and transfer pricing by pharmaceutical companies in connivance with DRAP officials. 
In February 2018, the NHS ministry had accepted the resignation of his wife, Roohi Bano Obaid, also a deputy director in DRAP, instead of paying any heed towards her frequent highlighting of the alleged corrupt practices prevalent in DRAP.

7,An Iftar where Christians and Muslims break bread together,"In a rare show of interfaith harmony, St Jude’s Church allows Muslim guests to offer prayers on church grounds.","KARACHI: A beautiful example to interfaith harmony was witnessed at St Jude’s Church in Hussain D’Silva Town where a joint Iftar for both Muslims and Christians was held on Saturday. 
The scrumptious Iftar followed by a delicious dinner was attended and enjoyed by members of the Christian community as well as Muslims along with clergy from neighbourhood mosques. Archbishop Benny Travas, the Bishop of Karachi, was the guest of honour on the occasion. 
The joint Iftar was the idea of the parish priest of St Jude’s parish Father Mario Rodrigues. He had been planning it for some time now, but the Covid-19 lockdowns and consequent standard operating procedures were constantly coming in the way of his plans. This year, though, he was happy to see it happen finally. “It is the seventh Muslim fast and the 34th Lent fast for us. And we will both break our fasts together at sunset or Maghrib,” Father Mario told Dawn. 
The popular Iftar delicacies like pakoras, samosas, spring rolls, fruit chaat, milk sherbet, etc., were all homemade as was the dinner. Father Mario could be seen running around between kitchen and the big U-shaped dining table as he was supervising so many things while also welcoming his guests with amazing grace and energy. 

In a rare show of interfaith harmony, St Jude’s Church allows Muslim guests to offer prayers on church grounds

A popular community figure, the little children didn’t take long to find their way to his lap the moment he sat down from a breather and to break his fast. 
Both Muslims and Christians then broke their fast on the call to Maghrib prayer with dates and milk sherbet. It was a rare sight to then see the Muslim guests say their prayers on the church grounds where special arrangements had been made for the purpose. 
Qari Bakhtullah, the imam from a neighbourhood mosque, the Jamia Masjid Al Sattar, led the prayers. 
Later, he told Dawn that he was glad to have accepted the church’s invitation. 
“My Christian brothers respect our religious obligations as we do theirs. Their prophet Jesus Christ is also our Hazrat Isa Alay-hi Salam. Caring for one’s neighbours and respecting their beliefs is also part of good religious practice followed in both our faiths,” he said. 
Father Asher Liaqat of St Jude’s pointed out that their church was located in the Hussain D’Silva Town, home for both Muslims and Christians. “It was due to the strong friendly bonds between Muslims and Christians that this town came about. We hope that this friendship becomes even stronger as more peace spreads in this place in the future,” he said. 
Archbishop Benny Travas, the Bishop of Karachi, said that as they broke their fasts together and broke bread together on the same dining table, it felt like they were all a part of one family. 
“We fast for 40 days during the Lent season, a time that we also spend looking to strengthen our relationship with God Almighty. We pray to Him and we give charity to the poor. You also spend Ramazan Kareem in fasting, praying and distributing zakat. We are so similar in our religious beliefs and obligations,” he pointed out. 
Dr Syed Khurram Mehdi, convener of the South Asia Research Institute for Minorities, and Advocate Nasir Ahmed also spoke on the occasion. 
Later, the church also distributed ration bags among the neighbourhood poor, including both Muslims and Christians.

8,Rs450m project to reconstruct road connecting district Central and East launched,Administrator Wahab promises completion of work before June 30...,"KARACHI: City administrator barrister Murtaza Wahab has said the main artery connecting Central District with East District is being reconstructed at a cost of Rs450 million and the 5.5 kilometer road will be completed before June 30.  
He said this while addressing the ground-breaking ceremony of the road restoration and reconstruction works from Cafe Pyala Gulberg Chowrangi to Rashid Minhas Road UBL Sports Complex on Sunday.  
He said that a change would be brought about in the city by working for betterment of the people.  
The administrator, who is also provincial government’s spokesman and chief minister’s adviser on law, said that three and a half years had passed in chaos, unemployment and inflation, but now everyone had to work together for the development of Pakistan and their city.  

Administrator Wahab promises completion of work before June 30

He said that Shahra-i-Noor Jahan in district Central would be rebuilt at a cost of Rs1.1 billion and on April 21, he would be laying the foundation stone.  
He said that water, sewerage and drainage works would be completed before the construction of the road.  
Barrister Murtaza Wahab said that Iqbal Park would be constructed in Block-14 Federal B Area for which PC-1 had been prepared and funds already allocated and available.  
In response to a question from the media, he said that the people of Karachi would decide whether the last four years were good or these eight months during his tenure as administrator were better.  
The administrator said that 25 parks had been opened in DMC Central after renovation. “No additional resources were used and all this was possible only because of hard work, dedication and attention,” he said adding that the journey of improvement was going on and would continue.  
“For the first time in history, the National Assembly has sent prime minister home using its constitutional powers. Now we expect a fair distribution of electricity, gas and resources from the federal government. I hope the federal government will now take an interest in the affairs of Sindh and the problems will be resolved,” he added.  
He claimed that PTI members did not believe in the Constitution of Pakistan but believed in the constitution of Imran. “That is why, they were not ready for the Constitution of Pakistan to be given priority and the decisions of the Supreme Court are implemented,” he added.  
The administrator said that Mohsin Bhopali underpass in Nazimabad was in very bad condition.  
“There is a water leakage; the drainage system is out of order and the system has not been working for the last 16 years,” he added.

The book deals with the new concepts of housing in Pakistan and the problems that the world faces. 
In his talk, Mr Hasan discussed the difference in the society now, and back when he started working in 1971. He talked about how there were no non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or civil right societies back then, and how the landscape of Karachi had completely changed since then.
While speaking to the audience, he shed light on the condition of politicians and said that the politicians had changed a lot and held the non-existence of school unions partly responsible for that. 
He said that the student unions provided training grounds for leaders and nurtured people, who inspired to be politicians. Sadly, the whole structure has now been changed, he said.
Mr Hasan said: “One of the biggest determinants of how a society performs is how densely populated that society is. Cramped settlements are directly proportional to unhealthy and unhygienic environment.”
Other major issues like leasing of properties, employment, transport, housing loans were discussed. 
He illuminated the fact that many loans were taken for housing schemes, but were not paid back.

10,This week 50 years ago: Urdu as national language will be opposed: G.M. Syed,"THE ethno-linguistic strife in the province of Sindh had begun to assume alarming proportions (thankfully, history...","THE ethno-linguistic strife in the province of Sindh had begun to assume alarming proportions (thankfully, history tells us, it did not become intractable at the time). On April 10, 1972, as reported in this newspaper on April 12, the National Students Federation (NSF) took out a procession from the Quaid-i-Azam mausoleum to condemn the exploitation of innocent people by selfish politicians who had created artificial issues of language — Sindhis and non-Sindhis in the province. The procession, led by NSF president Rashid Hasan Khan, paraded M. A. Jinnah Road and Saddar and terminated at the Dow Medical College, followed by a general body meeting. A number of student leaders addressed the gathering, condemning the two extremist groups led by G M Syed and Nawab Muzaffar Husain (a Mohajir leader). They raised slogans against them and deplored the recent happenings in Sindh, which were to harm Pakistan’s integrity.
But tensions did not simmer down. On April 16, the President of Sindh Muttahida Mahaz, G M Syed said that Urdu was a foreign language and if it’s imposed as the national language of the country, ‘we will oppose and resist’. He was speaking at a convention of the Sindh Adabi Sangat at the Sindh Madressah in Karachi. 
Mr Syed was of the opinion that now Pakistan consisted of four nationalities with their distinct languages and culture; Urdu was not the language of any of these nationalities, a fact that must be recognised. Urdu had no right to become the national language or the language of any province. 
He argued, the imposition of Urdu had cost us East Pakistan and if it was again made the national language of West Pakistan, then the four nationalities might have to decide whether they were prepared to sacrifice their cultures. He claimed Urdu had already divided India and disintegrated Pakistan. 
Mr Syed added that for a strong Pakistan it was necessary that Urdu should not be made the national language otherwise they [his party] would think of the course of action to resist [against it].
From politicians’ statements to the piece of construction where they come to legislate: on April 14 it was reported that the renovation and face-lifting of the Sindh Assembly building was proceeding at a hectic pace and would be completed two days before the assembly’s inaugural session on April 21. Renovation work on the assembly hall was nearly complete after having new curtains, a new carpet, polished furniture and two Chinese automatic transistorised wall clocks. Technicians had also begun undertaking the most important work of replacing the old microphone stands with the improved ones. 
Speaking of buildings, on April 14, a biting sensation ran through the staff of the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) when a deadly black cobra made a sudden appearance on the lush green lawns of the municipal head office. The six-foot long snake was in a furious mood showing its four-inch wide hood — he made everyone run for their lives. The keeper of the KMC reptile house at the zoo, Noor Mohammad, was called in to capture the ‘prize trophy’. He came rushing and captured the snake alive, ending a 45-minute drama witnessed by several hundred people.

The JI Karachi chief, Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman, while addressing party workers in Shah Faisal Colony said that only half of Karachi’s population was counted in the 2017 census held during the tenure of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz.
“The resources are distributed and policies are devised for an area on the basis of its population,” he said. “Karachi deserves more seats in the national and the provincial assemblies, as well as an enhanced share in resources. The delimitation on the basis of a flawed census would be tantamount to sheer injustice to 30 million residents of Karachi.” 
The JI leader while comparing the JI with other parties in the political arena of Karachi said that the JI had been fighting for the rights and cause of Karachi since a long ago, while the parties given mandate by Karachiites did nothing for the megalopolis.  
He maintained that the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf increased the miseries of Karachi and its citizens by paving way to legalise the flawed results of the 2017 census.  
He said that a musical-chair game being played by various forces in the country for the past seven decades called ‘politics’.  
He added that in fact the politics was a holy and sacred obligation.  
He said that unfortunately both the Pakistan Peoples Party and the MQM did nothing to resolve the major problem of acute water crises in the city. “Instead the two parties reduced water for the K-IV project from 650 million gallon to 260 million gallons.  
“In the current situation, the JI is the best choice for Karachi and Karachiites,” added Hafiz Naeem.

A complainant, Bhag-chand Meghwar, stated in his FIR lodged at Old Mirpur police station that ASI Mir Mohammad Burfat and his brother Imtiaz Burfat along with two unidentified men armed with weapons and iron rods attacked him and injured him seriously when he reached his office of Al Hafeez housing scheme near new bus terminal a few days ago.  
Then they ransacked furniture of the office and issued him threats of dire consequences before leaving, he said, adding that area people rushed him to Mirpurkhas Civil Hospital with serious wounds where doctors provide him first aid and referred to LUMHS Hyderabad.  
He alleged that in past ASI Mir Mohammad Burfat had been blackmailing him by forcibly taking his signatures on cheques and stamp papers to prepare fake deed agreements of properties. Police had not so far arrested any accused. 
ASI removed 
Meanwhile, Mirpurkhas range senior superintendent of police (special branch) Ashique Ali Bozdar dismissed the ASI and asked him to report at special branch Karachi range.  
He said in a letter to Sindh’s deputy inspector general of police (special branch) that the ASI Burfat was involved in armed attack on the complainant when he was absent from duties. He had also issued him show-cause notices in this regard, he said.  
His behaviour was not satisfactory in Mirpurkhas as he was also found to be involved in criminal activities, he said, adding that he was therefore relieving him of his charge, he said.  
He requested the DIG to post the ASI at his parent range in district Malir, Karachi.

13,Nearly 50 houses destroyed by fire in two Thar villages,"Affected families lose all their belongings, 15 sheep and goats to blaze...","MITHI: Nearly 50 huts and other structures along with all household articles, grain stocks, cash and other valuables were destroyed in two separate incidents of fire that also killed 15 sheep and goats in Tharparkar district on Sunday. 
In Mataro Sand village near Islamkot town, a fire broke out in one hut and engulfed 27 others forcing men, women and children to run to safety. The swiftly spreading blaze did not give people any chance to save their animals and belongings. Their 15 sheep and goats burnt alive. 
All the affected families belonged to the Sand community.
Allah Dino, Jamal, Daud, Peerano, Saindad and other affected villagers told local reporters that fire brigade officials were promptly informed about the fire but no fire tender was sent to the village. They wondered that a fire station happened to be just five kilometres away, in Islamkot, from the village but neither the district administration nor the coal mining company or its Thar Foundation bothered to send any fire tender to the village while the blaze raged for a couple of hours. 

Affected families lose all their belongings, 15 sheep and goats to blaze

A major portion of the village was devastated by the fire, they said, adding that affected families had lost all their belongings, grain stocks, animals and other valuables, besides houses, to the fire. 
A similar situation was witnessed in Donthar village near Diplo town where 20 houses and other structures belonging to the Bajeer and Meghwar communities were destroyed by a fire.
The affected families narrated the same story to local reporters saying that they made many distress calls to officials of the local administration for help but no fire tenders turned up to extinguish the fire. 
They said their furniture, cash, gold and silver jewelry, grain stocks and other belongings were reduced to ashes and the 20 families rendered homeless. 
Later, Tharparkar DC Mohammad Nawaz Soho issued a statement saying that relief goods were provided to the affected families. He said tents, kitchen kits, food items etc were included in the relief goods. Besides, he added, financial aid to the victims from government had already been recommended.
Regarding the administration’s failure to promptly send fire tenders to the fire-hit villages, the DC said this was done wherever possible. In case of negligence on the part of any official concerned, action was taken, he said, and pointed out that the town officer of Nagarparkar was transferred recently over his apathy in one such incident. He had failed to provide assistance to some fire-hit families, he explained.
The DC said he was in touch with army and Rangers officials stationed at the nearby section of the international border for necessary assistance to be provided to the affected families of Sunday’s fire incidents. Certain NGOs were also engaged for the purpose, he added. 
Only a couple of days back, a fire in Almsar village near Chhachhro town and another fire in Diplo town had destroyed 25 houses and other structures belonging to the Meghwar community. 
The affected families said they put out the fire on their own after hours of struggle as no fire tenders were sent to the villages despite repeated calls made by them to the officials concerned.

Syed’s death anniversary to be observed in Lahore: SUP,Conference on official status for local languages planned in Islamabad...,"HYDERABAD: Sindh United Party (SUP) on Sunday rejected the recent agreement between Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and resolved to launch a ‘public mobilisation campaign’ from April 16. 
The party has also decided to observe the May 14 death anniversary of veteran Sindhi nationalist leader G.M. Syed in Lahore and hold a conference in Islamabad to seek official status for all languages spoken in Pakistan.
Briefing the media about deliberations of the party’s central committee meeting held in Jamshoro on Sunday, SUP president Syed Zain Shah said that the meeting was chaired by party chairman Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah. 

Conference on official status for local languages planned in Islamabad

He said the SUP rejected the agreement signed by the MQM-P with PPP and Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM). This agreement had not only violated fundamental points of the Constitution but would also seek to foment ethnicity and ethnic hate in Sindh, he said, adding that this could be a conspiracy to create a conflict between different permanently living communities in the province.
Zain Shah said that SUP saw this agreement as ‘anti-Sindh’ because both these parties had hatched conspiracies against geography of Sindh and this was rejected by all Sindhi nationalist entities. 
He said that SUP’s Sindh Action Committee (SAC) would be meeting soon to formulate a strategy against this agreement and to protect rights of Sindh.
He said his party would hold an Iftar party where preparations for the upcoming local government and general elections would be discussed. 
He announced that the death anniversary of Saen G.M. Syed on 14th May would this time be observed in Lahore. A conference would be held in Islamabad to seek official status for all languages spoken in Pakistan, he added.
Mr Shah said that the ongoing developments concerning change of government at the Centre was not a political crisis but, in fact, “a crisis of state”. He said that it was a tussle between the PTI and its opponent parties for the sake of powers, and not for democracy and principles.
He regretted that any party which got powers finally took on state institutions after a certain period with the result that neither democracy would get stronger nor would parliament become supreme. 
The SUP president said that his party believed that in order to bring an end to this ‘crisis of state’, a new social contract should be signed on the basis of the 1940 Resolution.
He said his party’s central committee meeting condemned disappearance of its Jamshoro president, Javed Shoro, and arrest of JSQM chairman Aslam Khairpuri. Roshan Ali Buriro, Jagdesh Ahuja, Khawaja Naveed, Ameer Azad Panhwar, Ameer Ali Thebo and others were present at the media briefing.
