LONDON: Supporters of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf faced off outside the residence of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif in London on Sunday, as one group celebrated and the other protested the ouster of PTI chairman Imran Khan from the premiership.
A heavy police contingent stood in a chain between the two groups as they chanted slogans against each other’s leaders.

 





 
The morning started with a few PML-N supporters gathering outside Mr Sharif’s Avenfield House residence to celebrate. Two men were hired to play the dhol (drum), while party supporters broke into a dance and chanted slogans in favour of Nawaz Sharif.
“Chant your slogans loudly so Mian Sb can hear you inside!” said one supporter to the others, as they yelled “sher sher” (tiger). Mr Sharif’s bodyguards stood outside the main entrance of the apartment block. Members of the family were not seen at the gathering.
A stone’s throw away in the green expanses of Hyde Park, hundreds of PTI supporters demonstrated against Mr Khan’s ouster.
Imran Khan’s UK spokesperson Sahibzada Jahangir had in a video message called on the party’s supporters to gather at the park and then march to the US embassy to register their protest against alleged “foreign interference by America in Pakistan”.
A message circulating in PTI Whatsapp groups said the purpose of the demonstration was to raise their voice against “regime change” and the Supreme Court’s decision; and to demand free and fair elections through electronic voting as well as the right of overseas Pakistanis to vote.
At the PTI protest, both speakers and members of the crowd condemned the alleged US role in Imran Khan’s removal, with many saying they believed the letter and conspiracy Mr Khan spoke of was a reality. Several of Mr Khan’s supporters were also critical of the military establishment, and blamed it for his exit.
Emotions ran high and some supporters were teary-eyed as they spoke about their anger over his ouster.
“This new imported government is unacceptable,” chanted Mr Khan’s supporters.
“The sense of pride that we feel as Pakistanis has been instilled in us by Imran Khan alone.”
Some chanted: “No Imran, no remittances.”
The sizeable crowd was made up of PTI supporters from all over London, with many families turning up on the sunny day along with their children. Many wore shirts emblazoned with a photo of Mr Khan, and carried posters in which they condemned the heads of the Pakistan Democratic Move­ment’s component parties.
Although the plan for the PTI crowd was to march to the US embassy at 2pm, hundreds of people instead turned towards Park Lane and decided to take their protest to Avenfield House. Police raced ahead of the PTI demonstrators to create a divide between PML-N workers who were already outside Mr Sharif’s residence.
As the two groups confronted each other, both sides chanted slogans in praise of their leader and denounced the other.
Slogans raised by PTI supporters included “boot polish, boot polish” as well as anti-US chants, while PML-N workers did the bhangra to the drum beats and clapped.
Sahibzada Jahangir, the PTI spokesperson, said Imran Khan’s supporters were ready to give the “last drop of their blood” for him. “Khan will bounce back from the setback.”

1,"PTI supporters in US hope for Imran’s return, with more powers","""The court is wrong and the forces that backed the move against Khan are wrong too,"" says one shop owner.","WASHINGTON: “Imran will return, with more powers,” chanted a small group of PTI supporters as they gathered outside the Brookfield Plaza in Northern Virginia to protest former prime minister Imran Khan’s exit.
“Unacceptable, unacceptable,” they chanted when one of the journalists covering the event asked: “What’s unacceptable?” “This about-turn, return to the old Pakistan of corruption and nepotism,” one of them responded.
This was a spontaneous protest of PTI supporters who came with party flags to protest but still did not know what to say and how to say it. There were no posters, no banners, no placards. Just anger and frustration.
“The court is wrong and the forces that backed the move against Khan are wrong too,” said Khalid Tanveer, a shop owner and one of the first in the area to join PTI.
Johnny Bashir, PTI’s local head, said he had no doubt “Imran will return, with new vigor and a new team. A team which will not include turncoats and cowards.”
Read: The promise of Imran Khan
Rana Saadat, another PTI officer-bearer, declared: “Pakistani-Americans are solidly behind Imran Khan. We will march with him to another convincing win.”
There’s some truth to his claim. Imran Khan is popular among Pakistani-Americans. His first rally in Washington DC drew a huge crowd, larger than any before.
And they always come forward when PTI asks for donations, for a charity or for the party itself. So, their favourite leader’s unceremonious exit is extremely upsetting for them.
But they are also careful while talking about Imran Khan’s claim of a “foreign conspiracy” behind the move to unseat him. They do not want to blame America.
“We are Pakistanis, and we are Americans too,” said Imran Butt, another PTI office-bearer. “We love both. So, we cannot condemn either.”
“No, do not blame America,” said Tanveer. “The conspirators are sitting in Pakistan. The traitors are in Pakistan.”
“This country has given us stability and respect. We love America,” said Imran Shahid, another shop owner and Imran’s supporter.
One obvious change in their attitude was in how they address Imran. When he was the prime minister, he was “Khan Saheb.” Now, they are back to “Imran,” as they called him with affection before the elevation.
One supporter urged “whistle-blowers in Pakistan to come forward and tell us how it happened. We will go after those who committed this treachery.”
Bashir, the local PTI head, claimed “widespread protests in Pakistan would force the new government to hold elections in seven months. And then we shall return with a two-thirds majority in Parliament.”

2,"PTI blogger’s house raided; phones, laptop taken away",Shahbaz Gill says he alerted Dr Arslan Khalid to relocate before the raid took place.,"LAHORE: Some plain-clothes men raided the house of the focal person on digital media of former prime minister Imran Khan, Dr Arslan Khalid, and took away a laptop and some mobile phones in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Dr Khalid had already left his Wapda Town house in view of the expected raid, an official source said, adding that the action by personnel of a law enforcement agency was taken on the allegation that he had been running a social media campaign against a state institution.
However, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s official Twitter handle strongly rejected the allegation and stated that Dr Khalid had never abused anyone on social media and never attacked any institutions. Declaring it “disturbing news’, the PTI tweeted that Dr Khalid’s house had been raided and all phones from his family had been taken away.

 





 
The family members of the PTI blogger were unaware about the identity of those behind the raid probably for his arrest.

Gill says he alerted Dr Khalid to relocate before raid

The Lahore police high-ups and the Federal Investigation Agency made it clear they had nothing to do with the ‘raid’, explaining the matter didn’t fall in police domain.
“The raid was not carried out by police on the house of Dr Khalid,” Lahore Capital City Police Officer Fayyaz Ahmad told Dawn.
However, the official source said the men who carried out the raid were in plainclothes. After being unable to find him in the house, they questioned Dr Khalid’s family about his whereabouts, he said.
The incident went viral on the social media when some PTI leaders raised voice declaring the raid sheer violation of human rights.
Former PM’s aide Dr Shahbaz Gill said he had already alerted Dr Khalid about his possible arrest. He tweeted that as the raid was anticipated, Dr Khalid was sent somewhere else. “All I have to tell you is that Arsalan Khalid is a patriot and he has to live in this country. We anticipated that you would do this so last night I spoke to him and sent him somewhere else from his house. The laptops and mobiles you have taken have nothing else, but professional work,” Dr Gill claimed.

 





 
The raid drew reaction from PTI leaders including Asad Umar, Shafqat Mehmood and Dr Shireen Mazari. 
“Raid on Dr Arslan Khalid’s house is highly condemnable. The patriotic youth like Dr Arslan are an asset for the nation,” tweeted ex-minister Asad Umar.

 





 
Mr Mehmood tweeted: “Distressed to learn that Dr Arsalan’s house was raided and his family harassed”.

 





 
Dr Mazari, however, said the raid was not surprising, “because ‘deep-seated’ intolerance for criticism leads to irrational rage. But criticism on social media is often spontaneous unlike coups”.

3,PPP wants Article 6 invoked against violators of Constitution,Kundi says by-polls to be held in case PTI lawmakers resigned; Marri insists Imran has to answer for wrongdoings.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader and former National Assembly deputy speaker Faisal Karim Kundi on Sunday called upon the relevant authorities to invoke Article 6 against those who violated the Constitution in the recent political crisis.
“Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser recorded a black chapter in the history of the country by violating the Constitution on the directives of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan,” Mr Kundi said while speaking at a press conference.
The party’s information secretary, Shazia Atta Marri, was also present.
Mr Kundi said if the PTI parliamentarians wanted to resign from the parliament, they should go ahead and “we would hold by-elections”.

Kundi says by-polls to be held in case PTI lawmakers resigned; Marri insists Imran has to answer for wrongdoings

The PPP leader said it was strange that the entire team of former prime minister Imran Khan was in the parliament but he did not turn up because he did not want to face the opposition members.
The former deputy speaker said he (Imran) claimed that he was a sportsman but ran away from the political arena, adding that with the power of people, the united opposition threw Mr Khan out of the Prime Minister’s House in a constitutional way.
Mr Kundi also lashed out at former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and said he made a long speech just to be in the good books of Imran Khan.
He claimed that till late night, “Imran was begging for an NRO but the opposition was not ready to give him any relief for his wrongdoings”.
“We are ready to talk to the opposition (PTI) in the parliament but will never forgive Imran’s wrong policies which forced poverty-stricken people to form long queues to get their rights,” he added.
Speaking on the occasion, PPP Information Secretary Shazia Marri said: “We congratulate the Pakistani nation because today we have not only gotten rid of an incompetent and insensitive government, but also the selected one.”
She said citizens wanted relief as they were fed up with inflation and unemployment.
“PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had been struggling for two years to send the selected person home in a constitutional manner and today he has succeeded,” she said, adding that, “the PTI did many dramas to cling on to power and when the no-confidence motion was moved to remove the ‘selected people’ in a constitutional manner, they violated the Constitution”.
She said the PPP had made sacrifices for the supremacy of the Constitution and law and always spoke about their protection whereas Mr Khan was inciting people and trying to sell false statements.
“He (Imran) first has to answer about the wrongdoings he committed during the past three-and-a-half years; now he was trying to provoke people but we have foiled his nefarious designs to divide the nation,” the PPP information secretary said.
“It is strange that a former prime minister of Pakistan was praising Indians and the Modi government when innocent Kashmiris were suffering,” she said, adding that Narendra Modi’s hands were stained with the blood of Kashmiris.

4,GB’s CM likely to face no-trust motion,Opposition leader in Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly claims support of some PTI lawmakers.,"GILGIT: The opposition leader in the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly, Advocate Amjad Hussain, announced on Sunday that a no-confidence motion against GB Chief Minister Khalid Khurshid will soon be moved in the assembly.
Mr Hussain, who is the president of the Pakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) GB chapter, was speaking to his party workers.
He said it has been principally decided to submit a no-confidence motion against the GB chief minister.
He said the PPP will form a committee to discuss and finalise the motion with the leaders of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) in GB. He said the PDM’s central leadership will decide an action plan shortly.

Opposition leader in Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly claims support of some PTI lawmakers

Replying to a question, he said the opposition parties have 10 members in the 33-member GB Assembly. But, he added, some members from the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and its allied party Majlis Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM) have contacts with the opposition parties and showed their willingness to support the move.
The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam’s (JUI-F) member in the GB Assembly, Haji Rehmat Khaliq, said that the GB chief minister has failed in performing his duties during the last one and half years’ tenure of the government.
He said parties included in the PDM have agreed on the plan to oust the GB chief minister. He claimed that some members from the ruling PTI will also support the PDM in this regard.
The PTI has 20 members in the assembly, MWM three, PPP four, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz three and JUI-F, Balawaristan National Front-Naji Group and Islami Tehreek Pakistan have one member each.

Police said Shahzad, Abdul Majeed, Barkat Ali and Khalid were on their way home by car when armed men lying in wait opened fire on them near the Murad Shakh area.
“All the four died on the spot,” a senior police officer said, adding that police rushed to the scene of crime after receiving information and shifted bodies to the district hospital Dera Murad Jamali.
The bodies were handed over to the grieving families after medico-legal formalities.
The cause of attack seemed to be old enmity, police said.
“We are investigating the incident and conducting raids for the arrest of the suspects,” police said.

6,BAP leader urges respect for differing views,Senator Saeed Ahmed Hashmi urges political leaders to stop levelling serious allegations against each other.,"QUETTA: Senator Saeed Ahmed Hashmi, founder of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), said on Sunday that differences among political parties should not be allowed to cause damage to the unity of the nation.
Speaking to party workers at a meeting, he urged the political leaders to stop levelling serious allegations against each other and respect each other’s point of view.
Mr Hashmi said history has witnessed that not respecting political views of opponents had caused damage to the country, such as the fall of Dhaka in 1971.
He rejected the behaviour of the Baloch separatist parties, saying their issues can only be resolved through a political struggle. For the political and economic stability of the country all political parties would have to respect each other’s views.

7,BBC story about removal of key officer ‘pack of lies’: ISPR,RAWALPINDI: The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Sunday termed the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC...,"RAWALPINDI: The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Sunday termed the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC Urdu) news story — detailing events that reportedly took place at Prime Minister House late on Saturday night — published on its website as a pack of lies and part of an organised disinformation campaign.
The military’s media wing in a news release said, “BBC Urdu story published today is totally baseless and a pack of lies. The typical propaganda story lacks any credible, authentic and relevant source and violates basic journalistic ethos”.
It added: “There is no truth in the fake story whatsoever and clearly seems part of an organised disinformation campaign.”
The ISPR said that the matter was being taken up with BBC authorities.
According to Dawn.com, the story in question supposedly recounts the events leading up to the ouster of Imran Khan as prime minister late on Saturday night.
The BBC story says that Parliament House was abuzz with activity during the day as the National Assembly was in session. However, this activity shifted to the PM House once the session was adjourned for Iftar.
It said that Imran Khan had convened an emergency meeting of his cabinet — summoning his legal and political advisers, the NA speaker and deputy speaker and several bureaucrats — where it was decided that the “threat letter” would be shown to a select few officials.
The BBC story alleged that “two uninvited guests” reached PM House, with an extraordinary security detail, via helicopter and held a 45-minute private meeting with Mr Khan.
The biggest claim in the story said that the meeting was less than pleasant. “Just an hour ago, former prime minister Imran Khan had given orders to remove one of the senior officials present for the meeting,” the story alleged, without mentioning any names.
It went on to say that the sudden arrival of the guests was “unexpected” for the former premier, adding that Imran Khan was instead expecting the arrival of his “newly appointed officials”.
The story alleged that the necessary notifications for the removal and the new appointment were not issued by the ministry concerned. “Even if the removal was carried out on the prime minister’s orders, preparations had been made to declare it null and void,” the BBC report said.
The story also talked about how the doors of the Islamabad High Court were open late at night to take up a petition asking the court to restrain Imran Khan from de-notifying the officer.

8,Daily Covid cases fall below 100 first time in two years,The number of critical patients has dropped to 273 and not a single death has been reported for the last eight days.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan reported fewer than 100 Covid-19 cases on Sunday, the first time in more than two years and at a time when China and some European countries are battling the pandemic once again.
The number of critical patients has also dropped to 273 and not a single death has been reported across the country for the last eight days. The last time Pakistan reported fewer than 100 cases was on April 1, 2020.
Data released by the National Insti­tu­te of Health (NIH) Pakistan showed 96 Covid cases over the past 24 hours and not a single death. The last pandemic-related death was reported on April 2. It was a marked improvement, especially considering the fact that the country witnessed its highest daily Covid cases just a few months ago — 8,183 cases on Jan 27.
The national positivity rate has also shrunk to 0.37 per cent, and so is the number of patients in critical care, which stood at 273 on Sunday compared to around 6,000 in August.
District Health Officer Islamabad Dr Zaeem Zia told Dawn that though a res­ur­gence of Covid cases was under way in different regions, including Chi­na and the European countries, the situation in Pakistan was very much in control.

9,Five ‘terrorists’ killed in Bannu operation,"CTD official says slain terrorists were wanted for attacks on police and security forces, targeted killings.","LAKKI MARWAT: Five suspected terrorists were killed in an intelligence-based operation in the Zindi Falak Sher area of Bannu on Saturday night.
A Counter Terrorism Department official said that CTD commandos assisted by a contingent of police launched the operation on information that a group of terrorists affiliated with a banned outfit had gathered in the Haved area for carrying out subversive activities.
He said that law enforcers reached the area and besieged the hideout of wanted terrorists to arrest them. However, he added, the terrorists opened fire. “The police commandos took positions and returned the attack in the same manner, killing five terrorists,” he said.
The official said that other members of the terrorist group escaped taking the advantage of darkness.
“The policemen are combing the area in search of fleeing terrorists.”
The official identified the deceased as Shah Fahad, Nooruddin, Sabireen, Shermanullah and Mohammad Iqbal, saying Nooruddin belonged to Afghanistan and he was the deputy commander of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan in the area.
He said the slain terrorists were wanted for their involvement in several cases, including attacks on police and security forces, targeted killings and bomb attacks on police stations.
“The cops seized arms and ammunition, an IED fitted to a motorcycle, mobile phones, identity cards and other equipment from the hideouts and shifted the bodies to DHQ hospital,” he said.

10,Literary notes: How to run a country: Chanakya’s treatise in Urdu,IT SEEMS that the art of running a country is stigmatised as something abominable since two most famous works...,"


 
IT SEEMS that the art of running a country is stigmatised as something abominable since two most famous works that teach rulers how to successfully govern a country have often been criticised for moral reasons. 
Machiavelli (1469-1527) is sometimes criticised for his famous work The Prince, and for a reason: he believed that virtue may be ignored for a while in order that an independent, united and strong state can be created.  
He believed it was necessary to crush or imprison “petty tyrants” and “unruly nobles” for the greater good, but a virtuous ruler who would try to tackle the corrupt elements politely was doomed to fail. So the ‘ideal prince’ must inspire awe and be feared, rather than loved.  
But The Prince is not the first work by a political thinker to elaborate ideas on governance, state, politics, military strategies and tactics to win over the general public. Arthashastra, a treatise on politics and governance, written in Sanskrit some 1700 years before Machiavelli lived, too, has been targeted by some. 
Arthashastra is considered one of the oldest such works. The manuscript, discovered in 1905, was written in 3rd century BC on palm-leaves and was translated into English. Later on, other manuscripts were found in Malayalam and Devanagari scripts, too. A couple of more English versions were published and translations in other languages followed.  
Shanul Haq Haqqee (1917-2005) had translated Arthashastra into Urdu some 30 years ago. Now a new edition of its Urdu version has just been published by Readings, Lahore. Titled Arth Shastar in Urdu, it has been recomposed and a new, sleek design has given it a modern look. The previous edition of its Urdu translation had a tedious, 100-page preface by Ismail Zabeeh, which has now been replaced with a crisp, two-page intro.  
Though both its authorship and text have been subject to in-depth researches and debates — and some scholars believe it was written by several authors over the centuries — Arthashastra is generally attributed to Vishnugupta Kautilya Chanakya. Some say that Chanakya was a scholar and also a teacher and adviser to Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of Maurya Empire, but others doubt it and mention other names, too, as author. Some scholars have questioned the lack of any reference to the Maurya rule and Pataliputra, the then capital of Maurya Empire, situated near what is today’s Patna city in Bihar, India.  
Shanul Haq Haqqee has discussed the issue concerning authorship and period in which the book was written. In his intro to his Urdu translation of Arthashstra, Haqqee writes that it was written some time before Chandragupta Maurya ascended the throne. This is why, says Haqqee, Chanakya talks of small states and not a dynasty. Haqqee is of the view that Chanakya was compiling a code for rulers and not writing history. Arthashastra deals with not only politics and economics, but it is a complete code of life as it discusses many important aspects of life, such as, relations with neighbouring states as well as general public, monetary policy, taxes, revenues, war tactics, construction of castles, defence strategy, spying, social issues, festivals, medicinal properties of certain herbs, attires, letter writing, and what not, adds Haqqee. The book draws a complete picture of culture and civilisation that prevailed at the time.  
Though Arthashastra is notorious for some of its chapters discussing certain aspects of policies regarding ruling a country, like how to deal with foes and friends and how to coerce them into submission or how to deceive and frustrate opponents, Haqqee Sahib thinks it would not be fair to judge the book on the basis of such ideas alone.  
He says the book offers much more, such as, author’s insight into the social life and his wise words that dot the pages of the book not only prove his worldly wisdom but his sense of moral issues. As for politics and morality, says Haqqee, the objections raised against the political tactics mentioned in the book, may also apply to our present-day politics that is exactly as much callous and heartless.  
Haqqee’s translation is based on Dr Shamasastry’s English translation. Dr Shamasastry (1868-1944) was the librarian who discovered Arthashastra’s palm-leaves manuscript. But Haqqee had also consulted another English translation and a Hindi translation. Since the original text is very compact and hardly an extra word is used, some English translations sound lacking in meaning and sentences require explanation. Rendering it in Urdu must have been a Herculean task, but Haqqee, being a master translator and lexicographer, has done the job wonderfully well.  
The 419-page book does not mention the price.
