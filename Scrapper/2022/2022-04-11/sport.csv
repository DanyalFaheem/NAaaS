First-half goals from Nicolo Barella and Edin Dzeko in front of around 60,000 fans at a sun-dappled San Siro made sure that the champions built on their morale-boosting win at Juventus last weekend by moving into second place.
Inter are level on 66 points with Napoli, who host Fiorentina on Sunday, but ahead of Luciano Spalletti’s side in the table thanks to their superior head-to-head record.
Milan meanwhile are at Torino in Sunday’s late match with their two main title rivals breathing down their necks and seven rounds of fixtures to be completed in an enthralling race for the Scudetto.
The only worry for Inzaghi was a thigh problem for Stefan de Vrij which forced the Netherlands defender off at half-time on his return from a month out with a calf injury, although the coach said it shouldn’t be anything serious.
Italy’s midfielder Barella gave the hosts a deserved lead in the 22nd minute, nipping in at the back post to poke home a beautifully clipped cross from Ivan Perisic.
Eight minutes later Croatia winger Perisic then laid on Dzeko’s 13th Serie A goal for Inter by flicking Federico Dim­arco’s corner for the Bosnian to tap home from from practically on the goal line.
Goalkeeper Samir Handanovic then made sure that Inter went in at the break two ahead by charging out to stop Giovanni Simeone from scoring his 17th league goal of the season.
From there the home side shut up shop and left the stage for Napoli and Milan to have their say in another eventful weekend.
Four points behind Inter in fourth are Juventus who came back from a goal down to win 2-1 at relegation-threatened Cagliari thanks to Matthijs de Ligt and Dusan Vlahovic.
Dutchman De Ligt levelled the scores on the stroke of half-time in Sardinia after Joao Pedro had given the hosts a shock 10th minute lead and a previous Juve equaliser was ruled out for an odd handball.
Luca Pellegrini’s 23rd minute shot clipped off Adrien Rabiot’s left elbow while the Frenchman’s back was turned and flew past Cagliari goalkeeper Alessio Cragno only for the VAR officials to disallow the goal.
Giorgio Chiellini then had his close-range finish rightly chalked off for offside just after the restart before Vlahovic got the better of the impressive Cragno with 15 minutes remaining.
The Serbia forward toed in his 22nd league goal of the campaign to move top of the Serie A scoring charts.
Juve are now eight points ahead of fifth-placed Roma and in place to take advantage of a any slips from Milan or Napoli.

2,Spinners strike thrice as Bangladesh crumble in chase against South Africa,Keshav Maharaj took two wickets in his first two overs to plunge Bangladesh into deep trouble.,"GQEBERHA: Keshav Maharaj took two wickets in his first two overs to plunge Bangladesh into deep trouble on the third day of the second Test against South Africa at St George’s Park in Gqeberha on Sunday.
Fellow spinner Simon Harmer dismissed Tamim Iqbal with the last ball of the day and Bangladesh, set 413 to win, were 27 for three at the close.
Bangladesh’s poor start was similar to their plight in the first Test in Durban when the two spinners had the tourists reeling at 11 for three at the close on the fourth day. South Africa went on to win by 220 runs.
Mahmudul Hasan, who made a century in the first Test, was out for nought for the second time in the match when he was caught at a short gully by Wiaan Mulder off Maharaj. He was dismissed first ball after facing only two balls in the first innings.
Najmul Hossain inside-edged the first ball he faced from Maharaj for four but went back on his stumps in the left-arm spinner’s next over and was leg before wicket for seven.
The left-handed Tamim got a ball from off-spinner Harmer which spun sharply and bounced to take the shoulder of his bat and provide an easy catch for Mulder at second slip.
Bangladesh were earlier bowled out for 217 in their first innings, with Mushfiqur Rahim top-scoring with 51. Harmer took three wickets in 3.2 overs as the innings folded rapidly. Harmer finished with three for 39 while Maharaj took two for 57.
South Africa batted aggressively in their second innings and declared on 176 for six, scored in one ball less than 40 overs.
Bangladesh left-arm spinner Taijul Islam took three for 67 to finish with match figures of nine for 202.
Sarel Erwee top-scored for South Africa with 41, while Kyle Verreynne made a hard-hit 39 not out off 30 balls.
The declaration came with half an hour’s play remaining in the day although the floodlights were on in overcast conditions. As in Durban, spinners Maharaj and Harmer shared the new ball and both extracted considerable turn from the pitch.
Bangladesh started the day well, with overnight batsmen Mushfiqur Rahim (51) and Yasir Ali (46) making their sixth wicket partnership worth 70. But the innings folded rapidly after Yasir was caught and bowled by Maharaj.
South African captain Dean Elgar decided not to enforce the follow-on. He and Erwee scored at better than five runs an over in an opening stand of 60 before Elgar missed a reverse sweep against Taijul and was bowled for 26.

3,"‘It’s been difficult for me,’ admits Djokovic",The world number one’s only appearance in 2022 was in Dubai in February where he played just three matches.,"MONTE CARLO: Novak Djokovic admitted on Sunday that his absence from tournaments due to his continued and controversial refusal to get vaccinated  “has been difficult, mentally and emotionally” but he is  “moving on”.
The world number one’s only appearance in 2022 was in Dubai in February where he played just three matches.
Having been deported from Melbourne, and missing out on a possible 10th Australian Open, his single-minded Covid-19 stance then also saw him declared persona non-grata at the Indian Wells and Miami Masters.
“I hope I won’t play six matches in six months! The past three to four months have been really difficult for me, mentally and emotionally. 
“But here I am. I’ll leave all that behind and move on,” said Djokovic ahead of the Monte Carlo Masters, the prestigious European clay-court season opener which started Sunday.
“I don’t think it will leave insurmountable traces, far from it. I’ll try to use it as fuel.” 
In Djokovic’s absence from the tour, long-time rival Rafael Nadal clinched the Australian Open for a 21st Grand Slam title, breaking a tie with the Serb and Roger Federer.
He also briefly lost his world number one ranking to Daniil Medvedev although he is now back on top of the pile where he has been for 364 weeks so far in his career.
“I understand that I probably won’t be at my best at the beginning of this week,” added Djokovic.
“I am still testing my engine, so to speak, and building my game, so it will take obviously some time, some matches to really get in the groove and find the competitive play that I really need.” Despite his off-court dramas, Djokovic insisted he is still keen to add to his Grand Slam collection.
His next opportunity comes at the French Open where he is the defending champion.
“I still feel motivated to be on the tour and compete with young guys and try to challenge the best players in the world for the biggest titles,” said the 34-year-old Djokovic, the 2013 and 2015 champion in Monte Carlo.
“I’m very pleased to be here and Monaco has been home for over 10 years. I have been eagerly waiting for the moment when I will be out competing again, so this is the best place where I could possibly start.
“The Roland Garros win last year is still fresh in my memory, so I try to use that as an inspiration to kick-start the clay-court season best possible way.”

4,"Man City retain top spot after Liverpool draw, Brentford stun West Ham",Liverpool’s hopes of a second top-flight crown in 3 years have undoubtedly been dented by their failure to take three points home.,"LONDON: Manchester City preser­ved their one-point lead at the top of the Pre­mier League after a pulsating 2-2 draw against title rivals Liverpool on Sunday.
Pep Guardiola’s side twice led in the blockbuster showdown at the Etihad Stadium thanks to goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus.
Liverpool hit back to equalise on both occasions through Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane, but it was City who finished happier with the result of a high-quality encounter between arguably the world’s two best teams.
With just seven games left, reigning champions City remain in pole position to pip second placed Liverpool to the title.
That would give City a fourth English title in five seasons as they look to win a treble of the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup this term, Liverpool’s hopes of a second top-flight crown in three years have undoubtedly been dented by their failure to take three points home from Manchester.
Jurgen Klopp’s team will need a slip from City during the run-in if their bid for an unprecedented quadruple is to come to fruition.
Since the start of the 2018-19 season, combining the four campaigns, City and Liverpool are separated by just a point and the latest instalment of their title riv­alry is set to go down to the wire again.
On January 15, the title race looked done and dusted as City were 14 points ahead of Liverpool, who had two games in hand.
Liverpool’s 10-match winning run in the league had whittled away at City’s advantage, but the leaders’ ability to end that streak leaves the destiny of the trophy in their hands.
City made a flying start in the fifth minute as De Bruyne skipped past Fabinho on the edge of the area and unloaded a shot that took a wicked deflection off Joel Matip before glancing in off the far post.
City’s joy at De Bruyne’s sixth goal in his last six games was short-lived and Liverpool were level eight minutes later.
Andrew Robertson’s cross reached Trent Alexander-Arnold at the far post and he clipped the ball towards Jota, whose low shot from 10 yards beat Ederson’s weak attempted save.
City regained the lead in the 37th minute as Jesus repayed Guardiola’s faith for selecting him instead of Riyad Mahrez. Cancelo’s superb pass picked out Jesus’s run behind the slow to react Alexander-Arnold and the Brazilian forward guided a fine finish in off the underside of the bar.
Trailing at half-time in a Premier League game for the first time in a year, Liverpool hit back 47 seconds after the interval.
Mohamed Salah’s sublime defence-splitting pass found Mane’s run and the Senegal forward fired a composed strike into the top corner to celebrate his 30th birthday in style.
City thought they had gone ahead when Raheem Sterling converted De Bruyne’s pass, only for VAR to disallow the goal for a tight offside.
Mahrez almost won it for City in the last minute with a free-kick that smacked off the post.
Away from the day’s summit meeting, West Ham’s hopes of finishing in the top four suffered a major blow in a 2-0 defeat at Brentford.
Brentford struck in the 48th minute when Ivan Toney’s flick reached Bryan Mbuemo for a thunderous low finish.
Mbuemo returned the favour with an assist for Toney as the striker headed home in the 64th minute.
David Moyes’ sixth-placed side are now six points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, who have played a game less than their London rivals.
Norwich kept alive their faint hopes of beating the drop with a 2-0 win against fellow strugglers Burnley at Carrow Road.
Pierre Lees-Melou and Teemu Pukki scored for bottom-of-the-table Norwich, who are seven points from safety with seven games remaining.
Third-bottom Burnley are four points adrift of fourth-bottom Everton, with both teams having eight matches to play.
Leicester beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at the King Power Stadium as Ademola Lookman bagged his first goal since February.

5,Scheffler eyes Masters title as Tiger’s epic comeback resumes,Scheffler could also become the first player to win four times in six PGA starts since Australian Jason Day in 2015.,"AUGUSTA: Tiger Woods resumed his incredible return from severe leg injuries with more struggles in Sunday’s final round of the Masters while leader Scottie Scheffler eyed his first major title.
Woods, coming off his worst Masters round of six-over par 78, teed off before thousands of supporters as his amazing efforts stole the spotlight at Augusta National ahead of an expected back-nine battle for the green jacket.
Playing 18 holes on four consecutive days for the first time since a February 2021 auto accident, the 46-year-old medical marvel was on nine-over for the tournament at the turn, 18 strokes off Scheffler’s pace.
Woods sank a tap-in birdie at the par-5 second but made bogeys on three straight holes, missing greens in regulation and par putts from nine to 12 feet at the par-3 fourth, par-4 fifth and par-3 sixth.
After missing an eight-foot birdie putt at the par-5 eighth, Woods closed the front nine with a par to stand at two-over on the round.
Woods was on pace for his worst-ever Masters performance, but the fact he was able to walk the course and play at all was nothing short of astonishing given his situation.
The 15-time major champion arrived at Augusta chasing a record-tying sixth Masters crown 14 months after a car crash that caused him to wonder if his right leg might have to be amputated.
After weeks hospitalised and months unable to walk, Woods rehabilitated his battered body and returned to top-flight competition on the same course where he won his first major title 25 years ago despite his right leg being held together with metal rods, pins, plates and screws.
The buzz around Woods and his remarkable fightback grew after he opened on 71 and was in contention after a 74 on Friday, making his 22nd consecutive Masters cut, one off the all-time record.
But Woods slumped to a 78 Saturday in cold and windy conditions, unable to recapture the putting touch that once dazzled fans worldwide.
The worst 72-hole score for Woods at the Masters was five-over 293 in his 1995 debut as an amateur and again in 2012. His worst finishes were shared 41st in 1995 and 40th in 2012.
More rounds can only help. In 2018, Woods returned from a two-year absence after multiple back surgeries and shared 32nd, then won the Masters the following year.
Meanwhile, world number one Scheffler put himself in position to capture the green jacket and a $2.7 million top prize from a $15 million purse with a breakthrough major triumph.
The 25-year-old American won his first US PGA title at February’s Phoenix Open, added another last month at Bay Hill and overtook Spain’s Jon Rahm for the ranking summit by capturing the WGC Match Play crown two weeks ago.
Scheffler stood on nine-under 207 after 54 holes, three strokes ahead of Australia’s Cameron Smith, last month’s Players Championship winner. Smith was a 2020 Masters runner-up when he became the first player to fire four rounds in the 60s at Augusta National in the same year.
Smith and Scheffler were set to tee off in the final pairings at 2:40pm.in a showdown of the sport’s hottest players on an iconic stage.
South Korea’s Im Sung-jae, the first-day leader and another 2020 Masters runner-up, was third on 212 with Ireland’s Shane Lowry, the 2019 British Open champion, and South African Charl Schwartzel, the 2011 Masters winner, sharing fourth on 214.
Canada’s Corey Conners and American Justin Thomas, the 2017 PGA championship winner, were eight adrift of Scheffler on 215.
To capture the green jacket, Thomas and Conners would need to equal the greatest last-round comeback in Masters history, the eight-stroke fightback by Jack Burke in 1956.
Scheffler could become only the fifth player to win the Masters while sitting atop the world rankings, matching the feats by Welshman Ian Woosnam and Americans Woods, Dustin Johnson and Fred Couples.
Only Woosnam, the 1991 Masters champion, has won a major in his first event at number one as Scheffler is attempting.
Scheffler could also become the first player to win four times in six PGA starts since Australian Jason Day in 2015.

6,Lewandowski’s late penalty saves below-par Bayern,BERLIN: A late Robert Lewandowski penalty spared Bayern Munich after a below-par performance in a 1-0 home win over...,"BERLIN: A late Robert Lewandowski penalty spared Bayern Munich after a below-par performance in a 1-0 home win over Augsburg on Saturday, three days before their crucial Champions League tie against Villarreal.
Bayern struggled at the Allianz Arena until a handball by Augsburg defender Reece Oxford resulted in the penalty which Lewandowski tucked away eight minutes from time.
Bayern host Villarreal on Tuesday in their Champions League quarter-final second leg, having lost the first match 1-0 away last Wednesday.
Lewandowski has netted 32 league goals this season, leaving him poised to be the Bundesliga top-scorer for the fifth consecutive campaign.
In the wake of Wednesday’s first-leg defeat at Villarreal, Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann said he had no more  “tolerance for wobbles and slip-ups”.
Yet until Lewandowski’s spot-kick, this was another disjointed, stuttering performance from Bayern in their tune-up for Tuesday.
Bayern barely created a shot in the first half under pressure from Augsburg who stunned the Bavarian giants when the clubs met last November.
Teenager Jamal Musiala came on at half-time, before wingers Alphonso Dav­ies and Kingsley Coman also came off the bench. The injection of pace paid off as Bayern looked far more dangerous.
Kimmich forced a superb diving save from Augsburg goalkeeper Rafal Gikiewicz with an hour gone.
After the ball clipped Oxford’s hand from a cross, Lewandowski secured the three points.
Elsewhere, Cologne boosted their hopes of European football next season by coming back from behind to grab a 3-2 home win over Mainz.
Goals by Jonathan Burkardt and Karim Onisiwo put Mainz 2-0 up early in the second half before goals from Ellyes Skhiri and Dejan Ljubicic drew Cologne level.
Luca Kilian grabbed a late winner with his first Bundesliga goal.
Wolfsburg ended a run of three defeats with a 4-0 home win over Arminia Bielefeld.
Borussia Moenchengladbach pulled away from the relegation battle and into mid-table with a 2-0 win at bottom side Greuther Fuerth.

7,Leclerc wins Australian GP as Verstappen fails to finish,MELBOURNE: A flawless Charles Lecl­erc led from start to finish to steer his Ferrari to an action-packed win at the...,"MELBOURNE: A flawless Charles Lecl­erc led from start to finish to steer his Ferrari to an action-packed win at the Australian Grand Prix on Sunday with world champion Max Verstappen failing to finish.
The world championship leader from Monaco started from pole, held his position at the first turn and never looked back, scorching round the 58-lap Albert Park circuit to take the chequered flag by a massive 20.5 seconds.
Red Bull’s Sergio Perez was second with George Russell an encouraging third for the struggling Mercedes and his seven-time world champion teammate Lewis Hamilton fourth.
“It’s amazing, the car was incredible today. What a race and what a pace today,” said Leclerc after clocking a fourth career win and second of the season.
“Honestly, what a car today. I did a good job all weekend but it’s not possible without the car. I’m just so happy.”
The Mclarens of Lando Norris and Daniel Riccardo were fifth and sixth.
Alpine’s Esteban Ocon came seventh ahead of Valtteri Bottas in an Alfa Romeo, with Pierre Gasly’s AlphaTauri and Alex Albon’s Williams rounding out the top 10.
But there was disaster for Red Bull’s Verstappen, the winner two weeks ago in Saudi Arabia, who pulled over on lap 39 when second, saying on the team radio:  “I smell some weird fluid.” He jumped out with smoke coming from the engine, grabbing a fire extinguisher to help marshals put out the flames. It was his second retirement in three starts this season.
“These kinds of things, if you want to fight for the title, are unacceptable,” the Dutchman fumed.  “We are so far behind (Ferrari).” In contrast, Russell was delighted with his podium place after Mercedes’ early season struggles with porpoising — bouncing at high speed.
Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz and Aston Martin veteran Sebastian Vettel also failed to finish after spinning out.
Victory consolidated Leclerc’s championship lead after three rounds with the Ferrari ace, who also won the year’s opening grand prix in Bahrain, earning the extra point for the fastest lap to add to 25 for the race victory.
He now sits on 71 points ahead of Russell on 37. Verstappen is sixth with only 25.
Starting on medium tyres, Leclerc got a perfect getaway from his 11th pole in 83 grands prix starts and built a gap of 0.6 seconds on Verstappen after the opening lap.
Hamilton, who started fifth, was a big mover off the grid, powering into third at the first turn ahead of Perez and Norris.
But Sainz had a horror day. After starting ninth, he lost traction on lap two, and was lucky not to take out any rivals as he slid across the track and got stuck in the gravel forcing the first safety car.
After the restart, Leclerc and Verstappen increased their advantage over Hamilton before Perez grabbed third place back from the Briton on lap nine.
Leclerc stormed away to a 3.3-second lead over Verstappen by lap 12, lapping half a second faster than the Dutchman, who pitted on lap 19 and switched to hard tyres.
Leclerc waited until lap 22 for his tyre change, retaining the lead when he blasted back out 6.9 seconds in front of Verstappen.
The safety car was needed again on lap 24 when Vettel spun and crashed into a wall, leaving debris on the track to cap a horror weekend for the four-time world champion.
It enabled Russell to dive into the pits and emerge on fresh rubber ahead of Perez and Hamilton, who had already had their tyre stops.
Perez reeled in Russell to regain third place and inherited second when his teammate Verstappen’s race ended prematurely.

Thunder Star overcame frontrunner and challenger Blazing Arrow in home stretch to win day’s honours with rider Adnan Khan in the saddle.
Bay mare Princess Maria occupied third place beaten by five lengths while mare Spirit completed the frame finishing another two lengths away among six starters.
The victorious horse belonged to the stables of Ather Abbas and was partnered by trainer Nazir.
Chestnut mare Jugni made amends while lowering the colours of favourite Regardless to win the fifth and supporting race. Jugni, who finished second in her last outing, was home by three lengths.
Debutant King’s Ransom and Choice of the Day had to be content with third and fourth place respectively.
A pair of horses — Azeem Choice and Eng­lish Doll — were scr­atched before coming under starting order leaving eight horses in fray.
At the outset, two favourites and as many second favourites dominated the first four races of card.
Favourite mares Gol­den Arrow and Smart Girl obliged all and sundry by winning the third and fourth races respectively.

Mbappe added an assist and won a penalty in this game as he moved to the top of the Ligue 1 goalscoring charts with 20 goals this season.
Mauricio Pochettino’s men are now 15 points clear of second-placed Rennes and appear certain to regain the title with only seven games remaining.
Clermont remain in 17th spot, just one point ahead of Saint-Etienne who occupy the relegation play-off place.
PSG took the lead in the sixth minute as Mbappe caused havoc in the home defence with a driving run off the left wing.
The ball eventually found its way to Messi, whose clever pass found Neymar and the Brazilian drilled the ball into the far corner.
The champions-elect doubled their advantage inside 20 minutes as Messi collected his 12th league assist of the season.
The seven-time Ballon d’Or winner volleyed the ball through for Mbappe, who prodded it past onrushing goalkeeper Arthur Desmas.
But Clermont gave themselves hope of an unlikely comeback shortly before half-time as Jodel Dossou bundled in at the back post to finish off a fine team move.
The game was ended as a contest with 20 minutes to play, as Mbappe was brought down in the box by Akim Zedadka following a quick counter-attack and Neymar sent Desmas the wrong way from the spot.
Mbappe grabbed his second goal just a few minutes later, racing onto Neymar’s brilliant pass to round Desmas and tap in.
PSG’s fearsome front three combined for the fifth goal, as Neymar’s back-flick found Messi, who played in Mbappe to curl a magnificent strike into the far corner.
The away side made it four goals in the space of 12 minutes with seven minutes remaining, as Neymar completed his first hat-trick since December 2020.
He was indebted again to Mbappe, who ran clean through but unselfishly squared to give his teammate the easiest of finishes.
Earlier on Saturday, Rennes moved above Marseille into second place as a 3-2 victory at Reims boosted their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.
Benjamin Bourigeaud netted twice in four first-half minutes to give Rennes a two-goal half-time lead.
Martin Terrier made it 3-0 before the hour mark.
Rennes held on despite a late Reims rally with goals from Maxime Busi and Jens-Lys Cajuste, who netted a penalty just three minutes after his team-mate Moussa Doumbia had missed one.

MADRID: Real Madrid moved a step closer to the  La Liga title after easing past city rivals Getafe 2-0 on Saturday thanks  to goals from Casemiro and Lucas Vazquez and restore their advantage to 12 points at the top of La Liga.
Casemiro’s header and a smart finish by Vazquez sealed a comfortable victory for Madrid, who can turn their attention back to finishing the job against Chelsea and rea­ching the Champions League semi-finals.
In the night’s other match Spanish  champions Atletico Madrid suffered a shock 1-0 loss at lowly Mallorca  to end their six-game winning streak. 
Karim Benzema, the hat-trick hero of Real Madrid’s 3-1 win over Chelsea, started against Getafe but came off in the 74th minute, departing to a standing ovation which felt like the Santiago Bernabeu crowd paying tribute to his performance at Stamford Bridge.
Madrid had gone 20 home games in between without the Welshman, who was whistled by a section of disgruntled supporters.
Benzema had an early goal ruled out for offside but it did not take long for Madrid to break through Getafe, a sumptuous cross from the outside of Vinicius Junior’s right foot finding Casemiro’s head six yards out.
Vazquez’s second came in the 68th minute, as he flicked the ball down the right-hand channel to Rodrygo and kept running, receiving the pass back from Rodrygo and guiding a finish into the far corner.
Meanwhile, Atletico run-in could be less comfortable after they were dragged back into the fight for the top four following a defeat by relegation battlers Mallorca. 
The loss leaves Diego Simeone’s side just a point in front of Real Betis in the table after Betis had earlier come from behind to beat Cadiz 2-1 thanks to a late penalty from Borja Iglesias.
The decisive moment came in the 68th minute, after Atletico’s Reinildo Mandava kicked through the back of Mallorca’s Pablo Maffeo from behind and just inside the area.
Vedat Muriqi tucked away the penalty and Atletico had no answer, managing just one shot on target after they failed to muster any against City.
Also, the clash between Villarreal and Athletic Club ends in a 1-1 draw.
