0,PTI workers hold massive protests in Lahore on call of Imran,Demonstrations held in other cities across the province.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Saturday continued staging massive protest demonstrations on the second consecutive day at Liberty Roundabout in Gulberg where the party workers chanted slogans against, what they termed, foreign intervention in Pakistani politics.  
A large number of party leaders, workers, including women, took part in the protests, which were called on the appeal of the ousted prime minister and PTI chairman Imran Khan, who lost the no-confidence vote in the National Assembly the other day.  
The protests had covered the whole of the green area of Liberty Roundabout and there were massive rallies of motorcycles and cars on the road from the Kalma Chowk underpass till the Lahore Centre on the Main Boulevard. 
Noor Jehan Road was also blocked, leading to the Liberty Market. Some of the protesters were mounted on the min-truck and leading the sloganeering through the loudspeakers.  

Demonstrations in other Punjab cities as well

The protesters were waving the PTI flags and displaying banners and placards with slogans inscribed on them. Some common slogans included ‘Amreeka ka jo yar hai, ghaddar hai’; ‘Imran Khan qadam barhao – hum tumharay saath hein’, ‘imported government – na-manzoor’ and ‘foreign dictation – na-manzoor’.  
PTI leaders Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed, Murad Raas, Sheikh Imtiaz, Musarrat Jamshed Cheema, Zaheer Abbas Khokhar and others led the protest demonstration.  
The PTI leaders said the turncoats in the party should be named and shamed and added that they would soon be disqualified from courts.  
There were massive protests being held at Lalik Jan Chowk in the Defence Housing Authority and other places of the provincial metropolis when this report was filed. There were reports of big rallies and demonstrations of the PTI against the ouster of the party government in other cities of Punjab, as well. Huge demonstrations were also held at the Rangpura Chowk in Sialkot, Mazdoor Puli in Sahiwal and famous Ghanta Ghar in Faisalabad. The PTI workers had gathered in Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur, Mianwali, Taunsa Sharif and Burewala.  
The call for the protests was given by PTI Chairperson Imran Khan in his last address to the nation as the prime minister a day before the voting of the no-confidence motion against him in the National Assembly. All the protests were going on when this report was filed.

1,Punjab’s domestic consumers continue facing gas supply issues,Low gas pressure forces consumers to use compressors during Iftar and Sehr timings.,"LAHORE: Domestic consumers across Punjab continue facing gas loadshedding, especially during the night hours, despite the weather getting hotter and the fasting month of Ramzan starting from April 3rd.  
The consumers living in different areas of Lahore and other districts complain that the gas supply situation is worsening gradually. The problem is especially acute in the tail-end areas of Lahore where consumers either get no gas or the pressure is extremely low during the day time. The situation is not different in other districts of the province.  
The low pressure is also forcing the consumers to use compressors or other devices during Iftar and Sehr timings to get enough gas to cook food. 
On the other hand, the gas supply to the non-export industry and CNG sector has also been suspended with a stated objective of ensuring supply to the domestic consumers. However, the closure has brought little relief for most of the households, Dawn has learnt. 

Problem persists despite denial of gas to industry, CNG sector

“We have no gas the whole day. And even during Iftar and Sehr timings, we don’t get adequate pressure. This is forcing many consumers to use compressors,” Ishtiaq, a Kasur-based consumer told Dawn. “Though it is a matter of grave concern, the government seems least bothered to resolve the issue,” he deplored. 
According to another consumer who lives in Lahore, the tail-end areas are experiencing extremely low gas pressure or getting no gas at all. “The [gas supply] problem has been persisting since start of winter, and there has been no considerable improvement in the situation to date. We mostly get no gas, except during Sehr and Iftar timings,” a consumer living in a locality near Chuburji complains. 
Ikram, a resident of Johar Town, Lahore, says in night hours (from 10pm to 3am), the gas supply is turned off by the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL). “I had never witnessed such a situation in Johar Town and its adjoining localities in the past. But for the last couple of years, these areas have also started facing gas supply issues,” he says, adding that for the last one month or so, the residents have been facing gas loadshedding during night hours. 
Talking to Dawn, an official source revealed that the entire Lahore had been experiencing gas loadshedding in night hours. “It is not an issue in Johar Town alone, as it is happening almost in all parts of Lahore,” he added. 
According to a Khanewal-based consumer, the situation has worsened in the area recently as there is no gas during the whole day. “We only get supply during Sehr and Iftar timings,” he says. 
A source in the energy ministry’s petroleum division says though the government is trying hard to meet the demand of domestic consumers in Punjab, the situation is not improving despite suspension of supply to the non-export industry and the CNG sector. 
“The indigenous or system gas supply to Punjab is around 900MMCFD. Similarly, the Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) supply is around 800MMCFD. Of the total 1,700MMCFD supply to the province, 500MMCFD and around 350MMCFD gas is being given to the power sector (for the gas-fired plants) and industry, respectively,” the official requesting anonymity explained. 
He says the gas supply to domestic sector (after closure of gas to non-export industry and CNG sector, which use around 125MMCFD) has reached up to 850MMCFD, but the actual demand of this sector has crossed 1,000MMCFD despite the hot weather. “So we are facing a gas shortfall ranging between 150 to 200MMCFD for domestic sector,” he says.  
The official says another reason behind the gas shortfall is the default allegedly on the part of some foreign companies in supplying LNG timely to the Pakistan LNG Limited despite placement of orders. 
“The situation will improve only when the demand of domestic and other sectors is met,” he clarified, adding that the pressure-related issues in Lahore would be resolved in near future as three more supply points were under construction these days.

4,"FIA closes 7,000 cases filed under amended Peca ordinance","Majority of complaints related to defamation, threats received from Twitter and Facebook accounts.","LAHORE: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has closed nearly 7,000 inquiries/actions initiated countrywide under section 20 of the recently promulgated Prevention of Electronic Crimes (Amendment) Act (Peca) Ordinance of 2022.
A majority of these complaints were related to defamation and serious threats the citizens were receiving from the Twitter and Facebook accounts.
The decision came when the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday last declared amendments to Peca through an ordinance promulgated in February this year as “unconstitutional”.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah declared that the offence under section 20 of the Peca 2016 to the extent of the expression “or harms the reputation” and the punishment thereof was unconstitutional, invalid beyond a reasonable doubt.
An official privy to the development told Dawn on Sunday the FIA’s cyber wing had lodged 7,000 cases/inquiries under section 20 of the Peca and closed down all of them to ensure implementation on the court orders.
While sharing some official figures, he said the action was initiated on the 70 percent of the total complaints filed by the women who were harassed on social media by “known and unknown persons”.
A majority of them were female students of the public and private sector universities and other educational institutions.
“Over 60 per cent of the total complaints of women were filed against the people for sexually harassing them using Facebook accounts”, the FIA official said.
Suspects were also running the Facebook accounts in the names of the women complainants misusing their photographs and personal information.
The famous defamation case of singer Meesha Shafi was also one of them, which the FIA had proceeded it under section 20 of Peca.
“The other famous cases against the top journalists of Islamabad, which were lodged against them have already been withdrawn or closed,” he said,  adding that out of the total 7,000 cases/inquiries, 50 percent were lodged against the suspects in Punjab.
The Peca ordinance drew attention when the FIA acted against journalists Asad Toor, Absar Alam, Mohsin Baig, Imran Shafqat, etc.
It was later challenged in the IHC after the opposition parties also raised serious objections, declaring it a glaring example of abuse of power to silence the opponents’ voices against injustice.
“Most of the suspects were from Lahore, followed by Karachi,” the official said, adding that the cyber wing of the FIA has now stopped receiving complaints under section 20 of the Peca.
He said all the officers concerned in the country have been issued instructions officially not to entertain such complaints in future.
“Now we are just receiving a limited number of complaints that were not pertaining to section 20 of Peca,” he said.

6,Tributes to Punjabi poet on the verge of language memory loss,Friends and family of Punjabi poet Irfan Malik gathered at the South Asian Free Media Association office on Saturday...,"


 
Friends and family of Punjabi poet Irfan Malik gathered at the South Asian Free Media Association office on Saturday night to celebrate his poetry and works. 
Malik is suffering from Alzheimer’s that has affected his language and communication skills. Once well-versed in four languages of Punjabi, Urdu, English and Swedish, the poet has been left with only his mother tongue, Punjabi, and has lost the ability to read, write or understand other languages. Having first symptoms of his health condition about 13 years back, Irfan Malik was diagnosed with logopenic aphasia, language impairment, in 2015.  
Speaking at the gathering called, Beyond Words, Punjabi poet and scholar Mushtaq Soofi talked about some distinct features of Irfan Malik’s poetry, calling him one of the few Punjabi poets having urban sensibility.  
“Irfan Malik is purely an urban poet. He doesn’t carry the baggage of rural Punjab. He has got only Lahore (in his blood) because he was born, bred and raised in Lahore without any influences from the rural Punjab. That’s why his poetry, in its imagery and emotions, is poetry of an urban citizen, carrying newness. He writes about images of urban life (of Lahore), its streets, roads and flora and fauna.” 
Mr Soofi pointed out that there had been a recurring issue with Punjabi that in its writers and intellectuals would think of only villages when talking about Punjabi culture.  
“It’s there in the media, in the newspapers. I was in the PTV whenever there used to be any talk or discussion about Punjab or Punjabi, the people would think of rural images like wells, artifacts, pitchers.”  
He pointed out that even the designers (of book covers etc) would also think on this pattern. However, the reality was that Punjab had an over three millennia long urban history, starting from Harappa, he added.  
“There is another side of it which is that the village folks remained connected with their language (Punjabi) and culture for various reasons. On the other hand, in cities, education spread after colonialism, which created a disconnect with the native languages and their negation. The urban population would think in either Urdu or English.”  
He added that there were very few urban Punjabi poets until very recently despite the fact that one of the biggest Punjabi poets Madho Lal Hussain was a Lahori.  
Punjabi poet Raja Sadiqullah read out an essay on Irfan and his poem on him. In his essay, he said “Irfan Malik has a sense of wonder in him, which flows into his poetry. “He has given me surprises on many occasions. First time, when he wrote one-liner or two-liner poems in his book before leaving a page blank. When asked about it, he said poetry needs space.”  
He said that born in Dabbi Bazaar of the walled city of Lahore, Irfan wandered in the narrow streets of the city and grew up there. He said that every poet remains alone despite having all the company around him. Irfan kept his journey into the wonders of the Mall Road and its lights, Sadiqullah said. He talked about the poet’s move to Europe and then the US, saying his nature of wonder took Irfan to other countries, including Sweden, and their open cultures.  
He said that Irfan Malik was not a poet of mere craft as he did not use rhythm and rhyme and was not afraid of adopting new techniques.  
At the end, he recited his poem Alzheimer’s, written about Irfan Malik and his health condition.  
Irfan’s friend Shahid Jamal remembered that time in the 1970s when he, Irfan Malik and a couple of other friends belonging to the left started a literary organisation called Naey Ufaq. Talking about Irfan’s poetry, he said besides his rebelliousness and politics, he had a special regard and love for traditional relationships that many of our friends in the left ignored. Reciting a poem of Irfan written on his father, he said the poem was symbolic of what he felt about his family. “Irfan has written about all his experiences in his poetry, including on those relationships which we consider mere traditional,” he added.  
After the military coup of Gen Ziaul Haq and toppling of the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s government, Irfan Malik joined the underground Communist Party. He got quickly disappointed with it and moved to Sweden with his wife. However, he kept writing Punjabi poetry wherever he went.  
Irfan’s Swedish daughter Arianna spoke about how he met her mother for the first time and was the only Pakistan man in a Swedish town for years. What’s heartbreaking is that the father and the daughter need a translator even to communicate as she does not know Punjabi, the only language Irfan now understands.  
Poet Hasan Mujtaba in a video message from the US, recited a poem by Irfan. Amar Alam also read out her English poem while Amna Buttar recited his poems.  
Irfan’s poetry books include Wich Jagratay Sutti Tangh, Akath, Noon Ghunna, Dooji Aurat and Chhanday Aggay Kaiser.

7,punjab notes: Stories galore – Javed Boota and Shahzad Aslam,Javed Boota’s book of short stories Chaulan di Burki (A mouthful of Rice) has recently been published by Kitab...,"Javed Boota’s book of short stories Chaulan di Burki (A mouthful of Rice) has recently been published by Kitab Trinjan, Lahore.  
Javed Boota is a US-based fiction writer, translator, transliterator, and literary editor. He has translated Hindi writer Yushpal’s remarkable novel Jhuta Sach on the Partition in two volumes into Punjabi. The translation vividly evokes pre- and post-Partition life in Lahore and India. He also rendered Krishna Sobati’s highly readable novella Mitro Marr Jaani into Punjabi. He translated 20 short stories from Hindi. His lauded translation of Chekov’s play Proposal has been part of the syllabus at one of the institutes of higher learning in Lahore. He has transliterated many literary works from Gurmukhi script to Shahmukhi which included selected poetry of Pash, Veena Varma’s book of short stories Mull di Tivein, Rushpal Singh Ojla’s book of poems Shikra and Ravindar Sahra’s poetry titled Kujh Nah Kaho. 
His latest book Chaulan di Burki contains 17 stories dealing with diverse experiences. He mostly builds his stories from the people’s perspective which means exploring life as lived and experienced by ordinary people. This choice imperceptibly forces him to deal with concrete life with all its mundanity. Life, ordinary and extraordinary, can never be a sanitised chunk. Conflicts, paradoxes, miseries, and joys make it what it is. And the element of the unexpected which is always there at social and individual levels makes it unpredictable but worth living. Even the worst sufferings can’t kill zest for living. Individuals and groups live sustained by hope because the act of living itself outweighs all the unhappiness they encounter.  
In the book Ustad Shgird and Chaulan di Burki, Javed’s two stories really stand out. The former deals with an erotic experience of a young individual and the latter with the terrible suffering of an aged individual inflicted by the bloodied division of Punjab in 1947. Both the stories leave a powerful impact on the readers. The end of each story can almost overwhelm you because of its disturbingly emotional charge. A boy provoked by an indiscreet portrait of a woman plunges into a neurotic obsession with the female body. An image of an aged lady in East Punjab who breaks down while hosting a guest from West Punjab due to the volcanic outpouring of an unbearable pain that accompanied the Partition is extremely disturbing.  
Javed is a realist who employs his literary skills to create a traditional narrative with a dose of social consciousness but keeps clear of propaganda. A traditional narrative has its advantages and disadvantages; it can help boost effortless communication, but it can also come down to a statement level. Javed’s forte is his vast experience of day-to-day life of common people and an impressive grasp of the language. His literary idiom is chaste and yet close to natural speech which he can rightly be proud of. It can also be smutty at times. He is nearly as natural as life that can spring many a surprise. His is a highly readable book. It should be on the shelves of all the public and private libraries. 
We also have Shahzad Aslam’s short stories titled Daryavan de Haani published by Sanjh Publications, Lahore. The blurb says that he is associated with the legal profession and “writing stories is fun for him”. One wonders how to take this facetious remark? It becomes especially difficult to take it seriously as one finds different stuff in his book of gravitas. The book has stories, some short and some very short, which fall in the category of flash fiction. Repression, deprivation, class and caste biases, and denial of human dignity are some of the themes we come across in the book. His stories can neatly be divided into two categories; symbolic and traditional. The story Ulti is the best example of the former while Daryavan de Haani is a specimen of the latter. The first story very forcefully exposes the mechanism of repression employed by social structures to control the individual. The absence of freedom, alienation, loss of individuality, and denial of dignity can create an excruciatingly agonising ordeal for the individual who finds no option other than identifying with a slaughtered goat. The goat for him emerges as his doppelganger. The helplessness of a sacrificial goat placed in a human situation breeds existential crisis accompanied by anguish making him an angsty outsider. It’s a good narrative that leaves a deep impact.  
Daryavan de Haani is a traditional narrative that beautifully delineates the lives of our nomads, the wretched of the earth. These ancient rovers have continued to stubbornly exist on the margins. It’s an exploration of a younger generation of nomads struggling to integrate with the urban society that treats them as pariahs. Young nomads’ subsequent failure appears to be a failure of the so-called civilised society and is also its scathingly damning indictment. The material at the author’s disposal had all the ingredients that would have made it a great story but two things mar it. One, the author drops his guard and becomes careless regarding the selective principle. Overwhelmed by his passion, he over-stresses what needs to be said with restraint. He stuffs the narrative with unnecessary details especially sub-stories and anecdotes that aren’t organically linked with the plot or characters. Thus frills dilute the impact. Two, his frequent detailed references to some of the living individuals bring the narrative down at times to the level of reportage. The reality of the fictional world may be impervious to the charms of facts. But still, the story is powerful and highly readable. Another sensitively written story is Lash. It skillfully explores the psychological interior of a young man of a barber family which in our social hierarchy is at the bottom rung. The thought of so-called honour killing becomes his obsession because of his sister’s beauty in a village where a young lot of the influential covet her. The brother imperceptibly develops a nagging doubt about his sister’s character without any credible evidence. His psychological tension rattles him so much that he prepares to kill his sister on mere suspicion. The moment he is about to stab her, the visual of his young beautiful sister in her sleep makes him throw up his arms. Realisation of human beauty coupled with familial feeling enables him to exculpate himself from the guilt of contemplated femicide induced by the ruling cultural values. Shahzad’s book should be a must read. — soofi01@hotmail.com

11,Corruption alleged in toll collection on New Lahore Road,NAROWAL: The contract for toll collection at the Badomalhi Toll Plaza on the New Lahore Road could not be tendered ...,"NAROWAL: The contract for toll collection at the Badomalhi Toll Plaza on the New Lahore Road could not be tendered in the last two years due to alleged involvement in corruption by the Punjab Highways Department employees who collect toll at the plaza.  
The department vehemently denies the charges. 
The department had set up a toll plaza in 2017 on the New Lahore Road, 20km from Narowal, and posted its own employees to collect toll from the motorists. The employees collect toll from vehicles plying between Narowal and other cities, including Lahore and Sheikhupura. 
The department had called tenders for collection of toll to avoid corruption complaints at the toll plaza and contractors were awarded the contract but due to the alleged connivance of the employees of Punjab Highways, they left, leaving it for the highways officers of district Narowal to collect toll.  
According to the sources, toll tax to the tune of Rs40,000 to Rs50,000 is being collected on a daily basis from the plaza while only Rs10,000 to Rs18,000 are deposited with the provincial kitty. The highways department deployed eight workers at Toll Plaza Badomalhi for toll collection.  
The public transport and private vehicles use two roads, New Lahore Road and Muridke Road to reach Lahore from Narowal. Lahore is at a distance of 95km from Narowal through the New Lahore Road and the distance increases to 130km from Muridke Road, the alternative road.  
Citizens Ali Jan and Farid Ahmed said the owners of public transport and private vehicles like to travel on New Lahore Road, adding that 35km the journey on New Lahore Road was reduced and there was also saving of the fuel.  
Punjab Highways Narowal SDO Saba Afzal said there was no traffic on New Lahore Road as the road was single-carriageway while most of the traffic going to Lahore was the two-lane Muridke Road.
