1,Treatment under Sehat Card programme continues: ministry,"Says around 17,000 patients admitted to hospitals across country in last two days.","ISLAMABAD: Amid speculations about the fate of the health card scheme, the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) on Sunday claimed that in the last two days around 17,000 patients were admitted to hospitals across the country and availing free of cost treatment.
In a statement, the ministry stated that Qaumi Sehat Card empanelled hospitals were providing uninterrupted and free of cost medical services/treatments across Pakistan.
“Under the Sehat Sahulat Programme, families are able to get free treatment from empanelled public and private hospitals all across Pakistan. All hospitals empanelled with Sehat Sahulat Programme continue to provide free of cost hospitalisation services to all citizens as per an agreement. There were around 9,000 hospital admissions on Friday and 8,000 on Saturday (April 9) across Pakistan under the programme,” it stated.

Says around 17,000 patients admitted to hospitals across country in last two days

“Any social media messages to the contrary are patently false, malicious and baseless. In case of any problem, please call toll free helpline 080009009 or approach the relevant hospital’s Sehat card counter for prompt assistance,” it stated.
After Imran Khan was voted out through a no-confidence motion, rumours started on social media that the programme was going to be closed. On the other hand, some private hospitals were denying service under the card.
The Qaumi Sehat Card/Sehat Sahulat Programme included open heart surgeries, insertion of stents, management of cancer, neurosurgical procedures, burn management, accident management, dialysis, intensive care management, deliveries, C-section and other medical/surgical procedures up to the limit of Rs1 million per family per year. There is a facility of inter provincial/inter-district portability for availing free-of-cost services from over 600 empanelled hospitals in Pakistan.
Since the start of the health card in 2015, the State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan has been dealing with the scheme and last year it again won the contract of insurance of the health cards for three years (2022 to 25). Currently, 100pc population of Islamabad, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan is entitled to get free treatment.
A representative of the Setline Insurance Company, Raheem Safeer, while talking to Dawn said the insurance company had established Sehat Sahulat card counters in all the empanelled hospitals and in case of any complaint patients should contact the counters to get their issues resolved.

2,Irresponsible tourism spoiling scenic beauty of Margallas,ISLAMABAD: Irresponsible tourism and littering is a constant threat to the mesmerising environment of Margalla Hills...,"ISLAMABAD: Irresponsible tourism and littering is a constant threat to the mesmerising environment of Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP), which is home to numerous species of flora and fauna.
According to an Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) official, the board keeps urging visitors and tourists to take care of nature. 
He said the survival of MHNP’s flora and fauna was at risk due to frequent fires in peak season and 
irresponsible visitors polluting the natural environment with their non-degradable injurious plastic waste.
There are six hiking trails inside the park which is spread over an area of 17,386 hectares, he said, adding 17,000 regular hikers and bird watchers visit these trails every week.
He said regular trekkers had a docile and careful attitude towards nature as they used to venture in the trails with professional purpose. 
However, he added, seasonal visitors with just a recreational motive damage nature with no regard for the health of wild animals.
IWMB staff used to check every visitor prior to entering the trails but some people who were entering from shortcuts or other alternate routes from within, in the national park near Monal and other routes leading to Daman-i-Koh, used to bring food items and leave their trash as it is instead of throwing it in garbage bins, he said, adding the conservation of nature was a shared responsibility and individual role in realising the worth of nature was imperative to achieve the goal of zero waste and a plastic free national park.

4,Teachers seek timely rental payment as per ceiling,ISLAMABAD: College teachers of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) have expressed disappointment over excessive delay...,"ISLAMABAD: College teachers of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) have expressed disappointment over excessive delay in payment of their rental ceiling as well as discrimination in the assessment of the rents of their houses.
According to an official source, the authorities were unable to release payments of rental ceiling to owners of houses, which have been pending for over a year. Moreover in many cases, the assessed rent by the hiring committee of the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) is below the rental ceiling of teachers.
A lecturer at a local college said the public’s money is misused for “fake repair of furniture, vehicles and on different false purchases every year” but there is always no budget to pay rental ceiling to teachers.
House owners are threatening teachers of eviction if rent is not paid timely and the authority concerned should come forward to address the issue of backlog of unpaid rent which accrued during the last one year, he demanded.
Another lecturer, who managed to purchase a house in E-17, said: “I fulfilled the entire requirement for hiring a house. Covered area of my house was even more than the required area but the rent assessment committee of FDE assessed the rent below my ceiling fixed by the government. I was maltreated by the FDE rent assessment committee which fixed my rental ceiling one category below and denied the rightful privilege.”
“On the other hand, my counterparts in other government departments have been receiving the rent of their houses situated in the same sector according to their rental ceiling. This is sheer discrimination with me. I have no access to higher authorities to seek justice and fair play,” he added.
When contacted, president of Federal Government College Teachers Association Dr Rahima Rahman said the payment of rental ceiling is not made smoothly and is delayed by months. As a result of this, she said, teachers pay rent to landlords from their own pockets or by arranging money through loans. Contrary to this, employees working in ministries and other government departments never face any difficulties in connection with this matter, she said, adding they always get payment well in time and according to their rental ceiling and covered area of the house but unfortunately in case of teachers there are different standards.
Some of our teachers are not being paid according to their ceiling and covered area because the rent assessment committee of FDE has contrived its own inspection procedure of approving or disapproving the rental ceiling, she said.
“Teachers have been deprived of their due rights and fair demands but despite their efforts, they are unheard and are facing continued struggle. What performance can the government expect from a teacher who is always a victim of such perils? The new government should take notice of this and adopt a strategy for clearing the rental ceiling on time for the teachers,” she added and urged authorities to pay the rental ceiling immediately to facilitate teachers.

5,IHRA to start monitoring health centres,"Authority working on standards under which health establishments will be examined on regular basis, official says...","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad Healthcare Regulatory Authority (IHRA) has decided to start regular monitoring of health establishments in the federal capital to ensure provision of standard medical services to the citizens.
According to an official of the authority, substandard medical setups will not be allowed to continue working while only quality health establishments will be permitted to function. He said in order to regulate these health establishments, the authority was working on standards and after completing its documentation, the health establishments will be examined on a regular basis.
He said that after observing these standards, licences will be issued to eligible setups while those with poor service delivery system would not be allowed to work.
He said these steps were aimed at ensuring that formal or informal and public or private healthcare services were at par with the international standards.

Authority working on standards under which health establishments will be examined on regular basis, official says

He added: “We have field teams who conduct visits to monitor the standards of health facilities besides completing routine assessments.”
He said the main objective of IHRA was to regulate healthcare services and establishments in the federal capital.
The official warned private laboratories of action in case they did not ensure appropriate treatment methods for the safe disposal of infectious waste. Action will be taken against those laboratories which were not following proper procedures for disposal of waste right from handling, collecting, transporting, discarding and marking till incineration.
“Infectious waste produced in labs and hospitals is a great threat to the public health and the environment and causes nosocomial infections if it is not managed well,” he said.
He said that the authority had also started a crackdown on private Covid-19 testing laboratories for issuing fake test reports with the support of travel agents.
“These laboratories were unlawfully giving wrong PCR test reports of coronavirus as per the desire of the people with the involvement of some travel agents.”
He said that it was also observed that some labs had issued Covid-19 reports without receiving nasal or oral swab samples or even issued negative reports to positive patients to make their travelling easier.
The official said: “We will not allow anyone to run such an illegal business in the medical field. They are playing with the health of people while deceiving health authorities.”
He said that IHRA inspection teams had started surprise visits to all such labs and their collection points. The authority has suspended the services of some laboratories while more were under observation.
“We have started collecting data to take action and seal all such labs with the support of the local administration.”

Following the directions of Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammad Ahsan Younis, a campaign was underway to check violation of traffic laws while various squads headed by Senior Superintendent of Police (Traffic) Mazhar Iqbal were performing duties on main roads of the city so action could be taken against violators. 
Mr Iqbal said efforts were underway to ensure that a disciplinary traffic system in the city was implemented and urged citizens to follow rules.
“ITP personnel have been directed to ensure implementation on traffic rules and regulation irrespective of status and rank and demonstrate patience and politeness while issuing traffic violation tickets to road users. ITP is utilising all available resources to facilitate the general public. 
The force issues traffic violation tickets not as a punitive measure but their purpose is to ensure that roads are safe in the capital,” he said.

7,City managers in a fix over setting up of landfill site,ISLAMABAD: City managers are in a fix over earmarking a new landfill site as the existing temporary site in I-12 is...,"ISLAMABAD: City managers are in a fix over earmarking a new landfill site as the existing temporary site in I-12 is almost full to its capacity.
Recently, in a high-profile meeting headed by the secretary cabinet and attended by secretary interior, secretary climate change, the CDA chairman and several other officers, the issue of the landfill site came under discussion.
The meeting directed the CDA to come up with short and long-term solutions to the issue.
The meeting was held after the Islamabad High Court (IHC) issued a stay order on the CDA’s proposed site in H-16 and directed the civic agency and other stakeholders to submit a report.
On the other hand, CDA continues to receive criticism from residents for questionably reversing its decision of setting up a permanent landfill site after finalising a site in Kuri in 2011.
For over 10 years, Islamabad has been making makeshift arrangements for dumping over 600 tonnes waste at temporary locations.
The civic agency for years has been dumping the waste in the under-developed residential sector of I-12 which is now almost filled. On the other hand, the allottees of the sector have been demanding development work and the CDA recently also called tenders for it.
A few years ago, the civic agency proposed a site in Sangjani, but the environment body after receiving public complaints rejected the site. Later, the CDA proposed a site in institutional sector of H-16, but the IHC issued a stay order.
Subsequently, the civic agency proposed a new site in its nursery at Park Road but received strong criticism as local people said flower germination can’t go side by side with the dumping site. On Park Road, CDA has already launched its own three housing schemes of Park Enclaves and the fourth one exclusively for overseas Pakistanis is also in the pipeline. Therefore, the civic agency has dropped the plan of setting up a landfill site in the area.
Sources said that now the CDA was again focusing on H-16 and may plead before the IHC that for the time being it should be allowed to dump in the institutional sector as the planning wing had already earmarked a site in the sector.
“Honestly speaking, we are in a fix. Wherever we proposed a site, people started raising questions. Where we should go? Now, we have two plans - temporary and permanent. We will set up a temporary site in Islamabad while a permanent landfill site will be developed in Mandra in collaboration with Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA),” said an officer of CDA.
When contacted, CDA’s spokesperson Syed Asif Raza said the civic agency had been working on both temporary and permanent plans.
“The Mandra site, which will be a joint venture with the RDA, once developed will be the permanent solution,” he said.

8,IGP demands report on action taken to arrest proclaimed offenders,RAWALPINDI: Inspector General of Police (IGP) Rao Sardar Ali Khan has sought details about arrest of proclaimed...,"RAWALPINDI: Inspector General of Police (IGP) Rao Sardar Ali Khan has sought details about arrest of proclaimed offenders across the province and action taken against them under section 88 of the Criminal Procedure Code (PPC) (attachment of their properties).
According to law, property of any person, against whom a warrant has been issued by court and he/she has been absconding or has been concealing himself so that such warrant cannot be executed, is attached under the section of the PPC.
Of the 5,483 absconders in Rawalpindi district, the properties of only 185 have been attached so far. The IGP has directed the police to inform his office with the progress/compliance report at the earliest.
According to sources, a letter has been issued to the additional inspector general of police investigation, all regional police officers (RPOs), including RPO Rawalpindi Ashfaq Ahmad Khan, City Police Officer Omer Saeed Malik and the district police officers (DPOs) seeking progress on the attachment of properties of the proclaimed offenders.
Following IGP’s orders, RPO Rawalpindi Ashfaq Ahmed Khan has asked the CPO to expedite legal action for confiscating properties of such persons. The district police officers of Chakwal, Jhelum and Attock have also been issued orders.
A spokesman for the Rawalpindi district police told Dawn that a total of 5,483 absconders were on record in Rawalpindi out of whom 2,870 had been arrested - 2,345 in 2021 and 525 this year.
Similarly, there are 185 absconders against whom legal action under section 88 had been completed. The attachment of their properties has been carried out and the legal process is underway for others.
He also said in criminal cases, police cannot begin an investigation unless the person named in the case has been apprehended. The accused as well as the victim do not benefit from a person’s disappearance.
But in some cases, after committing gruesome and heinous crime, the accused persons managed to hide themselves for long time to defy the operation of law.
In one case, the accused against whom a murder case was registered remained absconded for 12 years and when he was arrested no penal action for absconding was taken against him except attachment of his property. Such persons deserve more punishment on account of defiance of the operation of the law besides the punishment prescribed for the offence committed, said a legal expert.
He said whoever being accused of an offence under this code or under any other law absconds or avoids arrest or evades appearance before any inquiry or trial or court proceeding or conceals himself and obstructs the course of justice and against whom a warrant of arrest has been issued by the court shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or with a fine or both.

9,PTI supporters rally in Islamabad against removal of Imran Khan,Term govt’s ouster a foreign conspiracy.,"ISLAMABAD: Scores of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and supporters brought out a rally on Sunday night to express solidarity with their leader Imran Khan, who according to them, was removed under an international conspiracy.
Prime Minister Imran Khan was voted out through a no-confidence motion in the National Assembly on Saturday.
Hundreds of charged PTI workers, including families, gathered at Zero Point who then joined a rally that headed to F-9 Park.
The participants raised slogans against the US and opposition parties in Pakistan.

Demand holding of early elections, term govt’s ouster a foreign conspiracy

“Imran Khan attempted to give the country an independent foreign policy. He visited Russia against the will of the US. He is the person who tried to make a vibrant Islamic bloc and hosted two back-to-back meetings of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Islamabad. But the US through Pakistani political parties removed him from power,” said Wajidullah Khan, a banker.
Raising slogans in favour of the former prime minister, he claimed that in the next elections people of Pakistan will take revenge against all those involved in the plot to remove Imran Khan by voting him back to power.
Another PTI supporter, Ghulam Rasool, who participated in the rally with his family, said: “We are here to support Imran Khan who was removed through a plot. We demand new elections, which are only solution to pull the country out of the current political tension.”
He requested the Supreme Court to take up the issue of the conspiracy letter to reach the truth. Mr Rasool, while showing a rubber bullet injury on his leg, which he said he received in the PTI sit-in of 2014, said the PTI workers will leave no stone un-turned in the next elections for getting two-third majority.
PTI MNA Raja Khurram Nawaz while addressing the rally at Zero Point said people of Pakistan had rejected the new government which was being set up on the basis of international conspiracy.
Meanwhile, MNA Ali Nawaz Awan told Dawn that the PTI would not accept the new government as ‘tainted’ politicians were all set to take the rein of the country.
He said PML-N leader Shahbaz Sharif, who was allegedly involved in multi-billion corruption scam, was now all set to become the prime minister. “So, we are rejecting this system,” he said. Mr Awan said former federal ministers Asad Umar and Fawad Chaudhry as well as other leaders were to deliver speeches at F-9 Park on Sunday night.

Addressing PTI protesters outside Lal Haveli, he said: “People staged protest in London and Canada against the removal of Imran Khan and it is the duty of the people to come out on streets,” adding that people were even protesting in front of Avenfield apartments.
He called on citizens to come out of their houses and throw out the new government, adding that he was leaving the country for three days for Umrah and after coming back, would lead rallies in Peshawar and Karachi.
He termed the united opposition “an alliance of thieves”.
He said the chief election commissioner came to the court and said elections could not be held in the next seven months. “If we want to save this country, we have to make decisions in the light of day and not in the darkness of night. We will fight peacefully,” he said, adding that elections are the last resort and there could be a miracle before Eid.
He said Imran Khan had been ousted under a foreign conspiracy. “I did not want to contest election, but, I changed my mind not to leave Imran Khan alone,” he added.

11,"‘Dust, tailpipe emissions harming air quality of capital’",ISLAMABAD: Dust being generated due to widening of roads and rise in tailpipe emissions from increased traffic are...,"ISLAMABAD: Dust being generated due to widening of roads and rise in tailpipe emissions from increased traffic are the reason why air quality in the capital is declining.
Ongoing projects such as the under-construction 7th Avenue Interchange, the 10th Avenue, Margalla Road, and work on I.J. Principal Road as well as Rawal Chowk Interchange are causing a steep rise in particulate matter (PM).
“The contribution of the built environment, in both the construction and operational phases, cannot be underestimated,” said a senior official from the Ministry of Climate Change.
Lack of water sprinkling at these sites of ongoing mega projects to stop dust pollution was emerging as one of the top reasons for deteriorating air quality in the city, he said.
According to National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) Deputy Director Dr Mohsina Zubair said one of the major problems the city was facing was the prolonged dry spell.
“Comparatively, the month of March was the warmest this year when temperatures reached nearly 36°C, higher than 20 degrees last year,” she said, the movement of dumper trucks in sectors I-9 and I-10 was also one of the factors that harmed air quality. At the same time, project developers were trying to keep the impact from construction activities to a minimum, she said.
She said that vehicular emissions contributed more than 40 percent to air pollution countrywide. After the pandemic, every activity in the twin cities was in full swing - institutions, universities and schools were still functioning and the traffic load was immense. After establishment of signal free corridors, she said, traffic flow had become continuous.
“There is no decrease in traffic flow even past midnight,” she said adding that air quality had improved somewhat in the last few days.
The last sufficient rain showers were in February, she said. March was so dry that humidity was as low as 24pc. Last year, humidity in March was over 40pc, the official said, adding: “A single spell of rain used to provide relief for at least the next two or three days at the same time settling dust.”
Officials from the climate ministry maintained that currently, major road projects, had been harming the air quality and water sprinkling could really keep dust levels on the minimum. Pak-EPA was monitoring these development schemes to ensure that developers, fulfilled their requirements following standards mentioned in detail in the environment impact assessment reports, to prevent deterioration of environment and human health.

12,No end to water crisis in Pindi’s cantonment areas,"The demand for water tankers has steadily risen even though it costs between Rs1,700 and Rs2,000.","RAWALPINDI: Despite efforts by civic bodies to ensure uninterrupted supply in cantonment areas, consumers are facing an acute shortage of water.
The citizens expressed the fear that the situation will worsen in the summer season as civic bodies of cantonment areas have no effective strategy to cope with the situation. 
The residents are also facing the water crisis due to frequent power outages, drastic fall in groundwater level, insufficient treatment plants and absence of modern technology. The situation is unlikely to improve in coming days unless the government comes up with a comprehensive plan.
The demand for water tankers has steadily risen even though it costs between Rs1,700 and Rs2,000. In some cases, it costs Rs2,200, but the consumers have to go for it.
At present, the Rawalpindi city and cantonment areas with a population of 1.6 million require 84 million gallons of water daily (mgd) including 44mgd for city and 40mgd for cantonment areas.
Naveed Raja, a resident of Misrial Road, said that water was being supplied to the area only one time after two days. He said that they had left with no option but to get water through tankers.
Akhter Subhan, a resident of Afshan Colony, said that they had been facing water shortage for the past three days and nobody was willing to pay any attention to solve the problem.
RCB spokesman Qaiser Mehmood was not available to comment on the issue. However, a senior official requesting not to be named said that it was the issue of demand and supply. He said that the demand increased in the summer but there was less supply from Khanpur Dam.
Chaklala Cantonment Board (CCB) elected member Raja Irfan Imtiaz expressed the hope that the coming PML-N-led federal government would resolve the water issue.
He said the PTI government failed to provide any relief to cantonment areas as the residents voted for the PML-N in the local government elections. The PTI government did not release funds for the installation of new tubewells and improvement of supply from the Khanpur Dam, he added.
