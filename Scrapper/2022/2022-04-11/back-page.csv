0,Imran govt’s exit dampens PML-Q efforts for Punjab CM seat,A restraining order may be sought to stop dissidents from taking part in vote.,"LAHORE: The regime change in Islamabad has made the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid’s task of wooing Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf dissidents and independents for the Punjab chief minister’s election difficult.
It is now planning to file a petition in the Lahore High Court on Monday (today) to seek a restraining order against dissident MPAs, stopping them from voting in violation of party instructions under Article 63A(1) of the Constitution.
“The restraint order can help reduce the joint opposition numbers in the Punjab Assembly for the April 16 election,” hopes a PML-Q leader.
The PML-N on the other hand believes the clause wouldn’t apply to the dissidents since they won’t be voting against a candidate from their own party.

Restraining order may be sought to stop dissidents from taking part in vote

Earlier in the day, Mr Elahi received a call from former prime minister and PTI chairman Imran Khan and discussed in detail the current political situation and other issues.
A PML-Q leader, who is on the team in talks with the dissidents, told Dawn that the party was in contact with all PTI dissidents and was confident enough that it would complete its numbers and not let the PML-N show majority in the CM election.
A PTI leader said those who had defied their party line in the ‘sham’ election of Hamza Shehbaz at a local hotel the other day would be disqualified by the court and their political career would be over.
Former Punjab minister and now Parvez Elahi’s spokesman Fayyazul Hassan Chohan would be approaching the Lahore High Court to seek orders to restrain the dissident MPAs from voting against party line.
In a statement on Sunday, Mr Chohan said the PML-N’s claim of having support of 200 MPAs in the Punjab Assembly was a white lie and an attempt to mislead MPAs. “Parvez Elahi has 189 MPAs on his side,” he claimed.
He said the PTI dissidents would not be counted if they voted against the party.
Condemning ‘horse-trading’ at the Centre and in Punjab, the spokesman said the PML-N had roped in PTI dissidents and was shifting them to hotels. “This is an act of desecrating democracy,” he said.
PTI leader and former health minister Dr Yasmin Rashid said notices had been issued to 24 dissidents and a reference was being prepared against them for submission to the Punjab Assembly speaker and the Election Commission of Pakistan for their disqualification.
Speaking to Dawn, a dissident MPA said it would not be possible to persuade the dissidents to vote for the PML-Q in the changed scenario in Islamabad.
He said the PML-Q had already faced a setback as its plan to change the Punjab chief secretary and inspector general of police could not materialise and the civil bureaucracy was now siding with the PML-N.

1,"Macron leads in first round, to fight runoff against Le Pen on 24th",Not for two decades has a French president won a second term.,"

PARIS: French leader Emmanuel Macron and his strongest challenger Marine Le Pen qualified on Sunday for a presidential election runoff on April 24, pitting a pro-European economic liberal against a far-right nationalist.
With projections putting Macron in first place ahead of Le Pen after Sunday’s first round voting, other major candidates admitted defeat. Except for another far-right candidate, Eric Zemmour, they all urged voters to back the incumbent in the runoff to block the far-right.
Ifop pollsters predicted a tight runoff, with 51 per cent for Macron and 49 per cent Lor Le Pen. In 2017, he won with 66.1 per cent of the votes. Le Pen, who had eaten into the president’s once-commanding 10-point poll lead in recent weeks, said she was the one to protect the weak and unite a nation tired of its elite.
“I intend without waiting to sew back up the tears that a torn-apart France suffers,” she told supporters, who chanted: “We will win!”
The runoff “will be a choice of civilisation,” Le Pen added on stage in Paris.
Macron garnered 28.1-29.5 of votes in the first round while Le Pen won 23.3-24.4 per cent, according to estimates by pollsters Ifop, OpinionWay, Elabe and Ipsos, which are usually reliable.
Conservative candidate Valerie Pecresse warned of “disastrous consequences” if Macron lost, while the Socialists’ Anne Hidalgo urged supporters to vote for him “so that France does not fall into hatred”.
“Not one vote for Le Pen!” added hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, who, according to the estimates, placed third with around 20 per cent of votes. In a sign of potential troubles for the right, Eric Ciotti, from Pecresse’s party, said he would not back Macron.
Zemmour acknowledged disagreements with Le Pen, but said Macron was a worse choice.
Not for two decades has a French president won a second term.
Barely a month ago, Macron was on course to comfortably reverse that, riding high in polls thanks to strong economic growth, a fragmented opposition and his statesman role in trying to avert war in Ukraine on Europe’s eastern flank.
But he paid a price for late entry into the campaign during which he eschewed market walkabouts in provincial France in favour of a single big rally outside Paris. A plan to make people work longer also proved unpopular, enabling Le Pen to narrow the gap. Le Pen, an open admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin until his invasion of Ukraine, had for months toured towns and villages across France.

2,"Sri Lanka nearly out of medicines, warn doctors",Medical association says all hospitals no longer have access to imported medical tools and vital drugs.,"

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s doctors warned on Sunday they were nearly out of life-saving medicines and said the island nation’s economic crisis threatened a worse death toll than the coronavirus pandemic.
Weeks of power blackouts and severe shortages of food, fuel and pharmaceuticals have brought widespread misery to Sri Lanka, which is suffering its worst downturn since independence in 1948.
The Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) said that all hospitals in the country no longer had access to imported medical tools and vital drugs.
Several facilities have already suspended routine surgeries since last month because they were dangerously low on anaesthetics, but the SLMA said that even emergency procedures may not be possible very soon.
“We are made to make very difficult choices. We have to decide who gets treatment and who will not,” the group said on Sunday, after releasing a letter they had sent President Gotabaya Rajapaksa days earlier to warn him of the situation.
“If supplies are not restored within days, the casualties will be far worse than from the pandemic.”
Mounting public anger over the crisis has seen large protests calling for Rajapaksa’s resignation. Thousands of people braved heavy rains to keep up a demonstration outside the leader’s seafront office in the capital Colombo for a second day.
Business leaders joined calls for the president to step down on Saturday and said the island’s chronic fuel shortages had seen their operations haemorrhage cash.
Rajapaksa’s government is seeking an IMF bailout to help extricate Sri Lanka from the crisis, which has seen skyrocketing food prices and the local currency collapse in value by a third in the past month.
Finance ministry officials have said sovereign bond-holders and other creditors may have to take a haircut as Colombo seeks to restructure its debt.
New finance minister Ali Sabry told parliament on Friday that he expects $3 billion from the IMF to support the island’s balance of payments in the next three years.
A critical lack of foreign currency has left Sri Lanka struggling to service its ballooning $51bn foreign debt, with the pandemic torpedoing vital revenue from tourism and remittances.

3,Biden will speak to Modi over Russian imports,The US had made it clear it does not want to see an uptick in Russian energy imports by India.,"WASHINGTON: Presi­dent Joe Biden will virtually meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, the White House said, at a time when the United States has made clear it does not want to see an uptick in Russian energy imports by India.
“President Biden will continue our close consultations on the consequences of Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine and mitigating its destabilising impact on global food supply and commodity markets,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement on Sunday.
Daleep Singh, US Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economics, who visited India recently, said the United States will not set any “red line” for India on its energy imports from Russia but does not want to see a “rapid acceleration” in purchases.
Lured by steep discounts following Western sanctions on Russian entities, India has bought at least 13 million barrels of Russian crude oil since the country invaded Ukraine in late February. That compared with some 16m barrels for the whole of last year, data compiled by Reuters shows.
Biden has previously said that only India among the Quad group of countries was “somewhat shaky” in acting against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The South Asian nation has tried to balance its ties with Russia and the West but unlike other members of the Quad countries — the United States, Japan and Australia — it has not imposed sanctions on Russia.

4,"Israeli forces ‘go on offensive’, launch raids in West Bank",Troops shoot dead Palestinian woman,"JENIN: Israeli forces carried out fresh raids on Sunday in the flashpoint West Bank district of Jenin, a bastion of Palestinian militant groups and the home of gunmen who launched two recent deadly attacks.
Elsewhere in the West Bank, near the southern city of Bethlehem, Israeli troops on Sunday shot dead a Palestinian woman who had approached them and failed to stop after they had fired warning shots, the military said.
The woman — a widowed mother of six in her 40s named by the Palestinian news agency Wafa as Ghada Ibrahim Sabatien — died after suffering massive blood loss from a torn artery, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The militant Islamic Jihad movement condemned her killing in Bethlehem as an “execution in broad daylight”.

Troops shoot dead Palestinian woman

As Israel was laying to rest three recent shooting victims, gun battles rocked the Jenin area for a second day, with 10 people wounded in clashes across the West Bank on Sunday, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
“The State of Israel has gone on the offensive,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said after a cabinet meeting, vowing to “settle accounts with everyone who was linked, either directly or indirectly, to the attacks”.
Israeli troops on Sunday detained 20 Palestinians, a military source said. The operation came after a gunman from Jenin went on a shooting rampage in a Tel Aviv nightlife area on Thursday, killing three Israelis and wounding more than a dozen others — the latest in a spate of bloody attacks in Israel.
Hamas and Islamic Jihad welcomed the Tel Aviv attack, which was condemned by Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.
“This is a difficult day,” Bennett said on Sunday, “the day on which the three people who were murdered in the Tel Aviv terrorist attack are brought to rest.”
The centre of the heightened tensions was the Jenin area where, the Israeli military source told AFP, Palestinian militants shot from passing vehicles at Israeli soldiers, who responded with live fire.
A total of 20 “wanted individuals” suspected of involvement in “terrorist activities” were apprehended, the source said, while the Palestinian Prisoners Club announced 24 arrests across the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Six Day War.
The Israeli military source said forces had located stolen Israeli army ammunition and uniforms in the residence of one of the suspects, and an explosive device in another home.
No Israeli forces were reported injured, while the Palestinian health ministry said at least 10 Palestinians were wounded in clashes in Jenin, as well as in Jericho and Tulkarem.
Tensions have surged during Ramazan, after violence flared during the Muslim holy month last year leading to 11 days of devastating conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip.

5,US ‘imposing new conditions’ in N-talks: Iran,"""The Americans keep talking about the need for direct negotiations, but we have not seen the benefit of direct talks,"" FM says.","TEHRAN: Iran’s foreign minister said on Sunday that Washington is “imposing new conditions” in the negotiations to restore the 2015 nuclear agreement.
“On the issue of lifting sanctions, they [Americans] are interested in proposing and imposing new conditions outside the negotiations,” state news agency IRNA quoted Hossein Amir-Abdollahian as saying.
“In the last two or three weeks, the American side has made excessive demands that contradict some paragraphs of the text,” he added.
Iran has been engaged for a year in negotiations with France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China directly, and the United States indirectly in the Austrian capital to revive the deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
“The Americans keep talking about the need for direct negotiations, but we have not seen the benefit of direct talks with the United States,” Amir-Abdollahian said.
The 2015 agreement gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme to guarantee that Tehran could not develop a nuclear weapon — something it has always denied wanting to do.
But the US unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump and the re-imposition of biting economic sanctions prompted Iran to begin rolling back on its own commitments.
“We seek the lifting of sanctions, but with dignity and with a lasting agreement,” the foreign minister said, adding that “Iran has stood and will stand by its red lines”. The Vienna negotiations aim to return the United States to the nuclear deal, including through the lifting of sanctions on Iran, and to ensure Tehran’s full compliance with its commitments.
They have been paused since March 11 after Russia demanded guarantees that Western sanctions imposed following its February 24 invasion of Ukraine would not damage its trade with Iran.

6,Ukraine preparing for ‘important battles’ against Russian forces,"Pope Francis calls for Easter ceasefire in Ukraine to pave way for peace through ""real negotiation"".","

KRAMATORSK: Ukraine is preparing for “important battles” against Moscow’s forces in the east of the country, officials in Kyiv said, as Pope Francis on Sunday called for an Easter truce to end the war.
Evacuations continued from Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, where a missile strike on Friday killed 52 people at a railway station, while an airport in the central city of Dnipro was completely destroyed in fresh shelling on Sunday.
President Volodymyr Zelensky again condemned atrocities against civilians, and after speaking with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said they agreed “that all perpetrators of war crimes must be identified and punished”.
Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova said the country was examining the alleged culpability of 500 leading Russian officials for thousands of war crimes, including President Vladimir Putin.

Pope Francis calls for an Easter truce to end war

Pope Francis meanwhile called for an Easter ceasefire in Ukraine to pave the way for peace through “real negotiation”. “Let the Easter truce begin. But not to provide more weapons and pick up the combat again — no! — a truce that will lead to peace, through real negotiation,” he told a public mass at Saint Peter’s Square.
The pontiff denounced a war where “defenceless civilians” suffered “heinous massacres and atrocious cruelty”.
But Russia’s Orthodox Patriarch Kirill, a key Putin ally, issued his own appeal against Russia’s “enemies”. “In this difficult period for our fatherland, may the Lord help each of us to unite, including around power,” he said.
“This is how true solidarity will emerge in our people, as well as an ability to push back external and internal enemies, and to build a life with more good, truth and love.”
The appeals came after Zelensky said Kyiv was readying for a Russian onslaught.
“Sadly, in parallel we see the preparations for important battles, some people say decisive ones, in the east,” he said on Saturday at a press conference with visiting Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.
“We are ready to fight and to look in parallel to end this war through diplomacy.”
The UN on Sunday said 4,232 civilian casualties had been recorded in Ukraine to date, with 1,793 killed and 2,439 injured.
Ukraine said Kremlin propaganda had laid the groundwork for the bloody campaign, accusing Russian media of long sowing hatred towards Ukrainians.
Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba cited civilian killings in the town of Bucha outside of Kyiv after bodies were discovered as the Russian army retreated from the area.
“Bucha did not happen in one day,” he said on Twitter on Sunday. “For many years, Russian political elites and propaganda have been inciting hatred, dehumanising Ukrainians, nurturing Russian superiority and laying ground for these atrocities.”
The comments came on the heels of a surprise visit to Kyiv on Saturday by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the latest Western leader to visit the capital in a show of support.
Hailing the country’s response to the Russian invasion, Johnson offered Ukraine armoured vehicles and anti-ship missiles, crucial to halting the Russian naval siege of Black Sea ports, to help ensure that the country will “never be invaded again”.
At least two bodies were found inside a manhole at a petrol station on a motorway outside Kyiv on Sunday, an AFP reporter saw. The bodies appeared to be wearing a mix of civilian and military clothing.
A distraught woman appeared at the manhole and peered inside, before breaking down and clawing the earth. She wailed “my son, my son”.
