0,SITUATIONER: HOW CAN PAKISTAN WIN 5G ‘WAR’ AGAINST INDIA,India has used its local laws to successfully block the flow of information from Pakistan for its social media users.,"WHILE India recently blocked social media accounts of several Pakistani diplomatic missions, it has also successfully evaded pressures from networking platforms against such bans and various state organs in Pakistan have yet to devise a counter strategy, primarily owing to the absence of any rules regulating online platforms.
In the last week of June, India blocked access to 80 Twitter accounts, including those of Pakistan’s diplomatic missions in Iran, Turkey, Egypt, the UN as well as state broadcaster Radio Pakistan, in its territory as part of its campaign to block any online content critical of the Modi government. 
The Foreign Office conveyed its concerns to the Indian charge d’affaires, while the telecom operator also lodged a protest with Twitter.
India used its local laws to gradually and successfully block the flow of information from Pakistan for its social media users, while Islamabad was in no position to counter the neighbouring country’s actions in the absence of relevant rules that could compel or even threaten social media companies to restrict access to Indian official accounts in the country in a tit-for-tat move.
Despite the passage of over 10 days, none of the state institutions concerned have held even a single meeting to plan a way forward; a meeting requested by the Foreign Office and scheduled for July 6 is now likely to be held sometime after Eid holidays. The meeting was lined up with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, while other relevant organizations such as the armed forces’ media wing and the Ministry of IT were not invited.
PTA chairman retired Maj Gen Amir Azeem Bajwa told Dawn that social media companies, especially Twitter, clearly had double standards; they had different rules for Europe, India or even the Middle East.
“Twitter blocking certain Pakistani official and verified accounts in India without due process and identifying any violation of the law is a blatant case of submission to Indian high-handedness,” Gen Bajwa maintained.
At the same time, he expressed his organisation’s limitations, as social media companies complied with the laws of the land they operated in.
Pakistan’s proposed social media rules, titled ‘Removal and Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight and Safeguards) Rules, 2021’, notified by the PTA in October 2021 have been rendered non-functional due to litigation by several entities and individuals in the Islamabad High Court.
Experts have blamed government functionaries for failing to understand the seriousness of the issue.
“The incumbent Indian government is pushing its Hindutva agenda and containing all counter voices from reaching its citizens,” Shahzad Ahmed, the country director of digital rights organisation Bytes for All, said.
“But I blame the government of Pakistan and various departments for failing to act in this regard. As a matter of fact, all the government functionaries are working in silos and not sharing their part of the information with each other.” 
The Foreign Office was also banking on international pressure and the court case filed by Twitter against the Indian government’s orders to take down some content on the platform.
An FO spokesman in a recent briefing had said, “We would also like to appeal to our media, and through our media international organisations that are guardians of free speech and expression to hold the Indian digital dictatorship to account and prevail upon the government of India to reverse its actions.”
On the other hand, a global collective of various social media and IT companies — the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) — also vigorously opposed Pakistan’s proposed social media rules. However, its reaction to similar laws in India was a mere formality — the double standards as pointed out by the PTA chief.

1,80pc of Pakistanis’ wealth comprises residential buildings: WB,"Asset accumulation is slower early in the life cycle and picks up speed between ages 40 and 65, study says.","ISLAMABAD: A new World Bank study says Pakistani households accumulate significant net worth but overwhelmingly in the form of residential buildings, and on average nearly 80 per cent of the wealth accumulated by age 60 to 65 is composed of residential buildings.
The average Pakistani household’s net worth grows by 60 months’ worth of consumption (5 years) between ages 25 and 65. The bulk of this increase is in the form of residential housing, whereas other forms of wealth such as land, durables, business and farm values and financial assets stagnate over the life cycle. Asset accumulation is slower early in the life cycle and picks up speed between ages 40 and 65.
The combined forces of population aging, weakening family and village risk-sharing networks, and low formal pension coverage will make financing elderly consumption a major challenge for the future, says the study, “Life Cycle Savings in a High-Informality Setting — Evidence from Pakistan”, released earlier this week.
The fact that households primarily save in real estate and land signals that this is considered a safe investment, relative to other available options.  Housing may be a way to store resources for the long run in a way that cannot easily be stolen or appropriated by other family members, observes the study.
The study says it could also reflect a lack of access to other safe, high return, and trustworthy long-term saving instruments.  Low financial literacy, numeracy, and familiarity with formal banking institutions can all create barriers to participation in other forms of saving.  
Pakistan has been much slower than other neighbouring countries in expanding financial inclusion and the barriers to this must be addressed, the study emphasised.
While safe, housing is a relatively illiquid asset, which takes resources away from short-term consumption smoothing. According to Findex, only 3 per cent of those aged 15 years and above in Pakistan report being able to rely on savings for emergency funds, while 49pc say it is not possible to come up with emergency funds. 
The main source of emergency funds tends to be family or friends, according to 41pc of the population aged 15 years and above; 25pc report borrowing for medical expenditures.
Policies that allow greater use of real estate assets as collateral to borrow against, through formal financial institutions, could in theory reduce the need for liquid precautionary savings, and free up resources to save for retirement. However, such initiatives may also encourage over-indebtedness and lead to evictions.
Lack of other safe, liquid forms of saving can also limit earning opportunities offered by self-employment. The self-employed tend to be older than informal wage workers but with similar levels of schooling. Almost half of the self-employed have no education. The older age of the self-employed might suggest that initial working years are spent acquiring start-up capital, as most of the self-employed enterprises are started using own capital. According to the Findex surveys, only 11pc of people aged 15 years and above borrow to start or expand a business.
The study suggests that improving opportunities for safe long-term saving outside housing in the form of government-sponsored or subsidised old-age savings instruments could yield greater independence in old-age and reduce the burden on younger families.
According to the study: “We find that average net worth accumulation accelerates midway through the working years, roughly around age forty. While some of this accumulation may reflect patterns in inheritances, we show that active saving likely plays a significant part: household income growth starts to outpace household consumption growth around that time, and the saving rate increases by 20 percentage points between ages 40 and 65.” This suggests that programmes that aim to encourage formal saving may be most successful among individuals in that age range.

2,"IMF, Pakistan inch closer to revival of loan package","Development comes as Islamabad has taken steps to reduce its expenditure, increase energy prices and improve tax collection.","WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Pakistan moved closer to the revival of their loan package on Saturday as Islamabad has taken several steps to reduce its expenditure, increase energy prices and improve tax collection, as demanded by the IMF. 
The moves bring Pakistan closer to meeting an IMF demand that the country achieve a primary budget surplus of 153 billion rupees — 0.2 per cent of the national output for the new financial year — to revive the bailout package. 
After the last round of talks, IMF Resident Repres­entative in Islamabad Esther Perez Ruiz said, “Discussions between the IMF staff and the authorities on policies to strengthen macroeconomic stability in the coming year continue, and important progress has been made over the FY23 budget”. 
Since then, Pakistan has taken other key steps to IMF demands.
But Michael Kugelman, a scholar of South Asian affairs at the Wilson Centre, Washington, thinks that the Fund wants more. 
“My sense is that the IMF wants to get a better sense of Islamabad’s commitment to meeting IMF criteria before agreeing to release more funds,” he said. 
He said the new government started off “slowly and indecisively,” refusing to remove the energy subsidy that the IMF wanted gone and this proved costly in the previous round of talks. 
“To its credit, the (Shehbaz) Sharif government is now doing all the right things, through the release of its austerity budget and other revenue-generating moves. So, the IMF funds should start coming in,” he added. 
The Bloomberg financial wire also agrees with this assessment, saying that “Pakistan is probably closer to an IMF loan”.

3,"Blinken, Wang hold talks on trade, Ukraine war",Biden and Xi are expected to speak in coming weeks...,"NUSA DUA: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Saturday he had discussed Russian aggression in Ukraine during more than five hours of talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in which he raised concerns over Beijing’s alignment with Moscow. 
The diplomats both described their first in-person discussions since October as “candid”, with the meeting taking place a day after they attended a gathering of G20 foreign ministers on the Indonesian island of Bali.
“I shared again with the state councillor that we are concerned about the PRC’s alignment with Russia,” Blinken told a news conference after the talks, referring to the People’s Republic of China. He said did not think China was behaving in a neutral way as it had supported Russia in the United Nations and “amplified Russian propaganda”.
Blinken said Chinese President Xi Jinping had made it clear in a call with President Vladimir Putin on June 13 that he stood by a decision to form a partnership with Russia.

Biden and Xi are expected to speak in coming weeks

Shortly before Ukraine invasion by Russia, Beijing and Moscow announced a “no-limit” partnership though US officials say they have not yet seen China evade tough US-led sanctions on Russia or provide it with military equipment.
US officials have warned of consequences, including sanctions, should China offer material support for the war that Moscow calls a “special military operation” to degrade the Ukrainian military. Kyiv and its Western allies say the invasion is an unprovoked land grab.
Asked about his refusal to hold talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at the G20, Blinken said: “The problem is this: we see no signs whatsoever that Russia, at this moment in time, is prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy.” 
During Saturday’s talks, Wang exchanged in-depth views on “the Ukraine issue”, according to a statement released by his ministry, without giving details. He also told Blinken that the direction of US-China relations was in danger of being further led “astray” due to a problem with the American perception of China.
“Many people believe that the United States is suffering from an increasingly serious bout of ‘Sino­phobia’,” Wang was quoted as saying.
Wang said Washington should cancel additional tariffs imposed on China as soon as possible and cease unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies. US officials had said before the talks that the meeting was aimed at keeping the difficult US-China ties stable and preventing it from veering inadvertently into conflict.
“Moving forward, the United States wants our channels of communication with Beijing to continue to remain open,” Blinken said.
Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping are expected to speak again in coming weeks, Blinken said.
Daniel Russel, a top US diplomat for East Asia under former President Barack Obama who has close contact with Biden administration officials, said ahead of the talks a key aim for the meeting would be to explore the possibility of an in-person meeting between Biden and Xi, their first as leaders, possibly on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Bali in November.
The US calls China its main strategic rival and is concerned it might attempt to take over the self-ruled democratic island of Taiwan. Despite their rivalry, the world’s two largest economies remain major trading partners, and Biden has been considering scrapping tariffs on a range of Chinese goods to curb surging US inflation before November midterm elections, with control of Congress in focus.

4,10 dams breached as rains ravage Balochistan,"CM orders probe into dams’ ""faulty"" construction; PDMA issues renewed rain warning.","QUETTA: Authorities in Balochistan have issued an alert for people to stay away from dams after at least 10 reservoirs were breached in several districts across the province due to heavy downpour and flash floods. 
The situation has been worsening in many districts in northern Balochistan, where dams have come under immense pressure due to water torrents gushing down from various mountainous areas. 
The Tal Dam in Kech district’s Hoshab area was breached after heavy rainfall triggered flash floods on Saturday. The water entered settlements and damaged houses and date orchards. 
The local administration rescued the affected families and shifted them to safe locations. According to officials, no loss of life was reported, but a vast tract of land in Hoshab had become inundated. 

CM orders probe into dams’ ‘faulty’ construction; PDMA issues renewed rain warning

According to reports from other districts, dams in Qila Saifullah, Toba Achakzai, Qila Abdullah, Chaman, Muslim Bagh, Pishin and Harnai districts either gave way or developed breaches.
“Four dams have collapsed in the Toba-Achakzai area alone, close to the Afghan border,” sources said, adding that the Khushdil Khan Dam in Pishin is also under threat, as it has continuously been receiving flood water from catchment areas. 
The spillways of the dam, constructed in the colonial era, were opened to alleviate the water pressure. According to the latest report, the dam has not developed any breach so far and is still intact. 
The Mirani Dam in Turbat, Ankra Dam in Gwadar and Shadi Kur Dam in Pasni have also been filled by accumulating floodwaters travelling downstream through seasonal channels. 
In view of the situation, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo has ordered the irrigation department and other concerned authorities to monitor the dams’ situation and deploy machinery and staff for prompt action in case of any breach. 
Mr Bizenjo has also ordered the chief secretary to conduct an inquiry into the use of substandard material in the construction of dams that were washed away or damaged. 
PDMA issues another warning
In a renewed warning, the PDMA has warned that the monsoon rains spell would continue for a few more days in northern, central and southern Balochistan, which would lead to flooding in the seasonal rivers and streams. 
According to a PDMA report issued on Saturday, so far 45 people – including women and children – have been killed and over 50 injured in rain-related accidents during last week. 
A PDMA official said over 700 houses have been destroyed, while many bridges and connecting roads were washed away in the floods. 
All kinds of traffic on the Quetta-Kandahar Road, which was blocked by landslides on Friday, was restored on Saturday after authorities removed the boulders and mud blocking it.
Also on Saturday, Commander Southern Command Lt Gen Sarfraz Ali visited Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Balochistan office in Quetta, where he was given a detailed briefing on the flood situation in the province and relief activities being undertaken by different institutions.

5,Water-starved Sindh gets relief in shape of early monsoon showers,Rohri canal official says flows in canals will be increased once the sky is clear.,"HYDERABAD: While water flows have somewhat improved in the Indus river system, early monsoon rains have eventually rescued the water-scarce Sindh where water thirsty crops, mainly cotton, had been awaiting relief.
With increasing temperature in Tarbela’s catchment, flows in the dam have started increasing as well. Hitting dead level in mid-May, the dam’s level remained unchanged till June 29. Statistics showed level of national reservoir started improving from June 30 (1,399.48) and on July 9, it stood at 1,465.58. Now water was being stored in the dam.
“We anticipate to have considerable storages if flows keep coming in,” said Indus River System Authority (Irsa) Director (Operations) Khalid Idris Rana. “But as far as Mangla’s storage is concerned, it will not go beyond 1,170 level against its maximum storage of 1,242,” he said.
Storing water in Tarbela, he explained, was necessary because in case there was a dip, which had been quite unusual throughout this season, flows would have to be increased for the provinces. He disclosed that Irsa increased conveyance losses for Sindh as per the province’s demand from 36pc-35pc while Punjab’s conveyance losses remained 36pc. Guddu would be having 150,000 cusecs upstream flows in next 48-72 hours, according to him.

Rohri canal official says flows in canals will be increased once the sky is clear

“Increasing flows will not perhaps serve the purpose in view of present monsoon spell of rains visiting Sindh. Such discharge might be wasted otherwise and we don’t have water when the province needs it,” he said.
Flows for Sindh province have increased at Chashma barrage where the province’s indent for water flows was placed. Chashma’s downstream flow stood at 210,000 cusecs on July 9 though the flows had remained below 100,000 till June 11. “From June 7, flows downstream Chashma increased to 205,000 cusecs on July 7 and 210,000 cusecs on July 9,” said an irrigation official.
According to another official, who wished not to be named, flows from Chashma should have been increased even further to enable growers cultivate their rice crop in right bank areas of Sindh.
Rains impact
However, Sukkur barrage’s major canals’ administrators in left bank areas have sought reductions in their canals in view of heavy early monsoon rains. These canals are Khairpur Feeder East, Khairpur Feeder West and Rohri canal. “Rains have come aplenty in Rohri [canal] catchment,” said Zaheer Memon, Rohri canal’s superintending engineer.
Gauge in Rohri canal has reduced from 8ft to 5.5ft, according to him. This reduction is sought at off-taking point of the canal at barrage. Such rains are not seen in last 15 years. “We will start increasing flows in the canals once sky starts clearing and sun making its presence felt,” the superintending engineer said. Reduction in discharges has also been reported in right bank Dadu canal due to heavy rains.
Cotton has suffered badly in terms of sowing acreage this season. Only 81pc sowing could have been achieved until June’s last week. One doesn’t know how grower would be able to salvage their crops in water-scarce areas.
“Every cloud has a silver lining,” said Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB) vice president Mehmood Nawaz Shah, adding that rains had been extremely beneficial for water-starved crops though cotton’s acreage had been seriously undermined this season. “But rains have been too widespread and in absence of such rains, even paddy cultivation would have become a major challenge for growers.”
Situation in paddy-growing right bank areas, however, was different, he said. Admittedly, he said, flows had started improving in dam but quantum wise that was a lot to be desired.
Shortage in Sindh, Balochistan
The right bank areas — exclusively meant for rice cultivation — were still facing shortage, as rainfall doesn’t offer any substantial relief. Paddy is also grown in left bank areas of Kotri barrage. “We are not yet able to cultivate our paddy nurseries,” said Ishaq Mugheri, paddy growers’ leader from north-west Qambar-Shahdadkot district of Sindh.
His district is fed by Sukkur barrage’s Khirthar Canal that also provides Balochistan’s share of water in interprovincial water distribution. Allocation-wise shortage was still there at Sindh’s barrages i.e. overall 40pc at three barrages. Among these barrages, Sukkur reported 43.17pc, Guddu 40.94pc and Kotri 35.8pc shortage till July 9.
“Farmers have prepared nurseries with tube-well water in areas wherever groundwater is sweet,” Mugheri said. But, he said, generally growers were still waiting for irrigation water supply for cultivation.
On the other hand, Balochistan also faced water shortage even after improved flows in storage at Tarbela dam, Kabul river and Chashma downstream. “There has been no improvement in water supply for our province ever-since our visit to Sukkur barrage,” said Hameed Mengal, Irsa member from Balochistan.
The province gets its water share from Pat Feeder of Guddu and Khirthar canals of Sukkur barrage. Just like Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan is exempted of shortage. “Our province is bearing with 61pc shortage, otherwise, 10,800 cusecs of water was to be provided to the province from Sindh’s two barrages,” he said.
Meanwhile, Punjab’s link canals, Chashma-Jehlum and Taunsa-Panjnad have been drawing water since July 6.
