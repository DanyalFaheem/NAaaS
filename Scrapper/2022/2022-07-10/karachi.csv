A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro also put the advocate general and prosecutor general, Sindh on notice and directed the respondents to file comments till Aug 11.
Ms Noori, through her lawyer, petitioned the SHC stating that her 20-year-old son Naveed Ali Kaka along with two others was killed by police allegedly in a fake encounter on June 28 in Steel Town. She said police dubbed them as dacoits and lodged cases.
The petitioner stated that after receiving the body, they found the deceased was brutally tortured and marks of violence were apparent on different parts, while his fingers and hands were fractured which prima facie established that the alleged encounter was fake.
She further submitted that they approached police high-ups for a proper investigation of the incident as the deceased had no criminal record, but police officials were allegedly influencing and threatening the family from adopting any course of law.
Citing the home secretary, IGP, SSP-Malir and SHO of the Steel Town police station as respondents, the petitioner maintained that her son, along with his friends, was picked up by police from an eatery in Gulzar-i-Hijri on June 27.
She said her son was the sole bread-earner, as her husband, Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Allah Yar, was already in jail in connection with the Naqeeb murder case.
She sought directives for the home department and IGP to constitute a JIT comprising officials of police and other agencies to investigate the alleged encounter and the cases lodged against her son and other deceased.
The petitioner further pleaded for constitution of a medical board under the supervision of a judicial magistrate for exhumation of the body of her son to determine the cause of death, torture marks and other circumstances.
She also sought directives for police to record her statement as well as the testimonies of other persons who witnessed the torture marks on body of her son.

1,Seven die from electrocution as rain batters parts of Karachi,South district receives most rain; roads leading to Governor House and provincial legislature were inundated.,"KARACHI: At least seven people were electrocuted and one died in a landslide in different parts of the metropolis, which continued to receive downpour on the sixth consecutive day on Saturday.  
It was the South district which received heavy rains in the first half of the day.  
Defence Housing Authority (DHA), Clifton, Bath Island, Lalazar and Keamari areas came under heavy spell that lasted for couple of hours with frequent breaks.  
Within an hour of the rain, M. A. Jinnah Road, I.I. Chundrigar Road, M.R. Kayani Road, Sarwar Shaheed Road, Abdullah Haroon Road and Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road came under water.  
Roads leading to Sindh Governor House and the provincial legislature were also inundated causing hardship to motorists and pedestrians. 

South district receives most rain

By 5pm, the Met Office recorded 59 millimetres of rains at its PAF Masroor  Base observatory and 38.2mm at DHA Phase II.
The Met Office said other parts of the  city witnessed drizzles, traces or single digit  count of the downpour.  
Deaths 
Saturday’s rains caused more loss to human lives as eight people died in rain-related incidents in the metropolis.  
The police, hospital and rescue services officials said that seven people died from electrocution.  
SHO Korangi Industrial Area Inspector Akhlaq Ahmed said that Abdul Khaliq, 28, was an owner of a restaurant in Mehran Town. He got an electric shock and died, when he tried to change an electric bulb in the restaurant.  
In Korangi, Abdul Rasool, 35, was electrocuted. His body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC).  
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that a 30-year-old man, Abdul Ghaffar, was electrocuted in Baldia’s area of Swat Colony.  
Dr Syed added that another man, identified as Inayatullah, 22, was electrocuted in Sohrab Goth near Al-Asif Square.  
The victim was a waiter at a restaurant and going upstairs when he slipped. He tried to stand up by holding a wall where he received the electric shock from an electric board on the wall and died.  
A 23-year-old man, Raqeeb, was electrocuted in Manghopir.  
In North Karachi, a 13-year-old boy, Muzammil got an electric shock inside his home in Arsalan Homes and died.  
In Korangi’s 100 quarters, an old man died from electric shock inside his home. Edhi Foundation spokesperson said that a man, Tufail Khan, 32, died in land-sliding in Baldia’s Abidabad area as heavy stone hit him.  
The body was taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi. Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that Tufail Khan was crushed underneath a boulder that fell from a hill. 
Rains effects 
The major effects of rains on South district this time pushed the city administration to put extra efforts to clear thoroughfares, streets and adjacent lanes after hours-long exercise in Karachi’s business district.   
“Major thrust of the rain was in district South. Nalaas & drains are working on packed capacity. Teams of KMC, DMCs, District Administration, KWSB, Cantonment Boards & Solid Waste are all out on the road to handle the situation. Will keep everyone posted,” Karachi administrator Barrister Murtaza Wahab tweeted with images supervising the rain-related operation of his teams.  
Due to enhanced measures from the administration, most roads were cleared, though a few intersections were inundated with rainwater.

2,SSGC restrained from encashing Rs6bn bank guarantees of KE,"SHC issues  notices to SSGC, two private banks and deputy attorney general.","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has restrained the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) from encashing two bank guarantees of the K-Electric amounting to Rs6 billion issued for indigenous supply of gas.
A single bench headed by Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi also issued notices to the SSGC, two private banks and the deputy attorney general for a date to be fixed after summer vacations.
The KE, through its counsel, filed a lawsuit in SHC stating that it was consuming natural/indigenous gas, RLNG, furnace oil and high-speed diesel for generating electricity.
It said natural gas and RLNG were being provided to the plaintiff by the SSGC.
The lawyer for plaintiff, Arshad Tayebaly, argued that the SSGC had asked the power utility to issue a bank guarantee equivalent to three months estimated indigenous gas supply and thus two banks guarantees of Rs4bn and Rs2bn were issued in favour of gas utility in 2018 and the period of such guarantees was extended from time to time.
However, he stated that such bank guarantees was like a security deposit and the SSGC could not encash the same against arrears and any other dues.
The counsel further submitted that the power utility had made all payments of monthly gad bills and the bill for the month of May amounting to Rs246.575 million was also paid.
He claimed that SSGC had never demanded any outstanding amount in respect of any default in payment of gas supply, but the plaintiff had received information from two private banks that the SSGC had approached them for encashment of the both guarantees.
He maintained that the SSGC was allegedly seeking encashment of guarantees on the pretext that the KE owed outstanding dues of the gas utility amounting to around Rs15bn on account of weekly bills for RLNG and not monthly bills of gas.
The lawyer further submitted that if the bank guarantees were encashed by the SSGC, it would not only be a violation of the term of the bank guarantees but the plaintiff would also be subjected to a significant liquidity crunch.

3,Karachi ‘drowns’ in political wrangling,"KARACHI: Every year the pattern is repeated: the monsoon hits Karachi with all its might, electricity goes kaput,...","KARACHI: Every year the pattern is repeated: the monsoon hits Karachi with all its might, electricity goes kaput, roads get submerged, prolonged traffic jams cause massive air and noise pollution not to mention psychological harm to those who wish to reach home from their workplace or vice versa on time, streets look like turbid rivers, huge puddles are formed all across the city, lives are lost, properties are damaged and the media make a hue and cry about it… to no avail. 
Even the blame game seems to have lost its meaning, if it had any. The Sindh government, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and the district municipal corporations seem to find either themselves utterly helpless or the clamouring for attention by the public no longer cuts ice with them. On Friday alone, one report suggested, nearly 150 K-Electric feeders got affected. Mind you, from Friday, the official five-day Eid holidays begin. Eidul Azha is on Sunday, and who doesn’t know about the hustle and bustle one witnesses at malls and bazaars for Eid shopping, apart from the frantic visits to the cattle market. These are the kinds of occasions where the masses look for moments of joy and a sense of camaraderie. 
It has been written time and again that governments are formed to serve the people. If they don’t do that, their very purpose of coming into being is defeated. But then, in our part of the world, it’s not a new story. Or is it? 
Now the internet is an unforgiving entity. While the mainstream media can sometimes act like an iron fist in a velvet glove, social media holds back no punches — it tells it as it is. 
The videos that people have been uploading for the last few days of areas such as University Road are enough to indicate the enormous scale of damage caused by the rains. One literally needed a boat, not a car or motorcycle, to cross that road the day before. 
The more poignant thing that has accompanied those visuals is their captions, the most common of which is ‘Lawaris Karachi’. It roughly translates as unclaimed city, which basically implies a town without ownership. It is one point of view of looking at the situation, a point of view that’s gaining currency. Even in the memes and humorous/satirical poems that are being written in reaction to the government’s attitude towards Karachi hurt by the monsoon season, the ownership issue comes across as the common theme. The following is a stanza from a recently published Urdu poem by Hassan Zafar Naqvi, which intelligently and incisively highlights the subject:
Hukmaranon ke qahr-o-ghazab ka nishaan
Terey sar per nahin ab koi sa’ibaan
Kon dekhe bhala teri mehrumiaan
Bus buhat ho chuka meri jaan doob ja
Ay Karachi meri jaan-i-jaan doob ja
You face the rulers’ wrath
There’s no shelter over your head anymore
There’s no one to feel what you’re going through
It’s enough, enough, time to drown
My dear Karachi, drown… in water

5,"Behind every successful butcher, there is a blacksmith","Coal barbecue grills costing Rs600-1,800 flood city markets on Eidul Azha.","

A blacksmith sharpens a knife at his workplace, while a variety of knives and cleavers is on sale at the Eid Gah Lohaar Market..—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

 
KARACHI: Agreed that the most important thing to have for Eidul Azha is the sacrificial animal but that’s not all. Even though the other essentials seem like a small matter to deal with in front of your goat, bull or camel, they are also very much needed.
That’s why you see all those piles of sliced round tree trunks or the meat chopping blocks, barbecue grills, various types of skewers, knives, etc, selling at every other big market including supermarkets and departmental stores. Still, the biggest and best place for these things is the Eid Gah Lohaar (or blacksmith) Market.
There are many shops here selling everything. Even if you are not interested in buying new knives or cleavers, you can bring your old ones to have sharpened here. There are skilled men sitting at sharpening wheels busy making knives edges razor sharp. The friction of metal against metal literally makes sparks fly.
Elahi Bux, who sharpens knives, says that it is a difficult skill requiring precision. “If not careful I can also cut myself,” he smiles. He says that he charges Rs50 per knife.

Coal barbecue grills costing Rs600-1,800 flood city markets on Eidul Azha

Sarfaraz Mohammad sells already sharpened knives at the market. He says that the best knives to have are the stainless steel ones that may cost you anywhere between Rs300 and Rs1,000 depending on size and material. 
“The plain steel knives are also good and do the job but they rust easily. But if you keep them in regular use they don’t gather rust,” he says.
He also sells hatchet-like cleavers, both plain steel ones and stainless steel ones. A stainless steel cleaver will cost around Rs2,500 and a plain one about half of that.
In front of him he also has a tall pile of barbecue grills. Nothing too fancy or expensive, they are just coal barbecue grills. The aluminium ones are cheaper than the cast iron ones. A small aluminium grill costs Rs600 and a bigger one, of about three times its size, also costs three times at Rs1,800. A couple of men carry off a large cast iron grill to a car parked nearby. We are told that it costs Rs4,000.
The market also has a variety of skewers to offer. There are thin and round ones and thick flat ones. 
Sohail, the man selling them, says that they need to be cleaned thoroughly before and after use and be stored after coating them with any kind of cooking oil.
Though not made of metal, steel or iron, Wali Khan here sells meat chopping blocks. He asks for Rs1,000 for a medium-size block and Rs2,000 for a big one though some smaller ones can be had for around Rs300, too. 
On being asked, Wali says that the blocks are made of Kikar (Acacia nilotica) wood. The thorny Kikar grows abundantly without too much of effort so there is no shortage of it. But these particular blocks, according to the shopkeeper came from interior parts of Sindh. Asked how to use the blocks and keep them clean, Wali says that one only needs to keep the wood moist with water.

Additional District and Sessions Judge Liaqat Ali Khoso of the Model Criminal Trial Court (Central) pronounced his verdict after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides.
The excise police had arrested her for possessing hashish and lodged a case under Sections 6 9(C ) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997.
Defence counsel Shahzad Ishaque argued that since 2014 no witness had been examined by the prosecution against his client, who was facing the trial without any progress.
He moved an application under Section 265-K of the criminal procedure code (CrPC) and pleaded the court to acquit her of the alleged false case.
The judge wrote in the judgment that the case record revealed that since framing of charges on Oct 23, 2014 not a single witness appeared and examined by the prosecution till date.

On July...","THE language bill passed by the Sindh Assembly on July 7, 1972 sparked off riots in Karachi and Hyderabad. On July 10, the authorities imposed curfew in the affected areas of the Sindh capital. On July 10, as reported by the media on July 11, the Chief Minister of Sindh, Mumtaz Ali Bhutto, issued a statement after a two-hour round of various neighbourhoods of the city during which he was accompanied by the provincial chief secretary and inspector general of police. The chief minister said he was shocked and grieved to see the state of a happy and prosperous city. “All the destruction becomes even more shocking when it is realised that there was absolutely no cause for it. There’s still time to consider the causes of dissatisfaction with a cool and composed mind. This nation was not created that it may become a battleground for Muslim brothers over purely imaginary grievances.”
On July 12, the district magistrate Karachi issued a press note in connection with the previous day’s situation: “Defiance of curfew restrictions in two parts of the city had to be checked by firing. One person in Drigh Colony was injured when a crowd refused to submit to the restrictions in spite of warning. The second violation was in Bohra Pir, Ranchore Lines where another person was injured, too, by firing. In the afternoon, when curfew was withdrawn for two hours, a group of urchins set on fire a night club on Frere Road. They were driven away by firing volley shots in the air. The minor blaze was quickly extinguished. A number of persons were picked up for disregarding the curfew order.”
The next day’s note (July 13) from the magistrate about the July 12 situation claimed that the city and its suburbs were quiet and peaceful throughout the curfew period. The relaxation phase was extended to four hours in the afternoon. During that time, a PIA bus which was in Drigh Colony to pick up employees of the airlines was set afire by some miscreants.
On July 13, two isolated incidents took place in Liaquatabad when a man was stabbed by an unknown person and a second man was injured by a bullet fired from a moving truck. The culprits escaped and the injured were sent to hospital.
On July 14, some roving groups tried to create confusion in Nazimabad, Liaquatabad and Golimar by placing obstacles on the roads and throwing stones at vehicles.
On July 15, in a 34-minute nationwide broadcast on Radio Pakistan, the President of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, announced the formula agreed upon by the representatives of the old and new Sindhis to resolve the language controversy in the province of Sindh. 
As per details, the language bill, passed by the Sindh Assembly on July 7, would be assented to by the governor and at the same time an ordinance would be promulgated so that the status of Urdu was not ‘prejudiced’. He added the ordinance would also provide that for 12 years no discrimination would be made in the matter of appointment, promotion and continuation of services in Sindh on the grounds that one did not know Sindhi or Urdu.

16,Lightning kills two men as many move to safe places during downpour,MIRPURKHAS: Lightning killed two farm workers in two villages as hundreds of people took shelter in government...,"MIRPURKHAS: Lightning killed two farm workers in two villages as hundreds of people took shelter in government buildings and makeshift huts along main roads during intermittent heavy rain on Thursday. The continuous downpour for four days has inundated several houses and fields. 
The local government departments have completely failed to drain out stagnant rainwater from the city and rural areas, leaving people at the mercy of nature. 
In several localities across the city, rainwater entered houses and shops and sewage mixed with rainwater, which aggravated unhygienic conditions for residents. 
The heavy rainfall has filled up the LBOD drain, heightening fears the rising pressure of rainwater may lead to breaches in the drain and flooding in nearby localities.
Meanwhile, hundreds of villagers moved to safer places and government buildings and erected makeshift huts along main roads after rainwater submerged their villages and farms. 
The rainwater also flooded main roads and streets in Mirwah Gorchani, Digri, Jhuddo, Tando Jan Mohammad, Naokot, Kot Ghulam Mohammad, Sindhri, Hingorno, Phuladiyyoon, Khaan, Jhilori etc after the heavy rainfall. 
Many villagers were seen digging drains to drain out stagnant rainwater into nearby LBOD to save their villages from inundation while growers were clearing their fields of cotton and other crops with the help of heavy pumping machines.
Lightning kills two farm workers 
Two farm workers were reportedly killed by lightning in a coastal village and three others, including two children, were injured when wall of their house in Tando Bago town collapsed during heavy rain on Saturday.
The Badin district administration’s so-called rain-emergency plan to cope with rain related issues was exposed as moderate and heavy rains continued to batter the district for the third consecutive day on Saturday, flooding almost all grounds, streets and major roads in the city and causing drains to overflow.
It started raining heavily at 12.30 noon and continued for over 15 minutes, inundating all low-lying localities, including Bhur­gari Mohalla, Labor Colony and Railway Colony.
The rain played havoc with all adjoining towns of the district, including Tando Bago where wall of a house suddenly collapsed injuring two children and a man. 
Heavy rain also lashed coastal villages of Kadhan, Behdmi and other surrounding villages causing heavy damage to thatched houses. Two farm workers Abdul Majeed aka Baboo Dal, 40, and Khuda Bux alias Khudho, 29, were killed by lightning when they were working in their field in the villages of Jhanjho Dal near Behdmi, and Mullah Mori village during heavy rain.

17,Hesco adds to consumers’ woes during heavy rains,HYDERABAD:  It has become almost a norm that electricity will go off before or the  very moment the first drop of...,"HYDERABAD:  It has become almost a norm that electricity will go off before or the  very moment the first drop of rain lands on ground and Hyderabad  Electric Supply Company (Hesco) religiously ensures it every monsoon  without fail. 
Satire aside, this year’s first spell of monsoon  badly exposed Hesco’s performance, like it does every year. The power  utility once again miserably failed to keep power supply going without  any major breakdown during or after the rain.
It rained only 8mm  and 12mm in the city and Latifabad, respectively, on Tuesday as per Met  office figures but electricity supply remained suspended for 10-12  hours. Power breakdown was reported at 5pm, at least 2.5 hours before  the moderate rainfall, and soon afterwards complaints of ‘no power  supply’ kept pouring in from 13 districts under Hesco’s jurisdiction.
It  has been a long time since Hesco was bifurcated into Hesco and Sepco  (Sukkur Electric Supply Company) still the two failed to perform  satisfactorily. 
Had Sepco still been part of Hesco, the latter’s  performance would have come to a naught considering size of the two  regions. The utilities were plagued by complaints of exaggerated  issuance of bills, fatal incidents due to poorly maintained transformers  (at least two major tragedies were reported last year in Hyderabad  alone in which over a dozen people lost their lives), shortage of staff  and equipment, which contributed to below par performance.
Hesco  is quick to share demand-supply gap to justify prolonged outages but  hardly does it come up with details on investment in transmission system  that remains extremely fragile. Back to back tragedies in Hyderabad  last year are a case in point. Electricity dues kept piling up while the  power utility was trying to recover them, often inviting ire of  defaulters. “Power dues are result of collusion between defaulters and  Hesco’s line staff, otherwise it is not possible without active  connivance of the staff,” said a consumer. 
Till May 2022, Hesco’s  receivables stood at Rs131.991 billion, including Rs4.949bn from  federal government, Rs12.408bn from provincial government and  Rs114.633bn to be received from private consumers.
Civic agencies’  water supply and drainage systems are always worst hit by the power  breakdown. “Power supply to pumping stations went off even before the  first drop of rain,” said a Wasa official. 
Hesco spokesman comes  up with a statement that “many feeders were closed as a precautionary  measure while faults also occurred at other feeders”.
As power  supply goes off, Wasa management switches over to standby generators  which are not as good as electricity supply, delaying drainage of  rainwater in Hyderabad, Latifabad and Qasimabad. 
“Ageing network  is root cause of all problems [in Hesco]. Investment in system can give  results alone otherwise it is useless talking about this or that thing,”  commented Aslam Uqaili, former vice chancellor Mehran University of  Engin­eering and Technology (MUET) and ex-member of Hesco’s board of  directors (BoD). 
He believes Hesco couldn’t improve its  performance even after separation of Sepco region. “Hesco is only above  Fata and Quetta’s power distribution companies in terms of performance,”  he said. 
He said that Punjab’s power distribution companies were  performing relatively better. “You need will to deliver. This will is  missing here,” he said.
He said that this power utility had not  yet been able to put in place an able and sound management through  competitive process. “A finance officer appointed through competitive  process in our [BoD] era faces issues as she doesn’t find enabling  environment. So, it is same old drudgery in Hesco,” he said.
Hesco’s  Chief Operating Officer (COO) tried to justify the utility’s  performance in answer to questions by Dawn and conceded that  normalisation of power supply system did consume time. “We are trying to  have more grid stations like two we have added recently,” he said,  referring to Sakhi Wahab and Hyderabad bypass grid stations.
“Old  city area of Hyderabad has become too congested. We don’t find space  there to bifurcate feeders. It is a tricky job and we need space for  having separate grid stations in the city limits to ease out load  management,” he said, adding old lines were being replaced.

18,Rape victim commits suicide in Thar village,MITHI: A teenage girl committed suicide by hanging herself with a rope from a tree near her house in Ful-Ji-Wandh...,"MITHI: A teenage girl committed suicide by hanging herself with a rope from a tree near her house in Ful-Ji-Wandh village on Friday after she was subjected to gang-rape by two men of her community. 
Mashooq Ali Halo, brother of the 18-year-old victim, registered an FIR at Vijuto police station, complaining that two accused Altaf Hussain and Allah Bachayo abducted his sister after drugging their family and then subjected her to sexual assault. 
“They dumped her outside their house in semiconscious condition after having gang-raped her but the moment she came to she ended her life,” he stated in the FIR. 
He said that Tharparkar SSP Hassan Sardar Niazi had taken notice of the incident had ordered the area’s SHO Malik Mushtaq to register the FIR against the accused as per the family’s but he spoiled the case by avoiding to mention the crime of abduction and gang-rape in the 
FIR allegedly after receiving hefty amount in bribe from the accused. 
He demanded registration of a fresh FIR against the accused after proper investigation into the heinous crime. 
Meanwhile, members of civil society, rights and political activists demanded IGP Sindh take notice of the incident and order formation of a JIT to probe the crime.

The transformers developed faults during ongoing heavy rains. 
The protesters held demonstrations and blocked Mir Ka Plot Road, Jarwary Shakh Chowk, M.A. Jinnah Road and Toll Plaza, bringing traffic to a halt. 
They said that over a week had passed since the transformers had developed faults but Hesco employees concerned had not done anything to repair them, hence they remained deprived of power and also water supply.
