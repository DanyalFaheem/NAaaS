DADU / ISLAMABAD: Sindh braced for yet more flooding on Thursday as a surge of water flowed down the Indus river, leaving parts of Dadu district inundated.
Meanwhile, Climate Cha­nge Minister Sherry Reh­man told a summit that “mon­ster” monsoon floods had washed away 45 per cent of country’s cropland, mai­nly in Sindh and caused around $10 billion in damages on the whole. In her estimation, around 70pc districts in the country are now under water. Overall, a third of Pakistan — or an area roughly the size of the UK — is inundated.
According to official data, the number of affected districts now stands at 110, including 34 in Balochistan, 33 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 16 in Sindh and the rest in Punjab, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir.
In Dadu, with Khairpur Nathan Shah city already sub­merged, residents of Johi and Mehar were racing aga­inst time to protect their cities.
The 50,000 citizens of Johi and 10,000 flood-affected people who have come here from various flood-hit villages are under threat as water level was rising along with the ring embankment in Johi city.

Tariq Rind, a resident of Johi, told Dawn that 600 villages of Dadu district had been submerged and many people were stranded amid a shortage of boats. They are also faced with food and water scarcity.
To reduce pressure on the embankments of Johi and Dadu cities, the irrigation department has made a 1,000-foot-wide cut at the MNV drain close to Manchhar lake.
Men, women and children have gathered to work shifts to form new dikes and reinforce existing ones using sandbags, stones and other materials. Apart from fellow residents, songs blaring from loudspeakers are a major morale booster for those working tirelessly to put anything in the way of water ready to swallow vast swathes of the landscape.
Death toll hits 1,191
The floods have killed at least 1,191 people, including 399 children, with 21 deaths reported in the last 24 hours.
The Met Office has predicted even more rains and flash floods this month. “Overall, a tendency for normal to above normal precipitation is likely over the country during September,” it said in a monthly outlook released on Thursday.
The military said on Thursday it had evacuated some 50,000 people, including 1,000 by air, since rescue efforts began.
“We’re on a high alert as water arriving downstream from northern flooding is expected to enter the province over the next few days,” Sindh provincial government spokesman Murtaza Wahab told Reuters news agency.
He said a flow of some 600,000 cubic feet per second was expected to swell the Indus, testing its flood defences.
Under 10 feet of water
In Khairpur Nathan Shah, the water level has risen to 10 feet, leaving thousands of families homeless. Residents were roaming from one place to another place in search of food, according to Hafiz Amin Jamali, the president of the local citizens’ action committee.
With the Indus Highway submerged, Mehar has also been cut off from other areas. Residents continued to raise the ring embankment level to protect the city.
“We have been working to make and reinforce this dike since early morning,” Damshad Ali, 20, told Reuters, vowing to stay in the flood-stricken area with his family.

Nearby, another man called for help. “I appeal to all young men to come join the dike strengthening, God willing we will save the city of Mehar from the floodwaters,” he said from a mound of sandbags as local residents joined the effort. Dadu city is also under threat from four sides.
45pc cropland washed away
The government on Thursday said “monster” monsoon floods had washed away 45pc of the country’s cropland, mainly in Sindh and caused $10bn in damages.
Federal Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman shared the figures at a summit jointly held by her ministry and Unicef in Islamabad to brief young leaders on the country’s vulnerability due to climate change.
She said Sindh was the food basket of the country and its 45pc area was washed away due to heavy flooding, which would bring economic shocks in the future.
“My generation had the carbon-intensive lifestyle and you will have to define at one level what we have to change in our life,” she told the young participants.
“No such environmental and humanitarian crisis has occurred before and we should consider this as the decade’s major climate event. As 70pc of Pakistan’s (districts) are underwater because of a climate catastrophe, make no mistake that it’s all man-made disaster and it will not go back automatically,” she said.
“Our folklore and songs had been on monsoon season, which used to be of two to three spells, but this is a monster flood. Our helicopters could not get off the ground due to persistent rainfall and inclement weather,” she said.

THE devastating floods sweeping the length and breadth of the country have caused more damage to life, property and livelihood than the 2010 floods.
Preliminary assessments put the total cost of physical losses around $11 billion this year and overall economic losses close to about 3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
However, this disaster will definitely take a 3pc chunk out of the projected growth rate of 5pc, with authorities not expecting more than 2pc growth after the floods.
The sum total of damages may vary at the end of the Damage and Needs Assessment, when another, albeit weaker rainfall system hits the country next week.
In 2010, the losses to physical infrastructure amounted to $9.5-10bn and the overall economic impact stood at about 2pc of the GDP, as the country’s growth rate fell to 2.4pc against a target of 4.5pc.
At the time, almost 20 million people were displaced and about 50,000 sq kms were submerged. However, the damage assessment in rupees was around Rs850bn ($10bn) in 2010, compared to over Rs2.5 trillion ($11bn) this year.
According to data put together by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the number of the affected population this year has exceeded 33 million already – 33,046,329 to be precise – over 80 districts across Pakistan, except Azad Jammu and Kashmir which remained mostly unaffected this year.
The overall rains between July and August, according to officials in the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), have been about 208pc above-normal.
However, as compared to 2010, river flows are significantly lower and reservoir storages even fewer amid limited rainfall in the catchment areas.
Editorial: Impact on industry
Another peculiar feature of this year’s rain and floods has been the localised cloud bursts in unusual areas and plains, rather than riverine flooding that occurs in mountains and catchment areas of major reservoirs. “The most astonishing thing this year was that in the catchments of eastern rivers in Kashmir, the rainfall was 5pc below normal”, a senior PMD official said, explaining that this was the reason that Mangla Dam was still at less than 50pc of its storage capacity and would not be filled to capacity this year – something that would pose a challenge in the coming Rabi crop season.
The monsoon rains are usually driven by westerly waves from the Bay of Bengal, moving through India towards the northeastern or southern parts of the country. But this year, consecutive systems mostly moved further west and vast amounts of rain fell in parts of Balochistan, which lies outside the range of the normal monsoon and receives most of its rainfall in the winter months.
PMD weather pundits attribute this to climatic change, as pressure patterns and weather conditions are affecting monsoon currents as well, but they are still reluctant to publicly comment without having a detailed data analysis and scientific study to back this claim.
They, however, agree that the frequency and quantity of extreme weather conditions are definitely expanding to new areas in Pakistan.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa faced the brunt of the devastation in 2010, with almost 90pc of all 1,985 deaths occurring there. Besides, damages to housing, roads, bridges and other infrastructure were caused by a combination of cloud bursts and the westerly monsoon in the catchment areas of the Indus and Kabul rivers, which also affected the Chenab zone.
This year, however, the magnitude of cloud bursts was high, resulting in massive devastation in Sindh, Balochistan and KP, but river flows remained on the lower side.
In 2010, river flows were so high that ‘high’ to ‘very high floods’ continued for weeks from upstream Tarbela dam to Kotri barrage and below, but this year, ‘very high flood’ was recorded at Nowshera for a couple of days, while all other recording points remained ‘normal’ to ‘very high’.
Officials suggest that Wapda’s gauging system was wiped away on August 26 when 350,000 cusecs hit Nowshera, which crossed the 602,000 cusec mark at Attock, while another 260,000 cusecs flow broke through the bays and destroyed heavy machinery, which resulted in damages to the headworks.
Yet, these flows are almost 13pc lower than the 10-year average, showing that most of the flooding was caused by hill torrents, to the extent of 8-10 million acre feet. As a result, about 17MAF of water has gone downstream Kotri since the start of Kharif season on April 1, yet the total storage at major reservoirs is still less than 9.5MAF against a capacity of about 13.5MAF – meaning that around 30pc of reservoir capacity remains un-utilised.
As a consequence of this inundation, cotton, which is the mainstay of exports and a major Kharif crop, is estimated to have lost almost half (5.5 million bales) of its current year’s target of 11 million bales. The destruction of roads and physical infrastructure coupled with crop losses has already sent prices of perishable items skyrocketing.
But when the 2010 floods hit, they coincided with high commodity rates, particularly oil prices which rose to to $125 per barrel from $80. Likewise, the current floods have also hit the country when it the population is already braving historic inflationary pressures and international commodity prices.

2,FPA exemption extended to 300 unit consumers,"Approves solar energy initiative for producing 10,000MW of electricity through solar, wind projects","ISLAMABAD: Blaming the previous Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government for what he called the “woes” the country was faced with, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday announced an exemption from Fuel Price Adjustment (FPA) charges for electricity consumers utilising a maximum of 300 units in August.
The prime minister also wished to rid the country of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) clutches and said the current agreement with the Fund should be the last programme availed by the government.
“Earlier, we gave an FPA exemption to the consumers using less than 200 units and bore the burden of Rs21 billion that covered 48 to 52 per cent of power consumers. But I told my economic team that it was not enough… so today we have decided that the facility should be passed on to the consumers using a maximum of 300 units,” PM Sharif said while addressing a gathering of national and provincial lawmakers. “This (exemption of 300 units) will cover 75pc of the consumers across the country.”
Regarding the IMF programme, the premier said: “We are not fully independent to take our own decisions, as the government sought approval of the IMF even for giving exemption to power consumers.”

Approves solar energy initiative for producing 10,000MW of electricity through solar, wind projects

He said since coming to power, the coalition government had no other option but to take unpopular decisions like multiple petroleum price hikes. He took on former premier Imran Khan for what he called wasting four years by going after his opponents and stopping development projects launched by the previous PML-N government. “I recently met the leadership of Qatar who informed me they had in 2019 offered Imran investment in the power sector, but he remained undecided,” he claimed.
About the resumption of the crucial IMF programme, the PM contended it was not a moment of happiness, as the country was taking on more debt.
Mr Sharif termed the recent flash floods and torrential rains “historic”, calling on the ministers and elected representatives to stay committed during these hard times. “Water has wreaked havoc everywhere from Sukkur to Jaffarabad. In Kalam and Swat, buildings have been washed away and all the tourist areas were a picture of devastation. But let me tell you that all the teams […] the NDMA and everyone else are working day and night to rehabilitate and rescue the flood-affected people.”
He further said the government was giving Rs25,000 as compensation to flood victims across the country via the Benazir Income Support Programme.
“Similarly, a Rs15 billion grant had been given to Sindh, while Rs10bn had been announced for Balochistan and KP,” he added.
The PM also expressed gratitude to Finance Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for sensitising the UN about the destruction after which the world body appealed to the international community for a $160 million emergency relief fund.
Moreover, in order to save billions of dollars in fuel import, the government approved the National Solar Energy Initiative for producing 10,000MW of electricity through solar and wind projects within 10 months.
“Today we have decided to launch solar and wind energy projects to curtail our $20 billion dollar oil import bill,” the prime minister said.
He also announced the convening of a pre-bid conference on Sept 8 or 10 in which 10,000MW solar and wind energy projects would formally be launched.
“Government buildings and tube wells running on diesel will be shifted to solar. Power plants operating on diesel, coal and furnace oil will be partially replaced,” he added.
Mr Sharif further said the electricity being produced through fuel-based projects cost Rs60 per unit, but the government could not supply it to people on that cost compelling it to give huge subsidies. “By establishing alternate energy projects, we can save a big amount given for subsidy and utilise it for the benefit of the people,” he added.

3,Imran boasts of Rs5bn in ‘foreign funds’ after telethon,"""CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja, if you are listening then [I hope] you have now understood what foreign funding is,"" he says.","LAHORE / SARGODHA: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan, whose party is under investigation for receiving prohibited funds by the election watchdog, on Thursday took a jibe at the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and said after watching the telethon — hosted by the PTI chief to collect funds for flood victims — the ECP chief would have learned what constitutes foreign funding.
“CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja, if you are listening then [I hope] you have now understood what foreign funding is,” Mr Khan said at a public gathering in Sargodha’s Sports Stadium. He asked the ECP chief if he had “seen the foreign funding” during the telethon and added that most of the money was pledged by overseas Pakistanis.
Mr Khan said the party would have gathered Rs10 billion but there was a shortage of time. During a three-hour-long telethon earlier this week, the former premier managed to gather Rs5 billion for floods survivors as a number of Pakistanis, mostly expatriates, pledged to help the victims.
Will spill the beans
Imran Khan, who was ousted through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in April, also threatened to reveal the names of people involved in the alleged conspiracy that resulted in his removal and sent the economy into a tailspin.
The PTI chief railed against the ruling coalition and the alleged conspirators who toppled his government for “vested interests”.
Mr Khan said, “I am the captain who would fight harder if pushed against the wall… if they keep on pushing me into a corner, I might expose those who brought the country to the brink of disaster.”
“I have been patient for four months…for the sake of the country. The nation is with me…[and] I can always shut down Islamabad [on one call] but I am not doing it because of the poor economic situation,” Imran Khan thundered.
He alleged that a plan was also hatched to ‘completely eliminate’ him but he had found out and made a tape in case something happened to him wherein he had named those people.
According to Imran Khan, all the economic indicators had been positive when his government was toppled through an alleged conspiracy. “I ask who is responsible for imposing the crooks on the country and creating this chaos,” said Mr Khan while referring to the hyperinflation.
The former premier said efforts were being made to remove him from politics because his rivals were scared, especially after the clean sweep in Punjab by-polls, that if elections took place then the PTI will win a two-third majority. He added that the only way out of the current situation was to hold transparent general elections.

4,"Inflation refuses to cool down, hits 49-year high",August’s CPI index at 27.3pc said to be highest on record since November 1973,"

Irfan Khan

 
ISLAMABAD: The headline inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surged to a nearly 49-year high of 27.3pc in August from a year earlier, official data showed on Thursday, mainly driven by rising food and energy prices.
Price hikes in staples, including vegetables, wheat and cooking oil, led the high inflation, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) said in a statement. In July, annual CPI inflation was 24.9pc, the highest in over 14 years.
By contrast, August’s 27.3pc inflation was the highest on record since 1973-1974, PBS spokesman Ateequr Rehman told Dawn.com. Meanwhile, Arif Habib Corporation said the figure was the highest since November 1973.
The CPI index has since mostly remained below 15pc, with a few exceptions in November 2008, when it was recorded at 24.3pc.

August’s CPI index at 27.3pc said to be highest on record since November 1973

Inflation has been on the rise after fuel prices skyrocketed since the last week of May, as the new coalition government scrapped costly fuel subsidies to tame the surging fiscal deficit and revive a stalled IMF loan programme.
According to the PBS, August inflation in urban and rural areas increased to 26.24pc and 28.7pc year-on-year, respectively. On a month-on-month basis, the CPI showed an increase of 2.45pc.
The inflationary trend was driven by a double-digit increase in almost all sub-indices, especially transport, food and housing, and utilities.
On a year-on-year basis, the transport index saw the biggest rise of 63pc in August, followed by perishable food items 33.85pc, non-perishable food items 28.85pc, housing and utilities 27.57pc, restaurants and hotels 27.43pc, alcoholic beverages and tobacco 25.78pc, and furnishing and household equipment maintenance 21.86pc.
Other categories included recreation and culture 21.78pc, miscellaneous goods and services 19.97pc, clothing and footwear 17.63pc, health 11.89pc, education 9.99pc, and communication 1.23pc.
Apart from CPI, other inflationary indicators like the Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) also saw substantial spikes in August. SPI rose to 34pc in August from 28.2pc a month earlier and 15.9pc in the same month last year. WPI stood at 41.2pc compared to 38.5pc in the previous month and 17.1pc a year ago.
Last week, the Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for August reported that heavy monsoon rains have adversely affected major and minor crops, which may impact the country’s agricultural performance and its overall economic outlook.
Official data showed that food inflation remained on the higher side in August, as it shot up to 28.8pc year-on-year and 1.6pc month-on-month in urban areas, whereas the respective growth in prices in rural areas was 30.2pc and 1.2pc — a reversal of the trend where urban areas usually experience higher food prices.
Food items whose prices rose in August compared to the previous month included tomatoes (52.85pc), pulse moong (15.27pc), vegetables (13.44pc), pulse mash (12.47pc), pulse masoor (11.76pc), eggs (7.53pc), besan (6.5pc), pulse gram (6.08pc), gram whole (5.67pc), potatoes (4.99pc), beans (3.07pc) and cooking oil (2.34pc).
In urban areas, however, the prices of fruits dropped by 19.98pc, chicken by 11.54pc and vegetable ghee by 0.74pc. A similar trend was noticed in the prices of essential food items in rural areas.
Non-food inflation in urban centres increased to 24.7pc year-on-year and 3.3pc month-on-month, whereas in rural areas, it rose to 27.5pc and 3.1pc, respectively. The increase in non-food inflation was mainly driven by unprecedented rising oil prices.
In the non-food category, the items whose prices saw an increase in August from the previous month included electricity charges (19.73pc), liquefied hydrocarbons (8.53pc), readymade garments (7.85pc), construction input items (7.53pc), stationery (7.29pc), cleaning and laundering (6.73pc), motor vehicle accessories (5.20pc), cotton cloth (4.67pc) and furniture and furnishing (2.33pc).
The core inflation in urban areas was 13.8pc in August against 12pc the previous month. In rural areas, the increase was 16.5pc against 14.6pc. This shows that the increase in interest rates also could not stop the upward trend in core inflation.
