1,"Of 0.5m IDPs in Sindh, 14,450 take shelter in govt camps in Karachi",Government has set up 38 camps in six of seven districts of Karachi.,"KARACHI: While more than half a million internally displaced persons (IDPs) have been provided shelter in nearly 2,000 relief camps set up across the province by the Sindh government, fewer than 15,000 of them are housed in 38 government facilities temporarily established in six of the seven districts of Karachi, it emerged on Thursday. 
Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon has put the number of displaced flood-hit people who took refuge in 1,175 relief camps across the province since Aug 20 at 581,010. 
A few days ago, Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani had informed a meeting of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) that so far 50,000 people from flood-hit areas of the province had arrived in Karachi and all of them “are staying in the camps set up by the Sindh government in Sachal Goth, and districts East, West and Keamari”. 
However, on Thursday, the office of Karachi commissioner issued official statistics according to which the number of displaced people housed in government relief camps in the metropolis stands at 14,450 as of Aug 31. 
When contacted, a PPP source told Dawn that Mr Ghani was referring to the total figure of the displaced people arrived in Karachi as a very large number of families preferred to stay with their relatives instead of staying at government’s relief camps for long. “The number [of flood-hit people reaching Karachi] is growing fast,” the source said.  
No relief camp in district South
The district-wise data provided by the office of the Karachi commissioner stated that the government had set up total 38 camps in six of the seven districts of Karachi and South was the only district where no camp had been established. 
of the total 14,550 flood-hit people, 14 camps established in Karachi district East housed the highest number of affected people i.e. 5,891, followed by 4,110 in eight camps at district Malir; 3,369 in six camps at district West; 730 in seven camps at district Keamari and 450 affected people in one relief camp at district Korangi. 
Commissioner Iqbal Memon stated that two relief camps had been established in district Central but so far there was no flood-affected person. 
He said that the IDPs were being provided water, food and medicines at these camps. 
Govt committed to help flood-hit people: Sharjeel
Information Minister Sharjeel Memon said in a statement that the Sindh government was working hard to help flood-affected people and it had set up 1,175 relief camps in the affected districts of the province to house those who had lost everything. 
“Till date, 581,010 affected people have been moved to these camps, where they are being provided with food, water, medicine and other facilities,” he said, adding that heavy rains had severely affected 235 taluqas and 1,051 union councils. 
He said it was the priority of the government to ensure their early rehabilitation and all-out measures were being taken in this regard. 
Meanwhile, a meeting of the district Malir chapter of the PPP was held on Thursday in which the overall situation with regard to the arrival of flood-affected people and arrangements being made for them came under discussion. 
Chairing the meeting, Labour Minister Saeed Ghani, who is also the president of PPP’s Karachi chapter, asked party leadership as well as elected representatives to play their role and ensure all facilities for the displaced people.

A total of 62,000 patients are being treated daily for different diseases, including malaria, dengue, diarrhoea and gastroenteritis, at relief camps. 
This information was shared during a meeting held between the minister for health and population welfare and the World Health Organisation’s representative in Pakistan on Thursday. 
The meeting was held to discuss the ongoing flood relief in Sindh and the ways in which WHO could support the provincial health department. 
Also in attendance were secretary of health Zulfiqar Shah and parliamentary secretary of health Qasim Siraj Soomro and WHO official Dr Sara Salman. 

Formation of mobile health units stressed to reach far-flung areas

Dr Azra Pechuho also expressed concern about the needs of pregnant women across the province and how they could be catered to. 
She said that there would be a rise in chronic diseases like tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, HIV and typhoid due to the contaminated environment. 
Dr Pechuho suggested that a radio transmission was carried out regularly that could guide families about where to seek medical assistance and how to contact health officials in case of an emergency. 
Registration of pregnant women, she said, would be helpful in enabling relief workers to know to prioritise specific treatments and supplements for the women who need it most. 
Dr Mahipala accepted the health minister’s request for providing pregnancy kits with towels, diapers, nutrition supplements and material for menstrual hygiene support in flood relief assistance. 
Dr Pechuho directed officials to utilise services of Covid-19 doctors in flood relief. 
She also advised them to create makeshift hospitals with labour rooms and operating theatres in the tent cities that are being established to provide shelter to the IDPs. 
It was also decided that there would be a daily online meeting with all the ministers who were taking account of the flood relief in Sindh in order to ascertain what the needs were and how the disease patterns were changing and what the priorities were for flood relief on a day-to-day basis.

That is what we have also set out to do,” said Hindu scholar and president minority affairs for the National Peace Committee for Interfaith Harmony Pandit Mukesh Kumar Majaraj P. Jedia during the Hindu festival of Ganesh Visarjan at the Shri Lakshmi Narayan Mandir here on Thursday. 
The festival celebrates deity Lord Ganesha’s birth. Ganesha, according to Hindu scriptures, is known as the deity that removes obstacles. 
“We stayed awake all night long and prayed to Lord Ganesha for all flood affected people, who have lost their loved ones, their homes, their livestock and means of earning. 
May they find relief. May Pakistan always prosper and remain safe from calamities,” said Arjun Maharaj, the temple priest.
Amid loud drum beats, singing and dancing along with loud chants of “Ganpati Bappa Morya”, there were devotees arriving at the temple, located at the Native Jetty Bridge, in groups with their own decorated Ganesha statues, that had a chubby human child’s body with an elephant head. 
The festival rituals included devotees immersing the symbolic clay statues in water following pooja and prayers until they started to dissolve. 
It is said that Ganesha was created from clay and earth and the ritual signifies his birth cycle so that he might return home.
Shri Lakshmi Narayan Mandir general secretary Kailash Vishram said that this year’s festival was special and more significant as the temple management have set up a day-long camp outside the temple for accepting donations for flood victims. 
“The donations started coming in also during the night and throughout Thursday. Whatever we collect, we will take to the affected people ourselves. We will be going door to door to distribute the food rations, clothing, cash and whatever else that we are collecting at our camp. Our heart, brain and eyes will lead us to the needy,” he said.
“We are with them in these trying times. Pakistan Zindabad!”

6,Suspects’ bail plea in Karachi teenage girl’s kidnap case dismissed,Zaheer Ahmed and brother Shabbir Ahmed are accused of kidnapping 15-year-old girl from Karachi and trafficking her to Punjab.,"KARACHI: A special gender-based violence court has dismissed bail applications of two suspects charged with kidnapping a teenage girl from Karachi.
Zaheer Ahmed and his brother Shabbir Ahmed have been charged with kidnapping a 15-year-old girl from Karachi and trafficking her to Punjab, where her illegal underage marriage was solemnised in April this year.
Judge Ilyas pronounced his verdict reserved earlier on the bail pleas of both the brothers after hearing arguments from both sides.
The judge recalled interim pre-arrest bail granted to both the accused on July 21. Therefore, they were taken into custody.
The court issued non-bailable warrants for the arrest of six suspects absconding in the case.
On Aug 27, the court had accepted final challan against 16 people, who have been charged with kidnapping the underage girl and arranging her marriage in Punjab.
The court had also directed the investigating officer of the case to arrest the absconders — Noor Muneer, Muneer Hussain Lughmani, Muhammad Waseem, Khurram Mehmood, Muhammad Arif and Muhammad Umar — and produce them in court on the next date.
The alleged prime suspect, 18-year-old Muhammad Zaheer, his brother Muhammad Shabbir, local cleric Hafiz Ghulam Mustafa, along with seven others have been nominated in the case.
The case has been lodged under the relevant sections of the law at the Al-Falah police station on the complaint of the victim’s father, Syed Mehdi Ali Kazmi.
Man gets life imprisonment
A model court on Thursday awarded life imprisonment to a man for murdering his neighbour over a trivial dispute in the Jamshed Quarters area.
Muhammad Qasim Abbasi was found guilty of shooting to death Muhammad Imran Khan over the issue of smoking outside the latter’s house within the jurisdiction of the Jamshed Quarters police station on Feb 20, 2021.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Haleem Ahmed of the Model Criminal Trial Court (East) pronounced his verdict which was reserved earlier after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides.
The judge observed that the ocular evidence is supported by medical evidence and recovery of firearm coupled with FSL (forensic science laboratory) report.
He maintained that ocular evidence has established that the accused had quarrelled with the deceased before the occurrence and thereafter he took out pistol and barged into his house and shot him.
He observed that the prosecution successfully proved its case against the accused beyond any shadow of doubt. Hence, the judge handed down life imprisonment to him.
He also ordered the convict to pay Rs500,000 compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased.
However, the judge noted that the reason for not awarding death penalty to the man is that he fired one shot at the deceased and he didn’t fire afterwards, which constitutes strong mitigating circumstances to award lesser penalty.
According to the prosecution, the complainant, Kamran Khan, stated that the accused was smoking cigarette in front of the main gate of his house on Feb 20, 2021. He barred the man from smoking there as it infringed on his “right to privacy”, after which the accused got furious and scuffled with him.
The deceased who was sleeping inside came out on hearing hue and cry, after which Abbasi also engaged in a brawl with him, it added.
The prosecution said accused later came back with a pistol and barged into his home and fired shot at his brother Imran, who died while being shifted to the hospital.

The girl’s father had moved an application before a sessions/gender-based violence court for medico legal examination of the girl as he apprehend that Zaheer committed the offence under Section 375 (rape) of Pakistan Penal Code between April 16 and April 17(dates of alleged abduction and marriage).
On Aug 30, the court had allowed the application and ordered the medical examination. Therefore, a two-member medical board was formed and the girl was called to appear before it on Thursday (Sept 1) for the medico-legal examination.

According to the report, overall, a tendency for normal to above-normal precipitation is likely over the country during September. The rainfall is expected to be above normal over 
northeastern Punjab and Sindh. “Northeast of Punjab and southeast of Sindh are likely to receive 20 to 30 per cent more rain than normal while the rest of country 10 to 15 per cent more than normal,” explained chief meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz.  
“Sufficient water for irrigation and power sectors will be available during the forecast month. Rains during the month of September may have a good impact on the growth and vegetation of kharif crops,” it says.  
There was no need for panic as the month of September had the least contribution in terms of precipitation in the monsoon period, he added.  
According to him, the northeast parts of Punjab have so far remained safe in the monsoon while southeast areas of Sindh, particularly Badin, received heavy rainfall.  
The report says that most parts of Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan are expected to receive normal to slightly above normal rainfall whereas Gilgit-Baltistan and northern parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa may receive nearly normal rainfall during the forecast month.

Livestock and Fisheries Minister Abdul Bari Pitafi told Dawn on Thursday that the total loss to this sector was still being estimated.
“So far, over 45,000 animals are reported to have perished causing a loss of over Rs10 billion,” he said.
“A committee has been notified to assess the losses,” he added.
Mr Pitafi said that over 32,000 animal sheds and farms were reported to have been completely damaged causing a loss of over Rs6.5bn.
It was also apprehended that seven to eight million animals out of total 50 million would become sick due to inundation, he said.  “At least Rs2bn is required for animals’ medication and vaccination,” he added.
The minister said that provision of fodder to the animals in flooded area was another big challenge.
“At least Rs70bn is required to provide one-month fodder to the livestock in the province,” he said, adding that the provincial government was planning to supply fodder to at least 10pc of the total livestock.
He said that most of the affected areas were still inundated and inaccessible and the figure of animal mortality and losses would definitely increase after water was drained out. 
“Around 300,000 animals are feared dead in the province,” he said.
The minister said that there were still many areas where livestock teams could not reach due to five to six feet high water.
A report compiled by the livestock department earlier this week said that 29,631 animals died in the unprecedented monsoon rains and flash floods in the province, causing loss of over Rs2bn.
