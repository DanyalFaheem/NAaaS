They says the DHQ MS seat requires an officer of BPS-19 or BPS-20 along an MPH diploma and three years administrative experience and Dr Faisal Ishaq, who has been appointed as the DHQ hospital MS, belongs to BPS-18 while he doesn’t have an MPH diploma or three years of experience in administration.
A gynecologist has filed an FIR against Dr Faisal Ishaq with the City Police Station Narowal, leveling serious charges of violating the sanctity of her house and harassing her. 
On the other hand, a departmental inquiry is also underway against Dr Faisal Ishaq under the Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability (PEEDA) Act on the report of the district health authority over an FIR registered for the misuse of authority and misconduct. 
Proceedings of the criminal case against Dr Ishaq are also going on in the local court. 
The secretary Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department had launched an inquiry into the charges for misconduct and inefficiency against Dr Ishaq under the PEEDA Act 2006 and appointed Dr Muhammad Riaz (BPS-19) APMO, Sargodha, as inquiry officer. 
Muhammad Farooq Gurayah, the law officer of the district health authority, says BPS-19 or BPS-20 scale is required for appointment of MS at DHQ Hospital. 
He adds that according to the law, the officer against whom an inquiry is being conducted under the PEEDA Act can’t be appointed at any administration post while the department has appointed Dr Ishaq as MS without completing the inquiry. 
Dr Khalid Javed, the chief executive officer of district health authority, claims that Dr Ishaq has not done an MPH diploma and he does not have three years of experience in administration. 
Talking to Dawn, Dr Ishaq refutes the allegations, saying that improving the system of the DHQ hospital is his top priority. 
He explains he has taken practical steps to ensure attendance of the absent doctors and paramedics at the hospital and invited their wrath. 
He says show-cause notices were sent to the doctors and paramedics working in private clinics and hospitals during the duty hours and they are now targeting him with false propaganda. 
Dr Faisal Ishaq asserts that the appointment as the MS is his right. He claims that though an inquiry is going on against him under the PEEDA Act and an FIR has also been registered with the police station but he has not been found guilty in both cases. 
“If the commission of crimes is proved, I will leave on my own,” he declares. 
Several phone calls were made and messages were sent by this scribe to Mr Hammad, the spokesperson for the primary and secondary healthcare department, for the department’s version on the story but no response was received.

4,Flood-stricken families vulnerable to viral infections in south Punjab,Unicef sees millions of children exposed to diseases.,"LAHORE: The flood victims of Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur are living under the sky without any shelter and suffering from skin and viral diseases.  
More than a million people have been affected by torrential rains and floods from mountain drains in the two districts in the last 20 days. Besides loss of human lives, the rain and drain water have swept away crops, cattle and mud houses of the people living in villages. The infrastructure and houses in the cities including Taunsa, Fazilpur, Hajipur and Mohammadpur have disappeared.  
The affected villages include Nai Abadi, Habib Shah, Seiflani Eidgah, Mathwan, Bathi, Koda, Wahowa, Sanghar, Surilound, Vidoor, Jalo Wali, Kotani, Dagarwali, Basti Gurmani, Lattra, Tibbi Qaisrani, Lami Wasti, Chah Gogan Wala, Patraywala, Bakhshaywala, Chandanwala, Latri Shumali and Janubi, Basti Batkal, Ratera city and Morr Jugni.  
Around two feet of floodwater is still standing in and around the cities and villages. However, the people from cities have started returning to their homes after remaining on the road without a roof for 10 to 15 days.  

Unicef sees millions of children exposed to diseases

Thousands of people are still living on the bank of the river and Indus Highway without any shelter. The massive floods have resulted in killing 38 people in both districts besides washing out three tehsils and 300 villages of DG Khan and Rajanpur.  
The district administrations have set up relief camps and provided the affectees shelter in schools and colleges of the nearby cities including DG Khan, Rajanpur and Jampur.  
Makhdoom Fakhar Jahan told Dawn that the people were gradually returning to their homes but still floodwater was standing in their houses and crops. He said the crops in both districts had been destroyed. The village people would have to build new houses and the abodes of the people in the city areas also had been damaged.  
He said the residents of nearby cities had provided great help to the flood-affected people by providing them food and shelter. He said although rain had stopped and there was no further floodwater coming in the areas, the displaced would need assistance in rebuilding their homes.  
He said the government was unable to help the people but some of the NGOs including Al Khidmat Foundation and locals had worked day in and day out to help the distressed. He said the government should come forward to build the houses, especially in the villages, ahead of winter besides coming up with a plan to compensate the farmers for the losses to enable them to cultivate crops next time.  
Meanwhile, the United Nations International Children’s Education Funds (Unicef) has warned that more than three million children are facing health risks.  
“Torrential monsoon rains have triggered the most severe flooding in Pakistan’s recent history, washing away villages and leaving more than three million children in need of humanitarian assistance and at increased risk of waterborne diseases, drowning and malnutrition,” a report issued by the global body for children’s rights said.  
It said at least 33 million people, of which approximately 16 million are children, have been affected by this year’s monsoon in Pakistan, bringing devastating rains, floods and landslides.

Justice Anwaar Hussain was hearing a public interest petition filed by Judicial Activism Panel’s chairman Advocate Azhar Siddique.
The lawyer contended that the court had directed the provincial government in 2014 to introduce legislation to enforce permanent measures to control dengue fever. He said the fever was once again spreading in the province due to insufficient measures taken by the government.
He argued that the lives of the citizens were at stake as the government failed to create awareness among the masses and to ensure free facility of CBC tests at all hospitals.  
The lawyer stated that every year the government filed a report in the court only to show its performance and no concrete steps had been taken to eliminate the dengue virus permanently.  
The judge adjourned further hearing till Sept 9 and directed the government to submit a progress report showing steps taken to control dengue. 
He also directed the government to constitute a committee comprising senior doctors to look into the delay in the legislation.

The reconstruction work of the houses will start as soon as the water recedes. Punjab received 364mm of rain this year, which was 85 per cent more than normal.  
Speaking at a news conference at the DGPR offices on Thursday, Raja claimed that pre-monsoon flood warnings and all necessary preparations were made by the departments concerned but those did not prove to be effective against unprecedented heavy rains.  
Raja, who is also provincial minister for cooperatives, environmental protection and parliamentary affairs, said 188 deaths occurred as a result of rains and floods in the province. He said 3,256 people were injured and 25,315 houses were damaged. He said Rajanpur, DG Khan and Mianwali were the worst affected districts.  
He said 644,339 people were affected by rains and floods while more than 200,000 cattle perished. “The flood-affected parts have already been declared calamity-hit areas,” he said. At present, he said, the relief work was in final stages and the most crucial phase of rehabilitation would begin soon.  
He said the chief minister had approved a relief package which included compensation of Rs1 million for the next of kin of each deceased person. Earlier, aid was not given for the construction of kacha houses but this time round the government would provide aid for the reconstruction of such dwellings.  
Meanwhile, health minister Dr Yasmin Rashid said global warming and series of endless rains had hit 346 villages in DG Khan, 176 villages in Rajanpur and 16 villages in Mianwali. She said the Punjab government was providing all possible assistance to the flood victims. Some 1.120 million acres of land had been affected by the floods, she said.  
She said more than 2.016 million people had received free treatment through the sehat sahulat card. 
Speaking at a press conference at the DGPR offices, Dr Rashid, who is also the PTI central Punjab president, said the party’s central Punjab had sent 22 trucks of relief goods for the flood victims.

9,50 artists converge to raise funds for flood relief,"About 50 artists got together and sent their 120 artworks, including calligraphy and sculptures, for an exhibition ...","About 50 artists got together and sent their 120 artworks, including calligraphy and sculptures, for an exhibition at Tagh’eer Lahore Creative Space in the Upper Mall area to generate funds for the flood relief activities.  
The gallery had given a call for the artists to contribute to the flood relief activities by donating their artworks in the wake of the devastating floods that cause destruction in almost all provinces of the country. 
“We (Tagh’eer Lahore Creative Space) had called for donations. We got more than 120 artworks as donations from more than 50 artists. Some gave us their one painting while some others gave their three or four paintings or their artworks. Many of them have been sold out,” says Nashmia Haroon, the founder and director at Tagh’eer. 
There are two parts of the exhibition, divided between senior and renowned artists and less renowned but established artists. Among the artists whose work is on display included Farida Batool, Mohsin Shafi, Laila Rehman, Lubna Jahangir, Masooma Saeed, Usman Saeed, Osheen Saeed, Rabeya Jalil, Kiran Saleem, Sana Saeed, Tehseen Khan, Safdar Qureshi and Javed Iqbal.  
Nashmia said the sale of paintings was still going on online as more people are inquiring and buying them through different mediums and social media. The art enthusiasts book the artworks online and do the deposit, she added. 
There is a variety of paintings and those who want to contribute to flood relief funds can make the purchase according to their own capacity. A painting is priced at Rs5,000 as minimum while the highest price is Rs200,000 for a set of four paintings. There are others that range from Rs15,000 up to Rs70,000.  
“We don’t have much idea of funds generated through the exhibition yet. We would do the collections after the whole process is over,” adds Nashmia. 
Regarding the launch of the fundraiser, she says the concept of the venture is to donate funds, making the art enthusiasts as well as painters and artists to enable them to contributing to raising funds for flood relief and rehabilitation of the flood victims. 
“In the times of inflation, the artists are also suffering. We can’t pay from their pockets in monetary terms. However, their art is worth much more than money so we are contributing through our art,” says Nashmia who herself is an artist. She says that the young artists showed more enthusiasm and they have donated most to the cause.  
Talking about other ventures in the near future, Nashmia says that after this exhibition, the next project of Tagh’eer would be to gather the musicians for a concert to do performances free of cost. There would be tickets on entry and the contributions, which would go to the flood relief fund. “That’s how artist community, painters and singers, can contribute to the relief and rehabilitation of the flood victims.”  
Lubna Jahangir, who is also a part of the exhibition at Tagh’eer, had seen the call for artists on Instagram to send their works for the raising funds by the gallery and sent her painting. She says she sent her four paintings for the cause.  
“I was already putting together my own appeal for funds –art in exchange for donations. I decided to donate some of my pieces for their cause too,” she says, adding that she had raised funds similarly during the Covid pandemic too and helped 50 families for three months. 
Regarding such ventures, Luban argues, “If I donate (funds) from my monthly income, I may not be able to donate a lot. But the exchange (artworks in exchange of donations) allows me to collect more money for the cause”. 
The online sale at Tagh’eer is still going on. The gallery is collaborating with the Zaman Foundation through which the funds would reach the flood victims. All the donations collected through the exhibition would go to the Zaman Foundation.

The governor’s office in a letter to the PU VC stated that a press release was issued on Aug 21 by the public relations section of the mass communication (department of the varsity) that twisted the statement of the governor during an event organised by a private group of colleges at a local hotel.
“The statement also gave an impression as it was from the governor in which he said to adopt a transparent system in the selection process of professors. The press release twisted this statement and linked it to the representation of Dr Shabbir Sarwar to the governor against the appointment of three professors through foreign referees, including Savera Shami and Lubna Zaheer (School of Communication Studies (SCS),” the letter said and directed the VC to probe the matter.
Acting on the governor’s desire, VC Dr Niaz Ahmad constituted the fact-finding committee comprising Prof Umbreen Javaid and Prof Khalid Mahmood to probe the matter and submit its findings within seven days.
Dr Sawar told Dawn that his representation had been pending with the chancellor/governor for the last two months regarding appointment of three professors at the SCS on favouritism but no fact-finding committee was formed in this regard.  
“It seems the chancellor office and the varsities are influenced by a select group corrupting the whole system,” he lamented and denied his involvement in twisting facts about the governor’s statement.
The Lahore High Court last month issued notices to the governor and the VC on a petition challenging the appointment of ‘influential’ candidates as professors of the SCS.
Dr Sarwar filed the petition that Ms Shami, Mian Hannan Ahmad and Dr Zaheer had been appointed as professors in violation of rules and regulations.
Dr Sarwar alleged favouritism, misuse of authority, and violation of rules and regulations in the selection process i.e. advertisement to the issuance of appointment notification.

12,Group comes to aid flood-hit women’s menstrual hygiene,"“Periods do not stop during floods. Women need this assistance,” Bushra Mahnoor, a university student, says.","LAHORE: As aid organisations mobilise to provide relief for victims of the catastrophic floods, a women’s group is focused on a necessity that is frequently taboo -- menstrual hygiene products.
Over 30 million people have been affected by floods -- that cover a third of the country -- following record monsoon rains, with hundreds of thousands made homeless.Half of the victims are women and girls.
“Periods do not stop during floods. Women need this assistance,” Bushra Mahnoor, a university student in Lahore who founded the ‘Mahwari Justice’ campaign to provide help, told AFP.
Mahnoor recalled her experience with the 2010 floods when she saw a young girl with period stains on her clothes.She learned that women “were using leaves” to manage their periods, so decided to take action.
Since June, Mahnoor and colleague Anum Khalid have mobilised friends and volunteers to raise money to buy, pack and distribute emergency sanitary kits containing pads, underwear and soap.
Each kit costs just Rs200, but can make an enormous difference for women trying to retain their dignity in desperate times.Calls to the manufacturers of period products went unanswered, so Mahnoor haggles with wholesalers in bazaars across the city to get the lowest possible rates for the kits.
Mahwari – meaning “period” in Urdu -- has already sent thousands of kits to some of the worst-hit areas, but their reach is set to get even bigger.
After a social media appeal, dozens of girls and women volunteered to help pack the kits. 
“I put myself in their place and thought this would have been such a huge problem for me if I didn’t have these things,” said volunteer Nyle Imtiaz, describing her motivation.
Similar meet-ups are happening in other cities, including Multan, where the transgender community has taken the lead in the local effort.
Mahnoor says she met resistance when she first spoke to men about the kind of specialised help she wanted her group to provide and asked for help in distribution.
“Menstruation is a big taboo in Pakistan and it was not easy,” she said.
Much of the society operates under a strict code of honour, and speaking openly about women’s issues such as menstruation and sexual health is rare.
The reach of the floods also includes Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.For many flood victims who have fled their homes for makeshift camps, women are mixing with men who are not their relatives for the first time. The camps have no showers and only a few shared toilets.
Public conversations and campaigns invoking menstruation often provoke disgust and draw public anger.On social media, the campaign has been accused of pursuing a “liberal agenda”, taking away funds from more worthwhile causes such as food and medicine.
“I don’t understand what is there to hide, and what’s there to be ashamed of,” said Nimra Akram, another volunteer here.“It would be more shameful in my opinion to see a girl who has her period and doesn’t have this kit.”
Mahnoor said even her own family has tried to stop her from being so public.
“My mother tells me I’m being such a shameless woman for even talking about menstruation so openly,” she said.
