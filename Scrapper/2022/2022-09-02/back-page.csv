The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief was booked for terrorism under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act for making controversial remarks against Additional Sessional Judge Zeba Chaudhry and officials of the Islamabad Police during a rally in Islamabad on Aug 20. Another case was also registered against the former PM for violating Section 144. However, new sections were later added to the FIR, against which the PTI chief had approached the court.
At the outset of proceedings on Thursday, the PTI chief’s lawyer Babar Awan submitted an application seeking relief in the sections inserted in the FIR against Mr Khan at a later stage.
These sections were: Section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 186 (imprisonment for three months), and 188 (disobedience to an order lawfully promulgated by a public servant).
Special Public Prosecutor Raja Naveed Hussain confirmed the insertion of these sections and admitted that these sections were not inserted in the FIR initially.
The court requisitioned a complete record of the case and observed except for the sections under the ATA, all sections inserted in the FIR were bailable.
ATC Judge Raja Jawad Abbas Hassan also brushed aside the need for furnishing fresh surety bonds. Mr Khan had earlier submitted surety bonds of Rs100,000 in compliance with th e Aug 25 order of the ATC wherein he was granted bail in Section 144 and terrorism cases.
Meanwhile, the court rejected another application moved by the counsel seeking exemption of Imran Khan from personal appearance at the next hearing.
After the proceedings, the PTI chairman told a group of reporters outside the Judicial Complex that with every passing day he was becoming ‘more dangerous’. He, however, refused to elaborate on his remarks.
When asked about the alleged acceptance of a diamond necklace from property tycoon Malik Riaz by his spouse, Imran Khan retorted that the reporter should ask him about “something more expensive since diamonds were not an expensive item”.

1,"Would ending new NAB bill restore old law, SC wonders","Imran’s revised plea accepted for hearing; his lawyer says amendments to affect rights of people, make accountability ineffective.","ISLAMABAD: A Supreme Court judge on Thursday wondered if the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO) would stand revived in its original form if recent amendments to the accountability law were struck down by the court.
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah is one of the members of the three-member Supreme Court bench that had taken up a plea by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan challenging the recent amendments to the NAO.
Along with the amended petition moved to include challenging of more amendments to the NAO, Khawaja Haris also submitted a concise statement before the court to elaborate why the amendments were being assailed.
Justice Shah asked the senior counsel, who is representing Mr Khan, to cite any case law to suggest that if the apex court struck down the recent amendments to the accountability law, the previous law which was in force before the amendments would stand revived.

Imran’s revised plea accepted for hearing; his lawyer says amendments to affect rights of people, make accountability ineffective

Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial and also consisting Justice Ijazul Ahsan, the bench however accepted the amended petition of the PTI chief for hearing when senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan did not oppose it on behalf of the federal government. The counsel however said he would file a concise statement to answer the issues raised in the amended petition.
The CJP also observed that the petition was not pleading to revive the previous law, but to strike down the law. The case will be taken up again on Sept 26 since one of the members of the bench was proceeding to attend a scholarly conclave abroad.
Referring to the previous concise statement filed by Makhdoom Ali Khan, CJP Bandial said on a lighter note that going through the document, he realised the counsel had kept his cards close to his chest and not divulged much. But now was a chance that more could be revealed when the federal government filed a response to the amended petition, the CJP observed.
At this, the counsel quipped by citing a Mirza Ghalib couplet: “Vo alag baandh ke rakha hai, jo maal acha hai.” (The finest quality goods have been kept separately)
Justice Shah also observed that going through the arguments of the counsel, it seemed they were akin to the principle of policy, which sought to ensure good quality education or good governance, but these were not enforceable, rather a kind of a wish list for serving the country.
Justice Shah also asked the counsel to suggest precedence that the courts should fill the void in case some provision of the law was devoid of or violated fundamental rights.
Khawaja Haris argued that the amendments to the NAO would inevitably affect fundamental rights of the people.

2,CEC asks Punjab govt to ensure holding of LG polls immediately,"Seeks LG rules, number of UCs, wards and reserved seats, maps and demarcation notification from provincial govt.","ISLAMABAD: Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja on Thursday asked the Punjab government to ensure immediate holding of local government elections in the province.
Presiding over a meeting, he told the chief secretary that the provincial government was bound to hold local government (LG) elections in the province immediately under the constitutional and legal provisions and the Supreme Court orders.
He said the provincial government should immediately provide local government rules, number of union councils and wards, number of reserved seats, maps and demarcation notification to the Election Commission of Pakistan so that the latter could discharge its constitutional duties.
The meeting was also attended by members and secretary of the ECP, Punjab chief secretary and other officials of the Punjab government and the ECP.
ECP secretary Omar Hameed Khan briefed the meeting that the provincial government had sent a copy of the Local Government Act, 2022, to the ECP for its input, on which the ECP had given its input and then the provincial government requested for Thursday’s meeting so that suggestions of the ECP be considered.
Speaking on the occasion, the special secretary of the ECP said that the Punjab government had dissolved the local government institutions in April, 2019, and after the order of the Supreme Court, they were restored, whose term also expired on Dec 31, 2021. In the meantime, he noted, the provincial government kept amending the laws from time to time, due to which it was not possible to hold elections.
Under Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the Election Commission of Pakistan is bound to hold elections within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions.
The director general of law informed the ECP that the Supreme Court had issued clear orders for holding local government elections in Punjab and that not holding elections on time was not only in violation of the Constitution and law but also the order of the Supreme Court.

4,Govt not considering any imports from India: FO,"ISLAMABAD: Laying to rest speculation about the import of vegetables and food items from India, the Foreign Office ...","ISLAMABAD: Laying to rest speculation about the import of vegetables and food items from India, the Foreign Office on Thursday categorically said the government was not considering any imports from the neighbouring country.
“We are in touch with countries in the broader neighborhood to facilitate import of those commodities as early as possible. And as regards India currently there is no such thing under consideration,” FO spokesman Asim Iftikhar said at the weekly media briefing.
Finance Minister Miftah Ismail had, earlier in the week, hinted at the possibility of importing vegetables from India to meet the shortage created by catastrophic floods in the country because of which their prices had increased exorbitantly.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, later in an interaction with international media, pointed towards the issues in ties, particularly the rights situation in India-held Kashmir, which needed to be addressed first.
Mr Ismail afterwards again suggested that the issue was still on the table. “The govt will take the decision to allow imports or not based on supply shortage position, after consulting its coalition partners and key stakeholders,” he said.
The finance minister further said: “More than one international agency has approached the govt to allow them to bring food items from India through the land border.”
Mr Iftikhar, responding to a question about Pakistan not engaging in trade but playing cricket with India, said: “As regards playing cricket with India, you would recall that it was India that was refusing to play bilateral series or whatever. Pakistan has always been open and was of the view that sport should not be mixed with other issues,” he added.
