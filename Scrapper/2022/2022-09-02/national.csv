0,"UK, Denmark, France to send aid to Pakistan","Pakistan receives 15m pounds from UK and 10m Danish Krone from Denmark, France pledges “extraordinary operation”.","ISLAMABAD: As floods continue to devastate the southern part of the country, Pakistan on Thursday received 15 million pounds (1 pound=$1.15) from the United Kingdom and 10 million Danish Krone (1 Krone=$0.13) from Denmark as the global community stepped up efforts to provide relief to over 30 million flood-hit people.
France also pledged an “extraordinary operation” to provide emergency relief to Pakistanis shattered by floods as Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari talked to his French counterpart regarding the humanitarian crisis brewing in the country.
The latest funding by the UK came after London provided 1.5 million pounds to Pakistan for relief operations last week. The UK is providing further urgent life-saving support to Pakistan following devastating floods that have left a third of the country underwater, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss announced.
At least 10 million pounds will go to international aid agencies on the ground to help them respond to people’s immediate needs, by providing potable water, sanitation, shelter, and protecting women and girls. It will also support families to repair their homes and maintain their livelihoods.
Denmark’s foreign affairs ministry said it had given money to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to help the survivors, the statement said.
“We are seeing sad pictures right now from Pakistan… it is the most vulnerable who are hit the hardest by climate change …we lend a helping hand to UNHCR’s relief work in Pakistan,” said Development Minister Flemming Moller Mortensen.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the French Embassy in Islamabad said at President Emmanuel Macron’s request, France was putting together an extraordinary operation to provide emergency relief to the people of Pakistan.
According to the French embassy, a special charter leased by the Airbus Foundation would transport 83 high-capacity water pumps, 200 family tents, and survival, hygiene, and protective equipment to Pakistan. The aircraft would also carry experts from civil security units, particularly doctors and nurses who would be deployed on the ground in consultation with the local authorities.
The statement said, the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs would also be shipping a 50-meter-long Bailey-type bridge as well.

1,Pakistan floods only the tip of ‘climate change iceberg’,"US NSA Jake Sullivan assures Islamabad that Washington ""will continue to stand by Pakistan during this tragic time"".","WASHINGTON: “The scenes coming out of Pakistan are heartbreaking,” said the head of a US Senate panel on South Asia as US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan assured Islamabad that Washington “will continue to stand by Pakistan during this tragic time”.
The statements, issued by their offices on Thursday, followed media warnings that Pakistan was facing a flood of “Biblical proportions” and the international community must not leave the country to fend for itself in dealing with this “unprecedented disaster”.
At the UN headquarters in New York, Pakistan’s ambassador, Munir Akram, reminded the international community that “Pakistan’s contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is negligible, but it’s facing deadliest consequences of the changes caused by those emissions”.
“Today it is Pakistan, tomorrow it could be another country,” he said in a series of interviews to various media outlets. “We all need to act in solidarity and find collective ways of how to address this existential threat.”
Pakistan contributes less than 1 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, yet it is experiencing some of its most severe impacts.
In Washington, Pakistan’s US Ambassador Masood Khan also underlined this point. “The floods are tied to global warming, and exceed past events,” said Ambassador Khan while quoting climate experts.
A report by Axios, a US media outlet, noted that “the estimated 1 million houses destroyed in the flooding were occupied by people who had a very low carbon footprint compared to the average American or European citizen”.
Advisor Sullivan also acknowledged that Pakistan was “experiencing the devastating impacts of the floods” and Secretary of State Antony Blinken assured Islamabad the US will continue to provide “critical humanitarian assistance like food, safe water, and shelter”.
“We stand with Pakistan in this difficult time,” Mr Blinken said in his second statement on the floods this week.
Earlier this week, the Biden administration announced $30 million in life-saving humanitarian assistance to Pakistan days after releasing about a million dollars in immediate assistance.
Senator Chris Murphy, Chair of the US Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on South Asia, noted that “severe monsoon season this year has brought unprecedented flooding and subsequently devastating losses” in Pakistan.
“Far too often those who are the least responsible and have the fewest resources face the greatest impacts of the climate crisis,” he said.
“I’ll continue monitoring this crisis and urge the administration to continue providing aid to ensure the people of Pakistan get the support they need,” Senator Murphy added.
Andrew Freedman, a climate and energy reporter for Axios, noted that “the scale and severity of this event are staggering, with the area and population affected exceeding the severity of disastrous flooding seen in 2010, which cost about $10 billion”.
Quoting recent climate studies, the report warned that “back-to-back extreme weather events due to human-caused global warming” could follow as “Pakistan is Exhibit A” what’s coming.

2,Unnamed and unclaimed,"Her body had been infested with maggots, she has been buried in nameless grave by local administration.","LAHORE: It is a heart-rending image and definitely not one for the faint of heart; a woman lies unconscious on a hospital bed with what appears to be dirt covering her entire head. Only, it’s not dirt. 
Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear what the heaving mass covering her skull really is – an infestation of maggots. 
Videos and images of this nameless woman, who passed away in a hospital in Dera Ghazi Khan district on Wednesday, have shaken social media users to the core. But even more heartbreaking is the fact that no one came to claim her body, and she had to be buried in a nameless grave by the local administration.
Taunsa Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Medical Superintendent Tahir Hussain Nutkani told Dawn on Thursday that the woman, thought to be in her 40s, was brought to the hospital unconscious.
According to Rescue 1122, she was rescued four days ago from the flooded area of Mangrotha. Rescuers believe she had lain unattended for 10 to 15 days, which resulted in the maggot infestation that covered her body. 
According to doctors, the woman was suffering from an old ulcer in  the head area and even her eyes were infested with maggots, which were oozing out her body. Hospital staff claim that they tried their best to save her life, starting treatment and clearing the maggots from her body. A surgeon and an eye specialist were also called in for specialist advice.
But after hanging on to life in the hospital for around two days, she breathed her last on Wednesday afternoon, after which the hospital handed over her body to the morgue and reported the matter to the police.
Police and officials from the local Tehsil Municipal Admin­istration tried but failed to establish her identity. They were also unable to locate any of her surviving family – they may have perished in the flood or become separated, who knows. Then, as is the fate that befalls all such Jane and John Does, a funeral was held and she was laid to rest in an anonymous grave.

3,Balochistan admits ‘wasteful chopper’ was theirs,Provincial govt says pilot was forced to drop flour bags meant for flood relief from great height as he couldn't find safe spot.,"QUETTA: The government of Balochistan admitted on Thursday that the pilot of the helicopter that wasted flour bags  meant for flood relief  by dropping them from a great height, was forced to do so as he could not find a safe spot to land.
Balochistan Chief Secretary Abdul Aziz Uqaili said the provincial government’s chopper was trying to drop relief supplies in the Hanna Urak area, a locality on the outskirts of Quetta.
“We do not deny that a few bags dropped from the helicopter were wasted during one of the sorties in the area, as it was  a difficult mountainous area and there was no place to land.”
He said that after a video of the pilot’s actions went viral, the government summoned the chief pilot to raise the issue with him.
According to the secretary, the pilot admitted that during one of the sorties, a few bags were dropped from a great height which resulted in them being wasted. However, he claimed, it was not possible for the helicopter to land or fly low in that area due to difficult mountainous terrain.
He said that after dropping a few bags, the pilot returned to the same area and carefully dropped relief goods by bringing the helicopter to a lower level and hovering in position.
Commander Tanveer, who is the chief pilot of the Balochistan government’s helicopter, told Dawn that the chopper was flying relief missions from the very first day and carrying out two to three sorties daily.

4,Battered roads hamper relief work in GB,Flood victims facing shortage of food and drinking water in GB; govt yet to start repair of roads and bridges.,"GILGIT: The flood victims of Gilgit-Baltistan have been facing shortage of food and drinking water since the calamity has battered the road network. 
The GB government has yet to start work to repair roads and bridges, rendering the region almost inaccessible for organisations trying to carry out relief and rehabilitation. 
On his part, Chief Minister Khalid Khurshid Khan has accused the federal government of hatching conspiracies against the PTI-led government in Gilgit-Baltistan and discriminating against the region’s flood victims. 
According to data provided by the GB disaster management authority, the region was hit by flash floods 112 times from July 1 to Aug 28. Seventeen people lost their lives and six were injured. 
A total of 49 roads, 22 power houses, 78 drinking water channels, 500 irrigation channels and 56 bridges have been damaged across GB. 
The damage to private property has been estimated at almost four billion rupees. 
People in affected areas complained the slow pace of work to restore the road network and electricity connections was making it difficult for aid organisations to reach out to the flood-hit with essential supplies. 
Abdul Majeed, a resident of Ghizer, told Dawn that the district was the worst affected place in GB today. 
“Many villages have been cut off from other areas. The floods rendered impassable a vital road linking Ghizer to Shansure 10 days ago, but the authorities have turned a blind eye to appeals by us to carry out repairs,” he said. 
People in remote villages like Ishkoman, Yasin and Punyal are desperately awaiting the arrival of aid agencies so that their lives could go back to normality, Mr Majeed added. 
Karim Hayat, another resident of Ghizer, told Dawn that the people of Darkhut village, in Yasin valley, had decided to rehabilitate a suspension bridge on self-help basis, but the absence of materials had made them helpless.

6,Court orders Pemra to restore transmission of ARY News,IHC CJ directs Pemra chairperson to ask an official to appear before court and explain why transmission is not being restored.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) ord­ered the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Autho­ri­­ty (Pemra) on Thursday to immediately restore the transmission of ARY News, if no authority has issued instructions to keep the network off air. 
Chief Justice Athar Minallah also ordered Pemra chairman Saleem Baig to ask an official to appear before the court on Friday (today) and explain why the ARY channel’s transmission was not being restored.
The court took up a petition moved by several ARY journalists against Pemra’s Aug 8 move to suspend the transmission, saying that it threatened their livelihood. 
Moved by Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan and Gohar Ali Khan on behalf of journalist Azhar Farooq and others, the petition argued that the transmission of ARY News was either being blocked or there was a complete blackout.  
The petition urged the court to order immediate restoration of the network’s transmissions in Islamabad. 
The IHC issued notices to the federal government and the Cable Operators Association to appear before it on Friday. 
The counsel drew the court’s attention to an order issued by the Sindh High Court (SHC) on Aug 10 that since Pemra had issued no directive for banning or suspending the transmission of ARY News, the authority should immediately restore it and place the channel on the same number as it was on Aug 7. 
The counsel said that despite the court’s unequivocal statement, transmission had not been restored.

7,‘Medicines worth a billion required immediately’,"Survey finds religious parties, groups have set up most relief camps for flood-hit people.","KARACHI / ISLAMABAD: With an estimated five million people at risk of various diseases after being displaced across the country following heavy rains and floods, medical experts and aid organisations have warned that medicines worth over a billion rupees are immediately needed in the affected areas, which they believe can only be generated through donations by pharmaceutical companies.
Meanwhile, a survey has found religious parties have set up the highest number of relief camps for flood-affected people.
“As the disaster is huge, the response should be the same,” said Sufyan Khan, the managing director of Al Khidmat Foundation’s (AKF) health division, at a joint press conference at the Karachi Press Club along with key members of the Pakistan Society of Health-System Pharmacists, local pharmaceutical firm Pharmevo, senior doctors and health experts.

Survey finds religious parties, groups have set up most relief camps for flood-hit people

“International trends and studies lead to an estimate that some five million people are at risk of different diseases. If we keep the minimum medicine price for each patient at Rs220, medicines worth at least a billion rupees would be required.”
Haroon Qasim of Pharmevo shared his reservations based on past experiences when mismanagement, lack of experience and unchecked supplies led to leakages, wastage of medicines worth millions and “mafias” exploiting the situation. He then referred to guidelines prepared by the PSHP carrying details of several medicines as basic first-aid supplies.
Religious parties’ camps
Meanwhile, a survey conducted by an NGO has found that religious parties have set up the highest number of relief camps and are receiving huge funds. This  perhaps reflects a lack of confidence in the federal and provincial governments’ capability to carry out relief efforts.  
Although most of the religious parties were organised on sectarian lines, the donors didn’t care about the divisions. These are some of the major findings of Pattan Development Organisation’s preliminary survey, conducted on July 29 and 30.
Interestingly, about 95pc of the respondents mentioned ‘sympathy’ and ‘to serve humanity’ as the motivating factors for setting up relief camps, while only 2pc said it was ‘my religious duty’. Most stated ‘reaching out to the worst-hit areas due to damaged bridges’ as the general challenges to aid collection and distribution.
“All the camps our teams visited were set up between August 24 and 30. [We] visited 15 camps in the capital city and interviewed those managing them. A large majority of the camps were run by members, madressah students, and volunteers of different organisations. Besides camps, almost every respondent said they employed multiple means to collect relief items and cash such as social media, door-to-door visits, word of mouth, personal contacts, and announcements through mosques,” the report stated.
