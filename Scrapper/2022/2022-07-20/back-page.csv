0,"Russia, Turkiye, Iran vow to ‘eliminate terrorists’ in Syria","Express opposition to the ""illegal seizure and transfer of oil revenues that should belong to Syria”.","TEHRAN: Russia, Turkiye and Iran on Tuesday vowed to continue their cooperation to “eliminate terrorists” in Syria, in a trilateral statement after their presidents met in Tehran.
The three countries “reaffirmed the determination to continue their ongoing cooperation in order to ultimately eliminate terrorist individuals, groups, undertakings and entities,” the statement read.
They “expressed their opposition to the illegal seizure and transfer of oil revenues that should belong to Syria”. They also “rejected all attempts to create new realities on the ground under the pretext of combating terrorism, including illegitimate self-rule initiatives, and expressed their determination to stand against separatist agendas” in Syria.
The trilateral statement was released after Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged his Russian and Iranian counterparts to back his efforts to fight “terrorism” in Syria. It comes after he has lately repeatedly threatened to launch a military offensive against a semi-autonomous Kurdish administration in Syria’s oil-rich northeast.

For Iran, at odds with US over its nuclear programme, Putin’s visit holds great significance

Turkiye has launched waves of attacks on Syria since 2016, targeting the Kurdish fighters as well as those of the militant Islamic State group. It has also supported Syrian rebels against the government of President Bashar al-Assad.
Iran and Russia are also involved in Syria’s conflict, but support, rather than oppose, Assad. “It should be understood clearly that there is no room in our region’s future for separatist terror organisations,” Erdogan said at the summit.
“We will continue our fight against terrorist organisations in the time to come,” he added.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had however told the Turkish leader in a pre-summit meeting that a new Turkish offensive against the Kurds in Syria would be “detrimental” for the region. He called for the issue to be resolved through dialogue between Ankara, Damascus, Moscow and Tehran.
It was not immediately clear whether the trilateral statement at the end of the summit reflected any alteration in Iran’s position on a Turkish offensive.
Putin meets Khamenei
Earlier President Putin held talks with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Kremlin leader’s first trip outside the former Soviet Union since Moscow’s Feb 24 invasion of Ukraine.
Putin’s trip, which came just days after US President Joe Biden visited Israel and Saudi Arabia, sends a strong message to the West about Moscow’s plans to forge closer strategic ties with Iran, China and India in the face of Western sanctions.
Footage of Putin’s meeting with Ayatollah Khamenei showed the Russian leader and the Iran­ian president sat together a few metres from the Supreme Leader, in a spartan white room. Only an Iranian flag and a portrait of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini could be seen in the background.
“The contact with Khamenei is very important,” Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser, told reporters in Moscow. “A trusting dialogue has developed between them on the most important issues on the bilateral and international agenda.”
“On most issues, our positions are close or identical.”
For Iran, also chafing under worst Western economic sanctions and at loggerheads with the United States over Tehran’s nuclear programme and a range of other issues, Putin’s visit is timely.

1,Parvez Elahi seeks Hamza’s trial for contempt,"Also seeks proceedings against Rana Sanaullah, Marriyum for allegedly threatening to make PTI MPAs disappear before CM election.","ISLAMABAD: Punjab Assem­bly Spea­ker Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi on Tuesday urged the Supreme Court to initiate contempt proceedings against Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and Information Minister Marri­yum Aurangzeb for allegedly threatening to make Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmakers disappear before the upcoming chief minister’s election.
In a petition moved through senior counsel Faisal Fareed, Mr Elahi accused the respondents for violating the July 1 Supreme Court order for holding of ‘run-off polls’ for the office of Punjab CM on July 22 and during the interregnum period Hamza Sharif remain within the confines of the constitution and the law without incidence of harassment of political opponents or witch-hunt.
The contempt petition argued that after PTI’s victory in the July 17 by-polls for 20 seats according to unofficial results, the petitioner and his allies had secured the requisite majority to form next government in Punjab as decided by the sovereigns of the state the public at large. It urged the SC to summon the alleged contemnor and award punishment to them for violating the court directions.
In pursuant to the July 1 order, Mr Elahi claimed, preparation for Punjab CM election was under way without any hurdle and he was determined to hold the election and business of assembly in a peaceful, just, transparent manner in accordance with the constitution and the law strictly as well as in accordance with letter and spirit of the court order.

Petition draws SC attention to interior minister’s statement

However, he alleged, the respondents after losing majority in the Punjab Assembly became unnerved and were showing extreme anger and frustration. He further alleged the respondents while acting in a reckless, unconstitutional and unlawful manner have threatened to “remove members” belonging to the PTI and its allies by blatantly flouting the court directions.
According to the petition, the statement of interior minister Rana Sanaullah “abuses, interferes with and obstructs the process” of the court, as the same was to be considered as obstruction to the implementation of the court’s order and it amounted to creating constitutional vacuum, anomaly or complication, and would keep the citizens of the Punjab deprived of due representation and governance.
While recalling the SC direction that the state functionaries would refrain from any interference, inducement or influence in the affairs to any person (natural as well as legal) in the process of by-election, the ‘threatening’ statements by the incumbent interior minister caused great fear and hostility towards the members of the allied parties, Mr Elahi alleged.
The incumbent CM, who is also a contender in the run-off election, had assured the SC about ensuring peaceful election of the chief minister on behalf of his party. Therefore, he was responsible for any disregard of the order passed by this court in letter and spirit.

2,Race to replace Boris Johnson heats up,Four candidates remain in the contest for UK PM.,"

LONDON: The race to replace ousted British Prime Minister Boris Johnson heated up on Tuesday, with four contenders offering more policies to try to climb to the top two in a leadership contest that is splitting the governing Conservative Party.
Since Johnson said he would resign earlier this month after his scandal-ridden administration lost the support of many Conservatives, the remaining candidates have turned their fire on frontrunner, former finance minister Rishi Sunak.
Four candidates remain, with one to be axed after a vote of Conservative Party lawmakers later on Tuesday. Sunak’s allies say his lead all but assures him of a place in the top two who will then court the party’s membership to be appointed the next prime minister in September.
But foreign secretary Liz Truss is closing the gap with second-placed Penny Mordaunt, a junior trade minister, and the rankings can change as Conservative lawmakers whose preferred candidates have been ousted decide where to place their votes.

Four candidates remain in the leadership contest

Sunak, Truss and Mordaunt presented policy offerings to try to add momentum to their campaigns, trying to move the focus away from pledges on tax cuts, at a time when Britain’s flagging economy has left people with the tightest squeeze on their finances for decades.
Sunak, whose resignation as finance minister helped trigger Johnson’s downfall, said he would implement harsher sentences for criminals who fail to attend court and would crackdown on grooming gangs if he became prime minister.
“It will be my top priority in government to keep the British public safe - and I will do whatever it takes to make that happen,” he said in a statement.
New policy statements
All four remaining contenders are keen to buttress some of their right-wing credentials to appeal to a party membership, which, according to 2020 research by Queen Mary University of London and Sussex University Party Members Project, tend to be older, male, southern English supporters of Brexit.
Party members will ultimately choose Britain’s next prime minister after Conservative lawmakers this week whittle down the race to the final two. The party will conduct a head-to-head postal vote of members, with the result due Sept 5 A YouGov poll of Conservative members showed Sunak would lose a runoff vote against all the others, including fourth-placed former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch.
Truss, who has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, repeated her commitment to increase defence spending up to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 2030.
“We live in an increasingly dangerous world where the threat level is higher than a decade ago, and we need a stronger deterrent to face down those threats and ensure Britain leads on the global stage,” she said. “My number one priority is keeping this country safe and people can trust me to do that.”
Mordaunt also committed to Johnson’s so-called levelling up agenda, or tackling regional inequalities in Britain.
“My economic plan will boost competition and growth up and down the country, creating the jobs of the future and enabling the country to live well,” she said in a statement.

3,Pakistanis can now get quake alerts on phones,KARACHI: Google’s “Earth­quake Alerts System” was lau­nched in Pakistan on Tuesday. The system is a free Android feature that...,"KARACHI: Google’s “Earth­quake Alerts System” was lau­nched in Pakistan on Tuesday.
The system is a free Android feature that detects earthquakes across the world by using mobile phone sensors and alerts people. It also provides near-instant information to Google Search engine to that people can find relevant results when they search ‘earthquake’ or ‘earthquake near me’, according to a press release.
On mobile devices, the system displays two types of alerts, depending on the magnitude and intensity of the earthquake. They are: ‘Be Aware’ and ‘Take Action’.
‘Be Aware’ alerts people when quakes with a magnitude of 4.5 occur. A notification is sent along with the distance of its epicentre. The alert uses the phone’s current volume, vibration, and Do Not Disturb settings. ‘Take Action’ is a full-screen alert for quakes with a magnitude higher than 4.5. To help people prepare for potential heavy shaking, full-screen instructions are shown and the phone plays a loud sound.
The system uses accelerometers in active Android smartphones to detect seismic activities. Acetometers are built-in sen­sors that measure motion and accordingly change the orientation of the smartphone. If the phone detects something that it thinks may be a quake, it sends a signal to Google’s earthquake detection server, along with its location. The server then combines data from many pho­nes to detect quake.

4,Sri Lanka's Wickremesinghe to face low-profile legislator in tight presidential contest,Parliament votes today to choose new leader; main opposition leader withdraws from the race.,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s main opposition leader withdrew from the presidential race on Tuesday and promised support to a low-profile politician from the ruling party who will take on acting president Ranil Wickremesinghe in a tight contest.
The 225-seat parliament votes on Wednesday to choose the new president, who will lead efforts to address the country’s economic and political collapse. The house finalised three candidates on Tuesday.
It was not immediately clear how much support the two leading candidates, 73-year-old Wickremesinghe and 63-year-old Dullas Alahapperuma, had in parliament.
Wickremesinghe is deeply unpopular among protesters who stormed his office and official residence earlier this month when he was prime minister, along with those of ousted president Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Nevertheless, Wickremesinghe is backed by a faction of the ruling party to be president.

Sri Lankan parliament votes today to choose new leader

Former journalist and five-time lawmaker Alahapperuma has the support of a separate faction of the ruling Sri Lanka Podu­jana Peramuna (SLPP) party as we all many in the opposition.
Protesters, angered by months-long shortages of fuel and food and rocketing prices after the country nearly ran out of dollars for imports, came out on the streets on Tuesday against Wickremesinghe’s candidacy.
Outside Colombo’s main railway station, a group of several hundred protesters shouted slogans against the Rajapaksa family and Wickremesinghe, who they see as the family’s candidate.
“We are protesting again Ranil. He is a corrupted man,” said Duminda Nagamuwa, one of the protest organisers. “If Ranil comes we cannot have stability.” As parliament met to finalise nominees for the post, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said he had dropped out of the race and would support Alahapperuma.
“For the greater good of my country that I love and the people I cherish, I hereby withdraw my candidacy for the position of president,” Premadasa said on Twitter.
He said his main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya party and “our alliance and our opposition partners will work hard towards making” Alahapperuma the winner.

5,Biden brings sanctions to end abduction of US citizens,Signs executive order that brings new punitive actions against foreign govts that unjustly imprisoned Americans.,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Tuesday that brings new punitive actions against foreign governments that unjustly imprisoned Americans and the order would also apply to hostage-takings in which the United States has a national interest.
“I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with this threat,” the US president said in his order, after declaring that hostage-taking and the wrongful detention of US nationals abroad “constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States”.
He also said that those who indulge in such activities “threaten the integrity of the international political system and the safety of United States nationals and other persons abroad”.
The order authorises US government agencies to use financial sanctions and visa bans on both state and non-state actors as a tool to try to secure the release of detained Americans.
The new measure requires the US State Department to issue a detailed travel warning after a high-profile detention and creates a new ‘D category’ of warning for countries where there’s a risk of wrongful detentions of Americans by foreign governments.
This would apply to China — currently designated as Level 3 — and to five other countries that the State Department has designated as Level 4 — do not travel: Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Burma and North Korea.
A text issued by the White House says that order “applies to both suspected and confirmed hostage-takings in which a US national is abducted or held outside of the United States, as well as to other hostage-takings occurring abroad in which the United States has a national interest”. It, however, does not apply if a foreign government confirms that it has detained a US national.
The order also directs agencies to share information and intelligence with family members of people who have been taken hostage or detained. The US Secretary of State will implement this authority.

6,UK breaks record as heatwave batters Europe,Experts blame climate change for the punishing weather,"

LONDON: A fierce heatwave left much of western Europe sweltering on Tuesday, fuelling ferocious wildfires and stretching emergency services, as it pushed north and took temperatures to record levels.
After Britain’s warmest night on record, the country’s Met Office said 39.1 Celsius (102.4 Fahrenheit) was provisionally recorded in Charlwood, near Gatwick Airport, south of London.
“If confirmed, this will be the highest temperature ever recorded in the UK,” the Met Office meteorological agency said.
“Temperatures are likely to rise further through today,” it added, with predictions that Britain would breach the 40C mark for the first time.

Experts blame climate change for the punishing weather

Experts blame climate change for the latest heatwave and note the more frequent extreme weather will only worsen in years to come.
The high temperatures have triggered an unprecedented red alert for extreme heat in much of England and Wales, where some rail lines were closed as a precaution and schools shuttered in some areas.
“A lot of our infrastructure is just not built for this temperature,” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told Sky News.
“Let record-breaking UK temperatures and tragic deaths in Europe be the wake-up call the world needs to stop climate change from claiming any more lives,” said Tim Wainwright, chief executive of the charity WaterAid.
In France, various towns and cities in the country’s west registered their highest-ever temperatures on Monday, the national weather office said.
The western region of Brittany — normally cool and often wet in summer — set new record highs above 40C.
As the heatwave moves northeast on Tuesday, replaced by cooler air from the Atlantic offering some respite, weather authorities lifted their top red alert level in 15 departments.
But dozens of departments remained on orange alert, with temperatures still expected to top 40C in the east and south and violent thunderstorms forecast locally.
The heatwave — the second to engulf parts of Europe in recent weeks — has contributed to deadly wildfires in France, Greece, Portugal and Spain, destroying vast tracts of land.
Firefighters in France’s southwest were still struggling to contain two massive fires that have caused widespread destruction and forced tens of thousands of people to leave their homes.
Nearly 1,700 firefighters from all over the country, supported by significant air resources, are battling the two blazes that have so far burned nearly 17,000 hectares (42,000 acres) of forest.
“It’s heartbreaking,” said Patrick Davet, mayor of La Teste-de-Buch, the site of one inferno which has prompted mass evacuations.
