The demonstration was organised by members of Young Teachers Association (KP) led by its president Attaur Rehman.
Police officers told Dawn that the teachers had gathered outside Mr Khan’s house to get their demands accepted. The teachers said that Contributory Provident Fund should be abolished and General Provident Fund and pension benefits should be restored. Besides, they also demanded reinstatement of their president, Attaur Rehman, and another office-bearer, the officers said.
Over 1,500 teachers reached the capital in the morning and moved towards Mr Khan’s house without any interference and interception.
Police were directed not to stop the teacher’s caravan anywhere, except the Red Zone. They staged a protest and sit-in in front of Aleema Khan’s house, who is Imran Khan’s sister. Later, they moved towards the PTI chairman’s house. A police contingent was deployed in front of his house.

2,PAC miffed after NAB moves court against directives,"Summons acting NAB chief, DG today; seeks FIA probe against award of exclusive contract to TV channel","ISLAMABAD: The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Tuesday took an exception to a petition filed by the acting chief of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) challenging the apex parliamentary body’s directives in the high court as it ordered the acting head of NAB and Lahore’s director general again to appear before the committee today.
In case of their failure to appear before the accountability committee, police have been asked to intervene and produce them before the accounts committee, as per the directives issued by PAC Chairman Noor Alam Khan during a meeting. 
The PAC met at the Parliament House to examine the audit paras of the Ministry Of Information and Broadcasting (MoIB).
As the meeting started, Mr Khan was informed that Zahir Shah, acting NAB chief, had approached the high court against PAC directives that had ordered the re-opening of the graft cases against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leadership as well as a probe into sexual harassment allegations against former NAB chief.

Summons acting NAB chief, DG today; seeks FIA probe against award of exclusive contract to TV channel

Noor Alam Khan pointed out that instead of implementing the PAC directives, the acting chairman went to a court against the PAC. 
Other PAC members, including Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed and Nisar Cheema, remarked that challenging the writ of PAC was “tantamount to contempt of parliament”. 
NAB plea in IHC
In the petition filed before the IHC, acting chairman Zahir Shah contended that the PAC had gone beyond its jurisdiction by investigating the allegations of sexual harassment against former NAB chairman Javed Iqbal and issuing directives for re-opening of closed inquiries against PTI leaders.
The PAC can only take up the audit reports of the ministries and departments of the federal government, it said, adding that the matters in question were sub judice; hence the PAC could not intervene in the judicial domain.
Moreover, the petition pointed out that the incumbent PAC chairman was facing a NAB inquiry and being an accused, he lacked the moral authority to preside over the meetings related to the bureau. It requested the IHC to set aside the PAC directives issued on July 7. 
ARY ON PAC radar
The PAC sought a report from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the information ministry regarding a decision to grant exclusive sports rights to ARY. Information Secretary Shahera Shahid informed that the matter had been referred to the FIA for further probe after irregularities were found in the award of the contract.
An FIA additional director expressed ignorance about the said inquiry. He, however, assured the committee of sharing details in the next meeting.  
Sexual harassment allegations
On July 7, a woman named Tayyaba Gul stunned the PAC with her disclosure on oath that she was not only treated inhumanly and by former NAB chairman Javed Iqbal and other top officials of the accountability bureau but the PM Office also secured personal gains by blackmailing NAB hierarchy by misusing a video of the then-NAB chief filmed by her.
Testifying before the PAC, Tayyaba Gul stated that former principal secretary Azam Khan and former special assistant to the prime minister Tahir A. Khan invited her for a meeting after she lodged a complaint on Prime Minister’s Citizen Portal.
In the complaint, she had accused the ex-NAB chairman of sexual harassment and also attached some screenshots from secretly recorded footage. 
She told the PAC that Azam Khan and Tahir Khan asked for the video and assured her of taking action against Javed Iqbal. However, the video was aired on Khan’s television channel later on. 
Ms Gul accused the PM Office of using this video to pressurise Iqbal after which the accountability bureau inquiries against PTI leaders were dropped.

7,AJK govt plans authoritarian tourism promotion body,Activists believe the move may pave the way for an unwarranted human intervention in the territory’s highlands.,"MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government is most likely to introduce a bill in the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday to establish an authoritarian “tourism promotion” body which would override several laws or their provisions, including the decades-old forest protection regulations.
The move, after it was partly leaked on social media, has triggered serious apprehensions and criticism from political and civil society activists who believe it may pave the way for an unwarranted human intervention in the territory’s highlands, particularly in Neelum valley, and thus aggravate global warming and biodiversity loss.
The proposed AJK Tourism Promotion (Amendment) Act 2022 is in effect an updated version of a previous law enacted by the PML-N government in 2019, whereby an eight-member state tourism executive committee (STEC) was constituted to formulate rules, regulations and policy pertaining to tourism promotion and examine the suitability and subsequently approve or turn down projects for tourism promotion.
The STEC, which included six civil servants and a representative of the only AJK-owned or any commercial bank, was headed by the minister for tourism and did not compromise the basic authority and functions of the tourism or any other allied department.

However, the new bill proposes establishment of an assertive “Special Tourism Zone Development Authority” to “plan, manage, control, supervise and monitor the activities” in [a] “special tourism zone” to be identified by it.
It has proposed eight civil servants and two representatives of the army as members of the authority while the terms and conditions, qualifications and experience of the chairman to be appointed by the government would be prescribed later.
“The Authority shall be a corporate body, having perpetual succession and a common seal, with power to acquire, hold and dispose of property, both moveable and immoveable, in its name and shall its name sue and be sued,” reads the bill, a copy of which is available with Dawn.
“The tourism department shall maintain close liaison with the Authority on all matters pertaining to special tourism zone project and facilitate smooth functioning of ‘one window operation’ ensuring that unimpeded project development activities are undertaken by the investor and that no major decisions are held up for approval from the concerned AJK quarters for more than 21 days,” it adds.
The proposed law gives sweeping and exclusive powers to the Authority to “develop, regulate and implement regulations in respect of spatial planning, master planning to regulate land use, building code to regulate construction, forestry code to protect and preserve forest and trees, and code for preservation of wildlife, biodiversity, flora and fauna in special tourism zones and act [itself] as regulatory body for implementation.”
While the Authority has been empowered to appoint officials and consultants on its own and within its budget, it has been made mandatory for all government departments intending to start any project in a special tourism zone to obtain prior NOC from the former.
As it was not enough, it states that the special tourism zone would be dealt with under the new law and several other laws or their provisions, including the Jammu Kashmir Forest Protection Regulations of 1930, would have no jurisdiction in the said area.
Even the reserved or protected areas of forests or a national park or any part of them would cease to be the same after being declared as a special tourism zone under the proposed law, it adds.
When someone leaked parts of the proposed bill, social media was flooded with comments smelling a rat in the move and criticising it.
“In Azad Jammu and Kashmir, in the presence of the tourism department, a Tourism Authority is being set up to fulfill some nefarious purposes, overriding the state laws. Valuable land will be sold or leased entirely,” tweeted PML-N AJK chapter secretary general Chaudhry Tariq Farooq.
 






Naila Altaf Kayani, a social and political activist, tweeted: “At a time when the world is grappling with the ravages of climate change, reports that [the] AJK Government is contemplating establishing special tourism zones in highlands are disturbing. Our highlands are so far safe from human intervention. If allowed, it’ll play havoc with biodiversity.”

10,AJK observes Kashmir’s accession to Pakistan day,AJK PM expresses hope people of India-occupied Kashmir will soon overthrow the shackles of India’s forcible occupation.,"MUZAFFARABAD: People across Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Tuesday observed 75th“Accession to Pakistan Day” to renew their unwavering affiliation with Pakistan and vowed to leave no stone unturned to translate the dreams of Kashmiri martyrs to overthrow India’s illegal occupation of their motherland.
Rallies and other events were held in different parts of state to mark the day which commemorates the passage of a resolution on July 19, 1947 by the Working Committee of All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference at its meeting in Srinagar whereby it had called for the Muslim majority state’s accession to the yet-to-be-created dominion of Pakistan.
In Muzaffarabad, a rally was taken out by Pasban-i-Hurriyat Jammu and Kashmir (PHJK), an organisation of post-1989 migrants from the India occupied territory, to manifest their hatred for India and love for Pakistan.
“In relation to Islam, we are Pakistanis and Pakistan is ours,” read a quote of Syed Ali Shah Geelani on a banner participants of the rally were holding.
The rally began from Garhi Pan Chowk and concluded at Burhan Wani Chowk outside the local press club, amid loud pro-freedom and anti-India chants.
“When the Kashmiri youths wave Pakistani flags in front of Indian bullets and bayonets and when the coffins of martyrs are draped with Pakistani flags, it’s the renewal of the intellectual commitment with Pakistan and the July 19 resolution,” said PHJK chief Uzair Ahmed Ghazali in his address on the occasion.
Speaking at a function held inside the press club, AJK minister for local government and rural development Khawaja Farooq Ahmed maintained that Pakistan Accession Day was a reflection of an unbreakable relationship between the Kashmiri people and Pakistan.
“Geographically, linguistically and religiously, the state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of Pakistan,” he asserted.
Mr Ahmed, who also heads the AJK government’s committee for national events, maintained that the freedom movement in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir had started in the wake of the accession resolution.
He asked the state-run Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Commission to publish booklets related to such national events and distribute them to the public so that the history of these days could be enlightened in the true sense.
He said love for Pakistan was in the blood of Kashmiris which India had failed to eliminate despite employing brute force having no parallel across the world.
He also paid tributes to the incarcerated Kashmiri leaders and youths in occupied Kashmir and India and called upon the international community to use its good offices for their immediate and unconditional release as well as the ultimate settlement of the core issue of Kashmir.
Meanwhile, in a statement from Islamabad, AJK Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas also expressed hope that the people of India occupied Kashmir would soon overthrow the shackles of India’s forcible occupation.

11,Covid-19 situation normal even with rising cases: DHO,Only 14 out of 466 beds and two of 68 ventilators occupied in capital’s hospitals,"ISLAMABAD: Though Covid-19 cases have again started increasing in the federal capital, according to data on hospital occupancy, the situation is not as bad as it looked from the number of daily cases.
District Health Officer (DHO) Dr Zaeem Zia while talking to Dawn said the situation was under control as almost every eligible person in the city had been vaccinated.
The data showed that 53 people were found infected and the positivity rate was recorded at 4.33pc. The low number of tests translated into the high positivity as only 1,225 samples were collected from suspected patients.
While Covid-19 was at its peak in February this year, around 8,000 tests were being conducted on a daily basis.

Only 14 out of 466 beds and two of 68 ventilators occupied in capital’s hospitals

According to the data available with Dawn, 466 beds were allocated for Covid-19 patients but only 14 were occupied across the city. Nine beds were occupied in Shifa International Hospital, three in Quaid-i-Azam International Hospital and two in Kalsoom International Hospital. Not a single patient was admitted in public sector hospitals.
Moreover, there were 68 ventilators dedicated for the Covid-19 patients and only two of them were occupied. Two patients on ventilators were admitted in Shifa International Hospital.
A senior doctor of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) said although 50 beds were allocated for Covid-19 patients in the hospital, none of them was occupied.
Replying to a question, the doctor said well-off people preferred admitting their patients, even with no complications, in hospitals so that other family members would not contract the virus.
“In public sector hospitals, we only admit patients having complications and others are advised to stay at home and remain in isolation. As majority of people are vaccinated so patients hardly face complications,” he said.
Dr Zia told Dawn that although cases and positivity had increased a little, the situation was under control.
“Currently, the health department is dealing with dengue, Covid-19, acute water diarrhea, heatwave and many other health-related issues at the same time. However, as we have dealt with Covid-19 when it was at its peak, we believe we can easily tackle the situation,” he said.
The DHO said he was getting full support from Minister of National Health Services Abdul Qadir Patel and the National Command and Operation Centre due to which it had become easier to deal with diseases and disasters.
USAID chief praises Covid-19 response
On the invitation of USAID Administrator Samantha Power, a virtual meeting was held with health minister Abdul Qadir Patel on Tuesday.
The meeting was meant to appreciate Pakistan’s overall response to the Covid-19 pandemic and progress on vaccination.
Ms Power appreciated the government’s strategic and targeted response to Covid-19.
According to a statement, despite being a developing country, Pakistan has faced the pandemic boldly through a coordinated mechanism. Pakistan rolled out Covid-19 vaccination successfully targeting vulnerable populations first. The overall coverage of 87pc plus of the eligible 12-plus population is a remarkable achievement.
Mr Patel appreciated the US support throughout the pandemic in terms of personal protective equipment, ventilators, oxygen and vaccines.
“Pak-US partnership is imperative for improving the health status of the people of Pakistan. US support for paediatric vaccination will help in protecting children 5-11 years of age,” he said.
