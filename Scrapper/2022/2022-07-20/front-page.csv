LAHORE: Following a crushing defeat in the Punjab by-polls on Sunday, the top leadership of the ruling coalition got together here on Tuesday for an ‘introspective’ huddle, resolving to save the Punjab government at any cost and announce the next general elections after completing the current assembly’s term till August 2023.
The bigwigs of the nine-party ruling alliance were unanimous that the Shehbaz Sharif-led government in the Centre should complete its tenure for one major reason — it had taken harsh economic decisions and paid the price by facing defeat in the Punjab by-polls. Now, there was no need to panic and give in to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan’s demands for early elections.
The coalition partners also put their weight behind PM Shehbaz in launching ‘concrete efforts’ and exploring all possible ways to save his son Hamza Shehbaz’s office of the Punjab chief minister from the joint PTI-PML-Q candidate, Chaudhry Parvez Elahi.

The top leadership of the ruling alliance, including JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, MQM-P’s Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and Wasim Akhtar, federal minister Tariq Bashir Cheema from the PML-Q (Shujaat group), Mian Iftikhar Hussain of the ANP, Shah Owais Noorani of Jamiat Ulema-i-Pakistan, Jamhoori Watan Party’s Shahzain Bugti, Punjab CM Hamza Shehbaz, PML-N federal ministers Marriyum Aurangzeb, Fahd Hussain, Azam Nazir Tarar and Saad Rafique, and former National Assembly speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, attended the meeting hosted by Prime Minister Sharif at his Model Town residence.
According to a source, almost all the participants vociferously backed the suggestion that the coalition government should complete its term till August next year. “We have taken tough economic decisions, and by the time we go to the general polls next year the situation will be different. We don’t need to be afraid of Imran… rather we have to get tough with him and respond in a befitting manner,” he said.
Leaders of the main coalition parties – PML-N, PPP and JUI-F – told PM Sharif to pull up his socks and, come what may, not hand over Punjab to the PTI-PML-Q without a tough fight. “Hamza should not resign. The coalition will explore ways to retain him as the CM at all costs,” the source quoted a participant of the meeting as having said.
During the huddle, Hamza spent some time with Mr Zardari and got some ‘important tips’ regarding retaining his office. “Losing Punjab means losing the Centre, and we can’t afford this,” maintained a participant. “Explore all legal and the required options to save the coalition government in Punjab,” he said. No one in the meeting disagreed with his opinion.
After the gathering, Railways Minister Saad Rafique, along with members of the allied parties, declared at a press conference that the federal government wasn’t going anywhere. He presented the coalition’s ‘official stance’ of coming to power after toppling the Imran government, saying it was done “in the larger interest of the country. The PTI government had laid economic landmines but we took tough decisions to save Pakistan and did not bother about our politics”.
Rafique played down the PML-N and its allies’ defeat in the by-polls, saying his party snatched four seats from the PTI and claimed their vote increased by 39 per cent. He refused to concur with the impression that the poll results had anything to do with the popularity of any party.
The minister was very critical of Imran Khan, saying the former premier wanted the army chief, chief justice of Pakistan and the chief election commissioner of his choice as he thought of himself as the “Ameerul Momineen”.
The minister also targeted the judiciary for not taking up the cases of PML-N leaders. He said court verdicts should not be announced under the ‘doctrine of necessity’ and urged the judiciary not to interfere in legislation, which was the domain of parliament. He asked the Supreme Court to hear the review petition against its judgement on the presidential reference on Article 63-A. He also asked the election commission to decide the foreign funding case of the PTI.
Federal Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the next general elections would be held when the incumbent government and the ECP decided.
PTI to thwart ‘buying of MPAs’
In anticipation of the PML-N’s likely bid to woo their MPAs, the PTI-PML-Q leadership has directed all its lawmakers to reach Lahore on Wednesday (today). “They are likely to be lodged in a hotel so they cannot be approached by the PML-N, and Imran Khan will meet them here,” a party insider said.
CM Hamza is certain to lose his office to Mr Elahi after failing to win 11 seats to achieve a majority in the Punjab Assembly where the joint opposition now has 188 members after the recent by-polls.
Reportedly, the PML-N is working on either ‘detaining’ a few PTI lawmakers in different cases or luring some of them with ‘very lucrative packages’ to abstain from voting on July 22 during the run-off election for the chief minister.
Former PTI provincial minister Dr Yasmin Rashid told Dawn the PML-N would fail to buy their lawmakers to save Hamza. “The PML-N should have shown some grace and accepted its defeat in the by-polls. By indulging in such nefarious activities, the Sharifs will tarnish their reputation even further. People have seen the fate of the lotas (turncoats) and our lawmakers can’t be lured anymore by the PML-N and its allies,” Dr Rashid asserted, adding party chief Imran would be staying in Lahore for two days (to thwart) any such plans of the government.
Meanwhile, the PML-N-PPP parliamentary party members’ meeting was held at 90, The Mall where reportedly two PML-N MPAs were ‘missing’. Hamza told the meeting that he knew how to compete (in the election for the CM). “We will not leave the field open,” he was quoted by a source as having said.
Zardari seeks Shujaat’s ‘help for Hamza’
Separately, PPP’s Asif Zardari met PML-Q president Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain at the latter’s residence in Lahore and reportedly sought his help to save Hamza Shehbaz in the run-off election for the CM on Friday.
Shujaat’s son Salik Hussain and PML-Q leader Tariq Bashir Cheema are part of Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet.
The PML-Q has 10 MPAs in the Punjab Assembly, and Zardari reportedly asked Shujaat to side with the ruling coalition in its plan to save Hamza. Reacting to these reports, Riaz Fatyana, chairman of the PTI Election Analysis and Management Cell, said in a statement: “The PML-Q MPAs will vote for the CM candidate from their own party -- Parvez Elahi. So they aren’t violating Article 63-A. Even Chaudhry Shujaat can’t stop them because the candidate isn’t from the PTI. Voting for your own party’s candidate isn’t unconstitutional.”
Shujaat has already said in a statement that Elahi would be the PML-Q candidate for the CM’s slot.

1,SC asks PTI why govt given ‘walkover’ on NAB law,Qureshi says his party tried its best to make suggestions about ame­ndments to the law during standing committee meetings,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court asked PTI vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Tues­day to explain why his party had given a “walkover” to the government during the passage of ame­ndments to the National Accou­ntability Ordinance (NAO) 1999.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, a three-judge bench took up a challenge to the amendments in the NAO, moved by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan through Khawaja Haris Ahmed.
The CJP dropped hints the court might send the amendments back to parliament for reconsideration since it cannot step into the legislature’s shoes.
The CJP also asked Shah Mahmood Qureshi whether questions being raised in the petition were debated and explain if the answer is no.

Qureshi says his party tried its best to make suggestions about ame­ndments to the law during standing committee meetings

Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah wondered why the PTI did not put up resistance in parliament when amendments were being made in the NAB law and why should the court consider the petitioner’s locus standi in moving this petition. “If you were so serious about your responsibility, why your party walked out of the assembly,” Justice Shah observed.
Although the apex court issued notices to the federation through the law secretary and the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), as well as Attorney General Ashtar Ausaf, under Section 27-A of the Supreme Court Rules 1980, it did not give any interim relief or stay to the petitioner despite a clear divide in the bench.
While Justice Ijazul Ahsan highlighted the need for an interim relief, Justice Syed Man­soor Ali Shah was of the view that nothing once done can be undone at the final stages of a case.
The CJP observed that an individual had to make “sacrifices for the greater good of the nation”, adding that it was time to “show responsibility” since the court was very sensitive about its time as ordinary litigants suffer when the court hears cases of a political nature.
Shah Mahmood Qureshi rep­lied that his party had tried its best to make suggestions about ame­ndments to the NAO Ord­inance during meetings of standing committees, but the ruling coalition managed to get the bill adopted by virtue of its majority in the National Assembly.
Justice Shah wondered whether the apex court could carry out the functions expected of the legislature, observing at the same time the apex court had to tread carefully since parliament’s sovereignty was supreme.
“We have to examine whether the NAB law has brought good to the country and added to its progress or whether it is being used as a political tool. The judiciary has to examine further whether it can strike down the law since it violates the Constitution,” Justice Mansoor Ali Shah said.
Parliament’s powers
Justice Ijazul Ahsan said the moot question was could parliament be given unbridled powers and what was the tipping point that allows the court to step into parliament’s domain.
Only a token resistance was shown by President Arif Alvi when he returned the amendments, but it was later passed through a joint session of parliament, Justice Ahsan recalled.
Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial observed the NAB law was not confined to public representatives alone, highlighting a consensus that the law was impeding normal government functions since officials thought twice before signing any document.
The counsel argued that amendments in NAB law had obliterated the concept of trust in public representatives _ a bedrock of the parliamentary form of government.
The court observed that the points raised by the petitioner deserved consideration and asked Shah Mahmood Qureshi to explain why debate did not take place in parliament on amendments to the NAB law, adding that “we also expect similar assistance from other parties”. The hearing will resume on Friday.

2,ECP comes under fire as plea for vote recount in PP-7 rejected,"RO asked candidates to mutually identify 15-20 polling stations for recount, say sources.","ISLAMABAD: The rejection of a PTI candidate’s plea for recount of votes at all the 266 polling stations in PP-7 provoked a fresh salvo of accusations against the Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan, as the returning officer (RO), after a daylong exercise, decided that results of the Rawalpindi-II constituency would be consolidated at his camp office in Kahuta on July 20 at 10am.
The RO, who had earlier called all the contesting candidates at his camp office in Kahuta for a decision on the recount application on Tuesday, kept on changing time for a decision throughout the day after initially saying that recount at all the 266 polling stations was not possible.
Informed sources told Dawn that the returning officer Rai Sultan Bhatti, after hearing arguments from all sides for some three hours, asked the candidates to mutually identify 15-20 polling stations for recount.
PTI’s retired Colonel Shabbir Awan raised questions about the high number of rejected votes, which was over 30 times more than the margin of victory. He lost by a thin margin of 49 votes while the number of rejected votes was 1,516.
The main objection raised by him was that most of the votes had been rejected on the basis of the stamps affixed by the polling staff at the back of the ballot papers under a mandatory requirement. He argued that the voters and the candidates were not responsible if the stamp affixed by the polling staff was visible on the front side of the ballot.
“If there was still any doubt about ECP acting in support of PMLN….” PTI leader Shireen Mazari tweeted.
Claiming that the ECP rejected recount request of PTI candidate on PP-7, she said this was in clear violation of election laws and constitution given the minuscule margin of victory. She was of the opinion the ECP would entertain the request of PML-N candidate Nazir Chohan to delay announcement of by-election results on a flimsy pretext of law & order situation on polling day. “A similar request made earlier viz Karachi elections where 5 ppl were killed & dozens injured on polling day was immed rejected by ECP and MQM’s winning candidate’s notification was issued the very next day! Such a blatant bias favouring PMLN is now too obvious. CEC must resign,” she tweeted.

 





 
“Returning officer has not allowed for recount in ‪#PP7, what else proof is needed of a biased Election Commission. PTI will not accept this, if we let it to, imagine what will happen in General Elections,” PTI leader retired major Tahir Sadiq tweeted.

 





 
According to the election officials, RO refused to order recount at all the polling stations but suggested the candidates of the PTI, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and other parties to mutually decide and identify any 15 to 20 ‘objectionable’ polling stations where votes should be recounted.
The RO also allowed some time to all the candidates to consult their legal teams for the purpose.
PML-N candidate Raja Sagheer Ahmed objected to the recount of ‘rejected’ votes, saying that the request for a recount of votes, which were ‘not approved or rejected’, should not be entertained.
Later, while talking to the media PTI’s lawyers said: “We have applied for a recount of 1,516 rejected votes and a recount of the votes including investigation. They said the RO asked to announce the decision at 6:30pm.”
Talking to Dawn, former MNA and PTI spokesman Sadaqat Abbasi said the PP-7 result was ‘doubtful’, as the PTI candidate was winning at 265 polling stations and his position changed all of a sudden with the last polling station result.
He said Mr Awan had submitted an application for ‘consolidation of result’, but the RO reserved the decision on Tuesday. The party workers and candidate were asked to wait till 6:30pm, but then the RO gave message to return home and he would inform the candidate over the phone about the decision.
“It is strange that RO refused to meet any candidate and his lawyers or party leaders. I personally requested to meet him but he declined. He (Returning Officer) did not know about the decision,” he alleged.
He said that the role of administration and election commission was ‘doubtful’ during the election campaign also. “Now it is delaying the issue,” he said, claiming that it was the candidate’s right to ask for recount of votes when there was a very thin difference of mere 49 votes.
According to unofficial results, PML-N candidate Raja Sagheer won the by-election for the provincial assembly. He got 68,906 votes while PTI’s retired colonel Shabbir Awan got 68,857 votes, Hafiz Mansoor of the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan 14,775, Raja Tanveer of Jamaat-i-Islami 1,666 and independent candidates Engineer Raja Nazakat Hussain 339 votes and Raja Wasim bagged 3,084.
For the PP-7 Rawalpindi constituency, having 335,295 registered voters, a total of 266 polling stations with 787 polling booths had been set up.
As per result, the turnout was 47.46 per cent as 159,143 votes polled and 1,516 votes were rejected.

3,FO rejects notion cipher was ‘hidden from ex-PM or Qureshi’,"ISLAMABAD: The For­eign Office (FO), once again on Tuesday, challenged Pak­is­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s cla­im ...","ISLAMABAD: The For­eign Office (FO), once again on Tuesday, challenged Pak­is­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s cla­im that the diplomatic cable from Pakistan’s ambassador in Washington — which is said to have contained an American official’s comments regarding the vote of no-confidence against former prime minister Imran Khan — had been ‘concealed’ from government functionaries.
It is “entirely baseless [to] claim that the cipher communication received from the embassy in Washington was ‘hidden’ from the foreign minister or prime minister,” FO Spokesman Asim Iftikhar said in a statement on Tuesday.
The statement was issued after Shahbaz Gill, chief of staff to Mr Khan, reiterated the allegation in a press conference that then-prime minister Imran Khan and foreign minister Shah Mah­mood Qureshi were not provided copies of the cipher, commonly known as the diplomatic cable at the heart of the ‘Cablegate’ affair.
The cipher, based on then-envoy Asad Majeed’s meeting with State Department official Donald Lu, is at the centre of PTI’s claim that the US conspired with elements within Pakistan to dislodge Mr Khan from office.
Mr Gill had said the cipher was hidden from Mr Khan and Mr Qureshi, and had to be “extracted”. He, however, did not elaborate who, in PTI’s view, had tried to hide it.
The allegation about withholding the cipher from top officials has previously been made a number of times by multiple PTI leaders at various levels, while Mr Khan himself – in recent public rallies – called for disclosing who the cipher was addressed to.
The FO spokesperson had earlier, in his media briefing of April 25, also rejected this accusation, but PTI has continued to stand by its claim.
“There is no question or possibility of hiding or holding back something like that. It was a cipher telegram, which is an accountable and classified document, whose handling and access are strictly in accordance with relevant cipher instructions and procedures,” the spokesman had said at the time.
He had further explained that the telegram was duly received at FO and immediately distributed to the relevant authorities.
Although the FO has insisted that the communiqué had not been hidden from the FM or the PM, it has not stated – at any stage – that the communication was officially provided to them.
Ciphers received from the missions abroad are normally of two kinds –non-circulation and normal distribution. ‘Non-circulation’ ciphers are marked to specific addressees and the sending ambassador decides who should receive it. The foreign secretary, being the head of the institution, can add recipients to the list.
The other type goes to everyone on the relevant desks at the FO.
The prime minister’s office, meanwhile, receives all cables except for non-circulation ones, and he is directly briefed by the foreign secretary on the contents of such cables.
It is believed that the cable in question was a non-circulation one, but it could not be ascertained whether or not it was addressed to the then-foreign minister.
“If the foreign minister was not included among the recipients and the foreign secretary did not mark it to the FM either, then both must have been of the view that it was a minor issue,” a former diplomat guessed, while explaining the process to Dawn.
In the latest statement, the FO spokesperson maintained: “The Foreign Office operates on professional basis and it would be detrimental to cast aspersions on its working.”

4,Fitch downgrades Pakistan’s outlook to negative,"Revision reflects significant deterioration in country’s external liquidity position, financing conditions since early 2022","ISLAMABAD: Fitch Ratings downgraded Pakistan’s outlook on Tuesday to negative from stable and affirmed its long-term foreign currency (LTFC) issuer default rating at ‘B-’ (B minus) due to deteriorating external liquidity position and difficult financing conditions.
The New York-based agency — one of the three major global rating agencies — noted a host of factors, including political risks, financial challenges following the re­v­ersal of commitments given to the Inte­r­national Monetary Fund (IMF) in Febru­ary this year and external conditions for downgrading Pakistan outlook to negative.
The outlook revision came on Tuesday ahead of the rupee losing almost Rs7 against the dollar and the benchmark stock exchange KSE-100 index falling about 980 points.
It said the revision of the outlook to neg­a­tive reflected a significant deterioration in Pakistan’s external liquidity position and financing conditions since early 2022.

Revision reflects significant deterioration in country’s external liquidity position, financing conditions since early 2022

“We assume IMF board approval of Pakistan’s new staff-level agreement with the IMF but see considerable risks to its implementation and to continued access to financing after the programme’s expiry in June 2023 in a tough economic and political climate,” Fitch Ratings said in a statement.
Highlighting political risks, the rating agency said renewed political volatility could not be excluded from the major risks and could undermine the authorities’ fiscal and external adjustment, as happened in early 2022 and 2018, particularly in the current environment of slowing growth and high inflation.
It noted that former prime minister Imran Khan, who was ousted in a no-confidence vote in April, has called on the government to hold early elections and had been organising large-scale protests in cities around the country.
“The new government is supported by a disparate coalition of parties with only a slim majority in parliament. Regular elections are due in October 2023, creating the risk of policy slippage after the conclusion of the IMF programme,” it said.
On foreign exchange reserves, it said limited external funding and large current account deficits (CADs) had drained forex reserves, as the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had used reserves to slow currency depreciation. Liquid net reserves at the SBP declined to about $10bn or just over one month of current external payments by June 2022, down from about $16bn a year earlier.
“Pakistan’s ‘B-’ rating reflects recurring external vulnerability, a narrow fiscal revenue base and low governance indicator scores compared with the ‘B’ median,” Fitch said. “External funding conditions and liquidity will likely improve with the new staff-level agreement.”
“Nevertheless, slippage against programme conditions is a risk and could quickly lead to renewed strains, while diminished foreign exchange reserves and high funding needs now leave less room for error,” it said, adding that Pakistan’s access to market finance could remain constrained.
The rating agency anticipated the fiscal deficit narrowing to 5.6pc of GDP (about Rs4.6 trillion or $22bn) in the current fiscal year from 7.5pc of GDP (about Rs5tr last fiscal year), which it said had deteriorated because of tax reductions and subsidies on fuel and electricity introduced by the previous government in February and lasted until June.
For the current year, Fitch’s forecast of the fiscal deficit is about 1pc of GDP, wider than the government’s budget target.
Fitch said its forecast of average inflation of 19pc in FY23 and 8pc in FY24 largely reflected base effects, but recent and planned future energy price hikes would all fuel broad-based inflation and mean inflation was skewed to the upside.
It said the economy had overheated last year, mostly driven by private consumption, largely reflecting a loosening of fiscal policy in FY22, as well as a fairly loose monetary policy despite significant tightening throughout the year.
“The SBP estimates that the economy was operating above potential in FY22, and we forecast slower growth of 3.5pc in FY23 amid fiscal and monetary tightening, high imported inflation, and a weaker external demand outlook, all of which will also hit household and business confidence,” it said.
Fitch estimated the CAD at $17bn (4.6pc of GDP) in the fiscal year ended June 2022, driven by soaring global oil prices and a rise in non-oil imports boosted by strong private consumption. Fiscal tightening, higher interest rates, measures to limit energy consumption and imports underpin the forecast of a narrowing CAD to $10bn (2.6pc of GDP) in FY23.
Noting large funding needs, the rating agency estimated public debt maturities in FY23 at about $21bn. Maturities of about $9bn are to bilateral creditors (chiefly Saudi Arabia and China), which should be fairly easy to roll over with an IMF programme in place. Much of the $5bn in debt to commercial banks is also to China.
“Staff-level agreement will potentially unlock $4bn in IMF disbursements to Pakistan in FY23, assuming board approval of a $1bn augmentation and extension to June 2023,” Fitch said.
