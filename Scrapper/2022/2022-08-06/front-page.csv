0,Call to guard parliament against ‘institutional overreach’,"Law minister endorses Raza Rabbani's stance, who says parliament's not public limited company that its proceedings can be stayed.","ISLAMABAD: Law Minister and Leader of the House in Senate Azam Nazeer Tarar said on Friday parliament must be defended against the overreach of the judiciary and other institutions.
Mr Tarar was speaking in the Senate to endorse the position taken by former Senate chairman and PPP stalwart Raza Rabbani, who expressed alarm over “continued interference in the parliament’s domain”.
Mr Rabbani regretted that parliamentary panels’ chairpersons were served notices and directions given by committees were stayed. In this regard, he mentioned a recent notice issued to the National Assembly speaker.
He said this transgression of the trichotomy of powers enshrined in the Constitution was a serious issue, stressing that parliament was a sovereign institution.
“Parliament is not a public company that its proceedings could be stayed,” he remarked.

Rabbani says parliament not a public limited company that its proceedings can be stayed; Senate urges world community to review engagement with India

He said proceedings of the parliamentary committee were part of the procedure of parliament and were covered under Article 69 of the Constitution.
He said it was in this context he had suggested a meeting of all the former Senate chairpersons and National Assembly speakers to come up with a reasonable way forward.
Mr Rabbani asked Law Minister Tarar to include the issue in the agenda of a joint session so that the opinion of the entire parliament could be sought.
‘Economy on path to recovery’ 
Earlier, criticising the PTI for playing politics on the economy, Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Dr Aisha Ghous Pasha said the country’s economy was well on the path to recovery as the incumbent government had successfully managed to curtail the ever-increasing imports.
Responding to a calling attention notice by PTI Senator Mohsin Aziz, she said the “financially imprudent” policies of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government had ruined the economy, sending the current account deficit to an all-time high last fiscal year.
In contrast, she said, the PML-N-led government had significantly reduced the import bill by taking prudent measures.
She said when the incumbent government took over in April, the country had no money to buy fuel for generating electricity as the government wanted to minimise outages.
This was one of the major factors that sent the import bill soaring and resulted in a 23 per cent depreciation in the rupee’s value against the US dollar, she said, adding that 12pc of the drop was due to the increase in interest rates by the US government. She claimed that the local currency lost 24pc of its value during the PTI’s tenure.
In his calling attention notice, Mr Aziz slammed the government for shrinking exports, the rupee’s devaluation and policies “that led to the closure of around 40 textile mills”.
He also chided the government for lifting a ban on the import of cat and dog food and cosmetics and delay in the appointment of the central bank’s governor and claimed that inflation had reached an alarming level of 35pc.
‘India disregarding humanitarian laws’
The Senate also unanimously passed a resolution urging the international community to review its engagement with India, which is disregarding international humanitarian laws and resolutions on the Kashmir dispute.
The resolution, moved by Mr Tarar, asked the government to re-energise diplomatic efforts to highlight the Kashmir dispute at the United Nations Human Rights Council.
The resolution strongly rejected India’s illegal and unilateral actions of Aug 5, 2019, which directly violated the UN Security Council’s (UNSC) resolutions and were aimed at changing the demographic structure of Indian-held Kashmir, suppressing the realisation of the inalienable right to self-determination of Kashmiris as well as violating their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.
Condemning Indian atrocities, including extra-judicial killings and demolishing homes and private properties as a form of collective punishment in the occupied territory, the resolution deplored change in the status of the Urdu language associated with Kashmiri Muslims and their identity.
It demanded that the Kashmir dispute be resolved according to the aspirations of the Kashmiri people and UNSC’s resolutions.

1,Imran to be lone PTI player on nine vacant NA seats,ECP announces Sept 25 by-polls on seats vacated after acceptance of 11 PTI lawmakers’ resignations.,"ISLAMABAD: Just hours after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) announced the schedule for by-elections on nine general seats of the National Assembly, former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan — in a bid to set a record — announced his candidature on all nine seats in the Sept 25 elections.
The nine seats are among the 11 vacated after acceptance of resignations of PTI MNAs by the National Assembly speaker, and their de-notification, last week.
The announcement that Mr Khan will contest from all nine constituencies first came from PTI’s official Twitter account, and was later confirmed by the party’s Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry while speaking at a press conference.

 





 
The nine constituencies where by-elections will be held on Sept 25 are NA-22 Mardan, NA-24 Charsadda, NA-31 Peshawar, NA-45 Kurram, NA-108 Faisalabad, NA-118 Nankana Sahib, NA-237 Malir, NA-239 Korangi Karachi and NA-246 Karachi South.

ECP announces Sept 25 by-polls on seats vacated after acceptance of 11 PTI lawmakers’ resignations

National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf had, on July 28, accepted the resignations of 11 PTI MNAs — nine on general seats and two on reserved seats for women — sparking a controversy over piecemeal acceptance of resignations. These lawmakers were among the more than 120 who had resigned from their NA seats en masse on April 11, two days after former prime minister Imran Khan was ousted from the top office in a no-confidence vote.
The PTI leaders whose resignations were accepted and who were also de-notified as lawmakers by the ECP, included Ali Muhammad Khan, Fazal Muhammad Khan, Shaukat Ali, Fakhar Zaman Khan, Farrukh Habib, Jamil Ahmed Khan, Muhammad Akram Cheema, Abdul Shakoor Shad, Dr Shireen Mazari, Shandana Gulzar Khan and Ijaz Ahmed Shah. Dr Mazari and Shandana Khan had been elected on reserved seats for women.
During the 2018 general elections, the PTI chairman had contested elections from five constituencies and had emerged victorious on all of them. He had defeated PML-N’s Khawaja Saad Rafique in NA-131 Lahore, former premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi of the PML-N in NA-53 Islamabad, the late Syed Ali Raza Abidi of the MQM-Pakistan in NA-243, Ubaidullah Khan of the PML-N in NA-95 Mianwali and Akram Khan Durrani in NA-35 Bannu.
According to the ECP, candidates could submit their nomination papers between Aug 10 and 13, which would be scrutinised by Aug 17, while election symbols would be issued to the candidates on Aug 29. The last date to decide appeals against the acceptance and rejection of nomination papers, by the appellate tribunal, is Aug 25.
Mr Khan’s announcement to contest the by-polls on all nine seats has startled many, with some commentators questioning if the PTI chairman could not find any other suitable candidate and the expenses to be incurred on the subsequent by-elections should Mr Khan win multiple seats and quits all but one.
Talking to Dawn, Fafen representative Mudassir Rizvi said the Constitution provided for by-elections to be held within a certain time-frame after a seat fell vacant, as well as allowing a candidate to contest on multiple seats but retain just one, in case the nominee wins from multiple constituencies.
“That way our Constitution also allows state funds to be incurred on political ambitions of political leaders and parties. In just one constituency only, the kind of staff required, number of polling stations and booths set up, and at least a couple of thousand election staff involved, the expenses run into millions each time.”
Moreover, in case a candidate contests by-polls or general elections from multiple constituencies, the leader is just trying to prove his popularity.

2,"Miftah gives banks tax relief, import curbs to remain",Says banks won’t have to pay higher tax rates for maintaining a low advances-to-deposits ratio on their earnings from 2021.,"KARACHI: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said on Friday banks won’t have to pay higher tax rates for maintaining a low advances-to-deposits ratio (ADR) on their earnings from 2021.
Speaking at a gong-ringing ceremony at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Mr Ismail said that contrary to the “assumption” among banks, the increased tax rates wouldn’t be imposed retrospectively.
“We’ve spoken to the banks. We’re correcting that mistake. The special tax on (the basis of) ADR won’t be applied retrospectively,” he said while directly addressing at least three bank presidents who were present in the trading hall of the PSX.
Through the latest Finance Act, the government increased the tax rates on the interest income that banks earn on their investments in treasury bills as well as Islamic and conventional bonds.
The government notified in the Finance Act different rates based on the banks’ ADRs — an indicator that shows loans as a percentage of deposits. A low ADR means the bank is being complacent by loaning out a smaller chunk of its deposits. Such banks then park disproportionately higher portions of their liquidity in risk-free sovereign papers and earn profits effortlessly.
In contrast, a high ADR means the bank is giving out a larger share of its deposits in the shape of advances and promoting economic activity.
The Finance Act increased the tax rates on investment income from 35pc to 39pc for banks maintaining ADRs of 50pc or higher. The rate went up from 37.5pc to 49pc for lenders having ADRs in the range of 40pc and 50pc. Banks with less than 40pc ADRs will have to pay this tax at the rate of 55pc.
“Banks that have announced their financial results for the April-June quarter already incorporated the higher tax rates on a retrospective basis,” JS Global Head of Research Amreen Soorani told Dawn on Friday.
For example, Habib Bank Ltd posted consolidated earnings of Rs3.49 billion in the April-June quarter, down 63pc from a year ago. This decline was because of the increased super tax rate to 10pc and “retrospective implementation of the increased tax rate on low ADR maintenance”, Syed Noman Ahmed of Insight Securities wrote in a research note after holding a conference call with the bank officials.
Focus on export promotion
With regard to the macro-economic situation, the finance minister said he planned to curb imports for the next quarter, although the restrictions would slow down the pace of economic growth.
He said he didn’t believe in the import substitution model, which seeks to replace foreign imports with domestic production.
“I think we should focus solely on the export promotion model,” he said while referring to the economic theory that favours increased participation in international trade by allocating greater resources to the export-oriented sectors without creating price distortions in the economy.
He said the depreciation in the rupee’s value was a result of dollar outflows in the shape of import payments consistently outpacing the dollar inflows.
“We have to control the budget deficit this year,” he said, adding that the average yearly budgetary gap in the five years of the PML-N’s last government was Rs1.6 trillion versus the annual average of Rs3.5tr during the last four years.
“No country can grow and be stable with this kind of current account deficit,” he said.
According to Dawn.com, Mr Ismail said he believed the tax imposed on small traders had been “very adequate and good”. “We were asking for just Rs3,000 on a bill of Rs30,000. No shopkeeper earns less than Rs100,000 per month. Salaried people earning that amount pay more,” he said.
The finance minister said he had promised specific payments to the International Monetary Fund. “We will absolutely make sure if there is any loss of revenue, we will cover [it]... there’s a loss to the revenue of about Rs7bn.”

3,Military slams ‘regretful campaign’ in wake of chopper crash,"Says he called “hundreds of families”, attended funerals and visited them to offer condolences.","• ISPR says ‘hurtful comments’ from some quarters unacceptable
• ‘Deep anguish’ among martyrs’ families, army’s rank and file
• Alvi calls controversy on why he didn’t attend funeral unnecessary
ISLAMABAD: The country’s armed forces and the families of martyred security personnel have expressed “deep anguish” over what the military spokesperson called a “regretful social media campaign” after the recent helicopter crash in which six army officials, including a lieutenant general, embraced martyrdom.
Also, President Arif Alvi in a series of tweets on late Friday night wrote: “There is unnecessary controversy on why I did not attend Janaza of the Shaheeds recently. This gives me an opportunity to condemn in unequivocal terms the despicable tweets by those who are neither aware of our culture or our religion.” 
He said he called “hundreds of families”, attended funerals and visited them to offer condolences. 

 





 
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “certain insensitive quarters” resorted to hurtful and derogatory comments on social media, which was “unacceptable”. 
“The regretful social media campaign after the unfortunate helicopter crash on Aug 1 has caused deep anguish and distress among shuhada (martyrs’) families and rank and file of the armed forces,” the ISPR stated in a press release issued on Friday.  
“While the whole nation stood with the institution in this difficult time, certain insensitive quarters resorted to hurtful and derogatory comments on social media, which was unacceptable and highly condemnable,” it added.
ISPR Director General Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar later told Geo News that the way “this happens on social media, we have to look into this and reject such elements involved in it”. He said: “We can do this collectively. That was why we issued a press release, as it was important to highlight this matter. This has to be condemned at every level.”  
The wreckage of the army helicopter, which went missing during relief operations in flood-hit areas of Balochistan on the night of Aug 1, was found near in Lasbela district the following day. Corps Commander Lt Gen Sarfaraz Ali, Brig Amjad Hanif, Brig Mohammad Khalid, Major Saeed Ahmed, Major M. Talha Manan and Naik Mudassar Fayyaz were on board the Mi-17 helicopter of Army Aviation.
Over the past few months, Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa has also been targeted on social media.
It was claimed on social media that Lt Gen Ali’s family had Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan from attending his funeral. Strongly condemning the social media campaign to spread misinformation about the helicopter crash, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry told a presser that Mr Khan had visited Lt Gen Ali’s residence to condole his death. 
Whoever was involved in the campaign over this tragedy must be condemned, a PTI spokesperson said.
‘Pakistani soil not used for Zawahiri killing’
Mr Chaudhry also demanded to know whether Pakistan’s air space had been used by the US for a recent drone strike that killed Al Qaeda chief Ayman al Zawahiri. “The nation wants to know whether we are again going to become a tool of the United States against Al Qaeda,” he questioned.
However, the military spokesperson ruled out the possibility, saying there was no question of Pakistan soil being used for “such a purpose”.
“The Foreign Office has clarified it in detail. They are all rumours, as anybody can write anything on social media. We should avoid this. Our enemy, in particular, feeds such information and they (people) get exploited,” the DG ISPR told the TV channel.
‘Dissolve assemblies in a month’
At the presser, Mr Chaudhry warned the government that his party was launching a campaign against the government within 48 hours to pressure the ruling coalition to hold the next general election without any delay. “Our next line of action will start in 48 hours,” he added.
“We are staging a big public gathering in Islamabad after two days where the party will give a deadline to the government for the announcement of general election,” he said, adding that it would be disastrous for the country and its economy if the “imported government” was given more time. He also asked the government to dissolve the assemblies within a month.
Mr Chaudhry criticised the Election Commission of Pakistan for “fulfilling the wishes” of the ruling PML-N and its ally PPP.
Responding to a question, he said there was no question of the acceptance of resignations of 11 PTI lawmakers by National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf when former deputy speaker Qasim Suri had “already accepted their resignations in April”.

4,"Wrestlers Mohammad Inam, Zaman Anwar bag silver as sprinter Shajar Abbas reaches 200m final","Pakistan loses out on gold as India's Deepak Punja defeats Inam in final, Zaman outdone by  Canada’s Amarveer Dhesi.","BIRMINGHAM: Pakistan’s wrestling team had two golds within its reach at the Commonwealth Games on Friday. In the end, they had only two silver medals to show for their efforts.
After the country’s leading hope Mohammad Inam faltered in the much-hyped Indo-Pak clash for the +86kg title, Zaman Anwar was pinned in the +125kg final at the Coventry Arena.
Their silver medals added to the bronze won in the ring by compatriot Inayatullah earlier in the +65kg competition, increasing Pakistan’s medal tally to five so far at the Games.
There might be another medal for Pakistan on Saturday if Shajar Abbas makes it to the podium in the men’s 200m final. The 22-year-old sprinter booked his spot in the final after a third-place finish in his semi-final at the Alexander Stadium on Friday.
Weightlifter Nooh Dastagir Butt has delivered the only gold for Pakistan and there were high hopes that Inam would add another winners’ medal.
But the 33-year-old, who was imperious at the previous edition of the Games in Australia, couldn’t repeat that feat when he lost 3-0 to Indian rival Deepak Punia in the final.
Inam looked far from his best throughout the duel against Punia, 10 years his junior, as he was booked for passivity early before the Indian successfully pushed his opponent out of the ring to take a 2-0 lead.
Both wrestlers were largely defensive in the bout but Inam did make a last effort to make a comeback despite clearly gasping for breath, only for Punia to easily thwart the same and get on top of him.
Inam had won his opening quarter-final bout against Australian Jayden Lawrence on points (8-3) before recording a come-from-behind 5-3 semi-final win over Edward Lessing of South Africa.
Zaman was easily outdone by Canada’s Amarveer Dhesi in their final. Dhesi raced into a 7-0 lead and after Zaman had clawed back two points, the Canadian pinned him down to win the gold.
It was anticlimax for Zaman, who had pinned both his opponents enroute to the final — first winning against Kensley Anthony Marie in the quarters before overwhelming home hope Mandhir Kooner in their last-four clash.
Inayat was the only Pakistan wrestler who failed to make the final.
Inayat won by technical superiority against Malta’s Adam Vella in the round-of-16 and then won on points against Nigerian Amas Daniel but went pointless during his semi-final loss against Lachlan McNeil of Canada.
He, however, rebounded in the bronze medal match and triumphed by technical superiority against Scotland’s Ross Connelly.
On the track, Shajar did not disappoint. With the top two in each of the three semi-finals advancing alongside the two who posted the best times, the 22-year-old made it through in the latter category after clocking 20.89 seconds.
Earlier at the National Exhibition Centre Hall, Pakistan’s table tennis hope Fahad Khawaja made a storming start to his round-of-32 singles tie against sixth-seeded Paul Drinkhall of England.
Fahad won four of the first five points of the match but never hand an answer when Drinkhall found his range, losing 6-11, 5-11, 3-11, 4-11.
At the University of Birmingham Squash centre, Pakistan’s campaign came to an end with Nasir Iqbal and Tayyab Aslam losing their doubles round-of-16 tie against Scottish second seeds Greg Lobban and Rory Stewart.
Having lost the first game 4-11, Nasir and Tayyab levelled the match when they won the second 11-10 but the Lobban and Stewart secured progress when they won the deciding game 11-3.

5,FIA constitutes team to oversee PTI funding probe,"Probe is being conducted under Political Parties Order, 2002; IHC seeks FIA response to harassment allegation by PTI staff.","ISLAMABAD: The Fed­eral Investigation Agency (FIA) on Friday constituted a five-member team to supervise the inquiry teams of FIA’s respective zones probing into the matter pertaining to the Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan (ECP) order in Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) ‘prohibited’ funding case.
Headed by FIA director Mohammad Athar Waheed, the FIA monitoring team would be responsible for coordination with and guidance to the respective inquiry teams in each zone, according to a notification issued by FIA’s economic crime wing director.
The FIA team was notified just a few days after a three-member ECP bench in a unanimous verdict ruled that the PTI received prohibited funding in the case pending since 2014.
As per the FIA notification, the probe is being conducted under Section 6 of Political Parties Order, 2002. FIA’s additional director Khalid Anees, deputy director Khawaja Hammad, Chaudhary Ijaz Ahmed and assistant director Ijaz Ahmed Sheikh will be members of the team that has been tasked with supervising the ongoing enquiries into PTI’s funding case.

Court seeks FIA response to harassment allegation by party’s staff

PTI staff plea against ‘harassment’ 
Also on Friday, the lower staff of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) filed a petition before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against an inquiry initiated by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) over the alleged collection of foreign funding.
The PTI’s financial board in 2011 authorised four employees of the party’s central secretariat —telephone operator (Tahir Iqbal), computer operator (Mohammad Nauman Afzal), accountant (Mohammad Arshad) and PTI’s office helper (Mohammad Rafiq) — were allowed to receive funds from within Pakistan and abroad in their personal accounts, according to the Election Commission of Pakistan. 
In their petition, Iqbal, Arshad and Rafiq moved through their counsel Shah Khawar before acting chief justice of the IHC Justice Aamer Farooq, the PTI staff alleged that FIA inspector Rehana Kausar started harassing them after Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah at a press conference announced registration of case against the employees.

While terming it mala fide on part of the investigation agency, the counsel argued that notices were issued to his clients at midnight after the minister’s presser and requested the court to set aside the notices.
Justice Farooq, however, issued notice to the FIA and sought reply till August 10.
According to PTI’s founding member Akbar S. Babar, who was the complainant in the foreign funding case, a sum of Rs11.104 million was deposited in the employees’ accounts, which was beyond their known sources of income. In 2016 and 2017, Mr Babar had written to the authorities for initiating an inquiry into the matter but the previous PML-N government didn’t pay heed to it then.
As for the account details, the PTI’s telephone operator received Rs4.715 million in his account when his monthly income was Rs28,000. PTI’s accountant received Rs840,000 and Rs959,000 in two accounts he operated while he was earning Rs42,000 a month. The office helper, Rafiq, received a sum of Rs4.725m whereas his monthly income was Rs23,000. In another account, Rs2.379 million was deposited.

6,SC wonders if Imran can assail NAB laws after quitting NA,CJP says court to consider public interest while deciding PTI chief’s plea against amendments to Nab law.,"• CJP says court to consider public interest while deciding PTI chief’s plea against amendments to NAO             • Justice Ahsan asks if self-serving law can be made to give amnesty
ISLAMABAD: Chief Jus­tice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial on Friday obser­ved that the court, while deciding about the accountability laws, will look into public interest to strike a balance by protecting those who act in a bona fide manner than those who misappropriate public funds and amass properties or pursue other interests out of extraneous and illegal considerations.
There is no question that accountability of people exercising public authority is fundamental to good governance, but it has to be considered how the economy was harmed due to fear on the part of civil servants of the National Account­ability Ordinance (NAO) and prolonging decision-making by avoiding fundamental decisions in time and leaving it for the cabinet to decide, the CJP regretted. He also observed that accountability laws have been used as an instrument of persecution.
CJP Bandial was heading a three-judge Supreme Court bench that had taken up a challenge to the recent amendments to the NAO, moved by PTI chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan through his counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed.
On Friday, the court asked senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan, who represented the federal government, as well as Mr Haris to furnish concise statements before the next hearing on Aug 19.
When asked by the court if there was a study to gauge the effects of the NAO on the economy, Mr Khan replied in the negative, saying there were observations of the court itself, and emphasised that failure to draw a line had paralysed the economy. The counsel also emphasised that the petitioner needed to show bona fide in challenging the NAO amendments when they promulgated a presidential ordinance during their tenure in this regard but were now challenging the same.
The counsel also questioned how the 33-page observations made by President Dr Arif Alvi on the amendments were leaked to the petitioner when the president represented unity of the state. “We would like to know what the observations of the president were when the previous PTI government itself made such amendments through ordinances twice or thrice. They are challenging their own acts,” the CJP wondered.
CJP Bandial recalled how the apex court entertained direct petitions under Article 184(3) or by taking suo motu notices on financial matters, but that ended up adversely affecting the country, as in the Reko Diq or Pakistan Steel Mills cases.
The real danger behind entertaining such petitions under Article 184(3) on a wholesale basis was the temptation of converting courts into the third chamber of parliament, Makhdoom Ali Khan said, adding this must be avoided. He also highlighted that courts should also see the genesis of the law, asking if the country was mired in corruption when the NAO was promulgated in 1999 and if something good happened after the advent of the law.
Presently, no businessman was willing to invest in the country, Foreign Direct Investment had dried up and the economy was in a shambles, the counsel regretted.
During the hearing, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah wondered when the petitioner walked out of the house as a parliamentarian without the consent of his constituents, what his credibility would be and if he would still have the locus standi to approach the court in the matter.
He also wondered whether the decision to come out of parliament was made at the party level, also stating that constituents could ask how members came out of parliament without their prior approval when they were sent to represent them and redress their grievances.
Khawaja Haris, however, reminded that the petitioner had resigned from parliament, but it was a different issue that the National Assembly speaker was not accepting the resignation.
Justice Ijazul Ahsan wondered if a self-serving law could be made to create amnesty, explaining that essentially a number of people had benefitted from these amendments.
“Should we continue to witness a seesaw with one government absolving itself of all charges and another undoing the same,” Justice Ahsan observed.
“We attach legality on the settled principle of the Constitution and the law,” Justice Ahsan emphasized, adding there were examples where the court had examined laws where the amendments introduced were in violation of the Constitution or took away the right or came under the category of breach of trust.
Mr Haris argued that the parliamentary form of governance blended with the Islamic provision was the salient feature of the Constitution, as laid down by the apex court in different judgements, adding when certain statutes took away the independence of the judiciary then it violated the salient features as well as the fundamental rights of the people to be governed in accordance with the law and Constitution.
The counsel also cited the example of Hazrat Umar who was subjected to questions regarding accountability.
