0,Posting of Punjab CM’s principal secy challenged,Plea filed in LHC contends that appointment of Muhammad Khan Bhatti violates Constitution.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) was moved on Friday against the appointment of Muhammad Khan Bhatti as principal secretary to Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi.
Advocate Mian Dawood filed a constitutional petition in the court on behalf of a citizen, Akhtar Ali.
It has been argued in the petition that the appointment of Mr Bhatti against the important post of CM’s principal secretary is a violation of the Constitution as per law.
According to the law, an officer serving in one service cadre cannot be posted in another.
The petitioner also said two notifications were issued for the appointment of Mr Bhatti -- first, a simple notification of transfer and posting and another about his posting on deputation.  
Both notifications were issued before Parvez Elahi was sworn in as chief minister, he stated.  
The petitioner also said that an “uneducated person” had been appointed as the head of highly-educated government officials that was unfair, requesting the court to nullify the appointment.

2,Azadi March fallout: Terror charges against PTI leaders dropped,Cases sent to sessions court,"LAHORE: An anti terrorism court (ATC) on Friday quashed terrorism charges against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders in the cases of vandalism and attacking policemen during the party’s Azadi March towards Islamabad on May 25.  
ATC judge Abhar Gul Khan hearing the cases issued directions for transfer of the cases to the sessions court after police declared the PTI leaders innocent for further hearing.  
The PTI leaders, including Hammad Azhar, Yasmin Rashid, Aslam Iqbal, Jamshed Iqbal Cheema, Musarat Cheema, Shafqat Mahmood, Mehmoodur Rasheed, Andleeb Abbas, Murad Raas, Yasir Gilani and Zubair Niazi, appeared before the court.  
Their counsel, Burhan Moazzam Malik, told the court that police had declared the PTI leaders and workers innocent in four cases registered by the last government on political grounds. He said that registering cases under terrorism charges against the political leaders was against democracy and the Constitution as the terrorism laws were devised to frame the terrorists, not political leaders.  

Cases sent to sessions court

The investigating officer submitted before the court that terrorism charges were removed from the four cases registered with Gulberg, Bhati Gate, Shafiqabad and Shahdara police stations as the PTI leaders were found to be innocent. He said that PTI members booked in the four cases did not have any role in the charges levelled against them in the cases and none of them were required to be arrested in these cases. Subsequently, as many as 20 PTI leaders withdrew their bail petitions.  
The court directed to remove the terrorism charges from the cases and transferred the cases to sessions court for further hearing.  
Three days ago, Shafqat Mahmood had met Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Ghulam Mahmood Dogar to discuss the cases against the PTI workers and instances of illegal police action during the ‘Azadi March’.  
He also tweeted “Had a meeting with CCPO Lahore yesterday to discuss the issue of fake cases against PTI workers and instances of illegal police action during Azadi march.”  
The PTI had marched on Islamabad on May 25 for, what it called ‘haqeeqi azadi’ to demand new general election, following the party chief Imran Khan’s ouster as the prime minister through a no-confidence vote in April.  
The march was preceded by the authorities invoking Section 144, a measure used to curb gatherings. Shipping containers were placed on the major thoroughfares to block their path.  
The marchers, who tried to force through the containers to make their way to Islamabad, faced teargas as police tried to disperse them. Police had also charged at them with batons.

The woman was travelling to Multan from Rawalpindi on coach No-8 of the train when two male passengers started teasing and leaving her with no option but to complain to the rail police officials on the train, a spokesman for the railway police told Dawn.

Addressing a press conference the JI Emir Sirajul Haq, flanked by secretary general Ameerul Azim and information secretary Qaisar Sharif, at Mansoorah, said the government had crossed “all limits of injustice and cruelty”.
A household, he deplored, received Rs12,000 monthly bill against power consumption worth Rs4,000. The government, he said, added over 60 per cent amount in the bill in the form of various taxes.  
“We demand the government to withdraw all the taxes included in electricity bills before Aug 12.”
The protest demonstration, he said, would be held all over the country next Friday, appealing the masses to stand up for their rights and ensure full participation in the agitation under the JI banner.
He warned the government that the JI would expand the protest movement if people were not provided relief in their power bills.  
Mr Haq said the people must know their miseries won’t come to an end without launching a struggle.  
People, he said, should no longer become a scapegoat to pay the cost of the luxuries being enjoyed by the ruling elite. The feudal lords and mafias were looting the country’s resources with both hands, without considering the miseries of the people, he added.
He regretted that in a country where 80 per cent population lacked access to even clean drinking water and millions of children were out of school due to poverty, there was no bar to “protocol culture” and extravagance of ministers and bureaucrats at the expense of state. Why the public was forced to pay the cost of the free electricity and fuel facilities available to the ruling class, he questioned.
The JI emir blamed the PTI, the PDM and the PPP for destroying the country and damaging every institution. The ruling parties, he said, stood badly exposed now, having nothing to their credit except loot and plunder. The JI would continue its struggle for the people’s rights, he added.  
To a question, he said, political parties should accept the court verdicts by rising above the personal liking and disliking. He said the three main political parties had always been seeking “backing of the establishment” to come into power.

According to the Pakistan Railways, the goods train coming from Lahore was near the Khanpur Railway Station when its bogies derailed. As the speed was low, the bogies did not overturn but the track remained closed for traffic.  
The derailment occurred due to the alleged negligence of the cabin man who could not divert the train on the other track.  
Khanpur is considered dangerous for train derailments as many such incidents had occurred during the last few years.  
Khanpur station master Muhammad Arbi told Dawn the incident occurred at 7am. As a result of the incident, he said, Sir Syed Express and Karachi Express were halted at the Liaquatpur and Dera Nawab railway stations.  
Later, a relief train arrived at Khanpur and technical staff cleared the track from the derailed bogies and diverted the bogies to the other track, which took half an hour.  
Sir Syed Express and Karachi Express departed for their destinations after a 45 minutes delay, Mr Arbi said.

6,By-poll in NA-157: PTI workers protest candidature of Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s daughter,Demonstration held in Multan; seat was vacated by Qureshi's son who won recently held by-poll in PP-217 constituency.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers held a protest demonstration in Multan on Friday against the party’s vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi for giving a party ticket to his daughter Meher Bano Qureshi as a candidate for the by-election in NA-157. 
The constituency was vacated by his son, Zain Qureshi, who contested in Punjab Assembly’s PP-217 as MPA and defeated the PML-N’s candidate Salman Naeem in the recently held by-election. 
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has released the schedule for the by-poll in NA-157 Multan, PP-139 Sheikhupura and PP-241 Bahawalnagar to be held on Sept 11 while Aug 5 was announced as the last date for submitting the nomination forms. 
More than 18 candidates, including Meher Bano Qureshi, former prime minister and Senator Yusuf Raza Gilani’s son Syed Ali Musa Gilani, Engineer Waseem Abbas and Saifur Rahman Qureshi, have submitted their nomination papers for the by-poll in the NA 157. 
The constituency is considered a stronghold and home seat of Shah Mahmood Qureshi. Musa Gilani also won the seat in the 2012 by-election. 
A large number of PTI workers led by the party’s local leader Engineer Waseem Abbas lodged a protest outside the ECP office in Multan against Mr Qureshi and his family for promoting dynastic politics in the party. The workers were chanting slogans and carrying banners and placards inscribed with slogans against Mr Qureshi and his family. They said Shah Mehmood Qureshi had fielded his son Zain in PP-217 Multan and now he had given the ticket to his daughter.  
“Did Mr Qureshi not see any other candidate to contest the by-election,” they questioned. 
PTI local leader Waseem Abbas said the PTI was launched under a slogan to challenge dynastic politics and the workers would not allow turning the party into a conventional and dynastic party. 
He said he had requested the party chairman Imran Khan to give him a ticket to contest the by-election for NA-157. 
“I will contest the election as an independent candidate if I don’t get a party ticket,” he declared. 
About her candidature, Meher Bano Qureshi tweeted on Friday, “Since announcing my candidacy for by-election in #NA157, I have come across so many spreading fake news, doctored images and posters and attributing false statements to me. I wonder if it would have been different had I been a man. Anyhow, happy to work hard and prove myself”. 

 





 
In an audio statement, shared on her twitter account, she argued that “the PTI and my father selected me (for the by-election), against the traditions of my family, to keep the narrative of Imran Khan alive. I am not just a voter of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf but I have remained connected with the party and worked along its social media team since 2018”. 

 





 
A twitter user, criticising her candidature, said, “As a staunch PTI supporter, I really respect and admire your dad SMQ. But I am totally against dynastic politics.” 
Ms Qureshi replying to the user said “I respect your opinion but I was selected by my halqa (constituency) to fight this election. I wasn’t given a party position or leadership. This isn’t a reserved seat. I have to fight for it. This is a very tough election but I will fight to keep my Kaptaan’s vision alive”. 

 





 
Pro-PTI analysts and party supporters criticised Imran Khan’s decision of allotting a ticket to Meher Bano and called it hypocrisy. Some of them tweeted that they were clueless as to why Mr Khan, who has been raising a voice against dynastic politics in Pakistan, would give a ticket to Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s daughter. They also criticised Meher Bano Qureshi for taking advantage of her father’s position in the party.  
“Workers are only for Zindabad Murdabad. Tickets are for baap, baita and baiti (father, son and daughter),” a twitter user commented. Others wondered why three seats in an area (Multan) would be occupied by the members of the same family.  
On Thursday night, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, addressing a press conference to introduce his daughter’s candidature, said the PTI had decided to field Meher Bano Qureshi for the NA-157 by-poll.  
“There are rules for all political parties to field 5pc women.” When asked if he was promoting dynastic politics, he claimed the party had sought opinion from the party workers in NA-157 who supported her. 
In 2018 general election, PTI Zain Qureshi had won the NA-157 by securing more than 77,000 votes and his opponent, the PPP’s Ali Musa Gilani, had got around 70,000 votes.

It sabotaged regional peace by intruding into the state of Kashmir and peace was also compromised by hatching a conspiracy in Palestine. He said Kashmir is a jugular vein and Pakistan was incomplete without it.
Speaking at the Kashmir Exploitation Day event at the Chief Minister Secretariat on Friday, Mr Elahi said former prime minister Imran Khan vigorously projected the core Kashmir issue at international forums and paid tribute to him for effectively highlighting the Kashmir issue at the UN General Assembly.  
He said Pakistan had a deep-rooted relationship with Kashmiris and their just struggle for the liberation of India-held Kashmir would continue. He lamented that India had gone to every limit in its continued state-sponsored oppression in Occupied Kashmir. Now, he said, even Indian organisations had stood up against the oppression of the Kashmiris.
The chief minister stressed that important member countries of the OIC should play their full role in the resolution of the Kashmir conflict. “Until we do not do something ourselves, no one will come to our help,” he remarked.
Mr Elahi said voices were raised, all over the world, about the worst lockdown in India-held Kashmir and added that the voice was also raised in the British parliament on the Kashmir issue. He said the time was not far when occupied Kashmir would be liberated.
The chief minister said Hurriyat leader Yasin Malik made immense sacrifices in the freedom struggle. He said Mr Malik was being treated inhumanely in jail and he was not given the right to a fair trial.  
Mr Malik is on hunger strike in jail and his condition is deteriorating. He said it was extreme cruelty that people were forced to come out of their homes and shot at in India-held Kashmir. In some places, he said, the Indian army had refused to fire on innocent people and international organizations were also concerned about the situation.  
He said Turkiye and Pakistan had raised their strong voices on the Kashmir issue and paid tributes to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoan.
The chief minister said the whole of Pakistan was with the Kashmiris in their struggle for the freedom of occupied Kashmir. He said Pakistan would not back down in the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiris and support the Kashmiris till success was not achieved.
Hurriyat leader Engr Mushtaq Ahmad Shah also addressed the event.
Health minister-designate Dr Yasmin Rashid, Kashmiri Hurriyat leader Imtiaz Iqbal Wani, President of Overseas Pakistanis in Scotland Shabbir Shah, additional chief secretary, additional chief secretary (home), information secretary, deputy commissioner Lahore and others attended the ceremony.

10,PHA plans planting 0.5m saplings in a year,"LAHORE: Lahore is set to have a plantation of 500,000 new saplings of various species by the Parks and Horticulture...","LAHORE: Lahore is set to have a plantation of 500,000 new saplings of various species by the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) by the next year’s monsoon. The authority has, so far, planted over 120,000 saplings at several spots in the city.  
“Every sapling planted in during the drives will have the PHA records (number, growth etc) through geotagging,” said PHA Director General Omer Jahangir while presiding over a meeting here on Friday.  
“Geotagging will be used to monitor the location of the plants and the maintenance,” he added.   
According to an official source, the PHA, since 2018, claims to have planted as many 1.8m saplings, including local fruit and other indigenous trees, out of which about 10pc died due to various reasons.  
“The number included 200,000 that were distributed free of cost among the public at large so as the people could plant them in their streets, houses and other open spaces under the drive titled ‘Plant a Tree’,” the official said and added that the authorities seeking cutting of trees for development projects (roads, underpasses, flyovers etc) are required to plant 20 trees against one lost tree under a policy. He said the PHA also plans to develop another 30 Miyawaki forests in the city to take the total number of such forests beyond 100.  
It may be mentioned Lahore lost over 3,000 grown-up trees besides shrubs, bushes and grass due to development projects, including 620 trees and herbs cut down due to Orange Line metro train and about 1,300 trees for the Canal Road widening project. 
As many as 1,700 grown trees are also likely to be cut down for the expressway project from Gulberg to the motorway as Usman Buzdar-led government in Punjab had revived this project and Parvez Elahi-led government is also thinking to start construction of this project soon.  
The Lahore High Court last year, on a writ petition filed by Judicial Water Commission chairman retired Justice Ali Akbar Qureshi, stopped the authority from cutting down trees. Later in another order, the court ordered the authorities to impose a heavy fine on those involved in cutting of trees unnecessarily. 
“Felling trees in Lahore is crime now and the amount of fine on cutting down one tree is Rs500,000,” the official said.

According to Rescue 1122 officials, the fire allegedly erupted due to power short circuit. This was the second fire incident in the area within a few months. 
The officials claimed that timely response by the Rescue 1122 firefighters saved about 150 other shops from being reduced to ashes, but the claim was rejected by the traders. 
Pattoki Landa Bazaar traders association president Arshad Bhatti and Anjuman-i-Taijran local head expressed their disappointment over the “poor performance” of the Rescue 1122 and local administration. 
They told the local media that the firefighters reached the spot late despite being informed immediately about the incident, while the fire-engines ran out of water during the operation and it took them considerable time to extinguish the fire because of this glitch. 
However, District Emergency Officer Sultan Mahmood told Dawn that the firefighters responded within 14 minutes of the incident, while vehicles had to be also called from Phoolnagar, Chunian, Renala tehsils and from Okara as well for the operation.  
He lamented that the traders had not taken any safety measures to avert fire incidents on their own. 
According to Rescue 1122, there was no loss of life reported in the incident, while as per traders’ estimates they suffered losses to the tune of Rs25 million because of the fire. Police were looking into the matter. 
The land where the second-hand clothes market was set up, without the permission of the local administration, is located in the heart of the city and said to be owned by a private person. 
Sources said the local administration never bothered to check the illegal market comprising hundreds of shops.
