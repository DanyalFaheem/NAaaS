0,Western Mediterranean hit by ‘exceptional’ heatwave: experts,Experts say the persistently hotter-than-normal temperatures in the Mediterranean pose a threat to the entire marine ecosystem.,"AJACCIO: An  “exceptional” marine heatwave is gripping the western Mediterranean with surface temperatures up to five degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than average, according to experts.
Although the record-breaking heatwave that baked northern Europe and Britain this month has subsided, the experts said the persistently hotter-than-normal temperatures in the Mediterranean posed a threat to the entire marine ecosystem.
“This huge marine heatwave began in May in the Ligurian sea” between Corsica and Italy, said Karina von Schuckmann, an oceanographer at the non-profit research group Mercator Ocean International. It then spread to the Gulf of Taranto in the Ionian Sea, she said.
By July, the heatwave had engulfed the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, and the Tyrrhenian Sea.
“The surface temperature anomaly map shows higher than normal values, in the order of +4 to +5C from the east of the Balearic Islands to the east of Corsica,” Mercator said in a statement.
While humans might find the warmer water temperatures pleasant in the tourist hotspots of the western Mediterranean, the group warned that  “ocean warming impacts the entire ecosystem.”  “It is important to be aware of the possible consequences for local fauna and flora, as well as the occurrence of extreme weather events that could result in natural disasters,” it said. Von Schuckmann said that unusually warm temperatures could cause irreversible migration for some species and  “mass die-offs” for others.
She noted knock-on effects for industries such as tourism and fishing which rely on favourable water conditions. According to the UN’s climate science body, marine heatwaves have already doubled in frequency globally since 1980.

1,North Korean leader says ‘ready to mobilise’ nuclear weapons,Kim Jong Un says country’s armed forces “thoroughly prepared” for any crisis.,"SEOUL: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country was  “ready to mobilise” its nuclear deterrent in any future military clash with the United States and South Korea, state media said on Thursday.
Washington and Seoul have repeatedly warned that Pyongyang is preparing to carry out its seventh nuclear test — a move that the United States has warned would provoke a  “swift and forceful” response.
In Kim’s latest speech to mark the armistice that ended fighting in the Korean War — known as  “Victory Day” in the North — he said the country’s armed forces were  “thoroughly prepared” for any crisis.
“Our country’s nuclear war deterrent is also ready to mobilise its absolute power faithfully, accurately and promptly in accordance with its mission,” Kim said in a speech on Wednesday, according to Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency.
Speaking to war veterans on the 69th anniversary of the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, Kim emphasised the country’s  “thorough readiness” to  “deal with any military clash with the United States”.
His latest threats come as South Korea and the United States move to ramp up joint military exercises, which have always infuriated the North as Pyongyang considers them rehearsals for invasion.
This week, the US military held live-fire drills using its advanced Apache helicopters stationed in the South for the first time since 2019.
Kim also slammed South Korea’s new, hawkish president Yoon Suk-yeol, who took office in May and has vowed to take a tougher stance against Pyongyang — which includes a plan to mobilise a preemptive strike capability.
“Talking about military action against our nation, which possess absolute weapons that they fear the most, is preposterous and is very dangerous self-destructive action,” Kim said of the Yoon administration, which he branded a group of  “gangsters”.
“Such a dangerous attempt will be immediately punished by our powerful strength and the Yoon Suk Yeol government and his military will be annihilated.”
The North has carried out a record-breaking blitz of sanctions-busting weapons tests this year, including firing an intercontinental ballistic missile at full range for the first time since 2017.
Nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington have been stalled since a summit between Kim and then-US president Donald Trump in February 2019 broke down over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return.

The storied show has been axed after 37 years of production due to a dwindling audience at home and in Britain, where it was once wildly popular.
Set around the fictional Melbourne cul-de-sac Ramsay Street, the show was once so influential it was even blamed for UK children developing Australian accents.
It was a rite of passage for generations of Australian stars, including Russell Crowe and Liam Hemsworth, but was dropped by Britain’s Channel 5 in March and was unable to secure another broadcast partner in the United Kingdom.

3,29 bodies found in Syrian mass grave,BEIRUT: Kurdish-affiliated authorities said on Thursday they had found the remains of almost 30 bodies in a mass...,"BEIRUT: Kurdish-affiliated authorities said on Thursday they had found the remains of almost 30 bodies in a mass grave in northern Syria, with a war monitor saying they were likely killed by jihadists.
“At least 29 bodies, including those of a woman and two children, have been found in a mass grave,” near a hotel in Manbij, said an official of the Kurdish-affiliated Manbij civilian council.
The militant Islamic State group had turned the hotel in a prison when it ruled the northern city between 2014 and 2016.
The mass grave was unearthed on Wednesday by municipal workers who were doing work on the sewerage system, according to the Manbij military council.
Some of the decomposed remains were found handcuffed and blindfolded, it said.
The military council said it was unclear when they were killed, but that it was during IS rule of Manbij.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said the remains are believed to belong to people abducted by IS fighters.
US-backed Kurdish-led forces took control of Manbij in 2016, after ousting the jihadists from the city.
Dozens of mass graves have been found in Iraq and Syria but the identification process is slow, costly and complicated.
IS seized large swathes of Iraq and Syrian territory in 2014, declaring a  “caliphate” and killing thousands before they were detained.
One of the biggest alleged IS mass graves contained 200 bodies and was discovered in 2019 near Raqa, the group’s former de-facto capital in Syria.
Rights groups have repeatedly called on Kurdish authorities and the Syrian government to investigate the fate of thousands who went missing during IS rule.
The missing include British reporter John Cantlie and Italian Jesuit priest Paolo Dall’Oglio.
Syria’s war, which erupted in 2011 after the brutal repression of anti-government protests, has killed nearly half a million people and forced around half of the country’s pre-war population from their homes.
17 killed in clashes
At  least 17 people have been killed and dozens wounded in the southern  Syrian province of Sweida in clashes in between armed residents and  gangs aligned with the security agencies, activists and local media said  on Thursday.
The Druze-majority province has remained mostly  shielded from the bloody conflict that ravaged the rest of the country  since 2011 but sporadic rallies have taken place over deteriorating  economic conditions.
Residents had also been growing increasingly  frustrated at government-backed fighters carrying out arbitrary  detentions, random roadblocks and kidnappings for ransom, said Rayan  Maarouf, an activist and head of the Suwayda24 local media outlet.
At  the weekend, the detention of one resident prompted others to set up  informal roadblocks and detain members of government-backed gangs and  besiege their bases, Suwayda24 reported.
“This uprising flared up  very suddenly and there were attacks on the bases of these armed groups,  which are reinforced with heavy weapons,” Maarouf said.
The resulting fighting left 17 people dead according to  Sweida’s health directorate, which was cited by both Suwayda24 and the  pro-government Al-Watan newspaper on Thursday.
The Syrian  government has not commented on the violence but Al-Watan said the  fighting had quietened and negotiations over a settlement were underway.

4,Pope’s Mass interrupted by protest over 15th century edict justifying land grab,"It was not clear if the pope, who was behind the banner, was able to see what it said.","eSAINTE BEAUPRE: Participants at Pope Francis’ Mass in Canada on Thursday unfurled a banner asking him to formally rescind edicts from the 15th century in which the papacy justified taking indigenous land.
The large banner protesting the doctrine of discovery was unfurled near the front row facing the congregation as the pope was starting Mass in a cathedral outside Quebec City. Most of the people in the church were indigenous.
Two women held up the banner, written on a white sheet with red and black letters, and later took it down themselves.
It was not clear if the pope, who was behind the banner, was able to see what it said.
The doctrine of discovery was enshrined in 15th-century papal bulls, or edicts. Indigenous people in Canada have been calling for its rescinding for years. 
In 2015, Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which spent six years investigating residential schools, listed its repudiation as one of 94 calls to action that it laid out.
Pope Francis is on a week-long tour of Canada to apologise for the church’s role in the abusive residential schools system, which removed indigenous children from their homes in a forced cultural assimilation programme.
A spokesperson for papal visit organisers said Canadian bishops are asking the pope to address the doctrine of discovery.
“Galvanised by the calls of our Indigenous Partners, and by the Holy Fathers remarks, we are working with the Vatican and those who have studied this issue, with the goal of issuing a new statement from the Church,” Laryssa Waler wrote in an email on Thursday.
“Canada’s Bishops continue to reject and resist the ideas associated with the Doctrine of Discovery in the strongest possible way.” Massimo Faggioli, a professor of theology and religious studies at Villanova University, said the pope was unlikely to formally rescind the doctrine but he should address it.
“The church doesn’t operate like that — it doesn’t issue a document saying, ‘Now we have decided that this old doctrine is no longer true,’” he said.  “How the church does that is to produce new documents with new doctrines that replace old doctrines. ... I believe (the pope) should address that issue, and I think he will. But not with a formal document.” 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also  “discussed the need to ... address the Doctrine of Discovery” in a meeting with the pontiff on Wednesday, according to a readout from his office on Thursday.

5,Graft probe opens against Bangladesh nobel laureate Yunus,"Economist, board members of Grameen Telecom being investigated over allegations they embezzled profits meant to go to employees.","DHAKA: Bangladesh has launched a corruption probe into Nobel peace laureate and microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus over accusations of embezzlement at a telecoms firm he chairs, the country’s graft watchdog said on Thursday.
Yunus, 82, has been feted internationally for his efforts to eradicate poverty but his reputation at home has been tarnished by a labour dispute and a long-running feud with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. 
The Anti-Corruption Commission said it was investigating the economist and other members of the Grameen Telecom (GT) board over allegations they had embezzled a share of profits meant to go to the firm’s employees.
“The commission has reviewed the allegation made by the factory inspection department against Grameen Telecom and has decided to investigate,” agency secretary Md. Mahbub Hossain told reporters.
The telco’s board is also accused of laundering and embezzling 29.77 billion taka ($315 million) and stealing another $5 million dollars meant for a labour welfare fund.
There was no immediate comment from Yunus.
Bangladeshi labour law requires all enterprises to give a five per cent profit share to employees.
The probe comes just months after GT agreed to pay $50 million to settle a long-running legal dispute by disgruntled employees, who had filed more than 100 lawsuits claiming they had been deprived of the payments.
Yunus is the founding chair of Grameen Telecom, which owns a multi-billion dollar stake in Bangladesh’s largest mobile phone operator.
He has been credited with helping eradicate extreme poverty in Bangladesh by offering microfinance loans to tens of millions of rural women through Grameen Bank, which he founded in the 1980s.
He was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work promoting economic development. But despite his status as a globe-trotting celebrity speaker, Yunus has faced a series of troubles at home in recent years.
He was forced from his position as Grameen Bank’s managing director in 2011 in a move his supporters blamed on conflict with Prime Minister Hasina. Yunus lost a subsequent challenge to his removal in the courts and was criticised by Hasina, who accused him of “sucking blood” from the poor with high interest rates.

6,Hundreds of aftershocks shake earthquake-hit Philippines,MANILA: Anxious residents slept outside after hundreds of aftershocks rattled the earthquake-hit northern...,"MANILA: Anxious residents slept outside after hundreds of aftershocks rattled the earthquake-hit northern Philippines, locals said on Thursday, as President Ferdinand Marcos Jr inspected damage in the region.
Five people were killed and more than 150 injured when a 7.0-magnitude quake struck the lightly populated province of Abra on Wednesday morning, authorities said.
The death toll rose to six on Thursday when a 59-year-old man was hit by a landslide caused by an aftershock, a local disaster official said.
The powerful quake rippled across the mountainous area, toppling buildings, triggering landslides and shaking high-rise towers hundreds of kilometres away in the capital Manila.
“Aftershocks happen almost every 20 minutes, 15 minutes since yesterday,” said Reggi Tolentino, a restaurant owner in Abra’s provincial capital Bangued.
“Many slept outside last night, almost every family.” Some families have been given modular tents to stay in. Marcos Jr has urged people to wait for their homes to be inspected before moving back.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed, roads were blocked by landslides, and power was knocked out in affected areas.
A state of calamity was declared in Abra, which felt the full force of the quake, enabling the government to tap funds for the response effort.
Abra police chief Colonel Maly Cula said the overall damage had been  “very minimal”.
“We don’t have a lot of people in evacuation sites, although many people are staying in the streets because of the aftershocks,” Cula said.
“Abra is back to normal.” Marcos Jr, who took office last month, arrived in Bangued on Thursday to inspect the damage and discuss the response effort with government, military and disaster officials.
More than 800 aftershocks have been recorded since the quake hit, including 24 that were strong enough to feel, the local seismological agency said.
Aftershocks were expected to continue for  “several weeks”, Renato Solidum, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, told a briefing presided over by Marcos Jr. There would be  “a lot” in the first three days, then  “hopefully it will decline afterwards”, he said.
Tourism operators hit 
In Vigan City, a Unesco World Heritage site and tourist destination in Ilocos Sur province, centuries-old structures built during the Spanish colonial period were damaged.
Governor Jeremias Singson told TV broadcaster Teleradyo that 460 buildings in the province had been affected, including the Bantay Bell Tower, which partially crumbled. “Our tourism industry and small business owners were really affected,” Singson said.
After visiting Vigan on Thursday, Senator Imee Marcos, the president’s elder sister, said the damage to old churches in the city was  “overwhelming”.
The Philippines is regularly rocked by quakes due to its location on the Pacific  “Ring of Fire”, an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.
Wednesday’s quake was one of the strongest recorded in the Philippines in recent years and was felt across swathes of Luzon island, the most populous in the archipelago. In October 2013, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck Bohol Island in the central Philippines, killing more than 200 people and triggering landslides.
Old churches in the birthplace of Catholicism in the Philippines were badly damaged. Nearly 400,000 were displaced and tens of thousands of houses were damaged.
The powerful quake altered the island’s landscape and a  “ground rupture” pushed up a stretch of earth by about three metres, creating a wall of rock above the epicentre.
In 1990, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in the northern Philippines created a ground rupture stretching over a hundred kilometres.
Fatalities were estimated at more than 1,200, with major damage to buildings in Manila.

7,"Notre-Dame on track to reopen in 2024, says French minister","PARIS: Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris is on track to reopen to worshippers and the public in 2024, Culture Minister...","PARIS: Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris is on track to reopen to worshippers and the public in 2024, Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak said on Thursday, more than three years after its roof was destroyed in a massive blaze.
She said the clean-up phase of the restoration project had ended, allowing rebuilding work to get underway at the end of the summer.
Notre-Dame has been closed for restoration since the fire in 2019 gutted its roof and sent its spire crashing down, to the horror of onlookers and people watching in France and around the world on television and social media.
“We are confident that 2024 will be the year a large part of this work is completed, the year of the re-opening of the cathedral to worshippers and to the public,” Abdul Malak said as she visited the site.
Soon after the April 2019 blaze, President Emmanuel Macron said the cathedral - which dates back to the 12th century — would be rebuilt and later promised to get it reopened to worshippers by 2024, when France hosts the Olympic Games.
The cathedral will be restored to its previous design, including the 96-metre (315-feet) spire designed by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc in the mid-1800s and for which new timber has been selected.
After completion of the safety phase in 2021 and work to clean up the interior of the cathedral, reconstruction notably involves rebuilding the wooden roof structure, the vaults and the spire.

8,Court tells journalist to pay fine over Ukraine remarks,Russian authorities have not announced the opening of any criminal investigation against Marina Ovsyannikova.,"MOSCOW: A Moscow court on Thursday ordered journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, who denounced Russia’s intervention in Ukraine during a live TV broadcast, to pay a fine for discrediting the Russian army.
Moscow’s Meshchansky district court said that Ovsyannikova, a former editor at state-controlled Channel One, should pay a fine of 50,000 rubles (around $800), a  journalist said from court.
Ovsyannikova’s lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said she was fined for speaking out against Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine earlier this month when she turned up at Moscow’s Basmanny district court to support city councillor Ilya Yashin.
In mid-July, Yashin, one of the last prominent opposition figures still in Russia, was placed in pre-trial detention for two months for having denounced Moscow’s Ukraine offensive.
Ovsyannikova, a 44-year-old mother of two, was briefly detained earlier this month.
Her brief detention came several days after she demonstrated alone near the Kremlin, holding up a sign criticising the military intervention in Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin.
Zakhvatov said the journalist was now in Russia and had no immediate plans to leave.
In March, Ovsyannikova shot to prominence for interrupting a live TV broadcast to denounce Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine.
After sending troops to Ukraine, Moscow adopted laws imposing sentences of up to 15 years in prison for spreading information about the military deemed false by the authorities.
Russian authorities have not announced the opening of any criminal investigation against Ovsyannikova.
In the months following her March protest, Ovsyannikova spent time abroad, working for Germany’s Die Welt.
In early July, she announced that she was returning to Russia to settle a dispute over the custody of her two children.
