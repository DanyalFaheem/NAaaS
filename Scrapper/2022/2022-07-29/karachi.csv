0,Haleem Adil Sheikh freed in land case for want of proof,"Court directs IO to release PTI leader after obtaining a personal bond in a sum of Rs50,000.","KARACHI: The provincial anti-corruption court on Thursday released the detained Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Haleem Adil Shaikh in a case pertaining to lease of government land worth Rs160 million “obtained through forgery”. 
Special Judge of Anti-Corruption (Provincial) Naushaba Kazi ruled that: “… Haleem Adil Shaikh is hereby discharged u/s 63 Cr.P.C, as sufficient material is not available on record to implicate him with the alleged crimes.” 
The court directed the investigating officer (IO) to release him forthwith, after obtaining a personal bond in a sum of Rs50,000, if he was not required in any other case. 
Earlier, IO Abdul Wahab Talbani had produced the PTI leader in the court to seek his 14-day physical remand. He submitted that the PTI leader had not been interrogated since he was arrested in Jamshoro on July 27 and brought to Karachi. He added that the investigation was incomplete and co-accused were yet to be arrested. The state prosecutor supported the IO’s contentions. 
However, the judge wrote that it had been observed by superior courts that the Anti-Corruption Police could not question any entry made in the record of rights belonging to private persons, adding that the Sindh High Court in a 2015 judgement had directed the ACE police to keep their hands off from entertaining complaints with regard to any entry in the revenue record belonging to private persons. 
The judge noted that the Supreme Court had also observed in its 2004 judgement that the fact as to whether the mutations in dispute were fraudulently entered or not, was yet to be determined by the civil court in civil suit filed by the accused, which was pending adjudication and there was no justification to invoke the jurisdiction of the criminal court. 
The judge added that the suspect had already approached the Sindh High Court by way of filing a suit wherein he had alleged that he had applied for the conversion of the lease grant made in his favour from 30 years to 99 years through a letter dated Oct 1, 2008, but such conversion remained pending and unanswered. 
The judge said that the SHC had also granted a status quo in favour of the suspect on Jan 2, 2019, hence, it was yet to be determined by the SHC. He observed that the matter was sub-judice, hence no case was made out against him at this stage. 
SHC issues notices 
Earlier, the Sindh High Court had issued notices to an officer of the Sindh Anti-Corruption Establishment investigating officer and provincial law officer on an application against the arrest of Mr Shaikh in the alleged violation of court order. 
A brother of Mr Shaikh had filed application on behalf of the accused and submitted that on July 11, the SHC had restrained the ACE from taking coercive action against Mr Shaikh in two pending inquires till Aug 3. 
The lawyer for the applicant contended that the petitioner had appeared before ACE Director Zeeshan Hyder Memon in its office in Jamshoro on July 27 and he was given a week to respond to a questionnaire, but Mr Shaikh was detained and handed over to police in an FIR registered on the same day. 
The bench put the alleged contemnor as well as the IO and advocate general Sindh on notice for Aug 4.

1,Opposition berates Sindh govt over devastation of civic infrastructure,Ministers claim better performance during current spell of record rains; pledge compensation to farmers.,"KARACHI: Ministers praised Sindh government’s efforts towards draining out rainwater during the spells of record rains across the province whereas opposition lawmakers belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) bitterly criticised it over its ‘failure’ in clearing accumulated rainwater in the urban as well rural areas as debate on weather-related issues resumed in the Sindh Assembly on Thursday. 
GDA’s Arif Mustafa Jatoi, speaking on a call attention notice, demanded the provincial government to announce compensation for the farmers who incurred heavy financial losses after their crops were devastated due to heavy monsoon rains. 
He said that the civic infrastructure of urban areas had collapsed piling miseries on people, while agricultural land of poor farmers had been flooded destroying all crops and causing huge financial losses. He apprehended that the loss of crops could lead to a severe food crisis in the country. 
The GDA lawmaker also showed pictures of many main roads submerged in interior parts of the province and asked what steps were being taken to drain out the accumulated rainwater. 

Ministers claim better performance during current spell of record rains; pledge compensation to farmers

Mr Jatoi also asked the relevant minister as to what steps the provincial government was taking to provide relief to the poor farmers who had suffered huge financial losses after their crops were destroyed in the recent rains. 
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawala said that the provincial government would ensure that the affected farmers got compensation. “We will talk to the federal government too in this regard and the matter of tax exemption for the affected farmers will also be taken up,” he assured Mr Jatoi. 
He said that the province had received record 600mm to 700mm rains during the two heavy spells of monsoon over the last 25 to 27 days. “The chief minister and his cabinet members along with administration officers remained in field to ensure early draining of rainwater that had submerged different arteries and roads,” he said, adding that the work continued day and night to drain out the rainwater. 
Another opposition member Riaz Haider of PTI also lambasted the provincial government over its ‘inefficiency’ during the recent spells of monsoon rains. 
He referred to the Shadman nullah incident that claimed the life of a woman and her infant, and said that he had been raising the issue of nullahs overflowing for the last four years but to no avail. 
The PTI MPA from PS-130 said that the civic infrastructure in his constituency had been in worst condition and deteriorated after the heavy monsoon rains, which was evident from the nullah incident. “Authorities have not taken any steps for the uplift of the area,” he lamented. 
In his reply, Parliamentary Secretary for Local Government Saleem Baloch said that the Shadman nullah passed through the Mewashah graveyard and this passage was closed down and the work on its diversion was in progress at two different sites. 
He said that rainwater would be drained out smoothly through the nullah after its diversion and it would be connected with Gujjar nullah. 
Earlier, speaking on a point of order, PTI’s Parliamentary Party Leader Khurram Sherzman said that the rain water was still there in almost every part of the city even after two days of rains. He said that people were facing a great deal of hardship due to submerged roads and streets. “The entire city has submerged and the authorities are doing nothing,” he deplored. 
Responding to the PTI member’s claims, Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Hussian Shah said that the provincial government carried out round-the-clock operations to drain out rainwater in every part of the city. 
He tendered apology to the people for facing hardships during the recent rains and claimed that rainwater was drained out successfully within a few hours of rainfall in those areas where in the past rainwater would accumulate and stayed for days. 
During the Question Hour, Social Welfare Minister Muhammad Sajid Jokhio had to cut a sorry figure when PTI’s Rabia Azfar Nizamani pointed out that six out of seven starred assembly questions on the agenda did not pertain to the social welfare department. 
Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari adjourned the house to Friday.

2,Four policemen among five jailed for life in kidnap case,"KARACHI: An antiterrorism court on Thursday awarded life imprisonment to five accused, including four policemen, for...","KARACHI: An antiterrorism court on Thursday awarded life imprisonment to five accused, including four policemen, for kidnapping two citizens for ransom in 2017.  
Police Inspector Afzal Qureshi, constables Ghulam Nabi, Abid Ali and Muhammad Qasim were found guilty of kidnapping Saqib and Arif with connivance of a private person, Waqar Hussain.  
The suspects had kidnapped Saqib and Asif within the jurisdiction of the Shah Faisal police station.  
On Thursday, the ATC-XII judge, who conducted the trial in the judicial complex within the central prison, pronounced his verdict reserved after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides.  
The judge noted that the prosecution had successfully proved its case against detained accused Waqar Hussain and absconding police officials – Inspector Qureshi and constables Ghulam Nabi, Ali and Qasim.  
The judge also ordered them to pay a fine of Rs200,000 each or serve additional six-year imprisonment on default.  
The judge also handed down life imprisonment to all the convicts for committing dacoity in the house of the abductees. They were ordered to pay Rs200,000 fine or undergo additional six-year imprisonment.  
Separately, the judge awarded three-year imprisonment to the four police officials for deliberately concealing themselves and obstructing the trials since they absconded after obtaining pre-arrest bail from the Sindh High Court’s Hyderabad circuit bench.  
The judge directed the investigating officer to arrest the four policemen, who had already been declared proclaimed offenders by the court, to serve out the sentences awarded to them in absentia.  
According to the prosecution, around 13 or 14 men introducing themselves as police officials broke into the house of complainant Shamim Akhtar in Shah Faisal Colony on Feb 7, 2017.  
It further mentioned that the men armed with lethal weapons took away her son and his friend along with gold ornaments and Rs700,000 cash.

3,"Ignoring all concerns, CM Murad appoints Dr Khalid Mahmood Iraqi as new KU VC","Appointment on the much-coveted post was pending for weeks following candidates’ interviews, which were held last month.","KARACHI: Ignoring concerns and criticism over the controversial selection process, the chief minister on Thursday appointed Prof Khalid Mahmood Iraqi as the 22nd vice chancellor of Karachi University (KU) for a term of four years.
The appointment for the much-coveted post was pending for weeks following candidates’ interviews, which were held last month.
“In exercise of powers vested in him under Section 13(I) of the University of Karachi Act, 1972, as amended by Sindh Universities and Institutes Laws (Amendment) Act-2018, the Honorable Chief Minister Sindh has been pleased to appoint Prof Dr Khalid Mahmood Iraqi as Vice Chancellor of Karachi University for a period of four years,” says a July 28 notification released by the Universities and Boards Department.
The two other candidates interviewed for the post were Prof Moonis Ahmer and Prof Syed Jamil Hasan Kazmi. Their names, including that of Prof Iraqi, were forwarded by the search committee to the chief minister.
Prof Iraqi had earlier served as the acting vice chancellor of KU for almost three years.
Speaking to Dawn, he expressed his desire to tackle all challenges the university is faced with, particularly its financial constraints.
“It’s indeed a difficult time not just for KU but all universities across Pakistan currently experiencing a serious economic crisis,” Prof Iraqi said, adding that he would work with all colleagues on the campus as a team.
About his plans for university’s financial issues, he said it’s time to move towards self-sustainability, which could be achieved through revenue generation and cost-cutting measures.
“For instance, university’s electricity bills have increased from around Rs30m to Rs50m. We can bring it down by running our academic facilities on solar energy. The experiment has already been done in few departments while the rest can gradually be shifted to the renewable energy source.”
He rejected criticism against his credentials and said he didn’t do anything “illegal” during his three-year tenure as the acting KU vice chancellor.
Prof Iraqi is expected to take over charge of the office on Friday.
The university is currently headed by Prof Nasira Khatoon, also the dean science, who took over as the first female acting vice chancellor of KU in March, 2022 after the government had removed Prof Iraqi on court orders.
Prof Nasira was the senior most professor on the campus.
Controversial process
It may be recalled that the selection process for the (regular) post of KU vice chancellor had been controversial since May, 2019 after KU vice chancellor Prof Muhammad Ajmal Khan passed away.
The chief minister decided to hand over the charge of KU acting vice chancellor to Prof Iraqi. This appointment was very much against the principles of merit and court rulings under which the senior-most university professor should be given the top slot in the interim period till the government made a regular appointment.
Prof Iraqi was at 27th number on the seniority list at that time.
In June 2019, the government advertised the vacant post of vice chancellor, but later issued a corrigendum in which the criteria relating to experience, research work and age was changed, apparently to benefit a few candidates.
The government had to revert to the old eligibility criteria on the orders of court, which directed it to consider all applicants for the post.
Sources said the government adopted another strategy to delay the process by asking one of the candidates to get his research papers verified from the HEC.
The candidate challenged this in court, which directed the relevant authorities to get papers of all applicants verified by the HEC.
The first court directive in this regard came in February 2021. Later, the court ordered removal of Prof Iraqi as acting vice chancellor.
It also directed the government to reconstitute the search committee tasked to carry out the selection process after some candidates challenged it on the grounds that two members of the committee (former KU vice chancellors) had conflict of interest with Prof Iraqi who served as an adviser under them.
Recently, it came to surface that Prof Tariq Rafi, the incumbent head of the search committee, had co-authored two research papers with Prof Iraqi.
Also, sources pointed to the questionable role the HEC had played in the verification of research papers as assigned by the court.
It dropped out a few candidates after rejecting their papers, published before June 2005, on the ground that they were not printed in the list of 181 HEC-verified journals.
This list, the sources said, did not exist before 2022, and that the HEC in its old directives had allowed university bodies to verify papers printed before 2005.
Another major flaw in the HEC’s verification process, candidates stated, was that the commission verified the research journals and not papers.

5,Environment-friendly Vlektra bikes come on roads in Karachi,Vlektra Electric Motorcycles are Pakistan’s first lithium-ion based electric motorcycles.,"KARACHI: A group of environmentally-conscious young people, engineers and designers, representing Vlektra Electric Motorcycles, unveiled various models of their much-needed electric motorbikes during a programme organised by Darya Lab at the Institute of Business Administration’s (IBA) City Campus here on Thursday.  
Vlektra Electric Motorcycles are Pakistan’s first lithium-ion based electric motorcycles.  
Whereas buying a normal 125CC motorcycle will cost you around Rs242,000, it will cost you Rs399,000 but that is the only higher cost. “Because lithium-ion batteries are expensive. They are the best batteries in the world which are also used by Tesla and all the biggest electric vehicle manufacturing companies of the world. We are also offering battery warranty,” Fatiq Bin Khursheed, one of the partners of Vlektra, told Dawn.  
“For a litre of fuel, a 125CC bike will run some 32 kilometres. It will also require Rs3,000 a month on maintenance. And then there is our most common model, the Bolt, which will run 90 kilometres on a single charge for which you spend about Rs30/kilowatt-hour (kWh). Its monthly maintenance cost is also nil. Its savings all the way,” he informed.  
The variants or different Vlektra models include the already mentioned Bolt, the Retro 1969, which has that old late 1960s and early 1970s vintage look. It is also cheaper as it costs only Rs250,000. And there is the Evo, which is custom-made. It’s prototype similar in look to beautiful heavy bike was also on display at IBA. “It is a made-to-order bike. It is entirely hand-made. Customers may ask for different things to be added to it and its priced accordingly,” the partner explained.  
The manufacturers also said that they had already commercially launched three of their Bolt models and even sold out the first batch. The initial batch comprised 50 bikes. And things are really looking up for them as their second batch has already been booked to be delivered in September.  
They are being helpful by offering the bike on instalments as well to buyers. And all the sales are mostly based on publicity through the word of mouth or through the company’s website: www.vlektra.com  
“Pakistan is the seventh most vulnerable country in the world due to climate change. Pakistan also has the second highest deaths from lung cancer. Being environment-friendly, the Vlektra has no carbon emissions. It is also noise-free. You only need to plug it into a regular socket to charge it, which takes only four to five hours. All the bikes have tubeless radial tyres and they pick up speed from 0 to 100km/h in six seconds.  
The company representatives said that after manufacturing their first motorcycles they spent one year on test rides only. “Our engineers and designers are still busy making prototypes and rejecting or passing them for production,” they said. They are offering test rides at IBA.  
After his test ride on the Bolt, one of the volunteers, Kamran, said that he was impressed by the motorcycle’s pickup. “It runs so smoothly and has an excellent pickup. It is also very silent so for me at least not hearing the ‘vroom vroom’ or feeling the usual vibration of a motorcycle engine revving up will take some getting used to. Also, its levers are just its brakes. The bike does not have a clutch as it doesn’t have a transmission system,” he said.

6,Notices issued in PTI’s plea against LG polls postponement,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Sindh chief...","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Sindh chief secretary and others on a petition of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) challenging postponement of the second phase of the local government elections in Sindh.
The two-judge bench headed by Justice Salahuddin Panhwar also directed the lawyer for the petitioner to satisfy it about the maintainability of the petition on Aug 11.
Senior PTI leader Ashraf Jabbar Qureshi, through his lawyer, had moved the SHC last week and contended that the ECP in connivance with the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) was delaying the LG elections with mala fide intentions as they were afraid of the PTI’s popularity after recent by-elections in Punjab.
The petitioner submitted that he was a candidate of the PTI for the post of chairman from a union committee in district central and a few days before the polling day, the provincial election commissioner had sent a letter to the ECP secretary to postpone the July 24 LG polls on account of thunderstorm and torrential rains forecast in Karachi and Hyderabad.
Thereafter, he stated that the ECP issued a notification on July 20, postponing the second phase of the LG elections and fixed Aug 28 as the new date for polling. He contended that the ECP’s move to delay polls was also made in violation of the June 24 judgement of the SHC as a division bench had dismissed the petitions of the PTI and MQM-P seeking postponement of the LG election on June 24 and ruled that no case for staying the elections was made out by the petitioners.
The petitioner also argued that during the hearing, the ECP had submitted that around 27,000 candidates were contesting and 30 million ballot papers had been printed and around Rs500 million spent and thus, polls could not be stayed.
Citing the ECP and Sindh chief secretary as respondents, the petitioner stated that if the upcoming elections were postponed due to weather forecast, the same should have been postponed for a week instead of more than a month, which would not only cause potential loss to the ECP of millions of rupees it had already spent but candidates were also facing huge losses as they had invested their hard-earned money in contesting the elections.
He submitted that the LG elections were already being held after an inordinate delay as the ECP was bound to hold elections within 120 days while the four-year tenure of the last elected local governments in Sindh had expired on Aug 30, 2020 and the delay in holding LG elections would prejudice the whole process.
The petitioner pleaded to declare the impugned notification of the ECP illegal and sought directive for respondents to announce schedule of the LG elections by the end of this month or first week of August as well as sought order for respondents to hand over the ballot papers to the court nazir or any person authorised by the court.
After a preliminary hearing, the bench in its order said, “Learned counsel for the petitioner shall satisfy this Court on the point of maintainability of the petition.” 
It also issued notices to the respondents to come up on Aug 11, 2022.

7,Yearly hepatitis toll constantly rising: experts,"KARACHI: Pakistan yearly reports about 150,000 new cases of Hepatitis C which claimed around 17,000 lives in 2019...","KARACHI: Pakistan yearly reports about 150,000 new cases of Hepatitis C which claimed around 17,000 lives in 2019 whereas the deaths related to Hepatitis B were around 12,000.  
Deaths have increased by over nine per cent in hepatitis B and five percent in hepatitis C cases. Most people catch these infections from healthcare facilities due to poor infection-control practices. 
This information was shared by experts at a public awareness programme organised here at the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT) in connection with the World Hepatitis Day. 
The day is observed each year on July 28 to raise awareness of viral hepatitis which causes inflammation of liver that leads to severe diseases, including cancer. 
An estimated 354 million people worldwide live with Hepatitis B or C, and for most of them, testing and treatment remain beyond reach. 
The WHO aims at achieving hepatitis elimination till 2030 by reducing new infections by 90 per cent and ensuring that at least 90 per cent of the people with Hepatitis B and C viruses are diagnosed. 
Sharing data on the disease, the experts pointed out that around 58 million in the world had chronic Hepatitis C infection with about 15 million new infections occurring annually and an estimated 3.2 million adolescents and children were affected with chronic Hepatitis C globally. 
The disease, they said, was called a silent killer because many patients remained undiagnosed and untreated for many years before developing complications. 
Considering the importance of the increase in the number of cases of Hepatitis A & E, the medical experts informed the visitors about its incubation period which was four to six weeks for Hepatitis A and six to eight weeks for Hepatitis E. 
They emphasised the need for using boiled water and ensuring hand-hygiene, especially after using washroom and before and after eating food. It was stressed to get vaccinated against Hepatitis A and E. 
Speaking about Hepatitis B and C, they underscored the need for routine screening during blood donation, using new syringes, razor blades and sterilised dental and surgical equipment for any procedure. 
In case of acute Hepatitis C, presenting with liver failure, the patients were required to go through an organ transplant while in case of chronic Hepatitis B, medications were prescribed for its treatment. However, in some cases, a liver transplant was required. 
They emphasised the need for Hepatitis B vaccine among high-risk groups with strong family history, immune-compromised patients, diabetics, travellers, haemodialysis patients, and those who have unsafe sexual practices. 
The medical experts pointed out that untreated cases of Hepatitis B and C could lead to liver cancer. 
During the day’s proceedings, a large number of people visited the institute to avail free testing and diagnostic facilities being offered as part of creating awareness and educating the public at large. 
Visiting persons were shown videos and provided literature on measures to combat hepatitis.

10,"Govt reappoints ‘tainted’ officer in LUH in violation of SC, tribunal orders",HYDERABAD: The Sindh government has reappointed an officer of health department to a “re-designated” post in the...,"HYDERABAD: The Sindh government has reappointed an officer of health department to a “re-designated” post in the Liaquat University Hospital (LUH) Hyderabad, which had already been declared illegal by Sindh Services Tribunal and Supreme Court. 
It appears the Sindh government is still working as per ‘wish list’ of the officer, Abdul Sattar Jatoi, to ensure he stayed in LUH. The term ‘wish list’ with regard to the officer was used in the verdict authored by then Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed, who had heard Jatoi’s appeal against the tribunal’s order dated Sept 22, 2020.
The government issued a notification on July 27 posting Jatoi as ‘director of (admin, accounts & development) against an ‘existing vacancy’. The notification, on the face of it, is in violation of Sept 22 order of the tribunal and the apex court’s Jan 10, 2022 order passed on an appeal filed by Jatoi against the tribunal’s order.
By this reappointment, the government has also shown complete disregard to its own legislation i.e. Sindh Teaching Hospitals (Establishment of Management Board) Act 2020, which calls for appointment of “finance & administration directors, separately in teaching hospitals”. 
Besides, the same officer has been posted again with dual charge of the posts vested in one despite the fact that Hospital Management Board has already initiated process or appointment of a director of finance in the LUH.
The government had removed Jatoi on July 1 this year as he, despite being a BS-19 rank, held a BS-20 post of director (administration, accounts and development, which was especially created for the officer) in violation of the SC order. He was demoted to BS-19 on May 16 after the SC’s Jan 10 order. 
The SC headed by then Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed had dismissed his appeal while upholding Sept 22 order of the tribunal that had set aside Jatoi’s promotion to BS-20 post of director, terming it as a “re-designation” of a BS-19 post.
“He used his influence with a religious party which finally worked and got himself reappointed,” said an officer. 
He said that findings of an inquiry conducted by health department against Jatoi and then MS regarding release of Rs350m of LUH funds through a fake letter were lying with the government yet he was posted in the hospital.
The para-14 of the Sept 22 order of the tribunal said that “then the series of acts in favour of Abdul Sattar Jatoi taking him out of health department, ‘re-designating clinical post of LUH Hyderabad/Jamshoro and making him director (administration, accounts and development) were also illegal and in violation of the judgement”. 
The SC bench in its Jan 10’s order said: “We find no illegality in impugned judgment of the tribunal and are not persuaded to interfere with the same. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed”.
The apex court noted in the verdict that through a notification dated July 2, 2013, competent authority eagerly complied with ‘such wish of appellant’ by inducting him in Provincial Secretariat Service cadre in a post equivalent to BS-19. 
The appellant himself filed an application on July 25, 2013 to Chief Secretary Sindh, requesting “he may be posted/absorbed back against non-cadre position of LUH by re-designating existing post of BS-19 as director (administration, accounts and development).
On his request, a summary dated Dec 12, 2013 was floated for CM’s approval for re-designation of Additional MS (BS-19) post on non-clinical side as director. The SC said that through Nov 25, 2016 notification the appellant was absorbed as director.
“The wish list of the appellant did not end there and departmental authority continued to be too eager to accommodate him to the post of his own desire. For doing so, rules were amended on March 6, 2018. A person-specific amendment to the rules was made to accommodate him alone and the appellant, out of so many other batch mates in BS-19 granted promotion on June 1, 2018 from SB-19 to BS-20 and the said post was shown to be a post of BS-20,” said the SC.
The tribunal in its order set aside his promotion to BS-20 and re-designation of the AMS post as director. “It means the post of AMS in fact is to be revived but the government posted him to position already declared illegal,” said a doctor in health department.

12,Six policemen fired for showing ‘cowardice’ in averting murder,SSP says action taken after due process of issuance of show-cause notices and inquiry by a committee of officials.,"HYDERABAD: Hyderabad’s senior superintendent of police has dismissed from service six policemen for their negligence and cowardice in averting a hotel brawl in Nasim Nagar on July 12, which led to death of Bilal Kaka and sparked violent protests by nationalists.
In separate orders of dismissal from service, the SSP Amjad Ahmed Sheikh said that the action had been taken after due process of issuance of show-cause notices and inquiry by a committee of officials. 
He said that all the policemen were already placed under suspension in the wake of July 12 incident at Super Salateen hotel near a filling station. Kaka was killed and four of his friends were injured in the incident and a case was lodged under Sections 392, 324, 147, 148, 149, 337-H (ii), 109 PPC in Bhitai Nagar police station.
The SSP observed that the policemen were on duty as they could be seen in the video clip of the crime scene that went viral afterwards. Instead of intervening and stopping the criminals they just tarried along idly. People witnessed the policemen as they stood by as “coward spectators”, he said.
He said that Kaka’s life could have been saved if the policemen had not acted cowardly. The inquiry committee headed by Anil Haider, SP headquarters, with ASP Hasnain Waris, SDPO Market Rasool Bux Siyal and SDPO Qasimabad Makhdoom Ghulam Mustafa submitted report to him on July 21, noting that head constable Israr Ahmed and constable Ashok Kumar were not present at the crime scene. 
But the SSP disagreed with the committee’s findings and said since charges levelled against them were serious, they were all dismissed from service. 
The SSP told Dawn that the inquiry against two SHOs, Farhan Memon of PS Nasim Nagar and Ziyad Noonari of Bhitai Nagar, ASI Manzoor Babar and others would be conducted separately and disciplinary proceedings would be initiated against them, accordingly.
Bilal Kaka, a resident of Saeedabad, Matiari was killed on July 12 over a petty issue, involving the hotel owner and his son. Shah Sawar Khan and his brother Afzal Khan are among the four suspects police have arrested so far. Kaka’s murder fanned ethnic hatred between Sindh and Pathan communities and led to incidents of violence across the province.

They added that the disease needed to be checked as it was spreading at an alarming rate. 
They were speaking at a seminar on the ‘World Hepatitis Day’ at a local hotel here on Thursday, organised by the Chief Minister Hepatitis Prevention and Control Program, Sindh, to create awareness about hepatitis B and C. 
Discussing current state of hepatitis in Sindh, programme in-charge Dr Zulfiqar Dharejo said Pakistan had the second highest prevalence rate of hepatitis in the world. He said: “This year’s WHO’s slogan for common people is ‘I cannot wait to get tested’ ”. 
He added that it was the message for common people to get tested and if diagnosed with hepatitis, get treated as soon as possible. He said that one million people were patients of hepatitis B and two million of hepatitis C as per the Pakistan Medical Research Council.  
He said that keeping in view that alarming situation, the Sindh government had launched a hepatitis control programme in 2009, leading to establishment of 63 treatment facilities and 19 vaccine centres free of cost. Under that programme, he said, the government had a target to eliminate the disease by 2030. 
Prof Dr Bikha Ram said that prevention was the best way to save oneself from disease. It was high time to take that disease seriously and organise awareness programmes to sensitise people on the issue. 
He said hepatitis among pregnant women must be treated timely to avoid transmission of the disease to the newborn. He said that although disease could be prevented and cured, but people were still unaware of its treatment. Prevention and vaccination was only protection against that disease, he added. 
He said 10 million population was the victim of that disease, which was alarming. He said: “We should work on the WHO slogan of ‘finding million missing’ which means to find those who are victim of this disease.” 
Hyderabad Divisional Commi­ssioner Nadeemur Rehman Memon said awareness programmes should be held on a regular basis instead of observing the World Hepatitis Day alone.
