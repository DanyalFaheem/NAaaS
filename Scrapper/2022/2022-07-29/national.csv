Fawad Chaudhry accuses Shehbaz Sharif and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari of hatching conspiracies against the judiciary.

 
• Fawad says if federal government resists snap polls it should be sent home immediately
• Ex-Sindh governor claims party leader Haleem ‘tortured in custody’
ISLAMABAD: The Pak­istan Tehreek-i-Insaf has alleged that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari are hatching a conspiracy against the judiciary at a time when the rupee is fast losing its value against the dollar.
While speaking at a press conference along with former Sindh governor Imran Ismail in Islamabad, PTI Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry remarked there was no government in the country as the federation was silent on problems the nation was faced with.
The former information minister said the foreign minister did not go to his office for 12 days during the entire Punjab chief minister’s election case, which spoke volumes about his indifference to the affairs of his ministry.
“[Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs] Tariq Fatemi travelled to the US to lobby for Shehbaz Sharif, but he failed,” he said.
Shehbaz and Bilawal were hatching conspiracies against the judiciary while the rupee was on a constant decline, as it lost its value by Rs62 against the dollar in just 100 days, he claimed.
He went on to say that the country was facing myriad crises, with the dollar rising at an alarming pace and the stock market nose-diving. In such a situation, “we have to announce an election date and if the government resists, the PTI must send the government home without any further delay”, Fawad Chaudhry declared.
Coming down hard on Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, Mr Chaudhry said the only solution to all the problems the country was embroiled in were snap polls. He taunted Mr Sanaullah, questioning how a person would manage to bring a no confidence motion against anyone when he could not save his chief minister in Punjab.
He said meetings were held in London to topple the PTI government, while one group within the PML-N became pro- and the other anti-establishment.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Ismail said PTI leader Haleem Adil Sheikh had been arrested for the tenth time, alleging Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah wanted to hang him. He further said Mr Sheikh had been subjected to torture in custody.
Moreover, PTI leaders Asad Umar and Shaukat Tarin, in separate posts on social media, said the rupee had hit a new all-time low against the US dollar in the inter-bank market around midday on Thursday.
Mr Umar said the dollar had crossed the Rs240 mark and the economy was bleeding to death.
He said the gravity of the situation could be gauged from the fact that the rupee had lost over Rs62 against the dollar. This would result in further increases in the prices of energy products, including petrol, diesel, LNG and electricity.
The PTI chairman’s Chief of Staff Dr Shahbaz Gill hit out at Interior Minister Sanaullah, saying a “criminal who killed 14 people”, including pregnant women, in Model Town, was unaware that there was no foreign funding case with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
Addressing a press conference on Thursday, he said the “criminal” could not differentiate between foreign funding and prohibited funding. Gill said the ECP should decide the foreign or prohibited funding cases of all political parties collectively according to the orders of the high court, and bring the truth before the nation.
In a separate development, PTI chairman Imran Khan ordered the Punjab government on Thu­rsday to immediat­e­­ly provide assistance to the flood-stricken people of sou­­th Punjab and Mian­wali.

 





 
He said he had also directed the KP government to assist the Balochistan government in providing relief to the areas ravaged by floods.

1,GDA opposes govt’s move to carry out judicial reforms,Disrupts NA proceedings by pointing out quorum.,"ISLAMABAD: Dr Fehmida Mirza of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) on Thursday blasted the ruling coalition for adopting a resolution seeking the formation of a parliamentary committee for judicial reforms, terming it an attempt to curtail the powers of the judiciary.
Speaking on a point of order, Dr Mirza declared the passage of the resolution “regrettable” and warned the government against attempts to “encroach” the jurisdiction of the judiciary.
The National Assembly had on Wednesday adopted a resolution seeking the formation of a special parliamentary committee to carry out judicial reforms after heads of the ruling coalition parties, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, slammed the judiciary over the decision of a three-judge Supreme Court bench in the Punjab chief minister’s case, depriving Hamza Sharif from the top position.
The resolution had been read out by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and was also supported by the small opposition comprising the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) dissidents.

Disrupts NA proceedings by pointing out quorum

Dr Mirza, who had served as the NA speaker during the previous Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government, claimed that there was no real opposition in the house at the moment, adding that there could be no democracy and the parliament could not be strengthened without a strong opposition.
The GDA member from Badin said the judiciary had an oversight role and the government through the “one-sided resolution” had mocked the Parliament.
She also lamented the Sindh government over its alleged failure to provide relief to the rain-affected people in the province.
As soon as Dr Mirza took the seat, another GDA member Ghous Bux Mahar pointed out lack of quorum in an apparent move to prevent Deputy Speaker Zahid Akram Durrani from giving the floor to Opposition Leader Raja Riaz who had already stood up to respond to Dr Mirza.
The deputy speaker later announced adjournment of the assembly sitting till Friday morning after finding the house not in order due to lack of quorum for which the presence of 86 MNAs (one-fourth of the 342-member house) was required.
Earlier, the deputy speaker gave a ruling that jobs and the facility of natural gas be provided to the locals from where deposits of the natural resources were discovered. Besides giving the ruling, Mr Durrani also referred the matter to the concerned house committee after a number of lawmakers protested over the refusal of the oil and gas exploration companies to give jobs to the local people.
The issue came up under discussion when MNAs Jamaluddin, Muhammad Anwar and Salahuddin Ayubi of the JUI-F and independent MNA from the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) Mohsin Dawar through a Calling Attention Notice drew the attention of the government “regarding not accommodating the local people in jobs in exploration of natural resources of North Waziristan, FR Lucky Marwat, Bettani area and District Bannu West.”
Responding to the notice, Minister of State for Petroleum Dr Musadik Malik said the exploration companies were bound under the agreements to provide jobs to locals. Currently, he said, two companies Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and Mari Petroleum Company Limited (MPCL) were operating in the localities pointed out by the lawmakers.
According to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan, the minister said the OGDCL had hired around 275 locals as the project workers there and as many as 310 for the Wali Block Well-I, adding the company would make more temporary hiring of locals for its planned 3-D seismic survey of 500 square kilometer area. Similarly, he said, the MPCL had so far provided around 3,200 jobs to unskilled locals in its operational fields there.
Answering a question, Mr Malik said there was a ban on new gas connections due to the extreme scarcity of the commodity. He was of the view that the imported gas was too expensive and unaffordable for consumers.
The movers of the notice, however, challenged the figures provided by the minister.
Mohsin Dawar claimed that gas was already being provided to some unknown localities through a pipeline. He alleged that the MPCL considered itself above the law.
The deputy speaker, however, said that he had already referred the issue to the committee where the members could discuss it in detail.

3,PM alarmed over delay in PTI funding case verdict,"Interior minister wants Imran-led party to dissolve Punjab, KP assemblies if it wants early polls.","ISLAMABAD: Irked by the alleged pampering of PTI chairman Imran Khan, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday voiced alarm over the delay in the announcement of verdict in the prohibited funding case against PTI.
“(The) foreign funding case is an example of how ‘Ladla’ is being protected. While NS (Nawaz Sharif) was convicted for not taking salary, ‘Ladla’ is untouchable. 8 years on, decision is still elusive. Imran Niazi filed 9 writ petitions in IHC & got 50 adjournments in the FF case,” the PM tweeted.

 





 
The tweet came two days after the prime minister urged the Election Com­mission of Pakistan (ECP) to announce the “long-delayed” judgement. “For long has Imran Niazi been given a free pass despite his repeated and shameless atta­cks on state institutions. Impunity given to him has hurt the country,” he said.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah also called upon the ECP for an early decision in the prohibited funding case.

Interior minister wants Imran-led party to dissolve Punjab, KP assemblies if it wants early polls

“The Pakistan Muslim League and its allies in the government demand the ECP announce its reserved verdict in the PTI’s prohibited funding case immediately,” he told a presser.
He said it had been proved that 350 foreigners and foreign companies, including Indians and Israelis, had funded the PTI. He said $750 million had been received in the PTI accounts, opened in the names of its members Amir Kiyani, Dr Humayun and others, who should be arrested for being involved in money laundering.
He said the ECP should not only announce the decision, but also take action against the party.
The minister alleged that during the last eight years, PTI had been using delaying tactics to prevent the case from reaching a logical conclusion.
Rana Sanaullah said the ECP had reserved its decision some eight weeks ago and wondered why it was not being announced. “What was the hurdle in its way,” he questioned.
About Imran Khan’s demand for removal of the Chief Election Commissioner, he said the incumbent CEC was appointed through a constitutional procedure and Imran Khan himself had proposed his name. The CEC could only be removed through the Supreme Judicial Council, he remarked.
Rana Sanaullah, while chiding the PTI for its demand for early elections, said the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtun­khwa assemblies should be dissolved before asking the coalition government to announce the date for early elections.
The interior minister said the PTI chief would never prefer early polls and was making such demands only to discredit the government. In fact, he added, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif himself wanted the country to move towards early elections.
Answering a question, he said the Model Town case had already been decided.
