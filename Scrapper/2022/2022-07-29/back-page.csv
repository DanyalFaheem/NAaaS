0,Citizens to pay extra Rs155bn in August power bills,"Nepra approves Rs11.37 per unit additional FCA for K-Electric, Rs9.90 for Discos.","ISLAMABAD: Citizens will see an extra cost of up to Rs11.5 per unit in their August bills for the electricity they consumed in June after the national power regulator, Nepra, allowed distribution companies to charge an additional Rs155 billion to compensate for the higher fuel generation cost in June.
On Thursday, Nepra allowed unpreceden­ted fuel cost adjustments (FCA) of Rs11.37 to Karachi power utility K-Electric and Rs9.89 per unit to electricity distribution companies previously owned by Wapda, or Discos.
The higher electricity rates will be charged to all consumers in the billing month of August, except those whose monthly power consumption is fewer than 50 units.
On Tuesday, the government announced an increase of Rs7.91 per unit in average base tariff across the country in three phases starting with effect from July. It has also approved Rs1.55 per unit increase in base tariff across the country under a quarterly adjustment.

Nepra approves Rs11.37 per unit additional FCA for K-Electric, Rs9.90 for Discos

At the conclusion of two separate public hearings presided over by Nepra chairman Tauseef H. Farooqui and members Rafique Shaikh and Maqsood Anwar Khan, the power regulator “graciously” cut two paise each from the tariff increase demanded by both K-Electric and all 10 Discos.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) — a subsidiary of the power division — earlier filed a petition on behalf of Discos for a record Rs9.91 per unit additional mon­thly FCA for electricity sold to consumers in June to generate about Rs133bn in additional funds through the billing month of August.
The additional FCA is almost 166pc higher than the reference fuel cost charged to consumers in June, which is also an unprecedented mismatch between estimated and actual fuel costs. However, Nepra cleared an additional FCA of Rs9.89 per unit, two paise less than the amount sought.
Separately, K-Electric had requested for Rs11.39 per unit additional FCA for June with an additional revenue impact of Rs22.25bn. The Karachi-based power utility said a major reason behind its higher FCA was 50pc expensive liquified natural gas (LNG) and a 74pc increase in power purchase from the CPPA. As a result, Nepra cleared an additional FCA of Rs11.37 per unit.
Data showed that despite 52pc power generation from cheaper domestic resources with static prices, the Discos fuel cost increased by about Rs133bn in June. The CPPA claimed that Discos charged consumers a reference fuel cost of Rs5.93 per unit in June, but the actual cost turned out to be Rs15.84, hence an additional charge of about Rs9.91 to consumers, an increase of 166pc.
The share of domestic fuel sources in overall power generation was slightly lower at 52pc in June compared to 54pc in May and better than 50pc in April and 45pc in March.
The share of hydropower supply, which has no fuel cost, in the overall basket stood almost unchanged at more than 24pc, as was in May.
The share of nuclear power significantly dropped to 9pc in June from 13pc in May and 17.37pc in April after the 1,100-megawatt K-2 plant closed for refuelling.
As a result, the biggest contribution of over 24.4pc in overall power supply came from power plants running on imported RLNG, some of which was bought at highly expensive rates. That share of RLNG in June was nominally higher than 23pc in May.
The share of domestic gas in power generation increased to almost 11pc in June from 10pc in May and April.
The share of coal-based power plants was almost unchanged at 13.6pc in June and May but was significantly lower than 16.74pc in April and 25pc in March. The cost of power generation from domestic gas dropped to Rs8.9 per unit in June from Rs10.12 in May. The cost was Rs8.4 in April and Rs7.75 in March.
Three renewable energy sources — wind, bagasse and solar — together contributed 7pc power supply in June against 6.5pc in May.
With a share of 9pc in the overall power supply, the most expensive power generation came from furnace oil-based plants at Rs36.2 per unit in June against Rs33.67 in May, Rs28.2 in April and Rs22.52 in March.
The CPPA claimed that a total of 13,876 gigawatt-hours (GWh) were generated at the cost of Rs204bn in June, whereas net units delivered to Discos stood at 13,471 Gwh at the cost of Rs214bn.

1,‘Asia’s richest woman’ Yang Huiyan loses half her wealth in real estate crunch,"She saw her net worth plunge by more than 52pc to $11.3bn from $23.7bn a year ago, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.","

YANG Huiyan

 
BEIJING: Asia’s wealthiest woman lost more than half her fortune over the past year as China’s real estate sector was rocked by a cash crunch, a billionaire index showed on Thursday.
Yang Huiyan, a majority shareholder in Chinese property giant Country Garden, saw her net worth plunge by more than 52 percent to $11.3 billion from $23.7 billion a year ago, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Yang’s fortune took a major hit on Wednesday when the Guang­dong-based Country Gar­den’s Hong Kong-listed shares fell 15 percent after the company announced it would sell new shares to raise cash.
Yang inherited her wealth when her father — Country Garden founder Yang Guoqiang — transferred his shares to her in 2005, according to state media.
She became Asia’s richest woman two years later after the developer’s initial public offering in Hong Kong.
But she is now barely holding onto that title, with chemical fibres tycoon Fan Hongwei a close runner-up with a net worth of $11.2 billion on Thursday.
Chinese authorities cracked down on excessive debt in the property sector in 2020, leaving major players such as Evergrande and Sunac struggling to make payments and forcing them to renegotiate with creditors as they teetered on the edge of bankruptcy.
Buyers across the country, furious at lagging construction and delayed deliveries of their properties, have begun withholding mortg­age payments for homes sold before completion.

2,"Pakistan, China call for stability in Afghanistan",FM Bilawal meets Afghan counterpart on sidelines of SCO summit in Tashkent; Chinese envoy calls on PM Shehbaz.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and China on Thursday emphasised the need for stability in Afghanistan as Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari met his counterpart in the Taliban administration, Amir Khan Muttaqi, for the first time.
“The two sides agreed that peace and stability in Afghanistan was vital for regional development and prosperity,” Foreign Office said in a statement on the meeting between FM Bhutto-Zardari and Chinese top diplomat Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Tashkent.
The two foreign ministers, while emphasising the importance of “peaceful, stable and connected Afghanistan”, noted that it could become the “fulcrum for enhanced regional trade and connectivity”.

Pakistan and China share geo-political and economic interests in Afghanistan. Both had been relieved over Taliban takeover of the war-ravaged country last August. While both may be comfortable with Taliban rule in Afghanistan, but their security concerns could cause complications.

Bilawal meets Taliban minister on sidelines of SCO summit in Tashkent; Chinese envoy calls on PM Shehbaz

Islamabad and Beijing have lately been discussing the possibility of extending China-Pakistan Econo­mic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan.
Mr Zardari and Mr Yi, the FO said, discussed the latest developments in Afghanistan.
Taliban have been encouraging Pakistan government to make peace with Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, but Beijing is wary that East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a group of native Uyghurs who want to separate Xinjiang region from China, is active in Baghlan province, where it has re-established its base, despite restrictions by Taliban. The ETIM also has close linkages with the TTP.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari and Mr Yi also discussed bilateral relations.
“The foreign ministers reviewed the progress in bilateral relations and discussed regional and international issues of mutual interest,” the FO said, adding that FM Bhutto-Zardari underscored that CPEC’s development had reached a new phase, with increasing emphasis on high-quality development of industry, agriculture, IT, and science and technology, while ensuring tangible socio-economic benefits for the people.

“Both sides reaffirmed their strong support for each other’s core interests and major concerns, and commitment to deepening strategic communication including at the highest political level and practical cooperation,” the FO further said.
The foreign minister also met his Taliban counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi in Tashkent.
During his first meeting with Mr Muttaqi, the foreign minister reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to a peaceful and prosperous Afgha­nistan. He also emphasised the need for promoting people-to-people contacts, providing humanitarian assistance and increasing trade and transit capacity.
Meanwhile in Islamabad, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Nong Rong called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
This was Chinese envoy’s first meeting with PM Sharif as the former was on leave when the latter succeeded Imran Khan, who was ousted through a vote of no confidence.
Mr Sharif emphasised the importance of key projects like ML-1 and KCR in Pakistan’s development plans and expressed desire to move towards finalisation of these projects in the upcoming 11th meeting of the CPEC Joint Cooperation Committee, the PMO said.

3,Xi warns Biden not to ‘play with fire’ on Taiwan,Beijing and Washington increasingly risk open conflict over the self-ruling island.,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping held “candid” phone talks on Thursday, with Xi warning the US leader not to “play with fire” on Taiwan, according to Chinese state media.
The virtual summit lasting over two hours took place as Beijing and Washington increasingly risk open conflict over the self-ruling island, which China considers part of its territory.
“Those who play with fire will eventually get burned,” Xi was quoted as telling Biden in reference to Taiwan, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency -- using the same language he had employed when they spoke last November.
“I hope the US side fully understand that,” Xi told Biden.

Beijing and Washington increasingly risk open conflict over the self-ruling island

“The position of the Chinese government and people on the Taiwan issue is consistent,” Xi was quoted as saying. “It is the firm will of the over 1.4 billion Chinese people to firmly safeguard China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity.” While this was Biden’s fifth talk with Xi since becoming president a year and a half ago, it’s getting hard to mask deepening mistrust between the two countries amid a trade war and tensions over Taiwan.
The latest flashpoint is a possible trip by Biden ally and speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, to the island, which has its own distinct democratic government.
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby had said “tensions over China’s aggressive, coercive behavior in the Indo-Pacific” would be high on the agenda — using the US administration’s term for the Asia-Pacific region.
Although US officials frequently visit Taiwan, separated by a narrow strip of water from the Chinese mainland, Beijing considers a Pelosi trip as a major provocation. She is second in line to the US presidency and given her position may travel with military transport.
Washington will “bear the consequences” if the trip, which Pelosi has yet to confirm, goes ahead, China warned on Wednesday.
General Mark Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, told reporters that if Pelosi asks “for military support, we will do what is necessary to ensure a safe, safe conduct of their business”.
And the dispute around Pelosi is the tip of an iceberg, with US officials fearing that Xi is mulling use of force to impose control over democratic Taiwan.
Biden’s contradictory comments on whether the United States would defend Taiwan — he said in May that it would, before the White House insisted there was no change in the hands-off “strategic ambiguity” policy — have not helped the tension.
No face-to-face
Biden prides himself on a close relationship with Xi going back years but — in large part due to Covid travel restrictions — the two have yet to meet face-to-face since he took office.
According to the White House, Biden’s chief goal is to establish “guardrails” for the two superpowers.
This is meant to ensure that while they sharply disagree on democracy, and are increasingly rivals on the geopolitical stage, they can avoid open conflict.

4,Pakistan pulls out of chess contest over Kashmir concerns,"Says tournament host India has ""committed a travesty"" by holding a torch relay for the event through occupied Kashmir.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has withdrawn from the world’s biggest international chess tournament in protest at hosts India holding a torch relay for the event through the disputed Kashmir valley, officials said Thursday.
The 44th Chess Olympiad will see over 1,700 players from 188 nations compete in Chen­nai from now until August 10.
The last two competitions were played virtually because of the pandemic.
By passing the torch relay through India-held Kashmir, “India has committed a travesty that the international community cannot accept under any circumstances,” Pakistan’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
It said the matter would also be raised with the International Chess Federation and condemned the “mischievous attempt to mix politics with sports”.
A spokesman for India’s foreign ministry called the decision “surprising” and in turn accused Pakistan of politicising the event.
“I was told the team was already here,” Arindam Bagchi said.

5,Macron defies anger to welcome MBS,"Amnesty International official “profoundly troubled"" by visit because of ""what it means for our world and ... Jamal (Khashoggi)"".","PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday warmly welcomed Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for talks in Paris, defying anger sparked by hosting the controversial strongman less than four years after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The meeting is the latest step in the diplomatic rehabilitation of the de-facto leader of the kingdom who became a pariah in the West following the killing of Khashoggi by Saudi agents inside Saudi Arabia’s Istanbul consulate.
Macron warmly greeted the ruler universally known as MBS ahead of a dinner, with the two men enjoying a warm handshake that they emphasised by using all four hands.
Shaking off criticism from rights groups and Khashoggi’s fiancé, Macron then guided MBS up the steps on the red carpet into the Elysee Palace. MBS, seen by supporters as an ambitious and by critics as a tyrant with a ruthless streak, arrived in France following a visit from US President Joe Biden to Riyadh earlier this month. On his way to France, he stopped in Greece this week, his first trip to the EU since the murder of Khashoggi.
The killing of Khashoggi was described by a UN probe as an “extrajudicial killing for which Saudi Arabia is responsible”.
US intelligence agencies determined that MBS had “approved” the operation that led to Khashoggi’s death. Riyadh denies this, blaming rogue operatives.
“I am scandalised and outraged that Emmanuel Macron is receiving with all the honours the executioner of my fiancé, Jamal Khashoggi,” his widow Hatice Cengiz, who had waited outside the consulate in Istanbul when her husband disappeared, said on Thursday.
“All the international investigations carried out up to this point...recognise the responsibility of MBS in the assassination,” Cengiz said.
Amnesty International secretary general Agnes Callamard said she felt “profoundly troubled by the visit, because of what it means for our world and what it means for Jamal (Khashoggi) and people like him”. MBS is a man who “does not tolerate any dissent”, she added.

IN a rare occurrence, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were hit by heavy rains on Thursday, which flooded the streets, forcing many residents to seek shelter in hotels from the unusual summer deluge.
According to Khaleej Times, the downpour resulted in flash floods in the eastern parts of the UAE damaging houses and washing away vehicles. This extreme weather also prompted the UAE’s meteorological office to issue a red alert in light of “hazardous weather events” expected to continue on Thursday.
According to images and videos shared on social media, vehicles on a highway were brought to a standstill by floodwater after nearly a day-long rainfall. Other videos showed rescuers evacuating people stranded in the flooded areas.
Al Arabiya English reported that the UAE’s disaster management authority was coordinating with more than 20 hotels to provide 827 units that could house more than 1,885 people who were displaced by flooding. According to the disaster management authority, at least 870 individuals were rescued in Sharjah and Fujairah and at least 3,897 in total had been provided shelters. No casualties or serious injuries were recorded as losses were material only, the media outlet reported.

The UAE authorities were working to clear the inundated streets as they called on residents to remain vigilant and stay away from valleys, dams and mountains that “continue to display heavy flow of water”.
Torrential rain over recent days caused major disruption across the northern Emirates, leading to waterlogged roads and closures, overflowing wadis and damage to homes, The National News reported.

Meanwhile, the capital of Qatar was brought to a halt following heavy rains that submerged the streets of Doha. The Middle East Eye reported inundated streets and near-submerged cars close to World Cup structures as a result of the rain on Thursday. Qatar is expected to host football world cup in November this year.
According to Al Jazeera, the rain and thunder started early on Thursday morning and will last till the end of this week. “The head of forecasting and analysis at the QCAA’s Meteorological Department, Mohammed Ali al-Kubaisi, said that Doha had reco­rded approximately 38mm of rainfall (1.4 inches) by 10:00am local time (07:00 GMT), and 29.8mm (1.2 inches) in Al-Wakrah,” the media outlet quoted the Qatar News Agency (QNA) a saying.
It reported that “rain in July in Doha just doesn’t happen” as the reliable forecast for much of the Arabian Peninsula is hot, dry and dusty in summer. However, monsoon rains do affect some parts when it bursts out of India, most notably Oman and Yemen, which have regular summer thunderstorms, the media outlet reported.
