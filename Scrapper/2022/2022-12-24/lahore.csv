0,"PA adopts resolution against denotification of CM,cabinet",Demands president dismiss governor for ‘overstepping powers’,"LAHORE: Amid a walkout by the opposition, the Punjab Assembly on Friday adopted a resolution condemning the governor’s act of de-notifying the chief minister, and demanded the president sack Balighur Rehman for what it called his “unconstitutional” decision.  
A privilege motion was also moved against the governor, and Speaker Sibtain Khan referred it to the committee seeking a report on it within two months.  
The stormy assembly sitting, held after a break of two days, began more than two hours behind its scheduled time. At least 143 members of the ruling alliance – PTI and PML-Q – and 115 from the opposition benches, including the PML-N, PPP, Rah-i-Haq Party and a couple of independents, were present during the proceedings. 
The house unanimously passed two bills – the Punjab Holy Quran Printing and Recording (Amendment) Bill 2022 and Khatimun Nabiyeen University Lahore Bill 2022. (Then de-notified and later reinstated) Chief Minister Parvez Elahi, who was also in attendance, took credit for both pieces of legislation. 

Demands president dismiss governor for ‘overstepping powers’

However, a pandemonium was witnessed in the house when the treasury announced introducing a resolution against the governor for his action against the chief minister. The opposition MPAs stood up from their seats and reached the open area before the treasury benches, and a match of sloganeering ensued.  
The treasury was chanting “Imported government unacceptable” and “Gali gali mein shor hai, sara tabbar chor hai”, whereas the opposition was shouting “Ghari chor”.  
The opposition walked out of the house when Law Minister Raja Basharat introduced the resolution out of turn condemning the governor’s late night act of de-notifying the chief minister and his cabinet.  
Both were restored by the Lahore High Court on Friday evening on a condition that Mr Elahi would not send his advice for dissolution of the assembly till a final court verdict on the issue.  
The resolution demanded the president immediately dismiss Balighur Rehman as the governor for “overstepping his powers, insulting public mandate, breaching privilege of the house and creating constitutional and administrative crises in the province”. 
It expressed confidence in CM Elahi and endorsed the speaker’s ruling against the governor’s action. It alleged that the federal government was indulging in illegal tactics of horse-trading and floor-crossing to destabilise an elected government of the PTI and PML-Q alliance in the province.  
Raja Basharat also moved a privilege motion against the governor for de-notifying the chief minister and his cabinet, and demanded the action be considered as a breach of the privilege of the whole house, transgression of the Constitution and the law of land, and an insult to the millions of voters of the province.  
The chair referred the motion to the Special Committee No-8 and sought a report within two months.  
PARLIAMENTARY PARTY: A joint parliamentary party meeting of the PTI and PML-Q at the Punjab Assembly on Friday expressed their trust in the leadership of PTI Chairman Imran Khan and Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi.
Mr Elahi presided over the meeting. It also condemned the unconstitutional and unlawful acts of the governor.
The meeting resolved to vehemently protest the unconstitutional and unlawful step of the governor at every forum.
Meanwhile, Mr Elahi said he thanked Allah Almighty for getting the Khatimun Nabiyeen University Bill and the Quran Act Bill passed by the Punjab Assembly.
Addressing the session of the Punjab Assembly, Mr Elahi stated that Quran education has been made mandatory in all private and government schools up to the FA level, adding that historic legislation was made with regard to elevating religion and Khatam-e-Nabuwat (SAW) during the tenure of Imran Khan and our government.
He stated that the religious segment prayed for us to continue our religious service work. We and future generations will continue to serve the religion. He also said that the approval of the Punjab Public Defendant Service Bill by the Punjab Cabinet was a historic step to provide free legal aid to the common man. With the approval of this bill, the Punjab government will provide free legal aid to the common man, adding that the provision of justice to the common man will also be ensured.

1,Toshakhana case hearing to resume next month,"A three-member bench is set to take up the petitions on Jan 9, 2023.","LAHORE: A Lahore High Court (LHC) full bench will resume its hearing the next month on two identical petitions concerning PTI Chairman Imran Khan’s disqualification by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the Toshakhana case. 
Headed by Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti, the full bench includes Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh and Justice Said Mahmoud Sethi . The bench is set to take up the petitions on Jan 9, 2023. 
One of the petitioners, Jabir Abbas Khan, a voter from the NA-95 constituency, filed an application through his counsel Azhar Siddique for an early hearing of his petition. 
In his petition, Khan challenged the legitimacy of Section 137(4) of the Elections Act 2017 invoked by the ECP to de-seat him. 
He argued that the PTI chairman had been disqualified under sections 137(4), 167 and 173 of the Elections Act despite the fact that these sections did not mention the word `disqualification`. 
Beside, he argued, under section 137 of the act, the prosecution could only be initiated within 120 days of the filing of false asset statements. In Mr Khan`s case, the last such statement was filed on Dec 31 last year. 
The petitioner said the ECP `illegally and unlawfully` disqualified Mr Khan under Article 63(1p) of the Constitution, along with sections 137 and173 of the Elections Act, because section 137 specified only a three-year punishment or fine or both, and not disqualification. 
He asked the court to declare Section 137(4) of the Elections Act ultra vires to the Constitution and restrain the ECP from taking any action until the petition is being heard. 
The other petition filed by Advocate Mohammad Afaq stated that the ECP disqualified the former prime minister and de-seated him from Mianwali’s NA-95 constituency on charges of corrupt practices. 
Therefore, as per the Representation of Peoples Act 1976 and the Political Parties Order 2002, the office-bearers of a political party must meet the standards provided in Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution. 
He argued that Mr Khan was violating the laws by continuing to head the PTI, a party registered with the ECP, and that a person disqualified under Article 63 was not entitled to become or stay as an office-bearer of a political party. 
The petitioner asked the court to order the ECP to remove Mr Khan as head of the PTI and direct the party to nominate a new chief.

2,Ruda receives proposals for wastewater treatment,LAHORE: The Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda) has received proposals from various international firms for...,"LAHORE: The Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda) has received proposals from various international firms for establishing six wastewater treatment plants that will ensure disposal of sewer into the river after treatment.
Since the authority has accelerated pace of works on various river training works, including construction of a huge embankment initially up to three kilometers (on both sides of the river) in a bid to protect the population from floods, it has also got the wastewater, being disposed into the river bed at six different points through several small and major drains, tested in a bid to know its specification and make it compatible for treatment, Dawn has learnt.
“We are doing several works these days in the project area. These works are related to river training, environment, development of residential areas in phase-1,” the Ruda Chief Executive Officer Imran Ameen told Dawn on Friday. 
Talking about the water treatment plants, Mr Ameen said it was a good news for the Lahorites that various local and international firms have expressed interest by submitting viable proposals to establish six wastewater treatment plants at the points where the entire Lahore’s wastewater, including the domestic, commercial and industrial and storm water is being disposed of through six drains.  
“After scrutiny of proposals for wastewater plants, we will go for tendering/bidding process,” he added. 
The Ruda chief said keeping in view the lab test results of the drains’ wastewater, it has been decided to cover all major drains in the city since their existing flow is injurious to public health.  
“We have also ensured cleaning of these drains by getting them desilting in collaboration with the departments concerned,” he said, adding that these open drains are also spreading dengue virus in Lahore. 
Mr Ameen revealed that the water to be disposed in the Ravi after treatment would be best for fishing, irrigation and other uses. According to him, it will preserve the 2.7 billion litre of water that will further help recharge the aquifer by increasing the water table that is currently depleting fast. The Ruda also plans to give this aquatic quality water to the industry so that it could stop extraction of water in the area through heavy turbines. 
“We are also going to have an agreement with the UN-Habitat in a bid to launch various schemes to improve environment in the entire project area. 
A 200-feet wide 46 km long marine drive road has also been planned on both sides of the river. Construction of roads with development of some parks with sitting area along the river banks will develop a beautiful riverfront in the project area. 
The Ruda CEO said the authority has decided to relocate the existing solid waste landfill site at Lakhudair to another area since it is releasing dangerous methane gas.“We have convinced the Lahore Waste Management Company to build another site. After shifting the landfill site, we plan to develop a park over this land,” he maintained, adding that the designs of three barrages to be constructed at three sites in the project area have also been finalised. 
It merits mentioning that the Rs5 trillion Ravi project, conceived by the PML-N government in 2013, was launched by the former PM Imran Khan in August 2020 by laying the foundation stone at the project site.

10,"PHEC chief, members oppose eight amendments proposed by HED",Express fear amends to PHEC Act will make commission toothless,"LAHORE: The Punjab Higher Education Commission (PHEC) chairperson and members have opposed all the eight amendments proposed by the Higher Education Department (HED) to the PHEC Act 2014, fearing that they would curtail the commission’s role to regulate the public and private higher education institutions (HEIs) and make it toothless.  
The chairman wrote to the chief minister, complaining that the commission was not taken on board regarding the proposed amendments. 
The Punjab Higher Education Department (HED) and private member bills were recently moved to the Punjab Assembly, seeking eight amendments to the PHEC Act 2014. The HED had proposed six amendments to the Act, including amendments in sections 3, 5, 10 and 12 and a general amendment, while the private member bill had proposed two amendments to sections 10 and 12. 
On Dec 19, the 29th meeting of the PHEC was held to discuss proposed amendments to the PHEC Act 2014. PHEC Chairperson Prof Dr Shahid Munir, HED, Specialised Health and Medical Education Department and Finance Department secretaries, Accreditation Committee chairperson Prof Dr Muhammad Ali and 10 other members were present in the meeting. The members discussed all the amendments one by one and pointed out their concerns. 

Express fear amends to PHEC Act will make commission toothless

The HED bill proposes amendment to Section-3, stating that the chief minister is currently the controlling authority of the commission and the CM’s powers should be delegated to the minister of higher education. “The Controlling Authority may delegate its powers and authority to the Minister in-charge of Higher Education Department of the Government,” it said. The PHEC members, during the meeting, remarked that the purpose of the establishment of the commission was to perform its functions autonomously. Higher education also includes health, agriculture, livestock and technical education and the chief minister should be the controlling authority of the PHEC instead of the minister of higher education, the members said. 
Another proposal was aiming to curtail financial, administrative and academic powers of the chairman of the PHEC. The PHEC members said the change would make the post of the chairperson redundant and challenge the in-dependency of the post. 
A proposed amendment also includes reducing members of the PHEC in the accreditation committee from three to one and giving authority to the government to constitute one or more committees. The PHEC members were of the view that the amendment would result in delaying the process of accreditation for a long period and the prevailing practice of accreditation was more effective. 
The department also proposed two general amendments, including adding two more sections 28 and 29 in the PHEC Act 2014, one for performance audit of the commission while another for fixing penalty over any misconduct and negligence in the commission. The PHEC members said Section 17 of the PHEC Act had already defined the procedure for audit and there was no need to include this amendment while the penalty clause should be included in the PHEC Act 2014. However, the private member bill would suggest amendments to the Section 10 of the PHEC Act to bypass the regularity role of the commission for old public and private institutions. 
The PHEC members said that the objective given in the preamble and Section 10 described the application of provision of the Act to the institution without any distinction whether the institution was old or new. The amendment would not be prudent exercise to exclude the old institutions from the ambit of the law and if it was so the whole provisions which regulated the national standards prepared by the HEC Islamabad under which public and private institution might be opened and operated, cause monitoring and evaluation of performance of the institution and carry out accreditation of the institutions, including sub-campuses and other discipline would be ceased. It would also shorten the scope of the commission and deteriorate the quality of education. It would restrict PHEC to new institutions and it could not prescribe guidelines and policies. 
While another proposed amendment wanted to challenge the authority of the commission in prescribing any conditions for the higher education institutes (HEIs). The amendment would result in damaging quality and standardisation of education, in view of the PHEC members. 
The private member bill also proposed amendment to Section 12 of the PHEC Act 2014, stating in the sub-section (2) that the accreditation committee should work as per direction of the commission to make recommendations regarding evaluation. The members remarked that the amendment was challenging the independent role of the accreditation committee to ensure transparency and restrict its role to evaluation only. 
PHEC Chairperson Prof Dr Shahid Munir had written a letter to Chief Minister Parvez Elahi under the subject: PHEC Amendment Bill 2022, stating that an amendment through private member bill “The Punjab Higher Education Commission Amendment Bill 2022” has been placed in the assembly and referred to the Standing Committee on Higher Education for consideration. 
The letters, available with Dawn, showed grave concern of the PHEC chairperson that the commission, being a major stakeholder, was not taken on board for the said amendments and some amendments were proposed without any input of the organisation. 
They further stated that these amendments would deteriorate the quality of education in the province and would compromise the working of the commission, as well. The amendments would make the commission toothless and cease to put any check and balance on the sector, the PHEC chairperson said, requesting the CM that all the stakeholders should be heard before carrying out any legislation.

12,Kaira asks Parvez Elahi to prove majority or leave,Says the governor was constitutionally empowered to ask the chief minister to take a vote of confidence but Elahi failed to do so,"LAHORE: Prime Minister’s Adviser on Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan Qamar Zaman Kaira has challenged Punjab Chief Minister Parvez Elahi to prove his majority in the house by taking a vote of confidence instead of making tall claims in private meetings and public places.
Speaking at a reception hosted by Lahore chapter PPP president Aslam Gill here on Friday, he said that instead of clinging to power by force, Mr Elahi should seek a confidence vote in the Punjab Assembly, as directed by the provincial governor.
He said the majority should be proved in the elected house instead of by holding parliamentary meetings at homes [where no impartial party has authority to judge].
Flanked by Sindh Minister Nasir Ali Shah and Punjab PPP general secretary Hassan Murtaza, the adviser said that as per the constitution, a sitting of the assembly could be summoned any time to take a vote of confidence, and there’s no bar that a new session could not be called when another session is already in progress.
He said that the governor was constitutionally empowered to ask the chief minister to take a vote of confidence but Mr Elahi failed to do so.
He said that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) had never asked that it would hold elections if the assemblies were dissolved.
He chided the PTI for its double standards: continuing to sit in the two assemblies of Sindh and Balochistan, while dissolving that of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as well as contesting by-polls for the latter two houses.
Mr Kaira defended the federal government vis-à-vis inflation and blamed the agreement with the IMF signed by the PTI when it was in power, for the price hike. He said had the incumbent government not honored this agreement, it would have been a dangerous move for the financial future of the country.
He said Pakistan is not the only country in the grip of inflation; rather, all nations in the world are suffering from it.
He alleged that Mr Khan wanted to push the country towards default and that whether in power or in opposition, the PTI chairman weakened democracy.
He stated that the funds for flood victims were arranged by the federal government by reducing its annual development plan, rather than from the provincial funds.
He said that the PDM would check every assault on the governance system and democracy as well as dissolution of assemblies while remaining within the bounds of the Constitution and law.
He recalled that the budget session in Punjab was continued for five months by the Elahi government only to block any move for requiring him to take a vote of confidence.
