0,Rainwater storage tank planned,LAHORE: A rainwater harvesting tank will be constructed at Gulberg by the Punjab Central Business District...,"LAHORE: A rainwater harvesting tank will be constructed at Gulberg by the Punjab Central Business District Development Authority (PCBDDA).  
At a briefing, Executive Director Riaz Hussain said the Kalma Chowk Underpass water storage tank is not big enough to hold the additional 14 cusecs of rainwater from the two new barrels.  
At Saint Mary’s Park in Gulberg, the tank will have a capacity to hold 300,000 gallons of water. 
The water will be purified and utilised again for horticulture and park irrigation.
He claimed the tank would prevent flooding and other problems related to water waste, soil erosion and water contamination. 
The storage would serve as a source of water in an emergency and would be crucial to raising groundwater levels. 
He claimed the Parks and Horticulture Authority had granted the PCBDDA clearance to build the water storage tank. The cost of the tank is Rs30.8 million.

1,Protest in Quetta against Taliban ban on women’s education,The protest was carried out by the workers and supporters of the National Democratic Party.,"QUETTA: Political activists and students on Friday held a protest against the Afghan government’s decision to impose a ban on women’s university education.
The protesters, including women, carried placards and banners and cha­nted slogans as they marched on dif­ferent roads in the provincial capital.
The protest was carried out by the workers and supporters of the National Democratic Party (NDP).
They later gathered in front of the Quetta Press Club where NDP Balochistan President Ahmed Jan Khan addressed the crowd.
Mr Khan strongly condemned the decision of the Taliban government and said it would deprive half of the country’s population of education.
Even during the Afghan war, the education institutions were not closed for women and they were allowed to continue education, he added.
He said the Taliban government came to power in the name of Islam but is now “trying to distort the history of Afghanistan”.
Mr Khan said the decision was “a gross violation of the basic rights of women” and it could not be accepted.
Islam was never against the education of women, he said.
Other speakers also condemned the decision and said Afghanistan cannot progress by depriving half of the population of education.
They appealed to the UN and other nations to play their part in forcing the Afghan government to lift the ban.
They also demanded Islamabad to pressurise the Taliban government to allow women to continue their education.
On Dec 20, the Afghan ministry of higher education imposed an indefinite ban on university education for women, according to AFP.
The ban comes less than three months after thousands of female students sat university entrance exams across the country, with many aspiring to choose engineering and medicine as future careers.

2,"Suleman gets pre-arrest bail in NAB, FIA cases","LAHORE: An accountability court here on Friday granted interim pre-arrest bail to Suleman Shehbaz, youn­ger son of...","LAHORE: An accountability court here on Friday granted interim pre-arrest bail to Suleman Shehbaz, youn­ger son of Prime Min­is­ter Shehbaz Sharif, in a mo­­ney laundering reference filed by the National Accou­ntability Bureau (NAB). 
Suleman along with his legal team appeared before the court. The court allowed the bail to Suleman till Jan 7 subject to furnishing of sure­­ty bonds and directed him to join the NAB investigation.
Later, Suleman also appe­ared before a special court (Central-I) for pre-arrest bail in a money laundering case lodged by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
The court granted bail to Suleman till Jan 7 with a direction to join the investigation before the FIA. 
PM Shehbaz’s son Sulem­­an, daughter Rabia Imran and son-in-law Haroon You­saf were declared absconders by the court for avoiding their appearance in the proceedings. 
Suleman recently ended his self-exile and returned to the country after securing an interim protective bail from the Islamabad High Court.
In its money laundering reference, NAB alleged that the family members and benamidars of PM Shehbaz received fake foreign remittances of billions of rupees in their personal bank acco­unts. In the FIA case, PM Shehbaz and his son Hamza have been acquitted by a trial court.

3,Assemblies have to be dissolved at any cost: Fawad,• Insists matter may not stretch beyond a week or so • Imran alleges establishment still following ‘Bajwa doctrine’,"• Insists matter may not stretch beyond a week or so
• Imran alleges establishment still following ‘Bajwa doctrine’
• Says plans afoot to push elections beyond 2023                                
LAHORE: The Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies “will have to be ultimately dissolved” at any cost, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry said on Friday, rhetorically insisting that the matter would not stretch beyond a week or so, despite the chief minister’s assurance to the court that no such action would be taken until a Jan 11 hearing.
“The assemblies will have to be dissolved. Elections will have to happen,” the former information minister told reporters after senior party leaders’ meeting with PTI Chairman Imran Khan on Friday.
On the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Friday verdict to reinstate PML-Q leader Chaudhry Parvez Elahi as Punjab’s chief minister, Mr Chaudhry said the court had “rightly” rejected the governor’s move to dismiss Mr Elahi.
The LHC’s order came after Mr Elahi submitted an undertaking assuring the court that he would not dissolve the provincial assembly until the next hearing scheduled for Jan 11.
On this, Fawad Chaudhry said the PTI did not agree with the court’s reasoning but ultimately decided to submit an undertaking “for one date [but] not beyond that”.
“Ultimately, the assemblies have to be dissolved — you can take a week or 1.5 weeks, but the matter will not stretch beyond that,” he said.
“The restoration [of the chief minister] has proved that the governor’s notification was unconstitutional […] an unelected and selected governor can’t send an elected chief minister home,” he said. He regretted that former President Asif Ali Zardari and Sindh government ministers had reached Lahore with “bags full of money to attempt to buy PTI and PML-Q lawmakers”.
Mr Chaudhry lambasted the elements that he said had “detained” newly posted chief secretary Abdullah Khan Sumbal and forced him to sign the notification of de-notifying the chief minister and dissolving the provincial cabinet.
The PTI leader said the Punjab Assembly, after adopting a resolution and converting the house proceedings into a privilege committee, had summoned Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman to explain his misconduct and Mr Sumbal to explain what happened and “who forced him to sign the notification after midnight on Thursday”.
“I hope the chief secretary would explain to the Punjab Assembly how he dared to take an unconstitutional step of signing the notification soon after the governor’s unconstitutional order,” Mr Chaudhry said. “Only elected representatives can elect or remove a chief minister.”
Mr Chaudhry urged President Dr Arif Alvi to immediately start proceedings against the governor on a letter written by Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan.
‘Military toeing Bajwa doctrine’
Earlier in meetings with party leaders and senior journalists, PTI chief Imran Khan alleged that the military establishment was still toeing the “Bajwa doctrine” and asserted that the top military boss was actually the real establishment.
Mr Khan said he had no contact with the new military establishment. “I did stay in contact with [former army chief retired] Gen Bajwa, but he continued showing green pastures to everyone,” he added.
Acknowledging that the establishment was a reality, Mr Khan said it could play its role in ensuring the rule of law.
Alleging that former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa had even called Shehbaz Sharif when he was in prison, Mr Khan said the establishment had imposed the corrupt and plunderers to rule the country and added that there were plans to push the elections beyond 2023.
However, he said, the critical economic situation did not warrant taking polls beyond February or March.

4,ECP order against govt decision on Islamabad UCs set aside,IHC directs election commission to hear all parties on Dec 27 and decide the matter afresh.,"ISLAMABAD: In yet another twist to the local elections in the federal capital, scheduled for Dec 31, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday set aside the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) order of revoking the cabinet’s decision of increasing number of union councils from 101 to 125 and directed the ECP to decide the matter afresh after hearing all stakeholders on Dec 27.
The order was issued on a set of petitions filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and a candidate of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) about election schedule, voters and candidates of different union councils related to voters’ list, as well as the aggrieved parties that challenged the recent ECP order to reject government decision regarding number of union councils.
While pronouncing the verdict, Chief Justice Aamer Farooq observed the IHC “cannot interfere in the decision of the federal government undertaken to devolve power in true spirit to the people of the locality and if in its wisdom.
“Election Commission ought to have understood the perspective of the federal government before passing the impugned order dated Dec 20, 2022 which on the face of it violates Section 4(4) of the Act of 2015.”

Court directs commission to hear all parties on 27th and decide matter afresh

As the case in hand seemed to be that of ‘first impression’, the ECP ought to have provided an opportunity to all concerned before arriving at a conclusion vide order dated Dec 20, Justice Farooq remarked.
The court earlier divided the petitions into two categories. In one set, petitioners were candidates for the local elections or voters of different union councils who sought corrections in voters’ list, whereas the other set included petitioners who challenged the ECP order against government’s decision to increase number of UCs in Islamabad from 101 to 125.
The petitioner, in the first category, contended that under Article 218 (3) of Constitution, it was ECP’s duty to hold fair and transparent elections. 
In its order, the court stated: “Since the discrepancies pointed out in the voters’ list and the grievance raised in the first category of the case seems to be plausible and bona fide, hence the ECP is required to look into the matter and turning a blind eye would tantamount to flouting the spirit of the Constitution and Elections Act, 2017.”
The court converted those petitions into representation and remitted to the ECP to consider the grievances, mentioning that the correction of electoral rolls was provided in Sections 34 and 35 of the act.
Election schedule
In the other set of the litigation, the petitioners were aggrieved of the ECP decision whereby notwithstanding the change in number of UCs, the elections had been ordered to be held as per schedule.
Advocate General, Islamabad, Jahangir Khan Jadoon and Advocate Qazi Adil Aziz argued that the fact that the federal government was bound to promote and enhance the local bodies was not taken into account by the ECP. It was contended that before issuing the impugned order, the ECP did not provide an opportunity of hearing to anyone.
Attorney General Ashtar Ausaf Ali argued before the court that bar regarding alteration was provided in Section 4(4) of the Local Government Act, while no such restriction was provided in Section 6 of the act. He said Section 4 was broader in as much as it talks of broader division of local area in Islamabad into union councils and metropolitan corporation, whereas Section 6 dealt with change in the number of UCs.
ECP DG (Law) Mohammad Arshad claimed there was no flaw in the voters’ list, which he said was according to law in the letter and spirit. He argued that no alteration in local area could be carried out under Section 4(4) of the LG Act once the election schedule had been out.
Sardar Taimoor Aslam, counsel for a petitioner, also defended the ECP order and sought direction to it for holding of elections as per schedule.
The court after hearing arguments remanded the case to the ECP.
The IHC directed the commission to decide the matter afresh after affording opportunity to all the concerned, including the federal government and taking into consideration the law. “The parties for the purpose of decision on notification dated Dec 19 shall appear before the Commission on Dec 27,” it ruled.

5,New biometric system for SIM cards,The new biome­t­ric verification system will be used by telecom companies to verify users’ identities before issuing a new SIM.,"ISLAMABAD: An enhan­ced version of the biometric verification system has been designed to thwart the sale of fake SIM cards.
The Multi-Finger Biome­t­ric Verification System (MBVS) will be used by telecom companies to verify users’ identities before issuing a new SIM. A contract was signed be­­tween Nadra and telecom ope­rators at PTA headquarters on Friday.

 





 
The move was necessitated by scammers who had managed to bypass the older biometric system designed to identify users before issuing SIM cards. 
The old biometric verification devices used by the sales departments of all network providers — Jazz, Uf­­o­ne, Tel­enor and Zong — have been upgraded to meet the requi­rements of the new system.
Officials believe the new system will make it impossible to get a new SIM card using fake fingerprints.
The new system will require impressions of multiple fingers for authentication — as opposed to only a thumb impression in the old system — before issuing a new or duplicate SIM card.
The system will ask for impressions of two separate fingers randomly, a move aimed at minimising human control over the system.

6,"COAS visits frontline troops in Miramshah, Tarbela",Hails the ‘sacrifices’ of SSG commandos,"PESHAWAR: Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Asim Munir visited Miramshah and Tarbela on Friday, a statement issued by the military’s media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
The army chief laid a floral wreath at the martyrs’ monument and paid homage to brave soldiers who laid down their lives while defending the motherland, the statement added.
The army chief also visited frontline tro­ops deployed along the  Pak-Afghan border and commended the professionalism, mor­ale and  operational readiness of the force.
The COAS was briefed by field commanders on the latest security situation in the area and the response mechanisms to counter terrorist threats.

Hails the ‘sacrifices’ of SSG commandos

“Pakistan Army remains focused on the evolving security situation and determined to take the battle to the terrorists and break nexus with their facilitators so as to ensure lasting peace through socio-economic development,” the statement quoted the COAS as saying.
“Pakistan Army will consolidate the hard-earned peace, made possible by the supreme sacrifices of the resilient nation and law enforcement agencies,” the statement added.
Later, Gen Munir also visited the Special Services Group’s (SSG) headquarters and met officers and soldiers including the elite Zarrar company, whose soldiers carried out the operation at the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) centre in Bannu.
The COAS praised the “indomitable spi­rit, sacrifices and commitment to the duty” of SSG personnel, the statement read.
“SSG is the pride of the nation and it has proved its mettle over the years,” the statement quoted Gen Munir as saying.
Upon his arrival, the COAS was received by Commander Peshawar Corps Lt Gen Hassan Azhar Hayat.
The army chief’s visit has come at a time when Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s districts, esp­ecially tribal areas bordering Afghanistan are seeing a surge in terrorist attacks.
Last week, terrorists from the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan took security personnel hostage after taking over the CTD centre in Bannu.
After a 48-hour-long standoff, the centre was cleared by SSG commandos who eliminated all terrorists.
In another attack on Dec 14, three civilians were killed and 14, including nine security personnel, were wounded in a suicide attack in the Sargardan area of North Waziristan.

7,Mansoor Awan named new attorney general,Tauqir Shah reappointed as PM’s principal secretary; cabinet swells to 77 members with addition of Shehryar Ali as SAPM.,"• Tauqir Shah reappointed as premier’s principal secretary
• Cabinet swells to 77 members with addition of Shehryar Ali as SAPM
ISLAMABAD: Mansoor Usman Awan, a young lawyer from Lahore, has been appointed as the new attorney general for Pakistan (AGP) after President Dr Arif Alvi approved his nomination on Friday as the country’s 37th principal law officer.
Meanwhile, Dr Syed Tauqir Hussain Shah has been reappointed as the premier’s principal secretary, whereas Shehryar Ali Khan has been named as the premier’s special aide on privatisation, inflating the cabinet size to 77 members.
Mr Awan came to prominence when he represented the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) during a presidential reference interpreting Article 63A of the Constitution that deals with defection.
His appointment comes after his predecessor, Ashtar Ausaf Ali, resigned in October, citing health reasons. 
Mr Ali was retained by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to continue serving the office until his successor is found.
President House said in a statement that Dr Alvi had approved Mr Awan’s appo­i­ntment as AGP after accepting Mr Ali’s resignation.
“Mansoor Awan is a dynamic, smart and young lawyer who enjoys a good reputation and will serve the office in a befitting manner,” commented Additional Attorney General Chaudhry Aamir Rehman, who represented the AGP office before the Supreme Court in the absence of Mr Ali in several high-profile cases, including a presidential reference on the Reko Diq mining project, and a challenge by PTI Chairman Imran Khan to the amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance.


TauqIr Shah

 
The AGP has been appoi­nted under Article 100 of the Constitution, and clause 1 of the provision states: “The president shall appo­int a person, being a person qualified to be a judge of the Supreme Court, to be the Attorney General for Pakistan.”
Under the Constitution, the president is bound to act upon the advice of the prime minister.
Mr Awan’s name was making rounds since he had been advising the prime minister on many legal issues for quite some time.
Earlier, he filed a petition in the Supreme Court on behalf of the SCBA seeking a declaration that invoking Article 62(1f) of the Constitution against politicians only applied to the election under question and did not entail a perpetual or lifetime bar.
The challenge is perceived to be filed before the top court to rescue PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and former PTI leader Jehangir Khan Tareen by challenging their perpetual ineligibility to become parliamentarians. The petition is still pending.
Mr Awan did a Master of Laws (LLM) in 2005 from Harvard Law School and received Dean’s Award for Leadership. He also served as president of the Harvard Graduate Council in 2004-05.
He did a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) from the Punjab University Law College Lahore in 2002 and earned the Justice M. Jan Memorial gold medal for the first position in jurisprudence, and the Charles Earl Bevan Petman law prize for the first position in criminal law.
Tauqir Shah reappointed
Dr Syed Tauqir Hussain Shah, who retired as the principal secretary to the prime minister (PSPM) at the age of superannuation, was reappointed on Friday.
Dr Shah, who was serving in grade 22, has been reappointed with effect from Dec 25, for one year at his last pay and allowances.
He has a long association with Prime Minister Sharif, having served as Mr Sharif’s principal secretary when he ruled Punjab for several years.
Dr Shah, a native of Islamabad and considered one of the most seasoned and experienced bureaucrats in the present lot, was first appointed as a PSPM on April 12, soon after PTI chief Imran Khan was deposed as premier through a confidence vote in parliament.
Meanwhile, the prime minister has also appointed Shehryar Ali Khan as his special assistant (SAPM) on privatisation, increasing the total number of members of the federal cabinet to 77. He has been given the status of a state minister.
According to the cabinet division’s website, there are 34 federal ministers, seven state ministers, and four advisers and 31 special assistants to the premier. With the addition of Mr Khan, the number of SAPMs has now reached 32.

8,Death toll of Lasbela cylinder blast jumps to 18,The victims were under treatment at Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital’s Burns Centre in Karachi where they succumbed to injuries.,"KHUZDAR: Three more victims of Monday’s gas cylinder blast in Lasbela lost their lives on Thursday, taking the death toll to 18.
They were undergoing treatment at Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital’s Burns Centre in Karachi where they succumbed to injuries.
Burn Centre’s in-charge Dr Rubina Bashir told Dawn that the condition of at least four more injured is serious. 
She said seven injured are still under treatment in the hospital. 
Earlier, around 26 people received burn injuries when a gas cylinder exploded at a LPG shop in Lasbela’s Bela town. 
One person died on the spot while the injured were moved to Karachi, most of them with 70 to 90 per cent burn injuries.
According to the police, the cylinder exploded while being refilled at the shop. The gas cylinders dumped inside the shop also caught fire as it spread to neighbouring shops and gutted over 30 motorcycles parked nearby. 
An inquiry has been initiated to fix responsibility for the incident.

9,‘Energy sector offers significant investment opportunities’,Report says Pakistan needs to address challenges for favourable climate investment,"ISLAMABAD: The ‘Energy Outlook 2030’ published by the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) says Pakistan’s energy sector presents significant investment opportunities because of its efforts to transition to a more competitive energy market structure, its continued support for private projects, and the government’s commitment to significantly develop renewable energy sources in the future. 
At the same time, Pakistan needs to address several challenges to introduce a more favourable investment climate, including circular debt issues, and the overall condition and coverage of the transmission and distribution (T&D) grid, according to the report made available by the Asian Development Bank. 
To further unlock Pakistan’s energy market for private companies, several challenges must be addressed. One of the key challenges is the lack of clarity regarding the categorisation of resources. 

Report says Pakistan needs to address challenges for favourable climate investment

Considering the 30pc renewable energy target in 2030, it would be hardly possible to reach this level only via wind and solar PV sources. If hydropower were to be included in the definition of renewable energy sources, it would make reaching the stated target and introducing stronger competition more realistic. 
The report says another challenge is the lack of a detailed energy plan for the energy sector. Although the National Energy Policy has been approved, the corresponding division of roles in policymakers who would assign policy areas to all relevant stakeholders has not been completed yet. 
In addition to the development of renewable energy and alternative sources, such as nuclear power, priority investments in Pakistan include the introduction of smart metering and smart grids, as well as energy efficiency measures.
Further development of the T&D network is crucial for the country, as 25pc of the population is not grid-connected and thus it has no access to the electricity network. 
The outlook report says total investment needs for the energy sector vary significantly across all three scenarios — from $62 billion to $155bn. 
The country has vast renewable energy resources, with total technical potential reaching 2,900 gigawatts for solar, 340GW for wind, and 60GW for hydropower. 
Total installed power generation capacity in Pakistan is 34.5GW, and consists mostly of thermal generation, reaching around 66pc of the total. The significance of thermal generation is expected to decrease in the future, since the government has set a course to shift toward increasing renewable energy (including hydropower) generation. Pakistan’s massive renewable energy potential — about 3.0 terawatts — is one of the key drivers of this shift.
