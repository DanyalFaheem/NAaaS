0,Weekly inflation surges 29pc,"ISLAMABAD: The weekly inflation, measured by the Sensitive Price Index (SPI), posted an increase of 28.76 per cent...","ISLAMABAD: The weekly inflation, measured by the Sensitive Price Index (SPI), posted an increase of 28.76 per cent for the combined income group on a year-on-year basis ending Dec 22 due to a massive surge in prices of both food and non-food items, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) on Friday.
On a year-on-year basis, the items whose prices jumped the most included onions (482.30pc), chicken (67.42pc), tea Lipton (65.41pc), diesel (65.05pc), petrol (52.19pc), salt powdered (51.99pc), bananas (47.95pc), pulse moong (47.13pc), eggs (47.07pc), pulse gram (45.24pc) and mustard oil (40.97pc).
However, the SPI on a week-on-week basis slightly fell by 0.11pc for the week under review. This was mainly because oil prices slightly dropped while few vegetable prices also posted a slight decline.
The price of petrol dropped (4.45pc), diesel (3.20pc) and LPG (0.23pc), respectively. The WoW decline in inflation is mainly because of a drop in petroleum prices.The average price of tomatoes in the market ranges between Rs80 to Rs120 per kg while that of onions is in the range of around Rs230 per kg to Rs260, respectively. 
Similarly, the potato price ranges between Rs60 per kg to Rs90.
In the food group, the items that saw the highest week-on-week increase in prices include chicken (9.86pc), pulse masoor (2.00pc), tea Lipton (1.72pc), rice Irri-6/9 (1.15pc) and wheat flour (1.12pc).
On the other hand, major decrease is observed in the prices of tomatoes (23.85pc), potatoes (10.53pc), eggs (1.54pc), sugar (1.04pc), bananas (0.80pc), vegetable ghee 1 Kg (0.53pc), onions (0.39pc), garlic (0.35pc) and vegetable ghee 2.5 Kg (0.22pc).

1,Pakistan received $5.1bn in July-November,PDM govt borrowed 14pc more from global lenders,"ISLAMABAD: Amid external account challenges, Pakistan borrowed about $5.115 billion in foreign loans in the first five months (July-November) of the current fiscal year, almost 14pc higher than the foreign loans it received in the comparable period last year.
In its monthly report on Foreign Economic Assistance (FEA), the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MEA) said it received about $5.115bn foreign assistance in 5MFY23 compared to $4.499bn in the same period last year. 
In November alone, Pakistan received $842 million from foreign inflows compared to $794m in the same month last year, a rise of 6pc.
As such, the total inflows at $5.115bn in 5MFY23 amounted to just 22.4pc of the budget estimates of $22.817bn for the entire year. 

PDM govt borrowed 14pc more from global lenders

The inflows of $4.5bn in 5MFY22 accounted for 37 of the annual budget estimates of $12.233bn. The MEA had finally reported the full fiscal year 2021-22 foreign economic assistance at $16.975bn.
In the same five months of 2019-20, the external inflow was $3.108bn around 24pc of the annual budgeted amount of $12.958bn. Last week, the MEA reported that Pakistan had received a total of $10.7bn during 2019-20 and $8.4bn in 2018-19.
The foreign inflows reported by MEA also include expensive foreign debt in Naya Pakistan Certificates from overseas Pakistanis and stood at just $139mn in five months against a full-year target of $1.63bn.
Unlike previous years, there were only three major sources of foreign inflows this year and including $4.172bn from multilateral lenders followed by $602 million from bilateral lenders and about $200mn from commercial banks.
The 4th usual source –- international bonds -– had dried up because of poor credit rating amid external account challenges and resultantly historically low foreign exchange reserves. The government had targeted $2bn in international bonds for the current fiscal year but no funds could be raised in five months.
Of the multilaterals, the Asian Development Bank turned out to be the biggest lender with $1.677bn loan disbursements in 5MFY23 followed by $1.166bn from the International Monetary Fund whose subsequent disbursement ($1.17bn) planned for the first week of November could not materialise because of differences with the authorities over the completion of 9th review. 
The government has targeted $3bn inflows from the fund during the current fiscal year. The ADB’s disbursements, however, more than doubled to $1.677bn in 5MFY23 when compared to $712m in 5MFY22. 
The World Bank Group disbursed about $624m in 5MFY23 compared to its $694m during the same period last year. The Beijing-based Asian Infrast­ructure Investment Bank (AIIB) disbursed $510m so far, up drastically from just $38m during the comparable period last year. The Islamic Development Bank also extended about $175m including $161m in short-term financing.
Among the bilateral lenders, Saudi Arabia extended about $500m in deferred oil payment facility in 5MFY23 against a negligible share of just $1m in the comparable period of last year. This was followed by China with $55m, up from $22m last year.
The loans from commercial banks were down to just $200m this year compared to a $1.53bn in 5MFY22.
The report said the government received $3.786bn worth of inflows for budgetary support and $661m of short-term credit. This put the total non-productive (non-project) assistance at $4.447bn in 5MFY23 (out of total inflows of $5.115bn) against a full-year target of $21bn, which meant that more than 85pc of total loans were acquired for oil imports, budget financing and replenishment of foreign exchange reserve.
About $645m were secured this year for various foreign-funded projects compared to $1.2bn in the same period last year, down by about 46pc.
The MEA data showed that the size of foreign loans had been steadily increasing over the last four years from $10.59bn in 2018-19 to $10.662bn in 2019-20 and then reaching $14.28bn in 2020-21 followed by $16.97bn in 2021-22. This showed Pakistan’s heavy reliance on foreign loans to finance the rising current account deficit and salvage declining foreign exchange reserves.
This was also evident from the fact that the annual budget target for foreign debt was set at $14.088bn in the federal budget 2021-22 and the government borrowed $17bn. The government borrowed a total of $14.3bn in the full 2020-21. The target for the current fiscal is significantly higher at about $23bn.
This sheds light on an unfortunate slide towards the debt trap as the governments had to rely on short-term expensive commercial loans amid the inability of the authorities concerned to ensure sufficient non-debt-creating inflows through higher foreign direct investments, remittances and exports.

2,"Govt fails to achieve growth, price stability","“Countries that prioritise growth at the expense of price and financial stability are not able to sustain growth and have repeated boom-bust cycles,"" says SBP.","KARACHI: The countries that prioritise growth at the expense of price and financial stability are not able to sustain growth and face repeated boom-bust cycles, says the annual report issued by the central bank recently.
The present government avoided focusing on growth for the fiscal year FY23 with the result that a steep fall in the growth is expected. But, even then it has failed to bring price stability along with financial stability.
“International experience has repeatedly shown that countries that prioritise growth at the expense of price and financial stability are not able to sustain growth and have repeated boom-bust cycles — rapid economic growth followed by a financial crisis,” says a special report of the SBP’s Annual Report.
In the report on ‘State of the Economy for the fiscal year FY22’, the SBP estimates that growth in FY23 would be lower than the low range set for the year. The growth rate will remain lower than 3-4 per cent.
 
 

The SBP avoided providing a new range for the growth rate but international credit rating agencies have been predicting it to hover around 2pc.
The sharp fall in growth has already resulted in heavy lay-offs from trade and industrial sectors with another big spell of retrenchments in the pipeline.
Textile millers, exporters and importers have been expressing grave concerns over non-opening of Letter of Credits that has crippled the business cycle.
Despite focusing on prices, inflation for the last five months is hovering around 25pc, worsening prospects for stability and growth. For trade and industries, it is hard to survive under the priorities that focus more on prices and less on growth.
“International experience has shown that price stability is a necessary condition for sustained growth and development,” underlined the SBP report, adding that countries where price stability is a primary objective tend to have lower inflation, as well as less volatility in both inflation and growth.
 
 

However, the Pakistani government has failed to achieve any one of these targets despite sacrificing the growth.
The SBP’s price stability objective is reflected in the government’s medium-term inflation target of 5-7pc.
Supply-side factors, such as changes in the price of energy and food, can be driven by both domestic and international developments. These factors can often be difficult to predict, said the report.
In forecasting the inflation, a number of assumptions have to be made and continually updated as more information comes in.
“In Pakistan, the coverage and timeliness of information needs improvement and there are often large revisions to ‘annual’ GDP growth estimates relative to provisional estimates. These, together with scarce availability of high frequency real sector data, complicate forecasting and real-time decision making,” read the SBP report.
It said that inflation forecasts also hinge on the outlook for international commodity prices and exchange rate developments.
Adopting price stability as the main objective of the central bank, while shifting to a market determined exchange rate is akin to shifting the nominal anchor in the economy from the exchange rate to an inflation target around which economic players are expected to centre their expectation and decisions, said the report.
“This requires the central bank to ‘credibly’ commit to deliver an inflation target,” according to the document.

3,OICCI seeks task force to enforce climate measures,Pakistan has made an ambitious commitment to reducing its emissions by 50 per cent by 2030.,"KARACHI: The government should set up a high-powered task force for the implementation of climate change–related measures in the corporate sector, said M. Abdul Aleem, secretary general of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI), while addressing a conference on Friday.
The chief of the representative body of more than 200 foreign investors said a steering committee should also be established to review and gradually raise the bar for improving the climate-related disclosures besides developing a nationwide climate knowledge-sharing initiative.
Mr Aleem made these remarks at the launch of a whitepaper titled “Synergising the climate ambition: a blueprint for achieving NDCs [nationally determined contributions] through private-sector engagement”.
The white paper showed key learnings and insights from the Pakistan Climate Conference 2022 that the OICCI organised in March. In particular, it highlighted the commitment of OICCI members — the likes of Chevron, Indus Motor, Engro Corporation and Unilever — to “promote positive climate actions.” It also drew an outline for action to boost public-private investment in climate change adaptation and resilience.
Pakistan has made an ambitious commitment to reducing its emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 through the NDC targets presented at the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26). As per these NDCs, about 15pc of the total proposed emissions reduction is unconditional whereas the remaining 35pc is to be achieved subject to conditional support from bilateral and multilateral sources.
Addressing the conference, Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) Chairperson Dr Shamshad Akhtar said the PSX has launched a task force on Environmental, Social, and Governance or ESG and conducts regular interaction with all corporate entities. “ESG compliance is important for attracting foreign direct investment… it’s an attractive instrument to bring in long-term investment,” she said.
Speaking on the occasion, Unilever Pakistan CEO Amir Paracha said Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country in terms of its vulnerability to climate change even though its share in greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1pc. “Taking the right actions now can move us towards a fairer, more sustainable world by addressing climate change,” he said.
The OICCI’s recommended roadmap aims at harmonising the climate change-related efforts made by OICCI members like Shell Pakistan, Siemens, Total Parco and Nestle. The monitoring and evaluation mechanism suggested in the working paper will help consolidate data and efforts for promoting collaborations as well as supporting the industry and government stakeholders in streamlining the projection and demonstration of their work.

5,"Hubco, Chinese firm resolve dispute",The announcement removes the analysts’ earlier apprehensions of increased financial costs for Pakistan's largest independent power producer.,"KARACHI: The Hub Power Company Ltd (Hubco) said on Friday its joint-venture (JV) partner in a coal-based 1,320-megawatt power plant has withdrawn the encashment notice it served on Hubco’s bank last month.
The announcement removes the analysts’ earlier apprehensions that the notice — served on the bank that issued a $150 million standby letter of credit (SBLC) on behalf of Hubco — would lead to increased financial costs for the country’s largest independent power producer.
The SBLC is a guarantee through which lenders ensure that equity partners cover any cost overruns or funding shortfalls that may occur before the project completion date (PCD).
Even though the plant has been producing electricity for many years, its PCD was still pending because the lenders were waiting for the fulfilment of their last condition: the establishment of a revolving fund by the Central Power Purchasing Authority-Guarantee (CPPA-G) to help independent power producers overcome their liquidity shortfalls.
The government recently set up the revolving fund, which has eliminated the need for the JV partner, China Power Hub Generation Company Ltd (CPHGC), to call the SBLC.
Hubco and CPHGC informed investors on Friday that the SBLC has been extended on “mutually agreed terms.” They didn’t state any details.
The JV partner called the SBLC on Nov 23, which was the day the facility was going to mature. Hubco didn’t renew it, which meant its JV partner would be out of opti­ons in the case of any funding shortfalls in the future.
As for the reluctance shown by Hubco in renewing the facility, analysts referred to the fact that SBLCs constitute a liability and use up the available credit lines. That’s because the issuing bank must make immediate payment on behalf of its client — Hubco, in this case — as soon as the SBLC is called upon.

6,Curbs to hit companies’ operations: French envoy,Says limitations on sending remittances abroad and restrictions of importing goods will make things difficult.,"KARACHI: Consul General of Fra­nce Alexis Chahtahtinsky has said that limitations on sending remittances abroad and restrictions on importing goods would make it difficult for foreign companies including those from France to operate in Pakistan.
Addressing members of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Friday, the French envoy expressed the hope that these limitations would be temporary and the government would find a  way out to get the country out of this difficult situation.
“We can look at the future with optimism as, despite these challenges, we have one success story of Lucky Motors and Peugeot in Pakistan which shows us that we can have more success stories,” Mr Alexis said.

8,Stocks falter on rising political heat,Topline Securities attrib­uted the drop in share prices to the one-notch downgrade by S&P Global for Pakistan’s long-term sovereign credit.," 


KARACHI: Pessimism cast a pall over the Pakistan Stock Exchange on Friday as negative news stories on political and economic fronts kept investors away from the market.
Topline Securities attrib­uted the drop in share prices to the one-notch downgrade by S&P Global for Pakistan’s long-term sovereign credit rating from B to CCC+.
In addition, a decline in the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves to the critical level of $6.12 billion along with a growing political rift following the de-notification of the Punjab chief minister by the provincial governor also played a key role in dampening the investors’ mood.
Arif Habib Ltd also held political tension responsible for share prices oscillating within a small range throughout the trading session.
As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 39,669.20 points, down 169.13 points or 0.42 per cent from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume decreased 31.8pc to 132.6 million shares. The traded value went down 15.9pc to $20.5m on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included the Hub Power Company Ltd (8.3m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (6.8m shares), Pakistan Refinery Ltd (6.1m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (5.3m shares) and Dewan Farooque Motors Ltd (5.2m shares).
Sectors that contributed negatively to the index performance were technology and communication (92.1 points), fertiliser (75.8 points), cement (64.4 points), commercial banking (34.6 points) and food and personal care products (33.8 points).
Companies registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs68), Premium Textile Mills Ltd (Rs27.10), Bata Pakistan Ltd (Rs19.99), Bhanero Textile Mills Ltd (Rs18.94) and Shield Corporation Ltd (Rs15.75).
Companies that recorded the biggest declines in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs511), Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs385.10), Mehmood Textile Mills Ltd (Rs61.28), Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (Rs25.40) and Ellcot Spinning Mills Ltd (Rs11.04).
Foreign investors were net buyers as they purchased shares worth $0.54m.
