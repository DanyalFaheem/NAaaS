1,Public gatherings banned as security on high alert in Islamabad,"Law enforcement agencies in twin cities told to ensure using bulletproof jackets, security vehicles and vantage points.","ISLAMABAD: The capital administration on Friday banned all types of gatherings, especially activities related to the upcoming local government elections, for two weeks and declared high alert in the city for 48 hours.
According to a notification issued from the office of Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon, “In light of recent advisories/threat alerts issued by the law enforcement agencies and today’s attack on police, the security of Islamabad has been beefed up to obviate the threats within the jurisdiction of capital which can disrupt peace and tranquility causing damage to public life and property. However, the likelihood of such activities cannot be ruled out in coming days.”
Keeping in view the prevailing situation, the deputy commissioner imposed a ban on all kinds of corner meetings, public gatherings and congregations, especially in the wake of the upcoming local government elections. The order came into force with immediate effect and shall remain in force for two weeks.
Meanwhile, security in the capital was put on high alert and a crackdown launched against vehicles with applied-for and unauthorised registration plates, police said.

Law enforcement agencies in twin cities told not to be oblivious to their own security

Teams deployed for patrolling and at pickets were asked to take strict action against those carrying and displaying weapons. Besides, they were told to check and verify the identification documents of people and vehicles.
Directives were also issued to the police stations to check and ensure the registration of maids, house servants and tenants.
Checking and inspection of guest houses, hotels, motels and inns has also been started while wooded areas, slums and nullahs were being combed.
Rawalpindi
Following the recent wave of terrorism and Friday’s suicide bombing in the federal capital territory, the law enforcement agencies have been directed not to be oblivious to their own security and ensure using bulletproof jackets, security vehicles and vantage points.
The federal government had already directed the authorities concerned across the country to take precautionary measures to avoid any untoward incident as militants may accelerate their activities in coming days to avenge the killing of their commanders.
Following the suicide bombing in the capital in which a police official was martyred, the security level has been raised to high alert in the twin cities.
Earlier, the federal government had directed the chief secretaries of all provinces, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan as well as the chief commissioner of Islamabad to take appropriate security measures to avoid any untoward incident amid reports of continued arrival of the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in areas bordering Afghanistan and the interior of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In the wake of the Bannu incident and other terrorist activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Punjab police chief issued a guideline to all divisional police heads to ensure strengthened security on the eve of Quaid-i-Azam’s birthday, Christmas and New Year.
According to the IGP’s guidelines, law enforcement agencies were on top of the spectrum of threats by terrorist groups, therefore, the police should not be unaware of their own security.
“Hence all precautionary measures including scattered deployment, alertness of security vehicles, use of vantage points, use of bulletproof jackets must be ensured for target hardening,” the guidelines said.
Regional Police Officer (RPO) Nasir Mehmood Satti, in a statement, said the security level had been placed on high alert and all district police officers (DPOs) of Attock, Jhelum and Chakwal as well as the city police officer Rawalpindi had been directed to ensure foolproof security especially around churches and at exit and entry points.
As part of tightened security, suspicious persons and vehicles should be closely monitored at special checkpoints and search and combing operations should be accelerated, the RPO said.
He said police at the checkposts should ensure checking according to the proposed standard operating procedures and stay in the field and brief the police personnel.
Security of property is the top priority which will be ensured by utilising all possible resources, he added.
On the other hand, the CPO Rawalpindi held a video link meeting with the SP security, SPs, DSPs and SHOs and issued directives to review security. He directed the police to ensure security of important installations, worship places, hospitals and public gatherings.

3,CDA stopped from razing structure at Swati’s farmhouse,Swati's wife condemns CDA for initiating action without giving her an opportunity of defence.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday suspended Capital Development Authority (CDA)’s notice to remove alleged unauthorised construction at the farmhouse of PTI leader Azam Swati.
Tahira Swati, the spouse of Mr Swati, contended in her petition that CDA last month issued her a final notice against “unauthorised/illegal construction” at the agro-farm.
Ms Swati is the owner of plot number 71 in Orchard Scheme, Murree Road, Islamabad. IHC Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir stopped the CDA from taking any coercive measure on the property. He also sought a reply from the CDA.
Ms Swati’s counsel Ali Nawaz Kharal argued before the court that the civic agency had started an operation at the property without even issuing a notice in advance.
The CDA in its notice issued by its building control section said that final seven days were being given to remove violations from the farmhouse.
It recalled that a show-cause notice had been issued on Nov 4, calling for removal of the violations including “unauthorised/illegal construction in basement in right side setback, unauthorised and illegal construction at ground floor in right side of setback, unauthorised construction of basement beyond the plinth level and guard room beyond the plot line”.
Initially, Ms Swati challenged the notice before a civil judge who restrained the civic agency from taking any action, but later dismissed her application.
She contended in the petition that the CDA’s officials issued the notice on the instruction of someone else as his husband was a senator and political activist.
According to the petition, the CDA condemned her unheard and initiated the action without giving her an opportunity of defence.
She stated that the CDA also ignored her demand of undertaking a joint measurement to ascertain the excess area. Ms Swati contended that the CDA violated its own rules and regulations in her case and was adamant to demolish her property.
She requested the court to declare the CDA’s final notice illegal and restrained them from demolishing her property.

4,Housing society owners face arrest warrants for violating environment laws,Police asked to produce violators in CDA court on Tuesday,"ISLAMABAD: Court of Senior Special Magistrate of Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Friday issued arrest warrants for several housing societies operators and individuals for environmental degradation in sector H-17.
According to sources in CDA, Environment Directorate had submitted challan in the court of Special Magistrate Sardar Mohammad Asif against various violators. The court directed the police to arrest the violators of environment laws and present them before his court on Tuesday.
Operators of Shifa International Housing Scheme, Sher Zaman Town, Pearl Orchard also known as Baraq Valley, Ammar Valley and Chinnar Valley have been found violators of environment laws.
The court issued arrest warrants for Malik Naeem Gondal, Haji Fakhar Zaman, Farooq Zaman, Mohammad Talash Zaman, Moahmmad Afzal, Faisal Riaz, Aneesur Rehman, Iqbal Mir, Habib Mughal, Tahir Awan, Fazal Rabi, Waqas Khan, Masawar Abbasi and Rehman Khan. The court will take up this case on Tuesday. 

Police asked to produce violators in CDA court on Tuesday

CDA officials said that in sector H-17 the housing societies have been operating for the last many years without having any approval. 
They said the sector was not meant for housing societies and recently courts had also directed the CDA to take action against illegal housing societies.
H-17 is an unacquired sector belonging to private people. As per Islamabad’s master plan, it falls in Zone I, which was supposed to be acquired and developed by the CDA. However, the civic agency has failed to acquire this sector and several other such sectors that include H-13, H-14, H-15, H-16, H-17, D-14, D-15, E-14 and E-15.
CDA is not acquiring these sectors nor regulating the construction asking the land owners that these sectors are meant for institutions, which will be constructed when CDA acquires the land.  
On the other hand, the local landowners say they have every right to construct houses and buildings on their own land. Since CDA has neither acquired the sectors, nor regulated them, that resulted in mushroom growth of unauthorised constructions.
“We will have to take bold decision. We have only two options, either acquire these sectors or regulate the construction, otherwise in future the unregulated construction will make these sectors new slums,” said an official of CDA.
Earlier, the court of special magistrate had also issued arrest warrants for Higher Education Commission Chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmed for violating environment laws in sector H-17.
However, after getting information, he approached the court and pleaded that he was not owner of any society rather he had an underdeveloped plot there and he did not violate any law. After being convinced by his arguments, the court withdrew his arrest warrant.

They were speaking at the launch of a research-based ‘Climate Financing for WASH brief – Pakistan Scoping Brief’ at a ceremony jointly organised by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).
The research was led by IRC researcher Habibur Rehman. The launch was followed by a panel discussion on climate financing for WASH.
The study called upon international donors to allocate at least 35pc of climate-related budget for WASH, raising it from the existing 22pc for Pakistan and prioritise the allocation of WASH and climate-related funding to countries which were currently unlikely to achieve the WASH SDGs.
In her welcome remarks, IRC Country Director Shabnam Baloch said: “WASH is a critical entry point to reducing community vulnerability to climate impacts, closing gender gaps, health and education disparity, economic inclusion and progress. Climate resilient WASH goes beyond climate infrastructure and is critical in climate-induced disasters.”
She said while Pakistan needed $7 billion to $14 billion annually till 2050, for adaptation alone there was a dire need to address impediments such as the complexity of the process in accessing climate financing by CSOs, resource-intensive nature of issue and lack of community engagement during project development.
Member Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Idrees Mahsud called on focusing on implementation rather than making new policies, urging donors to engage with stakeholders on estimating the need and improving research to support our financing proposals.
Giving an overview on the climate financing mechanism, SDPI’s Head of Sustainability and Resilience Programme Dr Shafqat Munir said: “Despite constraints in accessing climate financing from multilateral donors, bilateral partnerships and private sector organisations, both government and non-government organisations have been struggling to get the country’s share in the highly competitive climate financing market amid cumbersome processes.”
Expert Niazullah Khan said WASH as a sector had so far not been aligned with climate agenda due to absence of a consortium that could enable national sub-national coordination and anchor the formalisation and legislative review.
Dr Fahad Saeed, who is a climate analyst, emphasised the need for introspection to see flaws in policies as compared to regional members, Pakistan was lagging in securing climate financing.
WaterAid Pakistan Country Director Arif Jabbar Khan stressed the need to increase awareness on financial losses due to poor WASH conditions at the household level.

7,AJK court seeks details of official vehicles,"“We need complete information on who has been allotted which kind of vehicle,"" says court.","MUZAFFARABAD: Taking strong exception to misuse of official transport, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) High Court on Friday directed the government to furnish details about all official vehicles, including the names of officers to whom those have been allotted.
The direction was given by the court’s larger bench, headed by Chief Justice Sadaqat Hussain Raja, as it took up a petition filed by advocate Malik Mahmood Ali Awan, on this issue in the wake of reports that more than Rs870 million had been spent over the past 18 months on purchase of 152 new vehicles.
Apart from the details of the allottees, the court directed secretary services and general administration department (S&GAD), who also happens to be the administrative secretary of Central Transport Pool, to submit to it details about the entitlement of the allottees.
“We need complete information on who has been allotted which kind of vehicle and whether this allotment is in accordance with the entitlement of the person concerned or not,” the chief justice said.
The bench was of the view that arbitrary and unmerited use of government vehicles was sending a huge chunk of public money down the drain and passing on its burden on the general public.

11,Court stays order  to complete land acquisition for  IIA in one year,ISLAMABAD: The Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court (LHC) has stayed an earlier order of the same court...,"ISLAMABAD: The Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court (LHC) has stayed an earlier order of the same court requiring the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to complete within one year the land acquisition process for the third runway of Islamabad International Airport (IIA).
A division bench of the high court, consisting of Justice Anwaar Hussain and Justice Jawwad Hassan, issued status quo while accepting an intra-court appeal (ICA) against the Nov 17, 2022, single judge bench decision of acquiring the land within one year on a set of petitions by locals demanding current market value of their land if the CAA had to acquire it. The next date of hearing has been fixed as Jan 25, 2023.
Senior counsel Barrister Zafarullah Khan, who represented the CAA, argued before the court that the authority intended to expand IIA for which the relevant authorities - the land acquisition collector Fatehjang and the district price assessment committee Attock - were to initiate the process for acquisition of the land that belonged to 19 respondents.
Keeping in view the future expansion of the IIA, the local authorities issued a notification under Section 4 of Land Acquisition Act 1894 on March 13, 2018. Consequently the CAA approached the authorities for provision of the requisite rate which was provided to it on Feb 14, 2020.
The CAA petition stated that due to the submersion of required land under Ramma Dam, the acquisition process was reviewed on the touchstone of public purpose and by careful consideration the CAA paid Rs3.5 billion – the decided amount of compensation - in the Punjab Revenue Treasury on June 16, 2021, as compensation.
Due to the pendency of prevailing work of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Kasana Dam, a huge land was being acquired and the procedure of acquisition and compensation to the affected persons were being carried out by the local authorities.
In the meanwhile, the persons affected by the land acquisition approached the high court, and a single bench on the first date of hearing on Aug 2, 2021 and without notice to CAA ordered the land acquisition collector (LAC) Rawalpindi and Attock not to take any coercive action against the affected people, a process which delayed the acquisition proceedings.
The petition argued that land acquisition was no longer a federal subject since it had been devolved to provinces and therefore the single bench erred in reading the preamble of the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act 2017 to justify determination of reasonable time to one year.
Moreover, declaring illegal the non-completion of the process of land acquisition within one year was against the letter and spirit of Article 254 of the Constitution.

12,Body formed to enhance storage capacity of Rawal Dam,RAWALPINDI: To enhance the storage capacity of Rawal Dam so the garrison city could get 50 to 60 million gallon ...,"RAWALPINDI: To enhance the storage capacity of Rawal Dam so the garrison city could get 50 to 60 million gallon daily (MGD) water, the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) and Small Dam Organisation (SDO) have formed a four-member committee to make suggestions to send to the Punjab government within a week.
“Rawal Dam is one of the main water reservoirs for the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. However, since its construction in 1962, silting has caused over 50pc loss to its storage capacity,” a senior official of Wasa told Dawn.
He said the government wanted to increase the water storage capacity from 30,000 acre feet to 68,000 acre feet to cater to the needs of water for the garrison city for the next 50 years at least. 
“The dam’s original capacity was 40,000 acre feet but due to silting it has reduced to 30,000 acre feet. The water filtration plant installed at the dam can clean 28 MGD,” he said.

Silting has caused over 50pc loss to reservoir’s storage capacity since its construction, says official

However, he said Wasa managed to get 23 MGD water from the filtration plant at the dam.
“After increasing the capacity, the agency will be able to get 50-60 MGD water from the dam to provide it to all the union councils and bulk water to Pakistan Railways, Military Engineering Services (MES) and other military organisations.
“There are two proposals to increase the water capacity of the dam. One is to increase the height of the dam by five feet from all the sides and the second to desilt the lake,” he said. However, there is also a proposal for the construction of an upstream dam.
He said experts and engineers would see the best option after checking the foundations of the dam and the capacity of the structure. He said the engineers would also check the proposal to expand the lake to Banigala as it has no space towards Quaid-i-Azam University and Diplomatic Enclave.
When contacted, Wasa spokesman Umer Farooq said the agency and SDO had initiated work to chalk out proposals.
“The proposed life of any dam is 50 years but Rawal Dam is completely safe as the provincial government adopted preventive measures to avoid silting in the dam during the last many years,” he said.
He said the water storage capacity of the dam would be enhanced by increasing the height of the dam. However, he said a final decision would be announced by the experts.
He said at present Wasa got 23 MGD water from Rawal Dam which was not enough to meet the water requirements. By enhancing the storage capacity of the dam, Wasa would not need to establish 80 to 90 tubewells in the garrison city.
He said the four-member committee formed by Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) Chairman Tariq Mehmood Murtaza comprised senior officials of Wasa and SDO.
“The committee will submit its report within a week to send it to the Punjab government,” he said.

“All jobs, including that of a sanitary worker, should be kept open for all people as affiliating religious minorities with any such profession is against the Constitution as well as below the standards of human dignity,” NCM Chairman Chela Ram Kewlani said.
Chairing the 17th meeting of the commission, he said: “Why should only minority communities apply for the job of a sanitary worker?”
The commission members directed officials of the religious affairs ministry to respond to the matter in the next meeting along with a suggestion to counter this traditional narrative that only members of certain communities were hired as sweepers and cleaners.
The members took up the matter as Mr Kewlani had received a written complaint from a citizen along with the clipping of the advertisement.
The complainant stated that such a message was offending for all religious minorities in Pakistan.
Meanwhile, the NCM members congratulated the Christian community on the occasion of Christmas.
The meeting was attended by Dr Sara Safdar, Roshan Khursheed Brocha, Vishnu Raja Qavi, Dawood Shah, Liaquat Qaiser while Albert David and Dr Jaipal Chabria participated via digital link.
The meeting discussed various issues faced by non-Muslim minorities, including protection as well as infrastructure development of their places of worship.
The participants thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on his promise that the Act of the National Commission for Minorities of Pakistan would be brought to parliament as soon as possible.
The commission was notified by the Ministry of Religious Affairs in 2020, but there is no law regarding the NCM and the relevant draft law is still pending in the National Assembly secretariat.
