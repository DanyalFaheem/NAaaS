0,"Trump should never hold office again, says report on insurrection","The document urges lawmakers to legislate so that Trump and others can be barred from holding office — ""whether federal or state, civilian or military"".","WASHINGTON: Donald Trump should never be allowed to run for public office again after inciting an insurrection, lawmakers investigating last year’s assault on the US Capitol concluded in their watershed final report.
The recommendation led a list of proposals from the 845-page document aimed at ensuring there is no repeat of the deadly riot the former US president is accused of orchestrating in a failed bid to cling to power after losing the 2020 election.
“Our country has come too far to allow a defeated president to turn himself into a successful tyrant by upending our democratic institutions (and) fomenting violence,” the panel’s chairman Bennie Thompson said in an introduction to the report, released late on Thursday.
The document urges lawmakers to legislate so that Trump and others who “engaged in insurrection” can be barred from holding office — “whether federal or state, civilian or military”. 
It was the culmination of 18 months of work by congressional investigators who interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses to establish the primary cause of the attack, which they blamed squarely on the Republican billionaire.
The committee also recommended reforms of election law, a federal crackdown on extremist groups and the designation of Congress’s certification of presidential elections as a “national special security event” on a par with the annual State of the Union address.
It was the panel’s final act before it is disbanded as the House of Representatives switches to Republican control next month.
The party has opposed the investigation at every step and the switch in the balance of power raises doubts over the possibility of most of the recommen-dations ever being taken up.

The amount was disclosed in a court filing late on Thursday.
“The proposed settlement of $725,000,000 is the largest recovery ever achieved in a data privacy class action and the most Facebook has ever paid to resolve a private class action,” lawyers for the plaintiffs said in the filing.
Facebook has not admitted any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which must still be approved by a judge in the San Francisco division of the US District Court.

2,India naval officers languish in Qatar jail,"For more than 100 days now, the decorated soldiers have been locked up in solitary confinement, says The Times report.","NEW DELHI: As opposition parties mount pressure on the Indian government to come clean on the recent Tawang border incident with China in which several Indian troops were reportedly injured, some in the media have focused on the eight navy veterans who have been mysteriously languishing in prison in Qatar since August 30.
The Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die for the winter session on Friday, six days ahead of schedule, without either the China border issue being discussed or the naval officers’ fate being addressed.
“The news ought to have made headlines and the subject incessantly debated, but the incarceration of eight former Indian Navy officers in Qatar lies lost in the grey zone of bureaucracy and diplomacy,” said The Times of India on Monday.
The sister of a jailed officer had tweeted a similar call last month.
“The Indian Government need to act immediately, swiftly & walk the talk if they really care about their defence personnel as today is 69th day of the illegal solitary confinement of our senior citizen Navy Veterans (officers) in Doha (Qatar),” wrote Dr Meetu Bhargava, her message copied to the prime minister, external affairs minister and the defence minister, among others.
The Times said it was surprised by the silence. “For more than 100 days now, the decorated soldiers have been locked up in solitary confinement and the government has not told us why the Naval officers were picked up from their homes in the dead of night.
“In the age of information and the weightage the Centre gives to the armed forces, it is mysterious why there is a deafening silence surrounding the arrest of the eight officers.”
The arrests first came to light with the tweet of Dr Meetu Bhargava, sister of retired Commander Purnendu Tiwari, The Times said. He is the managing director of Dahra Global Technologies, and his company has been a service provider for the defence and security sector. He has been in Doha since 2013, training Qatar’s Navy personnel, The Times said.
India was given consular access to the Navy veterans in October, but neither New Delhi nor Doha have revea­led under what charges the officers are being held.
“What we know is disturbing. The officers are languishing in solitary confinement, unaware of why they were picked up or when they will be repatriated. The officers are allowed to speak with one member of the family once a week but it can be assumed that their liberty has been hugely curtailed. Tiwari, for example, is forced to speak with his aged, India-based mother only in English, a language she is not entirely comfortable with.”

3,China’s health system braces for Covid peak,"Authorities have narrowed the criteria for Covid deaths, prompting criticism from many disease experts.","

BEIJING: China is expecting a peak in Covid-19 infections within a week, a health official said, with authorities predicting extra strain on the country’s health system even as they downplay the disease’s severity and continue to report no fresh deaths.
In the face of a surging outbreak and widespread protests against its “zero-Covid” regime of lockdowns and testing, China began dismantling it this month, becoming the last major country to move towards living with the virus.
Its containment measures had slowed the $17-trillion economy to its lowest growth rate in nearly half a century, jamming global supply chains and trade.
China reported less than 4,000 new symptomatic local Covid cases nationwide for Dec 22, and no fresh Covid deaths for a third consecutive day. Authorities have narrowed the criteria for Covid deaths, prompting criticism from many disease experts.
Zhang Wenhong, director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, was quoted in Shanghai government-backed news outlet The Paper on Thursday as saying China “is expected to reach the peak of infections within a week”.   
“The peak infection will also increase the rate of severe disease, which will have a certain impact on our entire medical resources,” he said, adding the wave will last another one or two months after that.
“We must be mentally prepared that infection is inevitable.”  
Chinese state media cited a health official in eastern city of Qingdao as saying coronavirus was in rapid transmission stage in the city with 490,000-530,000 new daily infections, which was set to increase at a rate of 10 percent in the next couple of days.
Nevertheless, Zhang said he had visited nursing homes around Shanghai, noticing the number of elderly dealing with severe symptoms was low.
Nearly 37 million people in China may have been infected with Covid on a single day this week, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing estimates from the government’s top health authority.
Worries over the near-term impact of China’s Covid wave pushed stock markets in China, Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia lower. The yuan also weakened.
Stark contrast
Infections in China are likely to be more than a million a day with deaths at more than 5,000 a day, in “stark contrast” with official data, British-based health data firm Airfinity said this week.
A Shanghai hospital has estimated half of the commercial hub’s 25 million people would get infected by the end of next week. Experts say China could face more than a million Covid deaths next year.
Shanghai said people who had tested positive will be allowed to end home isolation after seven days if their symptoms significantly abate or end, without mentioning the need to undertake more tests. 
The guidance from earlier this month had said they could end home isolation after testing negative on antigen and PCR tests.

4,Male panda at Dutch zoo turns out to be female,"“We were so convinced the baby was male we never doubted it,” says zoo manager.","THE HAGUE: A two-year-old giant panda at a Dutch zoo has caused a stir by turning out to be a female and not a male as initially thought.
The discovery at the Ouwehands Zoo was made during a routine medical check-up on Fan Xing, who was the first giant panda to be born in the Netherlands.
The zoo’s manager confirmed the news on national television late on Thursday.
“Fan Xing surprised us,” said Jose Kok, in a statement released by the zoo after the interview was broadcast.
“For us, the sex was just a fact we wanted to check during the exam under anaesthesia, to be sure.” 
The panda underwent a short medical examination a few months after being born, which has to be done quickly so that the baby can be reunited with its mother.
But Kok said that determining sex is difficult in a young baby not under anaesthetic.
“We were so convinced the baby was male we never doubted it,” she said.
Fan Xing was born on May 1 to two giant pandas — mum Wu Wen and dad Xing Ya — who were loaned to the Netherlands by China in 2017 for 15 years.

5,"Sobhraj freed from Nepal prison, heads to France","KATHMANDU: Charles Sobhraj, a convicted killer blamed by police for a string of murders in the 1970s and 1980s, was...","KATHMANDU: Charles Sobhraj, a convicted killer blamed by police for a string of murders in the 1970s and 1980s, was released from a Nepal prison on Friday after nearly two decades behind bars.
Sobhraj, 78, a French national, arrived at the Kathmandu airport later on Friday to board a regular flight to Doha en route to Paris after clearing immigration, said Basudev Ghimire, a Kathmandu airport immigration official.
Nepal has barred Sobhraj from entering the country for 10 years, Pradashanie Kumari, the acting director general of the immigration department, said.
Nepal’s Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered his release from prison, citing his advanced age.
Suspected of killing more than 20 Western backpackers on the “hippie trail” through Asia, Sobhraj had been held in a high-security prison in Kathmandu since 2003, when he was arrested on charges of murdering US tourist Connie Jo Bronzich in 1975.
He was dubbed the “bikini killer” in Thailand and “the serpent” for his evasion of police and use of disguises, and he has been the subject of several dramatisations, including a Netflix and BBC joint production released last year.
While in prison, Sobhraj married Nihita Biswas, a Nepali woman 44 years his junior, in 2008.
“I’m happy and have great respect for our judiciary and Supreme Court,” Sobhraj’s mother-in-law Sakuntala Thapa said after news of his release was announced.
Sobhraj denied killing the American woman and his lawyers said the charge against him was based on assumption.
Several years later Sobhraj was also found guilty of killing Bronzich’s Canadian friend, Laurent Carriere.
But he was suspected of many more murders, including in Thailand, where police say he allegedly drugged and killed six women in the 1970s, some of whom turned up dead on a beach near the resort of Pattaya.
`You are Charles’ 
He was jailed in India for poisoning a group of French tourists in New Delhi in 1976, before he could stand trial on the charges against him in Thailand.
Sobhraj escaped from India’s Tihar jail in 1986 after drugging prison guards with cookies and cakes laced with sleeping pills.
Police arrested Sobhraj days later at a restaurant in the Indian beach holiday state of Goa.
“I walked up to their table and said ‘you are Charles’”, Madhu­kar Zende, the police officer who caught him in Goa, told The Indian Express newspaper in an interview.
A statue of Sobhraj stands at the restaurant in Goa to this day. He was jailed in India until 1997 when he returned to France

6,"Fires at Chile’s port, tourist city leave two dead",The Chilean government declared a state of emergency in the Via del Mar area on Thursday night.,"

SANTIAGO: A major fire broke out at Chile’s Ventanas port on Thursday near a refinery and smelter belonging to state-run miner Codelco, but the company said operations had not been affected.
A separate forest fire south of Ventanas, near the coastal tourist city of Via del Mar, raged on Friday, killing two people while destroying some 200 homes. 
That fire consumed 110 hectares of land, an official said, as firefighters struggled to contain it.
The Chilean government declared a state of emergency in the Via del Mar area on Thursday night.
Codelco’s smelter near the Ventanas port was already shut down due to maintenance, while the refinery is operating normally, according to Codelco, the world’s top copper producer.
There were no injuries from the port fire, the company that administers the port said in a statement. It said the incident occurred in a solid bulk cargo conveyor belt and spread to other nearby facilities.
Local media published images showing large amounts of dark smoke billowing out from the port, located 145 kilometres north-west of the capital Santiago.
AES Chile, which operates a coal-fired power plant near the port, said in a statement that it was taking all measures to prevent the fire from reaching its installations.
It added that a unit of the plant which is closest to the blaze, was taken offline due to company security protocols, while other units were operating normally.

7,Indonesian families sue officials over deadly stadium disaster,"Imam Hidayat, a lawyer representing the families, said they were demanding accountability and compensation.","JAKARTA: Seven Indonesian families whose relatives died or were injured in one of the worst stadium disasters in football history have sued officials they consider responsible, their lawyer said on Friday.
The stampede in the Javan city of Malang in October left 135 people dead, including more than 40 children.
It has been primarily blamed on an excessive use of tear gas by police, according to a preliminary investigation.
The civil lawsuit targets eight parties, including Indonesia’s football association, the national police, league organiser PT Liga Indonesia Baru, and the owners of Malang football club Arema FC.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo is also listed as a co-defendant.
Imam Hidayat, a lawyer representing the families, said they were demanding accountability and compensation.
“We have to consider the livelihood of the families of those who died or were heavily injured,” Hidayat said.
“They, in our view, need compensation, although lives cannot be exchanged with money.” The families are seeking around 62 billion rupiah ($3.9 million) in damages, he said.
The suit was filed to a court in Malang on Wednesday, Hidayat added. A court spokesman confirmed it had been received.
The plaintiffs also asked the government to cancel a plan to demolish the Kanjuruhan stadium, arguing it should be made a museum as a reminder of the tragedy.
Widodo has pledged to rebuild the structure according to FIFA standards.
The stampede took place after police fired tear gas into packed stands when supporters invaded the pitch at the end of a league match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya.
The government suspended competitive football games after the incident but league matches resumed early this month without fans in the stands.
Hidayat, part of an advocacy team for those affected by the tragedy, has also sent a letter to Widodo demanding the creation of an investigative team independent from police to ensure a transparent and objective probe.
After a police-led investigation, six people including three police officers were charged with negligence causing death.
But on Wednesday police released one suspect _ a former director of PT Liga Indonesia Baru _ after he was detained for the maximum period without charge.
Local media quoted a police official as saying he remained a suspect.
A task force investigating the stampede earlier called on the football association chief and all its executive committee members to resign, but they remain in their positions, as do senior police.

8,"British nurses, paramedics plan more strikes",The new strike dates will heap more pressure on Britain’s state-funded National Health Service which is already stretched by staff shortages.,"LONDON: Britain’s health workers announced on Friday a fresh round of strikes in January, with their long-running dispute over pay and conditions with the government set to continue into next year.
The new strike dates will heap more pressure on Britain’s state-funded National Health Service (NHS), which is already stretched by staff shortages and record backlogs.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told reporters he was disappointed about the disruption caused by strikes, adding that he was trying to “make the right long-term decisions for the country for everybody’s benefit”.  
The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said thousands of its members would strike again on Jan 18 and 19 over pay after walking out on two days in December.
Strike dates for the nurses union’s members in Scotland are also expected to be announced in the new year after they voted to reject a pay offer from the Scottish government this week. Ambulance workers represented by the GMB union scheduled a new date for action on Jan 11 after suspending another walkout later this month.
Passport control staff
Military personnel standing in for striking British passport control staff appeared to minimise feared disruption on Friday, despite an escalating public sector fight for more pay.
Around a quarter of a million passengers were due to arrive at the six airports affected by the border force officers’ stoppage, ahead of the Christmas holiday weekend.
Around 1,000 workers at Heathrow, Birmingham, Cardiff, Gatwick, Glasgow and Manchester, and the southern port of Newhaven, took part in the stoppage organised by the Public and Commercial Services (PCS).
They will walk out every day for the rest of the year, except Dec 27, following stoppages this week by nurses and ambulance workers. Railway workers will stage another strike from mid-afternoon on Saturday until early Tuesday, while highways and postal staff are also in the midst of walkouts.

The launch comes at the end of a year that has seen Pyongyang conduct an unprecedented number of tests, including last month’s launch of its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile yet, with a range capable of hitting the US mainland. 
Earlier this week, Pyongyang also claimed to have developed new capabilities to take images from space. “Our military spotted two short-range ballistic missiles launched by North Korea into the East Sea from the Sunan area of Pyongyang at around 16:32 (0732 GMT) today,” South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan. 
The two missiles flew around 250 kilometres (155 miles) and 350 kilometres (217 miles), respectively, before splashing down into the East Sea, it added. 
The United States and South Korea have warned for months that Pyongyang is preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test. 
But in a statement, the North Korean foreign ministry denied conducting arms transactions with Russia, saying the story was “cooked up by some dishonest forces for different purposes”.
