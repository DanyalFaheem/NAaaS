1,"Waziristan, Lakki and Bannu trouble spots: police",Official says most extortion calls made from Afghanistan.,"PESHAWAR: After analysing the overall law and order situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the outgoing year, the police department has declared South and North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts as terrorist trouble spots.
“Southern districts, including North and South Waziristan [from among the newly-merged tribal districts] as well as Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts [from settled areas], are trouble spots,” additional inspector general of police (operations) Mohammad Ali Babakhel told reporters here on Friday.
Mr Babakhel said that the annual analysis of the security situation revealed a surge in the number of extortion calls from Afghanistan after the Taliban’s takeover of Pakistan’s Western neighbouring country.
He also said that the number of targeted attacks against police increased in 2022 compared with the previous year.

Official says most extortion calls made from Afghanistan

The police official said that the exit of foreign troops, including the US and allies, from Afghanistan left behind arms worth Rs7 billion that were “bound to end up in someone’s hands.”
He said that the number of suicide attacks in the province 
also escalated in the outgoing year, while most of the extortion calls received by the local residents were made from Afghanistan.
“Our neighbourhood [Afghanistan] is primarily the origin of extortion calls. Some local criminals were also involved in these crimes,” he said.
Mr Babakhel said that the counter-terrorism department arrested 158 extortionists wanted in 81 cases, while 62 suspects were taken into custody for kidnapping people for ransom.
He said that the CTD arrested 806 militants, including 90 with head money, and killed 196 militants during operations in the province.
The police official said that 2,609 “threat alerts” were issued with 93 per cent of them being general and six specific.
He also said 129 alerts involved people and 41 alerts were for different locations.
Mr Babakhel said that 118 police personnel were killed and 117 suffered injuries in operations against criminals, including terrorists.
He also said that the police arrested around 129,637 outlaws and seized 22,416 weapons and 511,447 rounds of bullets in 20,601 “search and strike operations” across the province in the outgoing year.
“The presence of militants in Swat and other Malakand areas was reported by the media, and everyone saw an immediate response to it by our police,” he said.
The police official said the police carried out a total of 1,877 search and strike operations and 148 intelligence-based operations in Malakand district during 2022 leading to the killing and arrest of several militants and extortionists.
He said that it was the top priority of the police to promote public policing and establish a prosperous and peaceful society in the province.
Mr Babakhel said that the anti-state elements and criminals didn’t deserve any concession, so the police bosses had ordered a strict crackdown on them according to the law.
He said the police had also been directed to ensure the maintaining of law and order.

3,Confusion prevails over winter break,"Dept cancels vacation but IMS, Charsadda varsity to close campus","PESHAWAR: The government’s announcement of winter vacation cancellation caused a lot of confusion among the administrations and students of universities on Friday.
The higher education department announced that winter holidays for all public and private sector universities and colleges in the summer zone had been “waived off.”
It also declared that all winter zone colleges and universities would remain closed from Dec 1 to Feb 15.
However, the Institute of Management Sciences Peshawar and Bacha Khan University Charsadda announced the start of the winter break from Dec 25.
The winter vacation in the IMS will last until Dec 30 and in the Bacha Khan University Charsadda until Jan 3.

Dept cancels vacation but IMS, Charsadda varsity to close campus

The Bacha Khan University announced the winter break for students from Dec 26 to Jan 3.
Heads of departments, members of the administration staff, and the conveners and members of the convocation committee will remain present at the workplace.
A teacher of the University of Peshawar told Dawn that the faculty members were in constant contact with the administration for the winter vacation decision.
He, however, said the administration was not clear on the matter.
The Peshawar Valley and all southern districts of the province are located in the summer zone and northern parts, including Malakand and Hazara divisions, in the winter zone.
The elementary and secondary education department also announced on Thursday that there won’t be winter break in the winter zone schools to address learning losses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Private Schools Regulatory Authority also directed all privately-owned educational institutions in the province to follow the department’s winter and summer vacation orders “in letter and spirit.”
Meanwhile, people in Charsadda rejected the elementary and secondary education department’s decision about the winter vacation as an unwise move.
They told reporters that the district was in the grip of heavy fog and severe cold, leaving the schoolchildren vulnerable to cold-related diseases, so they should be asked to stay home until the situation improved.
The residents said excessive power outages and low gas pressure had added to the misery of minor students.
They demanded of the government to withdraw the immediate cancellation of winter holidays to the relief of schoolchildren.

The scheme was launched at a function, according to a statement issued from the Chief Minister’s House on Friday.

6,"Lawyer among seven acquitted in judge, family murder case","SWABI: A court here on Friday acquitted seven people, including former president of the Supreme Court Bar ...","SWABI: A court here on Friday acquitted seven people, including former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association Abdul Lateef Afridi, on the charge of killing anti-terrorism court judge Aftab Afridi and his four family members last year.
Additional district and sessions judge Abid Zaman declared that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against the accused, including Lateef Afridi, his son and former civil judge Danish Afridi, Bilal Afridi, Daud Afridi, Aziz Afridi, Zakir Shah and Shehzad.
ATC judge Aftab Afridi, who was posted to Swat, came under a gun attack near Ambar Interchange on April 4, 2021, when he was travelling in his vehicle with his family on the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway.
The ambush killed the judge, his wife and his pregnant daughter-in-law along with her three-year-old son and injured his guard and driver.
The Chota Lahor police station had registered the FIR of the attack on the complaint of the slain judge’s son, Abdul Majid Afridi, who named several people, including Lateef Afridi, for the murders.
The accused were booked under sections 302, 324, 353, 427 and 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. The challan (final charge sheet) of the case was submitted to the Mardan ATC afterwards.
Earlier this year, the Peshawar High Court had ordered the removal of Section 7 of the Anti- Terrorism Act from the case and ordered the transfer of the trial to a regular court.
The prosecution alleged that two of the accused, including Zakir Shah and Shehzad, were the gunmen, while Bilal Afridi, Daud Afridi and Aziz Afridi masterminded the murders.
Lateef Afridi was accused of abetting the crime.
Defence counsel Shabbir Hussain Gigyani, Mian Sher Akbar and Hussain Ali contended that their clients were falsely implicated in the case.
They added that the complainant and prosecution witnesses failed to prove the presence of the petitioners at the crime site, while the evidence available on record also confirmed it, so their testimony was not admissible.
The lawyers contended that it was a high-profile case but the police carried out “unfair investigation due to the pressure” of certain quarters.
They argued that the confessional statements of two of the accused were obtained under duress and by torture and that the accused were kept in illegal detention for many days.
The complainant’s counsel and state prosecutor contended that the motive behind the murder was clearly proved as both families had enmity.
They said two of the arrested killers had recorded their statements admitting their and others’ involvement in the crime. They also contended that the accused didn’t deserve leniency for killing the judge and his family members in a brutal manner.
