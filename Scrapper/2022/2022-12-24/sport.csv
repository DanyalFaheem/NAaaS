0,Meg Lanning returns after indefinite break to lead Australia in Pakistan series,"“We had always hoped she would come back and play, and a great story really,” says team selector.","SYDNEY: Skipper Meg Lanning was Friday inclu­ded in the Australian women’s one-day squad to face Pakistan, ending an indefinite months-long break and allaying fears that she had played her last international.
The record-breaking 30-year-old announced she was stepping away from the game in August after leading her all-conquering team to Commonwealth Games gold.
She said at the time it was to  “focus on myself” after a hectic string of successes for Australia and Lanning that included a World Cup triumph.
It was unclear whether she would return, but national selector Shawn Flegler said Friday that Lanning was  “all in” to take on Pakistan at home next month.
“We had always hoped she would come back and play, and a great story really,” he added.
“Obviously, she’s taken this time to work out what’s really important for her, things she needs to do to manage herself.
“You know, it’s a tough gig being the Australian captain and she has done it for a long time, so just really pleased she’s refreshed, happy and knows what she wants to do.”
Debuting at 18, Lanning’s skill with the bat shattered records from early on, holding the mark for the most centuries in women’s One-day International cricket.
Becoming Australia’s youngest-ever skipper at 21, she has led the side since.
Australia face Pakistan in three ODIs from Jan 16 in Brisbane and Sydney with Alyssa Healy, who captained the side in Lanning’s absence, ruled out of the series with a calf injury.

1,PCB selection committee abolished as Sethi eyes taking PSL to Quetta,"“Foreign coaches are more qualified, skillful and have no affiliation with any particular player,"" says Sethi.","LAHORE: With the management committee taking over the Pakistan Cricket Board, the dismissals of the old guard have begun. 
Najam Sethi, the former PCB chairman who is heading the management committee, on Friday informed that that a new selection committee will be finalised on Saturday, when the fate of the coaching staff of the senior team will also be decided while an attempt will also be made to host matches of the upcoming edition of the Pakistan Super League in Quetta. 
All that is in addition to the four-month mandate of the 14-member management committee, installed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the old setup of the PCB led by Ramiz Raja was discontinued, which includes restoring the previous constitution of the country’s cricket governing body and holding fresh elections. 
“The previous national selection committee headed by Mohammad Wasim has been abolished and a new one would be finalised [when we meet again] on Saturday,” Sethi told reporters, adding that other committees including cricket and finance had also been disbanded. 
Pakistan’s coaching panel led by Saqlain Mushtaq seem to be headed for the exit door too as Sethi said he believes that foreign coaches are more suited to the national team as compared to local coaches. 
“Foreign coaches are more qualified, skillful and have no affiliation with any particular player, while in our culture our coaches have soft hearts for a few,” said Sethi, who had appointed the services of South African Mickey Arthur during his tenure as the PCB chairman. 
“In my previous tenure, we hired Arthur as head coach and we became number one in Test and One-day cricket besides winning the Champions Trophy [in 2017].” 
Arthur is currently coaching Derbyshire in English county cricket and is the most likely candidate for the head coach job. Sethi, though, dispelled the notion that the current panel will be rendered jobless. 
“It does not in any way mean the services of our star cricketers will not be utilised and we will take the benefits of their expertise in different ways,” he said, adding that at the end of the ongoing Pakistan Cup, the Provincial Cricket Associations formed under the new constitution of 2019 would be disbanded. “But no coaches would be sacked as the PCB would fulfil its contract made with them,” added Sethi. 
Sethi informed he had spoken with the Quetta Corps Commander and the Army was very happy about the prospect of the Bugti Stadium hosting matches of the PSL. 
“PCB’s infrastructure team would soon visit Quetta to inspect the facilities at the stadium and we would extend all support including finance to prepare the venue for the matches for the PSL-8 which is scheduled to be held in February-March this year,” said Sethi. 
The major task of the management committee is to restore departmental cricket, which was part of the PCB’s previous constitution of 2014. 
“We have prepared new models for that and after we agree upon one, a meeting will be held with the prime minister as well as the departmental heads to cooperate on the restoration job,” said Sethi, who also said that the salary structure of the PCB will be reviewed. 
The Pakistan Women’s Super League, a project initiated by former chairman Ramiz, is set to continue although there would be discussions over the Pakistan Junior League. 
The inaugural edition of the women’s league was due to coincide with the PSL next year but Sethi said that franchises would be consulted on whether the scheduling should change. “I will try my best to strengthen women’s cricket and hold a separate Pakistan Women Super League to give a positive message to the world about the country,” vowed Sethi. 
PSL head Usman Wahla and Director Domestic Cricket Nadeem Khan also briefed the management committee. It has been learnt that the management committee isn’t happy with the working of the latter as it didn’t receive satisfactory replies about why the registration and scrutiny of clubs across the country couldn’t be completed in the last three years. 
The plan of setting up a rehabilitation laboratory at the National Cricket Academy has also been rejected with the committee in favour of utilizing the facility at the Lahore University of Management Sciences.  
Sethi sidestepped questions regarding the appointment of separate captains for each format but did say that he will look into the issues surrounding the pitch at the Pindi Cricket Stadium, which received demerit points, for the opening Test of the recently-concluded series against England. 
“I have asked [management committee members] Haroon-ur-Rasheed and Shakeel Sheikh to take up the issue and am also sending Haroon to Karachi to have a look at the pitch before the first Test of the series against New Zealand [which begins on Monday],” he said.

2,Afghanistan’s Fazalhaq Farooqi sacked by BBL side after ‘incident’,"The fast bowler’s contract was torn up after the club  “received a complaint about the behaviour of Farooqi"".","SYDNEY: Afghan international Fazalhaq Farooqi was fired Friday by his Big Bash League side Sydney Thunder following an  “incident” last week that was investigated by Cricket Australia.
The fast bowler’s contract was torn up after the club  “received a complaint about the behaviour of Farooqi following an incident last Thursday”.
Thunder referred the matter to Cricket Austra­lia’s Integrity Unit for investigation and sacked him following the hearing.
“The behaviours displayed by Fazalhaq Farooqi sit outside our values and it was determined that his contract be terminated,” Cricket NSW chief Lee Germon said in a statement.
“Our focus now is providing the necessary support to those affected by this incident.”
Cricket Australia said the matter was confidential and no further comment would be made.
Farooqi, 22, has played 10 one-dayers and 17 Twenty20 games for Afghanistan, bowling superbly in the recent World Cup in Australia.
When signed by Thunder last month, he was described as  “an emerging talent”.

3,"England leave Rehan Ahmed out of NZ squad, Broad returns",LONDON: England have decided against taking teenage rising star Rehan Ahmed to New Zealand for their next Test ...,"LONDON: England have decided against taking teenage rising star Rehan Ahmed to New Zealand for their next Test series despite the 18-year-old leg-spinner’s dramatic introduction to international cricket while veteran  bowler Stuart Broad is back in the England squad the England and Wales Cricket Board announced on Friday.
Broad, who sits fifth in the list of all-time leading wicket takers in  international Test cricket, missed England’s recent historic 3-0 series  win in Pakistan due to the birth of his first child. He returns to the  setup alongside fellow seamers Matthew Potts and Olly Stone but paceman  Mark Wood is not included and neither is Ahmed 
Ahmed became England’s youngest men’s Test cricketer when he made his debut against Pakistan in Karachi last week, breaking a 73-year-old record set by Brian Close, and went on to become the youngest Test debutant from any country to enjoy a five-wicket haul as Ben Stokes’ men completed the series win.
Ahmed, however, arrived in Pakistan having played just three first-class matches for county side Leicestershire and England are keen to make sure his development is managed carefully.
Pitches in Mount Maunganui and Wellington for February’s two-Test series against New Zealand are not expected to favour spin. With left-armer Jack Leach retaining his position as first-choice spinner, Ahmed was left out of a 15-man squad.
He will instead play in the United Arab Emirates T20 league with the aim of joining up with England’s white-ball squad for the first time in Bangladesh in March.
Fast bowler Wood has been rested from all cricket after starring in England’s recent T20 World Cup win and the Pakistan series in a bid to ensure he is fit for next year’s Ashes series against Australia.
The Durham quick missed the entire 2022 English with elbow problems.
England have also taken a cautious approach with Jofra Archer.
The fast bowler was selected in a squad announced Thursday for January’s One-day International series away to South Africa, but was omitted from Friday’s Test party after nearly two years out injured.
England play a pink-ball Test against New Zealand in Mount Maunganui starting on Feb 16 before facing the world Test champions in a traditional day-game in Wellington.
England squad: Ben Stokes, James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Harry Brook, Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ben Foakes, Will Jacks, Dan Lawrence, Jack Leach, Ollie Pope, Matthew Potts, Ollie Robinson, Joe Root, Olly Stone.

The duo dominated the opening round of the SGA President’s Cup at the Defence Authority Golf Club, emerging joint-top at two-under 70 for a four-shot lead in the amateurs’ contest on Friday. 
Under sunny skies, with a cold winter breeze blowing across the course, Saim shot four birdies — including two in two at the start — that were offset by two bogeys. Yashal, on the other hand, was sedate as fired two birdies in a bogey-free round. 
A group of three comprising M.A. Mannan, Vivek Anand and Arsalan Mughal finished on two-over 74 with Jameeluddin Khan a further two strokes adrift. A further stroke adrift were Zia Hai, Danyal Khan and Bilal Nasim. 
In the veterans 70-75 years competition to be held over nine holes, Maj. Rizwan Farooq (41) held a four-shot lead over Brig. Naveed Nasar. Mir Ali Raza is a further stroke adrift in third. 
The contest for veterans 75 years and above was more tight with Col. Shahid Mahboob and Gp Capt. Aftab A. Khan tied for the lead at 41. Dr Zubair Mirza is third at 44. 
Waleed Bilal is in the lead after the first 18 holes of the juniors’ under-14 category after returning a card of 13-over 85. He holds a two-stroke lead over Nyle Aurangzeb with Shayan Zia a further two shots behind in third.

5,French minister calls Argentina ‘inelegant winners’,PARIS: French Sports MinisterAmelie Oudea-Castera on Friday accused Argentine players of being  “inelegant...,"PARIS: French Sports MinisterAmelie Oudea-Castera on Friday accused Argentine players of being  “inelegant winners” and  “vulgar” for mocking her country’s star Kylian Mbappe after winning the World Cup final.
“As much as our French team knew how to lose with panache, so the manner in which this Argentine team acted after this victory was not worthy of the match we saw”, the minister told French radio station RTL.
Oudea-Castera singled out goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, who was seen in the victory parade in Buenos Aires holding a baby doll its face covered with a photo of French star Mbappe.
Immediately after the match had been heard in the Argentina changing room demanding:  “A minute of silence... for Mbappe.”
Mbappe scored a hat-trick as France twice fought back to take the game to a shootout and then beat Martinez with the opening kick.
“I find it pitiful,” said Oudea-Castera.
“It’s just vulgar, inappropriate, really not up to the occasion,” she said  “This Emiliano Martinez is not distinguishing himself. It is rather pathetic”.
The minister said she was pleased that the president of the French Football Federation (FFF) Noel Le Graet had written to his Argentine counterpart to complain of  “abnormal excesses “in the celebrations.
Oudea-Castera told RTL Radio she was looking at the issue.
“I am not ruling out discussing this with my counterpart,” she said,  adding that France’s football body had also written to Claudio Tapia,  president of the Argentine Football Association (AFA), over the affair.
The Argentine Embassy in Paris did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.
The FFF has also said it intends to file complaints against French fans who posted racist comments on social media after Kingsley Coman and Aurelien Tchouameni missed in the shootout and Kolo Muani squandered a chance late in extra time.

Gokce, who owns a chain of restaurants and is known as ‘Salt Bae’ for his theatrical style of sprinkling salt on his steaks, posted videos and photos on his Instagram page of himself with Argentina’s players after their win over France in the final.
He was also photographed holding the World Cup trophy. According to FIFA’s website, the trophy can only be touched by a  “very select group of people,” including former winners and heads of state.
Videos circulating on social media also showed Gokce gripping Lionel Messi’s arm in an attempt to draw the Argentina captain’s attention.
“Following a review, FIFA has been establishing how individuals gained undue access to the pitch after the closing ceremony at Lusail Stadium on 18 December,” world football’s governing body said in a statement. “The appropriate internal action will be taken.”
Gokce went viral in 2017 after posting videos of himself salting meat with a cobra-like manoeuvre.
He has nearly 50 million Instagram followers and has helped launch Nusr-Et restaurants, which charge several hundred dollars for some cuts of meat, in a number of locations across the world.
The restaurateur has been pictured with several footballers and other celebrities at his restaurants, including Robert Lewandowski and Kylian Mbappe.
He posted a video of a previous meeting with Messi to his Instagram earlier this week.

8,England’s Curran breaks IPL auction record,NEW DELHI: England all-rounder Sam Curran became the Indian Premier League’s (IPL) most expensive ever buy in the...,"NEW DELHI: England all-rounder Sam Curran became the Indian Premier League’s (IPL) most expensive ever buy in the players’ auction on Friday as the world’s richest cricket league spent big ahead of the 2023 season.
Curran returned to the Punjab Kings for the staggering sum of 185 million Indian rupees ($2.23 million) following a fierce bidding war involving the Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians.
Curran, who was player-of-the-series in England’s T20 World Cup triumph in Australia this year, previously featured for the Punjab Kings in 2019.
“Back to where it all started! Looking forward to it,” tweeted the 24-year-old.
The fee for Curran surpassed the previous highest bid of 162.5 million rupees, paid by the Rajasthan Royals for South African all-rounder Chris Morris last year.
The previous record fee paid for Morris was broken once more on Friday, with Mumbai Indians paying 175 million rupees for Australian all-rounder Cameron Green.
“I’m pinching myself that this has all happened,” Green, 23, said in a video message during the auction broadcast.
“It’s such a weird feeling watching an auction for yourself. I can’t believe how nervous I was and I was shaking like anything when the final call was confirmed.”
The Super Kings made up for missing out on Curran by signing England red-ball captain Ben Stokes for 162.5 million rupees.
Batsman Harry Brook, who made his England Twenty20 international and Test debuts this year, became the first millionaire of the day after being signed by Sunrisers Hyderabad for 132.5 million rupees.

Mubasir plundered the Central Punjab bowlers for seven sixes and five fours in his blistering 62-ball unbeaten knock of 102 as Northern posted 303-7 after opting to bat first.
The youngster, who has been consistently performing with both bat and ball since the last two years in the domestic circuit, built on opener Haider Ali’s 87-ball 77 and Zeeshan Malik’s 41 off 63.
In response, Central Punjab were bowled out for 280 in nearly 48 overs with half centuries by Tayyab Tahir and Ahmed Shehzad went in vain for them.
While Tayyab added 61 off 70, Ahmed made a 54-run contribution before both were dismissed by Mubasir. The off-spinner then went on to pick up the wickets of Qasim Akram and Aamer Yamin to register figures of 4-51.
Saad Nasim and Usman Shinwari with three and two victims respectively, took the remaining Central Punjab wickets.
At the UBL Sports Complex, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa beat Sindh by four wickets as spinner Sajid Khan and Khalid Usman and pacer Ihsanullah equally shared nine wickets between them to restrict Sindh to 233.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ticked off the target in 36.1 overs with Israrullah and Waqar Ahmed providing the momentum with a 92-run partnership. Israrullah made 61 off 59 and Waqar scored 59 off 45.
Balochistan chased down Southern Punjab’s 219 with six wickets in hand at the NBP Sports Complex. Imran Butt top-scored with 101-ball 72 in the run chase and was duly supported by Abdul Wahid Bangalzai (37 off 58), Bismillah Khan (33 off 35) and Haseebullah (33 off 48).
Southern Punjab were bowled out in 45.5 overs as Kashif Bhatti and Yasir Shah — the two spinners — equally shared six wickets. Mohammad Junaid took two wickets.
Summarised scores:
Northern beat Central Punjab by 23 runs at State Bank Stadium 
NORTHERN 303-7 in 50 overs (Mubasir Khan 102 not out, Haider Ali 77, Zeeshan Malik 41, Umar Amin 34; Usama Mir 4-45); CENTRAL PUNJAB 280 in 47.5 overs (Tayyab Tahir 61, Ahmed Shehzad 54, Zafar Gohar 39; Mubasir Khan 4-51, Saad Nasim 3-43)

12,"Struggling Pakistan won’t be easy to beat, says New Zealand coach Stead","“We’ve had a fine welcome and it’s exciting to be in Pakistan,"" says coach.","KARACHI: Taking on Pakistan, not long after they received a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of England at home, will not be an easy task for World Test champions New Zealand, their head coach Gary Stead said on Friday.
The BlackCaps are set to play two Tests and three One-day Internationals on effectively their first tour of Pakistan in 19 years. They arrived here on late Thursday morning and will go straight into the first Test at the National Stadium on Monday.
“At this stage there is still a bit of jet lag in the group, but in the next few days sleep will be important to us as well as training out here,” Stead told reporters following their first practice session at the venue.  “We’ve had a fine welcome and it’s exciting to be in Pakistan.” 
England became the first team to inflict upon Pakistan their first-ever Test whitewash at home when they beat them in the third and final game by eight wickets earlier this week.
The Ben Stokes-led side had registered 74 and 27-run victories over the hosts in the first two matches, in Rawalpindi and Multan respectively. On both occasions, fourth-inning targets looked to be in Pakistan’s reach, only for batting collapses to follow.
Stead believed Pakistan lacked in luck and missed their top players — out due to injuries — during the England series and that he expected Babar Azam and co. to bounce back strongly.
“Definitely don’t think Pakistan can be beaten easily,” he said. 
“I think there are times in Test cricket that you get a little bit of the rub off the green and things go your way. I think maybe Pakistan haven’t had that recently and have had a few injuries to key players in their team as well.” 
New Zealand watched the Pakistan-England matches “very, very closely”, Stead revealed before providing his short analysis of it.
“Whilst it was 3-0 to England, I think it was a very tight series still and at times could have swung either way so we’re certainly not underestimating Pakistan at all, especially in their home ground as well,” he said.
While the Rawalpindi Test saw England pacers James Anderson and Ollie Robinson bundling down the Pakistan line-up bringing reverse swing in full use, spinners were much more dominant in the Multan and Karachi Tests — so much so that the hosts’ leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed went on to become the highest wicket-taker with 17 in just two outings.
“I think spin will play a bigger part than what we are probably used to normally but we also saw signs of reverse swing at times as well so for us honing our skills in that area will be very important,” observed Stead.
Considering the conditions at play, New Zealand included leg-spinner Ish Sodhi in the squad for the two Tests — the second of which will be played in Multan. 
The Karachi fixture, if Sodhi plays it, will be his first Test since November 2018, the time after which he has spent on the sidelines working on his bowling action. 
“Ish has been in and around our Test team in the past and hasn’t played for some period of time but he’s made a few changes in his action in the last 12 months and we think he’s probably going to be a little more consistent than what he has been prior to that when he wasn’t playing for us,” Stead said. 
“But the conditions that we face here are very, very different to what we get in New Zealand as well, so we picked out the squad thinking that a leg-spinner will be important and we’ve obviously seen Abrar and [Zahid] Mahmood bowling well for Pakistan in the recent Test series.”
Stead, who was appointed as the New Zealand head coach in 2018, said the Kiwis will approach the Pakistan games in accordance to their own strengths rather than the home side’s recent record.
“.. for us coming here its more focused on what we can do well,” clarified the 50-year-old. “I expect [the Test matches] are going to be tight, hard fought and maybe very close as well like [Pakistan’s} last ones against England. 
“We know the rivalry we have with Pakistan is fantastic, it’s always friendly on the field but fiercely competitive as well.”
The Pakistan series will also mark the start of the New Zealand pacer Tim Southee’s era as the BlackCaps Test captain after his predecessor Kane Williamson stepped down from the position earlier this month.
Williamson lead New Zealand for six years across all red and white-ball formats before calling it a day as skipper citing increasing workload. Stead believed Southee will bring fresh leadership ideas to the New Zealand camp in his new role but Williamson will be someone he will still look up to for help.
“He’s been captain for six years in all three formats and now I think over time he’s realised that maybe just pulling back a little bit gives him the chance to really just focus on his batting and still giving to the team,” the New Zealand coach said of Williamson. “He’d still be a great leader in our group. 
“We’ve gone for Tim Southee as our captain and it will be a little bit different having a pace bowler as captain. But Tim’s got a great cricketing brain and looking forward to the way he manages the side through this series in particular as his first.”

DHAKA: Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer will be ruing missed hundreds and a chance to put India in complete control of the second Test in Dhaka on Friday after Bangladesh took quick wickets to keep alive their chances of levelling the series.
Star all-rounder Shakib al-Hasan stepped up to claim three wickets in the final session on day two just when his side could see the game slipping away.
India finished their innings on 314, squeaking out an 87-run lead, but would have expected a much bigger tally when they resumed after tea on 226-4 with both Pant and Iyer having posted half-centuries.
Bangladesh reduced that lead to 80 by stumps, ending the day without losing a wicket with openers Najmul Hossain Shanto on five and Zakir Hasan on two.
“If we could have given less runs during that period even without getting a wicket we could have been in a better place,” Bangladesh spinner Taijul Islam, who cleared the top order to make 4-74, said of the second session.
“Still, I would say we are not in a very bad position,” he told reporters.
Pant and Iyer hit aggressive half-centuries to take India past Bangladesh’s first innings total but both fell agonisingly short of their hundreds as India lost their last six wickets for 61 runs.
Their partnership came to an end after they guided India to 253, with Pant hitting 93 off 104 balls and Iyer amassing his 87 off 105 deliveries.
Pant had been at his best, hitting five sixes and seven fours in his 11th Test fifty, before edging Mehidy Hasan for a sharp catch behind the stumps.
That wicket had a cascade effect as skipper Shakib got rid of Axar Patel (4) for his first wicket and then had Iyer out lbw two overs later.
Iyer rode his luck in an innings that included 10 fours and two sixes. He was dropped by Mehidy on 19 off Taskin and then escaped again when wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan missed a simple stumping chance off Shakib.
“My mindset was just to play the session out and see how it goes, but obviously at the same time I was not going to restrict my strokes,” he said.
“I am grateful for what score I got.”
The first session of the day belonged to Bangladesh as Taijul had KL Rahul (10) and Shubman Gill (20) out leg-before in successive overs before he dismissed Chetes­hwar Pujara for 24.
Indian skipper Rahul was initially declared not out but the decision was overturned on review.
Gill walked off after he was struck plumb in front by Taijul in the next over.
The left-arm spinner then broke the fledging 34-run partnership between Pujara and Kohli just as the duo looked set.
Pujara, who reached 7,000 Test runs during the innings, was caught by Mominul Haque at forward short leg.
Umesh Yadav and Ravichandran Ashwin claimed four wickets apiece on day one as India bowled out Bangladesh for a modest total in the first innings.
India won the first Test of the two-match series by 188 runs in Chittagong.

14,City edge holders Liverpool in League Cup thriller,"MANCHESTER: Manchester City beat League Cup holders Liverpool 3-2 in a cracking game on Thursday, taking the lead...","MANCHESTER: Manchester City beat League Cup holders Liverpool 3-2 in a cracking game on Thursday, taking the lead three times before holding on to reach the quarter-finals.
This last-16 clash marked the return to competitive action of two of  English football’s heavyweights following the World Cup break with  City’s Kevin De Bruyne the outstanding player in a high-class field.
Defender Nathan Ake headed in what proved to be the winning goal in the 58th minute after Mohamed Salah had equalised one minute after Riyad Mahrez restored City’s advantage early in the second half.
Erling Haaland scored his 24th goal of the season in all competitions to put City ahead in the 10th minute at the Etihad Stadium but Liverpool responded in the 20th, when Fabio Carvalho knocked in a James Milner pass to complete a flowing move.
It was another fast and furious game between the two rivals who took the Premier League title race to a dramatic conclusion last season and, as then, it was City who finished on top.
They will travel to Southampton in the quarter-finals.
Liverpool coach Juergen Klopp thought Haaland’s goal was offside and lamented the fact VAR technology is not used in the League Cup until the semi-final stage.
“We have VAR, the referees are used to VAR. The technology is here, why shouldn’t we use it?,” said the German coach.
“We worked hard, we did good stuff. It was not good enough for tonight but it’s City at their home ground, it will always be an incredibly difficult game.”  City coach Pep Guardiola, who enjoyed a first win over Liverpool in six matches in all competitions, was pleased with his side’s performance.
“We cannot say it was not a good game,” he said.  “It’s not easy to keep the ball against Liverpool because they have a defensive structure that is the most difficult I ever faced in my career.”
Guardiola was also full of praises for De Bruyne who delivered a  a superb pinpoint cross to Ake for the winner.
“Kevin played with a fire inside of him. He had to find it. What a  player. How many years he’s been coming here? Eight years? He’s an  absolute legend.”
Haaland looked refreshed from his extended break due to Norway’s failure to qualify for the World Cup and heavily contributed to his team’s build-up play, setting up a great chance for Cole Palmer but the youngster sliced his shot wide.
Haaland had no such problem when presented with his first clear chance, stretching out his left leg to send Kevin De Bruyne’s cross into the net.
City’s defence switched off and allowed Liverpool to pass their way around their area and equalise through Carvalho.
Guardiola’s side looked more likely to score again and did so soon after the interval, Mahrez controlling a through ball from Rodri with one foot and slamming it low into the net with the other.
The visitors made two changes at half-time, Fabinho and Alex  Oxlade-Chamberlain coming on for novice midfielder Stefan Bajcetic and  Carvalho.
But Liverpool fell behind again before either of the two substitutes could get into the game.
As has often been the case in the recent years of the fixture, though, Liverpool came straight back and Darwin Nunez made a lung-bursting run down the left wing to latch on to a pass and sent it across for Salah to tap in.
City would not be outdone, however, and took the lead for the final  time, Ake rising high to head home an inviting cross from De Bruyne.
Oxlade-Chamberlain went down in the penalty after a collision with Ake  in the 69th minute but David Coote denied the Reds a spot-kick and, with  VAR not in use, the referee’s decision stood.

LAHORE: Inspired by goal-laden displays by Manuel Carranza and Tomas Marin Moreni respectively, Diamond Paints/Sheikhoo Steel and FG/Din Polo set up a final of the Coca-Cola Lahore Open Polo Championship on Friday.
