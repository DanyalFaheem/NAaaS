0,"Noor’s parents, activists demand execution of Zahir Jaffer at earliest",Candle-light vigil held in her memory at F-9 Park,"ISLAMABAD: Family and friends of Noor Mukadam – daughter of a former diplomat who was shot dead and decapitated on July 20, 2021, in Islamabad by Zahir Jaffer – gathered at F-9 Park in the capital to mark her first death anniversary and demand early execution of Jaffer who was handed a death sentence in February this year.
The gathering attended by rights activists urged the government and judiciary to ensure early execution of the death sentence to Jaffer for murdering and raping Noor.
At the request of Noor’s parents, her friends and human rights activists attended the event arranged to mark her first death anniversary. Besides fateha for the departed soul and a candlelight vigil was held in her memory.
The participants vowed that they would continue their efforts to send Jaffer to the gallows. He is not only the killer of Noor, but his action had also caused fear and panic among women across the country, they said as they held placards and pictures of the deceased woman.

Candle-light vigil held in her memory at F-9 Park

Speaking on the occasion, Shaukat Mukadam, Noor’s father, said he had full faith in the courts as the sessions courts announced the verdict in the case on merit and in the shortest possible time. He added that soon the killer would get the punishment.
He said though he had lost his beloved daughter, he was committed to ensuring that no other daughter of the country went through such an ordeal. Therefore, implementation of the punishment to the killer was imperative, he added.
Mr Mukadam appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to issue a statement on Noor’s first death anniversary so that other daughters of this country could feel a sense of security.
Kausar Mukadam, Noor’s mother, recalled the painful day of July 20 when her daughter was murdered in cold blood. “In July, last year, my happiness was snatched. I was deprived of my daughter,” she said.
Noor had a dream of doing something for Pakistan, a teary Ms Mukadam said, adding that, “I think she had done that by resisting the ruthless killer [Zahir Jaffer] and exposing him”.
Rights activist Tahira Abdullah said Zahir Jaffer’s trial was completed in six months calling the timely completion “encouraging”. She, however, raised questions over the acquittal of the killer’s parents – Zakir Jaffer and Asmat.
On July 20, 2021, Ms Mukadam, 27, was found murdered at Zahir Jaffer’s house in Islamabad. Following the grisly discovery of her body, he was taken into custody.
According to the FIR registered by her father, he discovered that his “daughter had been brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded”.
After a months-long trial, an Islamabad court sentenced Jaffer to death for the murder of Noor Mukadam on Feb 24. The court also found him guilty of rape and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs200,000.
The court sentenced two co-accused Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad — both domestic servants at Jaffer’s house — to 10 years’ imprisonment. Iftikhar and Mohammad, who were working as watchman and gardener, respectively, were punished for aiding in the abetment of crime.
However, Jaffer’s parents as well as TherapyWorks personnel were acquitted by the sessions court. Jamil Ahmed, a chef at Jaffer’s residence, was acquitted by the court.
The parents of Noor Mukadam subsequently moved the Islamabad High Court seeking stringent punishments for the convicts besides contesting the acquittal of Jaffer’s parents. Similarly, the domestic staff of the convict approached the court against the punishments awarded to them.
Zahir Jaffer had also challenged the death sentence in the case.

The Bhara Kahu bypass project, ground breaking of which was performed last May, has not yet started much to the inconvenience of the citizens who continue to face traffic congestion on Murree Road. However, sources said the engineering wing of the civic agency came up with a new proposal stating that construction of a flyover would solve the problem of traffic congestion.
The existing Kayani Road, which is linked with Quaid-i-Azam University road, will be used as bypass road and from the chowk, a flyover will be constructed.
“The proposed 8km Bhara Kahu bypass also has two major bridges in design. Under the new proposal we will have to construct a 4km road including a flyover, so this proposal is cost effective and we have decided to go for it,” said a senior officer of the civic agency.
He said the flyover project was easy to execute and could be completed within a year’s time while the bypass project could take several years to complete because the area was hilly. 
When asked if the bypass road project has been abandoned, he said: “The project could be executed in the future, but yes we have decided to give priority to the flyover project.”
It is relevant to note here that the proposed bypass was to start from Malpur area and culminate near Satra Meel on Murree Road. Former prime minister Imran Khan had laid the foundation stone of the project in April last year near Quaid-i-Azam University. 
Earlier, officials of the civic agency used to say that work on the bypass would be started soon after completion of first phase of the project – G.T. Road to D-12 – 80pc of which is complete.
They said that last year, CDA had engaged Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) and Army’s E&C branch for construction of Margalla Road and designing, alignment etc, of the bypass as well.
In 2017, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had issued a directive for starting the Bhara Kahu bypass, however, no practical work was carried out in his tenure. 
Thousands of people face traffic congestion in Bhara Kahu area of Murree Road on a daily basis. 
“We have no issue, if CDA will construct bypass or will go for flyover, we want a solution, we want to get rid of massive traffic congestion in Bhara Kahu Chowk. We want early start of construction work,” said Bilal Khan, a shopkeeper of Bhara Kahu.

4,Indian woman wants visa regimes eased to facilitate people on both sides of border,90-year-old Reena Varma from India fulfils her family’s dream to visit her ancestral house that she left 75 years ago.,"ISLAMABAD: The visit of the Indian nonagenarian to her ancestral three-storey home tucked away in the narrow alleys of the garrison city has opened a new chapter for the authorities to facilitate citizens of India and Pakistan on humanitarian grounds.
On Wednesday, Reena Varma, 90, from Pune, Maharashtra, finally fulfilled her family’s dream to visit the house that she left 75 years ago.
Her visit and related formalities were facilitated by the administrator of the Facebook page, ‘India Pakistan Heritage Club’ Imran William.
Mr William said the Indian authorities should reciprocate as more than 20 senior citizens from Pakistan wanted to visit their ancestral homes across the border.
“We work to highlight the shared heritage of both countries and reunite families separated by partition,” Mr William said, adding that, “we want to help people in getting permission to travel across the border.”
Talking to Dawn after her visit to the house which was built by her father – an employee of the Military Accounts in the British India Army – the teary-eyed Ms Varma said: “We had a radio and a gramophone in those days and I used to sing from the balcony of our house, especially when it rained.”
She urged both countries to ease their visa regimes to enable people from either sides to meet frequently.
“I would urge the new generation to work together and make things easy,” she said, adding that humanity was above everything and all religions taught humanity.
She said the only thing which made her sad was that no one from her family of eight was alive to share her joy.
“I am very happy to see that the house stood intact; even the fireplace is still in functioning condition,” she said, adding that, “during holidays in winters we used to burn wood for heating”.
Incidentally, for her age, Ms Varma not only recalled all details of the house but her life in Rawalpindi when she was merely 15 years old.
“We plan to visit Murree in the coming days – I remember we used to go there every summer,” she said.
Since her brother was in the British Army, the family moved to Pune after 1947 where he was posted, but the family did not take any property in claim against the Rawalpindi house.
“My mother always wanted to have this house, and she maintained that if we take any other house, our right to this house would be lost,” she said, adding that, “things have changed but the love and affection showered by the people of Pakistan will remain in my heart forever”.
REUTERS ADDS: Ms Varma has vivid memories of the day she and her family left their house.
Her family was among the millions whose lives were thrown into turmoil by the partition of colonial India into two states, mainly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan, when British rule ended in 1947.
At one point, Ms Varma burst into laughter over being unable to climb a staircase without a support, saying she had once tackled it “like a bird” countless times a day.
When she lived in Rawalpindi hers was a Hindu street, she said, but Muslims, Christians and Sikhs all lived in her neighbourhood peacefully.

6,"No compromise on fiscal, administrative rights of Azad Kashmir: PML-N",Opposes proposed piece of law being introduced by the PTI govt “in the name of tourism promotion”.,"MUZAFFARABAD: The regional leadership of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has made it clear that there will be no compromise on the fiscal and administrative rights achieved by Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) some four years ago through the 13th amendment to its Constitution.
They also declared their strong opposition, both in and outside the AJK Legislative Assembly, to a proposed piece of law being introduced by the PTI government “in the name of tourism promotion”, terming it “anti-state, anti-people and anti-environment”.
“We represent the people of Azad Kashmir and we will never compromise on the rights and authority of the people,” vowed the party’s regional president and secretary general, Shah Ghulam Qadir and Chaudhry Tariq Farooq, respectively, at a joint press conference on Wednesday.
Mr Qadir and Mr Farooq were nominated by PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif on the advice of Nawaz Sharif as new regional leaders on July 6.
Mr Qadir has replaced former premier Raja Farooq Haider who has been elevated as party’s central vice president.
The new leadership was accorded a rousing welcome on its maiden visit to Muzaffarabad late on Tuesday evening.
At the presser, Mr Qadir and Mr Farooq were flanked by former ministers in the previous PML-N government, Raja Abdul Qayyum, Syed Shaukat Ali Shah, Chaudhry Mohammad Saeed, Noreen Arif, Dr Mustafa Bashir, Barrister Iftikhar Gillani, MLA Raja Mohammad Siddique and MLA Waqar Ahmed Noor, as well as dozens of other party leaders and activists.
Mr Haider was however conspicuous by his absence despite being in Muzaffarabad.
As further amendments to the AJK Constitution are a burning issue in AJK, Mr Qadir asserted that his party’s central leadership was also of the view that the rights and powers granted to the AJK government under the 13th amendment would neither be surrendered nor reduced.
He said PM Sharif’s adviser for Kashmir affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Qamar Zaman Kaira had also told a PML-N AJK chapter delegation that as such no draft had been prepared for the much talked about 15th amendment.
Responding to a question, regional secretary general Farooq maintained that if the PML-N had struck a deal on 13th amendment [in 2018], it would have still been in power.
“The [13th] amendment gave rights to a common man in our state and there isn’t a single point in it that runs counter to the interests of the state of Pakistan. We wonder why different drafts are in circulation in Islamabad and Muzaffarabad,” he said.
Both leaders also took strong exception to a proposed bill envisaging establishment of a tourism authority and special tourism zones in AJK.
“This is an anti-state, anti-people and anti-environment bill, actually aimed at grabbing forest land and other beautiful attractive tourist sites… and we will strongly oppose it at every forum, including the assembly,” they said.
The PML-N leaders also strongly condemned India’s plans to convene the G20 summit meeting in occupied Kashmir and demanded of the federal government to activate its foreign office in stopping the proposed meet in the internationally acknowledged disputed territory.
To a question, they asserted that there was no rift in the AJK chapter and all were united under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif.

The exhibition titled, A Night At Lok Virsa Museum: The Confluence of Civilisations Between Indonesia and Pakistan, coincides with the 77th anniversary of Indonesia’s independence. 
“The show also coincides with the celebrations of diamond jubilee of cordial relations with Pakistan next month, which we will all be celebrating together,” Mr Tugio said.
The exhibition, organised by the Indonesian embassy and Lok Virsa, features a selected collection of photographs and videos that shed light on inter-regional connectivity and cross-cultural influence on both countries. 
The exhibition offers a fresh perspective into historical connections, religious backgrounds and the confluence of civilisation of both countries from past to present.
Some of the works focus on the spread of Buddhism and Islam in Indonesia besides the ancient civilisation and rock art.
According to the ambassador, the images will help people of the two countries trace cultural roots and the true purpose and deeper meaning of existence. The show is a continuation of a book launch from last year about similarities between Indonesia and Pakistan that received a good response.
“Many elements of the Buddhist culture in Indonesia seem to have been borrowed from Taxila. One of the main objectives is to highlight the fusion of culture between the two countries. Throughout this exhibition you will see the influence of Buddhism and Islam in today’s Indonesia and Pakistan.
“It will attract more people from Pakistan to Indonesia and vice versa and they will be amazed by the similarities in traditions and beyond such as food and commonalities between the Indonesian batik shawl and the Pakistani ajrak,” Mr Tugio said.
He said his favourite corners were the two ajrak and batik booths, where shawl makers from both countries described the tough grind of making the ajrak and batik. “It is an excellent example of fusion of the two cultures,” he added.
A miniature model of Borobudur, the biggest Buddhist temple in the world was also a major attraction. “It took 50 years to excavate Borobudur. I am very proud to share that the miniature model has been made by Pakistani craftsmen,” the ambassador said.
Besides local guests, dignitaries from the diplomatic corps such as Australia, Jordan, Korea and Thailand were also present. They enjoyed Pakistani musicians playing Indonesian tunes.
Lok Virsa’s Executive Director Sajjad Ahmed said: “Pakistan and Indonesia are blessed with rich cultural heritage and traditions with interesting similarities, which play an important role in keeping our bonds intact.”
The show will continue at Lok Virsa till July 24.

10,Combustible smoking puts disease burden on country: speakers,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is facing a heavy burden of disease because of combustible smoking, with more than 25 million...","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is facing a heavy burden of disease because of combustible smoking, with more than 25 million users of tobacco in the country. 
Some estimates say the number of tobacco users has reached 29 million.
This was stated at an event titled: ‘A Discussion on Smoking Cessation and Tobacco Harm Reduction’ organised by Alternative Research Initiative (ARI) on Wednesday.
If people decide to give up smoking, they do not know where they should seek assistance. That is why less than 3pc smokers successfully quit smoking in a year in Pakistan
The total cost of all smoking attributable to diseases and deaths in Pakistan was 3.85 billion dollars in 2019.
Research analyst Dr Abdul Hameed Leghari informed the discussants that tobacco harm reduction works as almost all of the disease risk attributable to smoking arises from the smoke: the particles of tar and toxic gases that are inhaled from burning tobacco.
ARI Project Director Arshad Ali Syed regretted that smokers’ concerns have been ignored in Pakistan’s tobacco control efforts.
He said that smokers should be part of efforts for a smoke-free future, since their participation in cessation efforts at policy level will provide the critical link for knowing what help they need to quit.
Meanwhile, health experts have urged the government to impose health levy on tobacco products to save precious lives, which are at imminent fatal risk.
In a joint press release shared by Society for Protection of Rights of the Child (Sparc), the experts recommended to the government to take this step, which has been pending since June 2019.
Country head Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids Malik Imran Ahmed said in June 2019, the federal cabinet decided to implement a health levy on tobacco products to protect the health of low-income groups and children by taking tobacco products out of their spending reach. Unfortunately, some key members from government, hailing from tobacco growing areas, repeatedly blocked this move.
He added that tobacco industry claims to be an essential entity however tobacco use is the leading cause of death due to non-communicable diseases such as cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular disease.
Sparc Programme Manager Khalil Ahmed Dogar mentioned that children and low-income people were primary target of tobacco industry and unfortunately, tobacco control policies were making those groups more vulnerable.
He said the average increase of 10.8pc in excise tax on cigarette in Finance Bill 2022 is even lower than the 13.3pc inflation; cigarettes will become affordable than two years ago. Therefore, it is important to impose health levy immediately otherwise the number of smokers in Pakistan will go beyond control.
