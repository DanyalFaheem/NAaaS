0,IMF not adding new conditions to pact: Ahsan Iqbal,"Bloomberg report claims Fund ""assessing Saudi commitment to financing Pakistan"" before fresh disbursement.","WASHINGTON: Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal said on Wednesday that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has not added new conditions to the staff-level agreement it concluded with Pakistan last week.
Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday that the Fund was “assessing Saudi Arabia’s commitment to financing Pakistan before it disburses fresh funds to the South Asian nation.”
The minister, who has held two meetings with IMF officials in New York and Washington this week, said the fund “did not raise this issue in talks with us.”
Asked at a news briefing at the Pakistan Embassy in Islamabad, Mr Iqbal said, “The Fund did not suggest any new conditions in our meetings.”

Bloomberg report claims Fund ‘assessing Saudi commitment to Pakistan’ before fresh disbursement

The minister said that the IMF has agreed to “release the funds by August and extend the facility to June 2023 and add one billion dollars to the package.”
However, Bloomberg reported that the Washington-based lender “wants to ensure that Saudi Arabia will follow through with as much as $4bn in funding to Pakistan to ensure Islamabad does not have a funding gap after the IMF loan.”
The IMF and Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement last week to complete the combined seventh and eighth reviews of the country’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF). The IMF’s Executive Board still has to approve the agreement before Pakistan receives the next tranche of $1.2bn, bringing total disbursements under the programme to about $4.2bn. The board is expected to meet in August.
The Bloomberg report also said that the $1.2bn from the IMF would be insufficient for Pakistan to avoid a debt default. The report pointed out that “Pakistan’s rupee and bonds are sinking as the financing woes, coupled with renewed political uncertainty, roil the country.” 
Pakistan needs at least $41bn in the next 12 months to fund debt repayments and boost foreign exchange reserves, the report added.
The planning minister said that in his meeting with IMF officials at the UN he suggested setting up a Covid-like facility for developing countries to help them deal with the impact of the Ukraine war. 
“This war is a super-shock for developing economies,” he said. “It has upset their balance of payments, created a food shortage and a major energy crisis for them. This impact is stronger than that of the pandemic.”
Mr Iqbal said that the international community, particularly developed countries, “must devise a mechanism to provide fiscal relief for developing countries so that they can revive their development funds and social support budgets.”
The minister said that in his meeting with IMF officials in Washington he reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to the IMF programme, which was violated by the PTI government. “This violation has shaken the confidence of lenders like the IMF,” he said. “We assured them that there would be no more breaches of confidence. We told them that Pakistan means business,” the minister said.
“We urged them to tell their board, when it meets to consider the staff level agreement, that we want to do all we need to revivify our economy.”

1,"ECC okays wheat, urea imports at cheaper rates",Approves Rs1.56 quarterly tariff hike for KE.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination  Committee (ECC) of the cabinet on Wednesday approved the import of 300,000 tonnes of wheat and 200,000 tonnes of urea at eight per cent and 17pc cheaper rates, respectively, at a total foreign exchange cost of about $222 million.
A meeting of the ECC presided over by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail also approved a Rs1.56 per unit increase in K-Electric’s power rates under a quarterly adjustment that would bring it on a par with the national uniform power tariff. 
The ECC, on the request of the Ministry of National Food Security and Research, approved the lowest bid of $404.86 per tonne for 120,000 tonnes of wheat by firm Vittera B.V-Marine International with cost and freight bulk at the letter of credit on a sight basis. The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) was also allowed to match the tender quantity of 300,000 tonnes. This will entail foreign exchange spending of about $121.5m.
The meeting was informed that Pakistan had earlier in May contracted import of about 500,000 tonnes of wheat for delivery between July and Aug 15 at the lowest bid price of about $515.5 per tonne, involving a total foreign exchange payment of about $258m.

Approves Rs1.56 quarterly tariff hike for KE

In the third week of June, the TCP went for another tender of 300,000 tonnes of wheat import which fetched the lowest bid price of $439.4 per tonne for delivery between mid-August to Sept 15. The ECC first approved the lowest bid but then scrapped it after two days because of the declining international market and ordered fresh tender.
The TCP’s third tender was issued on July 7 for 300,000 tonnes based on LC on sight with a 90-day deferred payment. Out of seven responsive bids, the lowest bid for 120,000 tonnes this time came in at $404.86 per tonne (about $35 cheaper than earlier tender) on LC on sight involving a foreign exchange of $121.5m for 300,000 tonnes. Only a single bid on a 90-day deferred payment was received for $420 per tonne.
The estimated cost at Karachi Port is Rs89,066 per tonne while that of 90-day deferred payment basis bid for delivery at Karachi port worked out at Rs92,343 per tonne. The shipment window in both offers is August-September.
Urea import
The ECC also authorised the TCP for signing an agreement for the import of 200,000 tonnes of urea from China’s M/s Sinochem Fertiliser and M/s CNAMPGC at a negotiated rate of $500 per tonne freight-on-board (FoB) on a 90-day deferred payment with markup basis. The ECC directed that imports be made under the cabinet directives with an allocation of Rs22bn for this import with $100m as exchange cover, which has not been allocated into the budget 2022-23.
The meeting was informed that through negotiations, the Chinese authorities had agreed to reduce the offered price from $606 per tonne to $500 per tonne with an approximate saving of about $21.3m.
KE tariff
The ECC also approved about Rs1.55 per unit increase in average tariff for K-Electric for the second quarterly adjustment of 2021-22 in line with the national average tariff for distribution companies of ex-Wapda. Now the Power Division would take this approval to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) for notification of the schedule of tariff under the national uniform tariff mechanism. 
The adjustment shall be applicable on the consumption of July, August and September 2021 for recovery from consumers in August, September and October bills.
Levy on LPG increased 
The ECC did not immediately approve a request of the ministries of energy and finance for an increase in petroleum development levy on liquefied petroleum gas by about 116pc to Rs10,111 per tonne instead of Rs4,669 per tonne at present to generate Rs8bn revenue during the current fiscal year. “The ECC returned the summary to the ministry for reconsideration of the proposal”, said an official statement.

2,Businessmen warn of Sri Lanka-like crisis,Urge central bank to play role to end exchange rate volatility.,"KARACHI: Leading businessmen gathered at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) to analyse the looming threat of a Sri Lanka-like economic emergency as the dollar hit an all-time high of Rs224.92 against the local currency in the interbank market on Wednesday.
FPCCI President Irfan Iqbal Shiekh said the rupee’s free fall has reached a point where it has become a threat to national security as the letters of credit (LCs) for petroleum imports were being opened at a much higher rate than the interbank rate. 
He feared that a serious law and order situation might emerge in the event of any fuel shortages for transportation and electricity generation. “We are not far from a Sri Lanka-like scenario and radical decisions are needed to reverse the situation,” he warned.
According to an FPCCI’s press release, leading businessman Aqeel Karim  Dhedhi expressed his shock that despite the fact that many numbers are  showing improvement over the last few weeks, such as global oil  prices, declining edible oil prices and better supplies of many other  commodities, the government has failed to rein in inflation.  

Urge central bank to play role to end exchange rate volatility

The FPCCI chief emphasised that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) cannot continue with the free-floating exchange rate and has to apply regulatory tools to minimise speculation and uncertainty. He added that the country does not even have enough foreign exchange reserves to cover two months of imports.
Despite a foreign exchange bloodbath, the government has failed to appoint a governor for the SBP, which reflects poorly on the government’s seriousness in dealing with the situation, he said.
Patron Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Group (KWGA) Anis Majeed said the landing cost of imported pulses had increased by Rs7-8 per kg in the last 10 days due to continuous rupee deprecation against the dollar and its impact had not been passed to the wholesale rates by the traders due to uncertain future exchange rates. Traders import pulses under cash against documents rather than through opening letters of credit.
He said pulse imports already decreased by 29pc to 897,352 tonnes ($611m) in FY22 from 1.266m ($709m) in FY21. The average per tonne price rose to $681 from $560.
In a statement, Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) President Salman Aslam, said the business community had serious reservations about the government’s mysterious silence for not taking any steps to manage the declining economy.
He said that the value of the rupee was depreciating artificially, leaving the currency free-floating in the market and causing severe losses to the economy. Investors have lost confidence after the stock market crash and the negative rating of Pakistan by Fitch rating agency.
Mr Aslam predicted a storm of inflation if the rupee continued to fall against the dollar.
The president of the North Karachi Association of Trade and Industry (NKATI), Faisal Moiz Khan, urged the SBP to adopt effective strategies to stabilise the rupee and curb the continued appreciation of the dollar.
The SBP needs to play its role as a regulator to prevent a further rise in the dollar price, he said, fearing that Pakistani products would become uncompetitive in the world markets after the rising landing cost of imported raw materials in view of persistent rupee devaluation besides creating difficulties in timely fulfillment of export commitments.

3,Government undecided over extension of import ban,"Govt on May 19 imposed two-month ban on 800 items in bid to contain import bill, minimise pressure on foreign exchange reserves.","ISLAMABAD: Confusion prevails over the status of a possible extension of the ban on the import of nearly 800 items in 33 categories including food products while its validity ended on July 19, Dawn has learnt from knowledgeable sources.
The government on May 19 imposed a two-month ban on these products in a bid to contain the rising import bill and minimise pressure on the country’s dwindling foreign exchange reserves. The annual impact of this ban was estimated between $250m to $500m.
A well-placed source in the commerce ministry told Dawn that it has approached the finance ministry to seek the status of further extension in the ban. “We have started reviewing the impact of the ban on imports and consultation with relevant stakeholders”, the source further said.
A senior official of the finance ministry has also informed a standing committee meeting that the government is reviewing the options of whether to continue the ban or withdraw it after consultation with all stakeholders.
Last week, the federal government approved a summary of the commerce ministry seeking to allow clearance of all goods stuck at ports that had arrived after the May 19 notification but booked before the announcement of this decision.
The ban was imposed in a sense to slow down imports. However, no respite was noted in the country’s overall import bill which grew to $7.88bn in June from $6.77bn in May.  
Meanwhile, the banned items were imported under the Afghan Transit Trade and were smuggled back to Pakistan during the last two months.
Despite the decision, the dollar scaled an all-time high above Rs224 driven by a rising import bill, growing current account deficit and depleting foreign exchange reserves.

4,Rice exports fetch record $2.5bn,"Volume of rice exported, both Basmati and non-Basmati varieties, during FY22 was over 4.8m tonnes.","LAHORE: Rice exports crossed the $2.5 billion mark during the 2021-22 fiscal year for the first time in country’s history, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.
Last year, the country fetched $2.041bn foreign exchange through rice exports. 
The volume of rice exported, both Basmati and non-Basmati varieties, this year was over 4.877 million tonnes, which was 1.19m tonnes more than last year’s figure of 3.684m tonnes. 
According to the PBS data, the volume of rice exports grew 32.35 per cent while the value in dollar terms rose 23pc on a year-on-year basis.
Basmati rice accounts for more than 0.75m tonnes of export volume and more than $69m in financial terms.
Talking to Dawn, Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (Reap) chairman Ali Hussam Asghar said lower rice prices than in India at the start of the season attracted international buyers towards Pakistan, which helped increase the export volume. 
He said the non-availability of containers did create problems, and Reap representatives resolved them with the help of the Trading Corporation of Pakistan through the provision of bulk vessels. 
He promised to work on the supply chain so that rice export volumes could reach $3bn in the coming year. 
Mr Asghar predicted that Basmati acreage and production were set to increase in the next season as farmers had got a good price for their produce during the year ending June 2022. Until last year, rice sector stakeholders had been expressing their concerns at the increasing trend of sowing non-Basmati, particularly hybrid rice varieties, even in the Basmati producing belt of Gujranwala division. 
According to rice sector expert Hamid Malik, the supply side has greatly improved in the last three years, with production increasing from 7.2m tonnes to 8.9m tonnes.
Mr Malik said the demand side also remained robust during 2021 and 2022 despite odds like a three-time increase in ocean freight, the non-availability of empty containers and bulk vessels, and restrictions related to the Covid pandemic.

The rupee lost 1.3 per cent value to close at 224.92 against the dollar in the third consecutive days of battering.
