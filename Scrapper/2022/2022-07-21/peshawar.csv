Talking to a delegation of representatives of Sipah Khidmat-i-Khalq Committee at his office on Wednesday, he directed the line department heads to pay immediate visits to the areas where the displaced families had only recently returned and ascertain their genuine problems before compiling the report.
He also directed the authorities concerned to immediately start ‘citizens’ losses compensation programme’ in the militancy-affected areas. He ordered them to take stern action against those officials, who were found guilty of demanding illegal money from the returned families in lieu of wrongfully registering their names in the damage assessment survey report.
The commissioner also directed the officials of communications and works department to prepare PC-I for a bridge on the Bara River in Sipah-inhabited area of Tirah valley. He asked the health officials to establish basic health unit in the same locality.
Earlier, the Sipah delegation apprised the commissioner about the problems faced by majority of the returned families.
Meanwhile, more than 200 former khasadars of Bara ended their years-long boycott of polio vaccination after successful negotiations with a delegation of tribal elders.
Head of the delegation Malak Abdur Razzaq said that the former political administration of erstwhile Khyber Agency had terminated services of 715 khasadars after they rendered resignation en masse when they were threatened by Mangal Bagh, the head of militant organisation Lashkar-i-Islam in 2009.
He said that though around 500 of the terminated khasadars were later reinstated in different phases after furnishing guarantees about their good conduct by their respective tribal elders, 215 remained terminated and they held a series of protests to press the government for reinstating them on their previous positions.
He said that the disgruntled khasadars had also stopped vaccinating their children against polio as a mark of protest, which they ended on Wednesday after an assurance by the tribal elders that their grievances would be addressed in due course of time.

Addressing a news conference in Khar area, elders from Barang tehsil Malik Samiullah Khan, Malik Akbar Khan, Malik Khista Gul and Malik Haji Asghar Khan said the establishment of the Government Degree College, Barang, was approved in 2014, while work on it was completed two years ago but it had yet to open its doors to the people.
They said it was the only college in the region, which had a population of 200,000.
The elders said that the college’s building and classrooms were in place, a hostel for teachers was ready for use, while all facilities from furniture to drinking water to electric supply were there but even then, the start of classes was unnecessarily being delayed by the relevant authorities to the unrest of the residents.
They said a lack of proper security had rendered the building and its equipment and goods vulnerable to damage and theft.
The elders also complained that the education department had yet to appoint teachers and other staff members to the college.
They said that the relevant authorities had promised them that the college would become functional by August 2020, but they didn’t fulfil the promise.
The elders said that they had taken up the matter with the district administration, provincial minister Anwar Zeb Khan, MNA Guldad Khan and local MPA Ajmal Khan several times, but to no avail.
They asked the relevant authorities to make the college functional before the start of the new academic year saying the start of classes will facilitate the enrolment of hundreds of matriculate students from the area.
The elders said they along with other residents would begin a ‘protest movement’ if the college was not made functional at the launch of the new academic session slated to start next month.
They said the street protests would continue until the issue wasn’t resolved by the authorities.

10,IKD to get funds for free medication to renal transplant patients,Health secretary says all issues of the institute will be resolved,"PESHAWAR: Health department is going to resolve the longstanding issue of shortage of funds for free provision of medicines to patients after renal transplants at Institute of Kidney Diseases (IKD), Hayatabad Medical Complex.
“We have convened a meeting to resolve the issue of funds for the subsequent medication of post-transplant patients today. The meeting will be attended by officials of finance and health departments besides the present and former directors of IKD,” Health Secretary Amir Sultan Tareen told Dawn.
According to him, the government has been providing funds for free medication to all patients after transplantation but the finance department wants that the medication should be given to only those people, who undergo procedures at IKD.
“We will set criteria for free medication to resolve the issue. IKD is part of HMC, a medical teaching institution but the government wants to help the patients, who deserve free medicines,” he said.

Health secretary says all issues of the institute will be resolved

The health secretary said that a proper mechanism was being devised to help the poor patients and save the money from being wasted. “Additionally, the meeting will also hold detailed discussion regarding resumption of renal transplants at IKD and extra funds for the purpose,” he said.
The institute had stopped renal transplants two years ago and now wants to re-start the procedures to facilities patients.
In February this year, IKD told the health department through a letter that it had 1,200 registered patients, who received medicines after transplants on monthly basis and on average 50 to 60 patients visited the nephrology OPD on daily basis where they weren’t only given free anti-rejection drugs after a long process of their clinical evaluation.
The letter said that patients were also subjected to battery of tests and were given drugs as per investigation. It said that the patients were checked by consultants. It added that the cost of investigation was about Rs10,000 per patient that was burden on the institute.
It said that in future, the cost of investigation should be addressed. In case of rejection, the cost of treatment was beyond Rs500, 000. Each year, 120 new patients were registered. Therefore, the provision of funds should be made on sustainable basis not on ad hoc basis, it added.
The letter also said that free medication to only poor patients from Zakat fund should be allowed and only the people undergoing transplants at IKD should be made entitled to the free services as it was huge constraint on health budget to facilities all the patients undergoing transplants anywhere.
Sources in IKD said that in response to many letters for provision of funds, Rs30 million was released in December last year by the government against the demand of Rs122 million. 
The process of providing free medicines to kidney transplant patients was resumed on February 4, 2022 that lasted for two months, they added.
They said that since April 11, the patients were not getting free drugs. The patients, who underwent renal transplants in the past and required subsequent medication, were at the receiving end due to non-availability of medicines and the life-saving drugs were expensive and not affordable for most of the people, they added.
The patients needing dialysis on monthly, fortnightly or weekly basis continue to suffer for want of drugs. IKD has been providing free medicines to patients since launching renal transplants and they receive cashless medication on monthly basis.
Sources said that in the past two years, the programme of free medicine had been suspended several times due to insufficient funds.
However, the health secretary said that all the issues of IKD would be resolved. 
“The government wants to ensure free medication to post-transplant patients as well as resume transplants at the institute,” he added.

13,High court stays work on Bannu water schemes as contract challenged,Notices issued as petitioner claims rules violated,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has issued a stay order suspending work on two water schemes in Bannu district and directed the local deputy commissioner and the relevant Kaki tehsil municipal administration to respond to a petition, which challenged the contract over the alleged violation of rules.
A bench consisting of Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim issued notices to the Bannu DC and Kaki TMA for response and directed them to maintain status quo on the matter until next hearing.
Pir Hameedullah Shah, lawyer for petitioner Shafiullah, a contractor, contended that the Kaki TMA had sought bids for water schemes through newspaper advertisements.
He said that his client had submitted a bid for two of the schemes in which the ratewas 10 per cent lower than the cost of schemes, while the bid of another contractor, Mohammad Younas, was 11 per cent lower than his client’s.

Notices issued as petitioner claims rules violated

The lawyer said that under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Rules, a bidder had to deposit two per cent bid security for participating in the auction.
He added that under the rules, if a bidder submits a bid, which was less than 10 per cent of the total cost, then he had to deposit additional eight per cent as bid security.
The counsel argued that contractor Mohammad Younas had to deposit eight per centcall securityunder the rules but he didn’t do so.
He added that the rules declared that if a contractor failed to deposit that bid security, then his two per cent security deposit had to be confiscated by the government, whereas the contract had to be awarded to the next lowest bidder.
The lawyer contended that the TMA had violated those rules and awarded the contract to Mohammad Younas. He said the cost of both schemes was Rs50 million.
The counsel requested the court to declare that contract illegal and order its award to his client.

Additional district and sessions judge Mohammad Faisal pronounced that the prosecution had proved its case against the accused, Faheem, a resident of Takhtbhai area in Mardan district, while the evidence on record connected him with the commission of the offence.
The accused was arrested by officials of the Paharipura police station on Aug 10, 2021, and was charged under Section 11-B of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substance Act.
The state prosecutor contended that the police had recovered a shopping bag with 220 grammes of crystal meth (ice drug) from the possession of the accused.
He argued that the chemical examination report and the statements of prosecution witnesses clearly proved the guilt of the accused.
The state prosecutor added that the accused was involved in a heinous crime, so he didn’t deserve any leniency.
