Maritime authorities  “were able... to rescue 255 would-be migrants, including 170 people of various African nationalities, with the remainder Tunisians,” the National Guard said in a statement on Facebook. 
The attempted crossings — 17 in total — took place on the night of Friday to Saturday from the east of Tunisia, according to National Guard spokesman Houcem Eddine Jebabli.
The statement did not indicate whether any vessels had got into difficulty or sunk, but did note that an unspecified sum of cash was seized during the operations. The National Guard also on Friday carried out a  “pre-emptive operation”, arresting five people who were  “preparing to lead an illegal immigration bid departing from the coast of Sousse province in the east of the country”, Jebabli said.

In addition to a looming famine, the Horn of Africa nation also faces a grinding Islamist insurgency, with Al Shabaab militants ratcheting up their attacks in recent months.
On Sunday, as parliament met to approve Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre’s 75-member cabinet, which includes a former Al Shabaab deputy leader, several rounds of mortar shells landed near the presidential palace, according to a security official and a witness. “We have no recorded casualties so far as investigations are ongoing,” district security official Mohamed Abdifatah said. One of the rounds damaged a medical facility in the area, according to an onlooker.
“One of the mortar rounds struck in the midst of the Xararyaale intersection and another hit a hospital close by,” Abdikadir Yare, a witness, said.

2,Syria more than doubles petrol prices,DAMASCUS: Syria’s internal commerce ministry has announced a petrol price hike of around 130 percent in the...,"DAMASCUS: Syria’s internal commerce ministry has announced a petrol price hike of around 130 percent in the war-torn country facing fuel shortages and extended power cuts.
The cost of a litre of subsidised fuel will rise to 2,500 Syrian pounds, from 1,100 previously, a rise of 127 percent, the ministry said in a statement quoted by the official SANA news agency late on Saturday.
The cost of non-subsidised petrol will rise from 3,500 to 4,000 Syrian pounds, the ministry added.
The increases represent the third time this year that authorities have increased the price of fuel, as the Syrian pound continues to depreciate. Syria’s currency is trading at around 4,250 to the dollar on the black market, compared to an official rate of 2,814. “This measure will hit everyone,” said Raed al-Saadi, a warehouse worker.
“Our salary is now only enough to get us to the workplace, and not even enough to get us home again.”  “Life has become very difficult and I don’t where this situation will lead us,” the 48-year-old added.
Since the outbreak of war in 2011, Syria’s oil and gas sector has suffered losses amounting to tens of billions of dollars.
The economy has been hit hard by both the long-running war and sanctions imposed against Damascus.
A UN commission in March called for a review of sanctions against President Bashar al-Assad’s regime because of concerns that the measures were hitting ordinary people too hard.
The conflict in Syria started in 2011 with the brutal repression of peaceful protests and escalated to pull in foreign powers and global jihadists.
It has killed around 500,000 people and displaced around half of the country’s pre-war population.

3,Zawahiri discussed on Blackbeard’s islands,"""Good riddance, although we should not rejoice in a death, any death,"" says one man.","OCRACOKE ISLAND: “Good riddance, although we should not rejoice in a death, any death,” said a tall, rough man with two dogs when asked what he thought of the US decision to eliminate Ayman al Zawahiri.
In Ocracoke, and in the nearby island of Hatteras, people paused to learn about how Zawahiri was killed by a US drone in  Kabul before they resumed whatever Americans do during summer vacations — fishing, eating crab cakes and drinking beer.
Ocracoke is where the much romanticised British-American pirate Blackbeard (Edward Teach) was killed on Nov 22, 1718. But people on this island still talk about him, as do the residents of Hatteras. He is the local hero.
Read: The CIA spy tasked with finding Bin Laden and Zawahiri 
The man with the two dogs, who only gave his first name Joe, has “friends and relatives who have served” in Afghanistan. That’s  why he was keener than others to talk about the Afghan war.

No nation can be powerful without strong economy

“This is a good use of technology. Instead of sending our young men and women in harm’s way, we should let the machines do this job.”
North Carolina, where the two islands are, is a big recruitment state for the US military, 4th after large states like California, Texas, and Virginia. So, it’s not difficult to find military veterans here and since the Afghan war is the longest in the US history, it’s not difficult to find those who have served there and are willing to talk about the war.
“Yes, it was a long war, and we should not have allowed it to drag on for so long,” said Shawn, one of those veterans. 
“It’s all politics,” said Joe, adding: “Remember how they facilitated the Bin Laden family’s return to Saudi Arabia after 9/11?” Both thought that the United States had “enough power and technology to eliminate bad guys” and should use its power to “get rid of those bad guys”.
Liz, a visitor from Virginia but not a veteran, however, said international politics was “much more complicated than these two understand”.
“The use of power is important and necessary. But what’s even more important is to “understand the complexities of a dispute.” 
The United States, she added, “had to retaliate after 9/11, so we did. But we also lost our focus when we got involved in the Iraq war.”
But all three agreed that “taking out Zawahiri was a good thing.” 
Joe recalled how the then Virginia Governor Alexander Spotswood had to kill Blackbeard.
Blackbeard, born in Bristol England in 1680, was a much-feared pirate who operated along the coasts of West Indies and the eastern shores of Britain’s North American colonies. Later in life, he gave up piracy and accepted a royal pardon. But had to be killed when he resumed his activities.
“There’s no place for pirates in today’s world,” said Liz. “They need to understand that they cannot beat the governments anymore. They are too powerful.”
When she learned that our group included Muslim journalists, she advised us to “educate your people on how raw power no longer works. If you need to be strong, build your economy.”
After this brief discussion, we went to the sea, first near Hatteras Tower, which is considered a major achievement of modern engineering. Built in 1870 on a small island, in 1999 it was moved 2,900 feet southwest from its original location to save it from a collapse. 
The sea was rough and big. It was cool too, So, dipping in the water was pleasant on this hot summer day. But the big sea had no fish for us.
“We could not even get fried fish at Ocracoke. We would have been happy with okra (bhindi) and Coke as well. But those were unavailable. We only got ice cream.”

4,‘Little hope’ of saving beluga whale stranded in Seine river,"SAINT GARENNE: Hopes of saving a malnourished beluga whale that has swum up the Seine river were receding on Sunday,...","SAINT GARENNE: Hopes of saving a malnourished beluga whale that has swum up the Seine river were receding on Sunday, as rescuers said they were in a race against the clock to find a solution.
The whale was first spotted on Tuesday in the river that runs through Paris to the English Channel. Since Friday it has been between two locks some 70 kilometres (44 miles) north of the French capital.
But leaving it in the warm stagnant water between the lock gates is no longer an option.
“He has to be moved in the coming 24-48 hours, these conditions are not good for him,” Sea Shepherd France head Lamya Essemlali said.
Specialists held out  “little hope” for the visibly underweight whale as they were  “in a race against the clock” to save the creature, Essemlali said. “We are all doubtful about its own ability to return to the sea,” she said.
“Even if we ‘drove’ it with a boat, that would be extremely dangerous, if not impossible”.
Before swimming betw­een the two locks,  “he had the tendency to be heading toward Paris. It would be catastrophic if he reached there,” Essemlali said.
However,  “the euthanasia option has been ruled out for the moment, because at this stage it would be premature”, she said.
The whale still has  “energy ... turns its head, reacts to stimuli”, she said after a meeting of experts and French officials.
Although rescuers have tried feeding it frozen herring and then live trout, the animal was refusing the food.
“His lack of appetite is surely a symptom of something else... an illness.
He is malnourished and this dates back weeks, if not months. He was no longer eating at sea,” Essemlali said.
On Saturday veterinarians had administered  “vitaminsand products to stimulate its appetite,” said a statement on Sunday by the police in Normandy’s Eure department, which is overseeing the rescue effort.

5,Iran says UN nuclear watchdog should resolve outstanding issues,TEHRAN: Iran on Sunday demanded that the UN nuclear watchdog  “completely” resolve outstanding issues related to...,"TEHRAN: Iran on Sunday demanded that the UN nuclear watchdog  “completely” resolve outstanding issues related to questions over nuclear material at undeclared sites, amid resumed talks to revive its 2015 nuclear deal.
Talks aimed at reviving the agreement over Iran’s nuclear programme resumed this week in Vienna, months after they had stalled.
Iranian sources have suggested that one of the key sticking points is a probe by the International Atomic Energy Agency on traces of nuclear material found at undeclared Iranian sites.
“We believe that the agency should completely resolve the remaining safeguard issues from a technical route by distancing itself from irrelevant and unconstructive political issues,” Iran’s foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said.
During a phone call with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Amir-Abdollahian reiterated that his country is  “serious about reaching a strong and lasting agreement”, Iran’s foreign ministry said. “The outcome of this matter depends on whether the United States wants to make an agreement,” he added.
The IAEA’s board of governors adopted a resolution in June, censuring Iran for failing to adequately explain the previous discovery of traces of enriched uranium at three previously undeclared sites.
But Tehran argued on Friday that the issues surrounding the undeclared sites  “are political in nature and should not be used as a pretext for abuse against Iran in the future”.
“Nuclear weapons have no place in the doctrine of the Islamic republic of Iran and are contrary to our policies and beliefs,” Amir-Abdollahian reiterated on Sunday.
The negotiations to revive the deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, began in April 2021 before coming to a standstill in March. The 2015 deal gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme to guarantee that Tehran could not develop a nuclear weapon — something it has always denied wanting to do.

The sinkhole, which emerged on July 30, now stretches 50 metres (160 feet) across and goes down 200 metres (656 feet). Seattle’s Space Needle would also comfortably fit in the black pit, as would six Christ the Redeemer statues from Brazil stacked head-to-head, giant arms outstretched.
The National Service of Geology and Mining said late on Saturday it is still investigating the gaping hole near the Alcaparrosa mine operated by Canadian company Lundin Mining , about 665 km (413 miles) north of Santiago.
In addition to ordering all work to stop, the geology and mining service said it was starting a  “sanctioning process.” The agency did not provide details on what that action would involve.
Lundin did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The company last week said the hole did not affect workers or community members and that it was working to determine the cause. Lundin owns 80pc of the property and the rest is held by Japan’s Sumitomo Corporation.
Initially, the hole near the town of Tierra Amarilla measured about 25 metres (82 feet) across, with water visible at the bottom.

7,Biden out of isolation after testing negative for Covid,"""He will safely return to public engagement and presidential travel,"" his physician says.","REHOBOTH BEACH: US President Joe Biden tested negative for Covid-19 for a second consecutive day on Sunday and ended his isolation at the White House with a trip to his vacation home in Delaware and a reunion with his wife, first lady Jill Biden.
Biden has been holed up at the White House for more than two weeks with Covid, leading to canceled trips and events even as his symptoms stayed mild.
The president tested negative on Saturday but waited until a second negative test on Sunday before ending his isolation.
“He will safely return to public engagement and presidential travel,” Biden’s physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, said in a memo. Biden flew to Delaware on Sunday morning.
“I’m feeling good,” Biden, 79, told reporters outside the White House as he was departing for Rehoboth Beach.
Biden first emerged from isolation at the White House on July 27 after testing positive for Covid-19 for the first time on July 21. He tested positive again on July 30 in what O’Connor described as a rebound case seen in a small percentage of people who take the antiviral drug Paxlovid.
Biden plans to travel to Kentucky on Monday. His return to Covid-negative status will allow him to participate in bill signings at the White House this week to celebrate recent legislative victories on semiconductor manufacturing, veterans’ health, and potentially a climate and healthcare bill that was making its way through the Senate on Sunday.
Biden suffered mild symptoms, including body aches and cough, during his initial bout with Covid-19. The president is vaccinated and boosted against the disease.

8,30 inmates saw out of jail in Lebanon,"""The escapees include Lebanese, Syrians and Palestinians, among other foreigner,"" official says.","BEIRUT: More than 30 people fled a Lebanon detention centre at dawn on Sunday, security forces said, after sawing their way through a window, according to a judicial official.
“At dawn... 31 detainees managed to escape” from a detention centre in the Adl­ieh district of the capital Beirut, the Internal Security Forces said in a statement. “Immediate orders were giv­en to arrest them and investigations are underway.” 
The detainees broke past a prison window using a saw smuggled into the facility, said a judicial official close to an investigation into the incident. “The escapees include Lebanese, Syrians and Palestinians, among other foreigners,” he said.
On Sunday morning, a correspondent saw security forces and army personnel deployed in the Beirut neighbourhood housing the jail.
The Adlieh detention centre was formerly controlled by Lebanon’s General Security agency but is now manged by the country’s prison authority.
It was notorious for abuses committed against detained Syrian refugees and foreign migrant domestic workers, according to rights groups, including Human Rights Watch. Bassam al-Kantar of Lebanon’s National Human Rights Commission said the facility was among the country’s worst, suffering from overcrowding, foul sewage smells and lack of ventilation and sunlight.
“Detainees are malnourished... and are not allowed to receive food from their families,” he said.
“Healthcare is also non-existent, with a large number of detainees suffering from skin diseases,” mainly due to lack of hygiene measures in the facility, he added.
The prison break came as Lebanon grapples with an unprecedented economic crisis that has seen the value of the Lebanese pound lose more than 90 percent of its value against the dollar on the black market.
Inflation has skyrocketed and public sector salaries have plummeted to record lows, forcing a large number of soldiers and other members of the security forces to quit in order to try to eke out an alternative living.
The crisis has also further degraded Lebanon’s already dismal jails, with poor conditions and lack of medical care regularly sparking prion riots and unrest.

9,German consul arrested in Brazil over husband’s death,"The version of events given by the consul is incompatible with the conclusions of the forensics report, officer says.","RIO DE JANEIRO: Brazilian police said they arrested a German diplomat on Saturday for allegedly killing husband at their home in an upscale Rio de Janeiro neighbourhood, then attempting to cover up the crime.
Uwe Herbert Hahn, a German consul, told authorities Belgian national Walter Henri Maximilien Biot, had taken ill, collapsing and fatally hitting his head, police said.
However, analysis of the body and the couple’s apartment in the beach neighbourhood of Ipanema found Biot had been severely beaten, they said.
“The version of events given by the consul, that the victim suffered a fall, is incompatible with the conclusions of the forensics report,” officer Camila Lourenco said in comments posted on social media by Rio de Janeiro’s 14th police precinct.
“It found various bruises, including on the torso, compatible with injuries inflicted by stomping, as well as lesions compatible with an attack with a cylindrical instrument,” she added.
“The cadaver is screaming out the circumstances of its death.” The precinct’s Instagram account posted pictures of what appeared to be blood stains on the floor and furniture of the couple’s apartment.
Brazilian media reports said Hahn would not have diplomatic immunity given the nature of the crime. Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Local media reports said Hahn, who had been married to Biot for 20 years, tried to clean up the scene of death before police arrived, then told officers he had been drinking a lot and taking sleeping pills.
Biot was a week shy of his 53rd birthday, according to a picture of his ID card published in the Brazilian press.
The German embassy did not immediately respond to a request for information.
But both the embassy and the consulate in Rio de Janeiro are in  “close contact with the Brazilian authorities investigating this case”, a source in the German federal foreign office said.

10,China ends largest-ever military drills near Taiwan,"Taipei says it has mobilised intelligence surveillance system to ""monitor enemy situation"".","BEIJING: China’s largest-ever military exercises surrounding Taiwan were drawing to a close on Sunday following a controversial visit last week to the self-ruled island by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  
Beijing has raged at the trip by Pelosi — the highest-ranking elected US official to visit Taiwan in decades — ripping up a series of talks and cooperation agreements with Washington, most notably on climate change and defence.  
It has also deployed fighter jets, warships and ballistic missiles around Taiwan in what analysts have described as practice for a blockade and ultimate invasion of the island. Those exercises were set to end Sunday, though Beijing has not confirmed their conclusion.  
Taiwan’s transport ministry said six of the seven “temporary danger zones” China had warned airlines to avoid ceased to be in effect as of noon on Sunday, signalling a partial drawdown of the drills. It said the seventh zone, in waters east of Taiwan, would remain in effect until 10am (0200 GMT) local time on Monday. 

Taipei says it has mobilised intelligence surveillance system to ‘monitor enemy situation’

“Relevant flights and sailings can gradually resume,” the ministry said in a statement.  
Taipei said some routes were still affected in the seventh area, and authorities would continue to monitor ship movements there.  
Beijing has also announced fresh drills in the Yellow Sea — located between China and the Korean peninsula — to take place until August 15.  
Earlier on Sunday, Beijing conducted “exercises in the sea and airspace surrounding Taiwan Island as planned”, the Chinese military’s Eastern Command said.  
Taipei’s defence ministry confirmed China had dispatched “planes, vessels and drones... simulating attacks on Taiwan’s main island and on ships in our waters”. 
Beijing also sent drones over Taiwan’s outlying islands, it added. 
‘Jeopardising’ peace
In response, Taiwan said it had mobilised a “joint intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance system to closely monitor the enemy situation” as well as sending planes and vessels. 
Su Tseng-chang, Taiwan’s premier, said China is  “barbarously using military action” to disturb peace in the Taiwan Strait. 
“We call on the Chinese government not to go around wielding its military power, showing its muscles everywhere and jeopardising the peace of the region,” he told reporters on Sunday. 
Taipei’s foreign ministry said the drills threatened  “the region and even the world”. 
An anonymously authored opinion piece published by state broadcaster CCTV said that after these exercises, China’s military would be able to stage  “regular” training drills east of the median line. 
That line is an unofficial demarcation in the Taiwan Strait that Beijing does not recognise. To show how close it has got to Taiwan’s shores, the Chinese military released a video of an air force pilot filming the island’s coastline and mountains from his cockpit. 
The Eastern Command also shared a photo it said was of a warship on patrol with Taiwan’s shoreline visible in the background.

11,"Kenya campaign ends, but disinformation battle drags on",NAIROBI: The campaign for Kenya’s presidential election has officially closed but the relentless — and dangerous...,"NAIROBI: The campaign for Kenya’s presidential election has officially closed but the relentless — and dangerous — flow of disinformation continues online, as keyboard warriors battle to discredit rivals by sharing fake rigging claims, experts say.
Campaigners for the frontrunners, Deputy President William Ruto and veteran politician Raila Odinga, are circulating dozens of posts claiming that their opponent is engaged in  “vote rigging plots”, said Benedict Manzin, a sub-Saharan Africa analyst at UK-based intelligence firm Sibylline.
“We are increasingly seeing false information which seeks to delegitimise the results of the election with widespread claims that the opposing side would only win through fraud and that they are attempting to steal the election,” Manzin said.
In one case, a strategist for Ruto’s campaign accused Odinga’s team of trying to rig Tuesday’s poll because the 77-year-old urged the election commission to use a manual voter register instead of a digital one.
Meanwhile a pro-Odinga blogger tweeted that Ruto was attempting to steal the election, sharing a link to an unrelated video — since taken down — of a politician discussing an old scandal.
Mary Blankenship, a disinformation researcher at the University of Nevada, said the circulation of baseless fraud claims could cause real harm, especially in a country where past polls have been followed by an eruption of violence.
“It creates an avenue for either of the candidates to discredit the outcome of the polls, which could lead to unrest,” Blankenship said. She likened the situation to the 2020 US election when former president Donald Trump’s fraud claims culminated in an attack on the US Capitol by his supporters.
More than 1,100 people died in politically motivated inter-ethnic clashes in Kenya following the bitterly disputed 2007 elections.
A decade later, dozens died during a police crackdown on protests after the 2017 presidential poll which was later annulled by the Supreme Court due to  “irregularities and illegalities”.
Fabricated opinion polls 
Fact-checking organisations — including AFP Fact Check — have debunked hundreds of false and misleading claims about the Kenyan elections.
Both sides have sought to cast aspersions on their opponent’s educational qualifications, claiming that Odinga lied about studying engineering in Germany and that Ruto falsified his university grades. These claims were debunked by fact-checkers but trended on Twitter for days.

12,Austrian scientists race to learn melting glaciers’ secrets,"For scientists looking to reconstruct the Earth’s climate in the distant past, such ice formations are a unique time capsule.","GALTR: Jumping from rock to rock to rock over a creek formed off Austria’s Jamtal glacier, scientist Andrea Fischer worries that precious scientific data will be irreversibly lost as the snow and ice melt faster than ever.
“I couldn’t have imagined that it would ever melt as dramatically as this summer... Our ‘archive’ is melting away,” says the glaciologist.
Fischer — vice director of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Mountain Research at the Austrian Academy of Sciences — has spent more than 20 years surveying Jamtal and four other Alpine glaciers across Austria’s highest peaks for the oldest areas of ice.
For scientists looking to reconstruct the Earth’s climate in the distant past, such ice formations are a unique time capsule stretching back thousands of years.
The glaciers contain an invaluable treasure trove of data — as they grew, the ice encapsulated twigs and leaves, which can now be carbon-dated, Fischer explains.
And based on the age of such material and the depth where it was found, scientists can infer when ice grew during colder periods, or when warmer conditions caused it to melt. But now the glaciers are melting rapidly — including the one in the remote and narrow Jamtal valley, not far from where tourists found the stunningly preserved 5,300-year-old mummy of Oetzi, the Iceman, in the 1990s.
Temperatures in Europe’s highest mountains have risen by nearly two degrees Celsius in the past 120 years — almost double the global average, according to the International Commission for the Protection of the Alps (CIPRA).

13,Blinken pays tribute to Soweto Uprising at start of Africa tour,Visit comes as Washington scales up diplomacy to counter Russian influence on the continent.,"SOWETO: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken kicked off a three-nation African trip on Sunday paying tribute to the Soweto Uprising, a student protest whose tragic ending galvanised the world against the apartheid regime.
His visit comes as Washington scales up diplomacy to counter Russian influence on the continent and follows hot on the heels of an extensive tour of Africa by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
For his first stop, the US top diplomat chose South Africa, a leader in the developing world, which has remained neutral in the Ukraine war, refusing to join Western calls to condemn Moscow, which had opposed apartheid before the end of white minority rule in 1994.
Blinken laid a wreath and toured the Hector Pieterson Museum, built in memory of students killed in a 1976 protest which became one of the watersheds in the anti-apartheid movement. It was named after the 12-year-old boy who was the first to be shot and killed by police on June 16, 1976.
During the afternoon visit to Soweto township, the heartland of South Africa’s anti-apartheid struggle, Blinken was shown around the museum by Pieterson’s sister Antoinette Sithole.
“What’s so extraordinary about this museum is that it’s living history because it’s inspiring people to see the power that young people can have to make change,” Blinken said after the tour.
He made reference to the iconic black-and-white picture of a dying Hector Pieterson being carried away by a teary fellow student after security forces opened fire on the young protesters.
The photograph  “probably did as much to open hearts and open minds and raise consciousness about apartheid and about the struggle for equality and freedom as anything”.
Pieterson’s story  “really resonates because we have our own struggle for freedom and equality in the United States”, Blinken said.
Over 170 were gunned down when thousands of black students protested at being forced to study in Afrikaans, the language of the white-minority regime.
Blinken will hold talks with South African counterpart Naledi Pandor and also make a policy announcement on the US government’s new Africa strategy, Pretoria said in a statement.
The two will  “discuss ongoing and recent developments relating to the global geopolitical situation,” it said.
The US State Department last month said African countries were  “geostrategic players and critical partners on the most pressing issues of our day”.

14,Desperation deepens for families of trapped Mexican miners,AGUJITA: The families of 10 Mexican coal miners trapped in a flooded deposit for days were becoming increasingly...,"AGUJITA: The families of 10 Mexican coal miners trapped in a flooded deposit for days were becoming increasingly desperate on Sunday, as rescue efforts made little progress and hopes of reaching survivors began to dwindle.
More than 300 soldiers and other personnel, including six military scuba divers, have joined the effort to free the miners in the northern state of Coahuila following Wednesday’s accident, according to the government.
Five workers managed to escape from the crudely constructed mine in the initial aftermath of the disaster, but since then, no survivors have been found.
Liliana Torres, the niece of one of the 10 workers, told reporters that she had witnessed the relentlessness of rescuers who  “do not stop all day,” but added that the families were increasingly  “desperate.” 
The water inside the flooded mine has receded only about 9.5 metres (31 feet) from the initial 34 metres, according to a report given to the relatives by the authorities at the end of Saturday’s effort, and divers have been unable to enter.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had earlier declared Saturday  “a decisive day” for the operation.
“According to the experts, we’ll know if it’s possible for the divers to enter safely,” he tweeted.
The main problem has been the flooding, he said, adding that pumping equipment was working at full capacity.
After Saturday ended without success, some families took part in a Catholic Mass near their improvised camp in the community of Agujita.
The Coahuila state prosecutor’s office said it had interviewed the five workers who managed to escape from the crudely constructed mine.
“Apparently they were expelled by a torrent of water,” Coahuila attorney general Gerardo Marquez told the press.
He added that his office had requested information from the landowner and mine concession holder, but declined to name them.
Water leak
Authorities said that the miners had been carrying out excavation work on three mine shafts that descended 60 metres (200 feet) when they hit an adjoining area full of water.
Experts detected a leak coming from nearby mines and are trying to find its exact location so they can stop water from flowing into the area where the workers are trapped, said Coahuila’s labor secretary, Nazira Zogbi.
A French company has provided equipment to assist in the task, she said, without naming the firm. The arrival of more powerful pumping equipment was a reason for optimism, Zogbi said.
Water seen flowing from the mine through drainage channels had initially lifted the hopes of relatives anxiously awaiting news.
“We’re still hoping that they’re in a higher part (of the mine), although there’s too much water... but we trust in God,” Elva Hernandez, mother-in-law of one of the trapped workers, said.
History of accidents
Coahuila, Mexico’s main coal-producing region, has seen a series of fatal mining accidents over the years.
Last year, seven miners died when they were trapped in an accident in the region.
The worst accident was an explosion that claimed 65 lives at the Pasta de Conchos mine in 2006. Only two bodies were retrieved after that tragedy.
Miners and their relatives painted a picture of a precarious profession fraught with risks due to lax safety standards.
“When everything’s fine, you don’t think about the danger, but when things happen you think about quitting,” said Luis Armando Ontiveros. However, looking for a new job does not seem like a viable option for the 48-year-old, whose father taught him to dig for coal at an early age.
The father-of-three said he needed to make the equivalent of about $500 a month to pay for his children’s education so they do not have to follow in his footsteps.
