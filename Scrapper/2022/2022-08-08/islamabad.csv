0,Travelling on roads in Rawalpindi becomes a nightmare,"Recent rains exposed performance of civic agencies, commuters say.","RAWALPINDI: Travelling on the dilapidated roads in the garrison city has become a nightmare for motorists and the recent spell of rain exposed the performance of civic agencies.
The roads in the garrison city have not been repaired for years and have become accident-prone.
After the monsoon rains, the roads have developed potholes and causing hazards for commuters.
Most of the broken roads included Kashmir Road, Range Road, Allahabad Road, Tench Bhatta Road, Zakria Masjid Road, Transit Camp Road, Dhoke Ratta, Workshop Road, Marrir Chowk Road, Rawal Road, Westridge Bazaar Road, Gowalmandi Road, Farooq-i-Azam Road, Sadiqabad Road and Railway Road.
In last two years, Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC) did not launch any uplift project. The Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) paid attention on The Mall and left the other areas neglected.

Recent rains exposed performance of civic agencies, say commuters

Motorists find it difficult to drive on cantonment roads due to countless potholes which result into traffic snarls at several places. Even public transporters face difficulty in driving on these roads while cabbies refuse to go to the downtown.
For example, the road from Marrir Chowk to Gawalmandi, Westridge Bazaar to Allahabad, Kashmir Road and others have developed ditches. At some places like Gowalmandi and Nogaza Road, open manholes in the middle of the roads also pose threat to commuters.
The residents of the downtown are disturbed over the situation and have demanded of the provincial government to fulfil its promise of launching public welfare projects.
“I daily travel on Gawalmandi Road to Saddar and my vehicle has developed faults due to the broken road. Will the government compensate us if our car gets damaged due to the broken roads,” said Nasir Hussain, a resident of Gawalmandi.
Mohammad Anwar, of Allahabad said his motorcycle developed faults due to the potholes on Allahabad Road and it was difficult for middle class people to spend heavy amounts on repair of their vehicles. 
Ahmed Khan, a resident of Kashmiri Bazaar, said that residents of the area had been facing problems due to the bad condition of roads. Travel on the roads is time and fuel consuming, he added.
When contacted, Deputy Commissioner Tahir Farooq said that the district administration was aware of the problems being faced by the citizens.
“We have made a comprehensive plan to reconstruct all the roads in downtown area.”
He said that funds had been allocated for the task and soon work would be started. He said that the heavy rains had damaged the roads in the garrison city and work on the construction of the roads would be started soon after the monsoon season.
“We also started patchworks on roads in many areas till the construction work starts. During the monsoon season, the roads will not be reconstructed,” he said.
He said that the district administration had spent Rs300 million on rehabilitation of damaged roads in Murree due to landsliding. 
He said 18 kilometres roads had been repaired and remaining work would be completed soon.
He said the basic aim of the reconstruction of roads in Murree was to keep the area connected with other parts of the country and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.

3,Poor implementation of bylaws blamed for shrinking parking spaces in Islamabad,CDA officials say Blue Area is also facing a serious parking issue.,"ISLAMABAD: A massive increase in the number of vehicles during the last two decades and poor implementation of bylaws are the main reasons behind the shrinking parking spaces in the capital city.
CDA officials Dawn spoke to agreed that poor implementation of the bylaws was one of the main reasons behind the parking issue which was being faced by citizens for the last many years.
They said that parking spaces had been designed in markets and plazas in accordance with number of shops but with the passages of time shop owners alerted the layout plan, increasing the number of shops. During the last two decades, the number of cars also increased manifold but parking spaces were not expanded, resulting into the shortage.
“The numbers of shops have increased in all class three shopping centres, while in marakis there is also slight violations of original layout plans. For example, just visit G-7, there is class three shopping centre – Gulshan market - which had only nine shops [units] in the 70s but now the number is over 70 as owners have made almost eight small shops in one unit. So the flow of customers have also increased significantly that is causing parking issue,” said an official of CDA.
Similarly, he said the situation in G-7 markaz was also not different where the numbers of shops have increased and even some shops opened in verandas as well while a hotel and several other shops are being run on a plot which was reserved for a cinema.
“These are examples of just two markets. A visit to other markets will reveal more such facts,” said an official, adding in Zero Point there was the Industries and Trade (I&T) Centre adjacent to the newspapers’ office. Now motor mechanics have encroached on both the small roads passing through the centre by narrowing down their width.
The CDA officials said that Blue Area was also facing a serious parking issue. Moreover, due to poor planning, the district courts were operating in F-8 markaz, causing a massive parking issue.
CDA’s spokesperson Syed Asif Raza could not be contacted for comments on Sunday. However, a senior officer of the CDA said poor implementation of bylaws was not the major factor behind the parking issue. He said the phenomenal increase in the number of vehicles and shortage of parking lots were the main reasons. He said the CDA had been working to expand parking spaces and introducing bus services on various routes that will reduce the use of cars.
The officer also said that in addition to the bus service, the CDA was also planning to go for the paid parking concept. He said that the issue of F-8 courts was going to be resolved for good as 93 courts were being built in G-11 which were near completion  while in Blue Area construction work on a parking plaza was in progress.
The officer said recently Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and the CDA in principle agreed that paid parking was one of the solutions to overcome the parking issue in the city.
A team of PIDE headed by Vice Chancellor Dr Nadeemul Haque held a meeting with a CDA team headed by Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed on Thursday at the CDA headquarters to discuss various options.
PIDE is helping the civic agency find out effective solutions to parking issues.
“During the meeting, it was discussed that due to high traffic pressure on roads and lack of effective parking arrangements, citizens face problems like traffic jams. In this regard, paid parking plazas will be constructed in areas where there is more traffic and parking problems.”
The plaza being built in Blue Area will be a test case,” said a press release issued by CDA after the meeting.
It said before implementation, all stakeholders, including the business community, will be taken into confidence. Later, it will be implemented in other areas also.
“These measures will not only increase revenue but also help in better handling parking managements. The CDA chairman appreciated the proposal given by PIDE and said it should be implemented immediately,” it said.
Blue Area, the main commercial hub of the capital, has been facing parking problems.
As per the master plan for the area, six parking plazas were to be constructed in Blue Area and the sites were identified, but no effort was ever made to create these parking spaces until last year. Currently, the first parking plaza is being constructed in G-7 portion of Blue Area.
In 2016, the Islamabad Traffic Police had written to the CDA regarding the shortage of parking spaces in Blue Area and other commercial centres, including F-8 Markaz.

The martyrs of Karbala, free from worldly interests or greed, laid down their lives in the way of truth. 
These views were expressed by Dr Yousuf Khuskh, chairman of Pakistan Academy of Letters (PAL) while presenting the keynote address at the ‘Mehfil-i- Musalama’ held in memory of the martyrs of Karbala. The event was presided over by Dr Ehsan Akbar. Ali Akbar Abbass and Anjum Khaliq were the chief guests while Akhtar Usman, Dr Arshad Mahmood Nashad and Shakeel Jazib were the guests of honour. The proceedings were conducted by Arif Farhad.
Dr Khushk said that the events of Karbala drew a boundary between right and wrong, the oppressor and oppressed, and cannot be erased from history.
“On the one hand, this incident exalted the religion of Islam and on the other hand, it determined the lifestyle known as Hussainism. Writers of every genre of literature in Pakistan, whether it is history, poetry, fiction or novel have drawn inspiration from Imam Husain, his sister Bibi Zainab and their companions. From ancient times till today, the story has been used through new angles, new words described using new metaphors. Karbala has widened the scope of literature,” he said, adding the martyrs’ sacrifice is remembered every Muharram.
Dr Ehsan Akbar said: “It is a matter of luck for me to participate in this blessed gathering. Those who honour the martyrs collect a lot of good for themselves and are lucky. Imam Husain’s suffering is the hallmark of our nation and our life.”

6,Residents want early construction of Leepa Tunnel,MUZAFFARABAD: Residents of Leepa valley have threatened that they would launch a protest against governments in...,"MUZAFFARABAD: Residents of Leepa valley have threatened that they would launch a protest against governments in Muzaffarabad and Islamabad for ignoring several problems of their area, mainly the construction of a tunnel.
The warning came through Shaukat Javed Mir, a regional office bearer of opposition People’s Party (PPP) and a key figure in an alliance of Leepa valley based leaders of different parties.
“Leepa valley is not only a strategically important area as it runs along the Line of Control but is also one of the best tourist attractions of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). But ironically every government has been callously ignoring the plight of its people,” he said on Sunday while speaking on behalf of the alliance.
He said the major demand of the Valley people was construction of a tunnel to provide them round the year access to the rest of the state.
“Come winters, a population of 80,000 people lands in hot waters because huge snowfalls block all three ground routes leading to their valley from Reshian,” he said.
Leepa valley is located some 100km southeast of state capital Muzaffarabad and 25km ahead of Reshian, from where it is accessed by two vehicular and one pedestrian tracks running through an altitude of around 10,000 feet. Winter snowfalls and glaciers block movement through these routes which is why residents of the area have long been demanding construction of a tunnel from Reshian.
Mr Mir recalled that as chief minister of Punjab Shehbaz Sharif had pledged in an election campaign related rally in Leepa in 2011 that his party when voted to power in the centre would construct Leepa tunnel.
“Now that he has become the prime minister of Pakistan it should not be difficult for him to fulfill his commitment which will facilitate the residents of the valley on the one hand and strengthen its defence on the other,” Mr Mir said.
In this regard, he claimed that the PPP led central government [2008-13] had conducted the feasibility study of Leepa tunnel at a cost of Rs350 million while the PML-N government of Nawaz Sharif had approved a Rs12 billion scheme for its construction.
“Unfortunately, the project was shelved later due to some unknown reasons to our shock and dismay,” he said.
The PPP leader also urged his party’s chairperson and foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and AJK Premier Sardar Tanveer Ilyas to play their role in this regard.
He maintained that people of his area had patiently waited for construction of the tunnel for years together “but now they were at the end of their tether”.
“Leepa tunnel is one-point agenda for the survival of our future generations and we can go to any extent for its implementation, including a long march to Islamabad, hunger strike unto death,” he warned.
“But we are hopeful that steps will be taken to meet our bona-fide requirement before pushing us to agitational movement.”

The budget speech and finance bill 2022-23 has a contradiction with respect to procedure. 
It is very unfortunate that those who have received an electricity bill of Rs100 have also been sent a tax of Rs3,000. 
Tier 1 category should be maintained for the jewellery sector on the basis of 1,000 square feet.
These views were expressed by Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) President Nadeem Rauf in a meeting with the chairman of Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Dr Asim Ahmed.

Mr Rauf said that declared property should be exempted from deemed income tax, and notices should be issued to non-filers. 
He added that 17 percent sales tax on bakery products is excessive as these are daily items and there is no luxury on which 17pc is levied, he added.
“We demand that this harassment be stopped. Filers should be given incentives as this will help in documenting the economy,” he said.
Dr Asim assured the delegation that the finance minister is looking into the issue of fixed tax and it is being advertised through newspapers and media that if the tax has been wrongly calculated, it will be adjusted in the future bills. 
The FBR chairman welcomed the proposal of the chamber members related to broadening the tax net and also issued instructions for immediate restoration of Tax Advisory Committees at the regional level.
