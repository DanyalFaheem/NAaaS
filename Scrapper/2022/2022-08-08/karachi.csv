1,This week 50 years ago: Call for solidarity on Independence Day and high tide,EFFORTS were being made by the authorities to restore peace after many weeks of disturbance caused by the linguistic...,"EFFORTS were being made by the authorities to restore peace after many weeks of disturbance caused by the linguistic strife in Karachi. On Aug 8, 1972 Kassim Haji Abbas Patel, Provincial Minister for Industries and Mineral Development said that those who were raising the slogan of ‘Sindhu Desh’ and demanding Karachi as a separate province were the enemies of the country. The people who were living in Sindh — Mohajirs, Punjabis, Pakhtuns, Sindhis and Balochis — were all Sindhis. He appealed to them that “all of us should live like brothers as Sindh is our hearth and home.” 
In a similar vein, on Aug 11, a joint meeting of MNAs and MPAs from Karachi representing various political parties reviewed the operational activities carried out in the province to maintain law and order in the region. The meeting, held at Qasr-i-Naz, was convened by Central Education and Provincial Coordination Minister Abdul Hafeez Pirzada. He told journalists that the meeting noted with satisfaction that the people of Karachi had displayed the highest sense of responsibility as was expected from them and that there had been no provocative speeches. He felt it was a healthy sign.
And on the eve of Independence Day, the first administrator of Karachi when it used to be the federal capital, Syed Hashim Raza called upon the people in general and the youth of the country in particular to rededicate themselves for building Pakistan into a progressive and modern nation. 
He was speaking at an event organised by the Pakistan-Iran Cultural Association at a local hotel. He said Pakistan was the Quaid-i-Azam’s ‘amanat’ which should be defended with our blood. Referring to the tragic happenings in East Pakistan and its secession, Mr Raza asked them to create conditions for a united and collective fight against the enemies of the country so that the remaining part of Pakistan could be safeguarded. 
Something noteworthy happened in the realm of the media, too, which was relaying all these reports of attempts made to lift the spirits of the countrymen. On Aug 9, the Karachi Union of Journalist (KUJ) decided to establish a ‘struggle fund’. It directed all the unit chiefs of the union to collect Rs5 per month from every member of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) in addition to their monthly subscription. The KUJ also directed them to step up their campaign in their respective units for the restoration of the legitimate rights of newsmen and other workers of the press industry.
Weather conditions often play a part in setting Karachi’s socio-cultural and political moods. Tides are usually high in the summer, especially in the months of July and August. On Aug 13, unfortunately, Klaus Saler, a German national and a senior executive of a hotel in the city, drowned in Hawkes Bay. He had joined the hotel a few months ago and was living alone. Thought to be a good swimmer, he had gone to the sea with a picnic party. After getting swept away by the strong currents, he was rescued by fellow swimmers and rushed to the nearest hospital in Mauripur, but did not survive.

Speaking to the media at the shrine, he said he was here only to pray for peace and prosperity of Sindh and Pakistan. 
In reply to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan’s demand for early general elections, he said the country could not be run on any individual’s demand or wish. He argued that the incumbent dispensation at the centre was constitutionally elected by the parliament. “The federal government is an elected dispensation and not a selected one,” he insisted.  
He said only the masses had the powers to decide about general elections. If they wanted early elections, then their call must be accepted. In the other case, he added, the incumbent federal government would complete its constitutional term.  
He remarked that the federal government was trying to manage the mess left by the previous government.

Mr Shah, who visited Karoonjhar Hills on Sunday, was speaking to the media about his plans to promote tourism in the desert region. 
“We have already established a beautiful tourist attraction, Rooplo Kolhi Resort, here whereas more such projects are in the pipeline to develop the area as a unique tourist site. These project would help promote seasonal tourism in Tharparkar,” he said, and added that board and lodging facilities for families in other rest houses here would also be made available. 
Mr Shah said that a 30-room comprehensive English-medium school with all essential facilities and science equipment would be established for local boys and girls in Nagarparkar. Besides, he said, a centre for archaeological research and another resort with modern facilities were being established this town. 
Regarding illegal extraction of granite from Karoonjhar hills, the minister said that he was trying his best to check the illegal activity that was damaging the hills. “The PPP leadership believed in protecting all such sites and encouraging healthy activities so that people could get maximum benefits from them and Sindh’s culture could be promoted in a very effective manner,” he said. 
He pointed out that a museum and certain other structures were built and named after eminent freedom fighter Roolpo Kolhi and Thari philanthropist Miskeen Jahan Khan Khoso. 
Mr Shah said that the higher authorities would again approach the command of the border security forces on a plan to install a chairlift at Karoonjhar. 
He said he was delighted by seeing a large number of tourists thronging Nagar­parkar and other parts of the Thar region to enjoy natural beauty amid heavy rains over the last few weeks that had turned this desert region lush green.
Speaking about the acute water shortage experienced by Sindh in the first half of the year, Syed Sardar Shah said that the provincial government had undertaken certain mega projects of small dams to store rainwater which brought about an agricultural revolution in this region. “More projects to promote culture and heritage were being undertaken with a view to ensure people’s easy access to historical sites, especially the ancient Jain temples,” he said.
MPA Qasim Siraj Soomro told the media that the ongoing rainfall had already turned the entire desert region lush green and thousands of people were visiting it these days to enjoy natural beauty.

7,"All agricultural taxes, loans in rain-hit areas be waived: SAB",‘Initial estimate of losses to crops may be close to Rs50bn’...,"HYDERABAD: The Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB) has urged the Sindh government to waive off all taxes and agricultural loans, recoverable from farmers, in the rain-hit areas of Sindh.
The call was made at a meeting of SAB office-bearers held here on Sunday under the chairmanship of Mahmood Nawaz Shah to discuss various issues, mainly impact of rains on crops, livestock and the plight of growers, farmers and tillers in the affected areas.
It said that heavy rains had hit all districts of the province and caused huge losses to growers. The date-growing areas had also suffered losses as around 150,000 out of 220,000 tonnes of the produce was badly affected.
The mature fruit on trees had been destroyed as well, it added.
The meeting noted that cotton growers had first suffered due to water shortage from March to June and then heavy rains affected the crop in many districts in July. These districts included Mirpurkhas and Sanghar where the crop was completely destroyed or heavily damaged.

‘Initial estimate of losses to crops may be close to Rs50bn’

In addition to it, over 70pc onion crop was destroyed in Tando Allahyar, Matiari, Mirpurkhas and other districts. Other crops such as chilies and cauliflower were severely affected, it said. 
The SAB leaders said that initial estimates would put the overall losses close to Rs50bn and they could go even higher if incessant rains continued.
With doubling of the production cost and fertiliser being unavailable at company-declared rates, the agricultural economy remained under stress, they noted, and apprehended that the situation could have an adverse impact on the national economy as well in coming months. 
The board emphasised the need for short- and medium-term measures to rehabilitate the agricultural economy.
It proposed provision of interest-free loans to farmers in the areas where crops were destroyed. These areas could be identified through the technology that is indigenously available. 
The SAB meeting demanded that all taxes and levies as well as agricultural loans be waived off in the rain-hit areas.
It said that subsidised fertilizer availability should be ensured during Rabi season.
It regretted that the Kisan Card was being worked on for two years but could not be distributed as yet. 
It said that disaster management bodies should be made more proactive and they should liaison with growers’ organisations with a view to devise strategies and respond more effectively.
The SAB leaders said that rehabilitation of natural waterways like Dhoro Puran, Dhoro Naro and others should be ensured to drain out excessive water. 
The Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) should be rehabilitated or remodeled so that it could work perfectly. The Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD) was lying incomplete for over 18 years which should also be completed at the earliest, they said.
The meeting said that crop Insurance schemes at least for small- and medium-sized growers should be ensured. 
It also demanded establishment of a ‘climate emergencies fund’ keeping in view that such emergencies had become more frequent.
The meeting was attended by Syed Nadeem Shah, Azam Rind, Aslam Marri, Imran Bozdar, Arbab Ahsan, Mustafa Nawaz Shah, Taha Abbasi, Mehtab Loond and others.

8,Murad orders probe into varsity faculty recruitment,SUKKUR: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has ordered probe into complaints of gross irregularities and...,"SUKKUR: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has ordered probe into complaints of gross irregularities and appointment of ‘favourite’ non-PhD and M.Phil degree holders as faculty members in several departments at Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur.
He took notice of reports about illegal appointment of BPS-19 to 21 as teaching faculty published in local dailies and voices raised against blatant violation of the recruitment policy of the university and ordered secretary of universities and boards to launch a thorough inquiry into the charges levelled in this regard by Dr Mohammad Aslam Korai, a college lecturer who had applied for the post of assistant professor in organic chemistry department.
Mr Korai said that appointment of teaching faculty especially ‘assistant professor’ in four branches of the department was not made according to the requirement policy as laid down in the advertisement published in March for the post of BPS-19.
The advertisement said the candidates who applied for the post of assistant professor must have a PhD degree with two years teaching and research experience at a recognised university or professional experience in the relevant field in a national or international organisation but the candidates who were cleared for selection did not meet the criteria, said the complainant.
He said the university administration conducted interviews on July 2-4 but neither any notification was circulated nor any candidates applying for the post of assistant professor were called for interview.
Furthermore, as per Higher Education Commission, members of the selection committee should have PhD degree holders in relevant field but they were not experts in the relevant fields and lacked exposure to chemistry branch, yet they conducted interviews and recommended short list of ‘favourites’ for appointment as assistant professors in the chemistry departments.
At the time of papers’ scrutiny, eligibility criteria were completely neglected and only favourite candidates’ papers were approved, he claimed.
Three other candidates Atta Hussain Rind, Khalid Hussain Bhutto and Aijaz Hussain Memon were declared eligible though they did not meet the criteria for the post, he said, adding that Jamshed, brother of director of the Institute of Islamic Studies, was also declared eligible.
He accused media coordinator of the Faculty of Social Sciences dean Prof Dr Taj Mohammad Lashari of getting two of his daughters appointed as lecturers at zoology and education departments with the support of the university registrar.
The complainant proved his charges leveled against selection committee and managing board with the help of ample evidence.
Two college lecturers, who had also applied for the post of assistant professor in zoology department, said that they were not even called for the interviews.
Asked whether they would submit complaints against the selection board, one of them said he was currently doing PhD at the university and could not even think of going against the management while the other said it was wastage of time to talk against corrupt mafia in the syndicate and the selection committee.
A source at the university said that apart from unfair selection of ‘favorites’ through sham interviews, the practice of large-scale embezzlement and misappropriation of funds was rife at the university.
He said that no efforts were made to improve standard of education at the university and create bright opportunities for students. The syndicate members and powerful individuals were interested only in exerting influence and using unfair means to have their sons and daughters selected for the teaching faculty posts in several different departments at the university, he said.
Asked what would happen if the complainants decided to move the court, he said that the policies formed by the syndicate could not be challenged in any court. 
The university’s spokespersons and information cell were unavailable for comments.

10,"Without alternative, ban on plastic bags in Sindh bound to backfire",Industry source says 10bn shoppers used in Karachi annually and it is not known what other product would replace them.,"KARACHI: In the absence of an alternative, the city administration with the support of provincial authorities and law enforcement agencies is set to undertake a gigantic task by fully enforcing an eight-year-old ban on all plastic bags in Karachi after Ashura, it emerged on Sunday. 
The authorities believe that widespread use of plastic bags — a more than a billion pieces of such products are used each year in the country — after becoming an environmental hazard has now started taking a heavy toll on the city’s infrastructure, sewerage system and municipal services. 
Last week the Sindh government had announced initiating a stringent action against manufacture, sale and use of all plastic bags across the province. 
As the government is ready to initiate the action, the question arises about the effectiveness of the new move as the ban was already in place since 2014 hardly affecting the production, sale and use of the plastic bags. 

Industry source says 10bn shoppers used in Karachi annually and it is not known what other product would replace them

“It is true that the ban has been there since 2014,” said Karachi Administrator and Sindh government spokesman Barrister Murtaza Wahab. 
“But the problem is that the city or district administration cannot enforce that curb with certain resources. This time the move is different because we have taken everyone onboard, including the provincial government, the police and other relevant authorities. So after Ashura, we hope that a notification will be issued that will lead to enforcement of the ban,” he said. 
However, a question remains about the outcome of the fresh move which would deprive Karachiites of plastic bag which has become an essential daily use item. 
Intrinsic to city lifestyle 
The widespread use of plastic bags, mainly in urban setting, is also supporting certain industries to grow. 
“The industry estimates and even government institutions suggest that 55 billion shopping [plastic] bags are used annually in Pakistan,” said an industry source citing the data compiled by the Pakistan Plastic Manufacturers Association (PPMA). 
“Being the largest city in terms of area and population, Karachi tops among others where 9-10 billion plastic bags are used every year. This is a huge number. I am not sure what other product would replace them in such a large quantity. These are not just bags, they have become our lifestyle,” he added. 
Despite that argument, which mostly relies on huge numbers of plastic bags production and widespread use in the society, experts discourage the use of plastic and suggest more technological and innovative ways to gradually come out of this “environmental hazard” in a more productive way. 
Recycling of plastic 
Dr Saud Hashmi, who’s the chairman of the department of polymer and petrochemical at the NED University of Engineering Technology, has recently launched an initiative at the varsity campus to make it plastic free. 
“We have initiated this project in collaboration with a multinational [fast-moving consumer goods],” he said. “The objective is to set an example through an innovative way on the basis of technology to convert or recycle them.”
He said: “The same recycling process at least allows us to melt this polythene material into household commodities. So I believe before banning anything completely, make its use a little difficult or expensive. So the people may switch to healthier trends to avoid financial burden.” 
He was in agreement with the thought that using only thicker plastic bags, weighing a minimum of 60 microns, would continue to add to the problem which the city was currently facing. 
He suggested that the only environment-friendly, workable and cheap replacement of plastic bag was the use of cloth shopping bag. 
From the platform of his university, Dr Hashmi also cited various initiatives and research projects which were going on that helped convert the plastic product into useful items. 
Plastic chocking drains 
The city administration on the other hand sounds more determined against the use of plastic bags after the relief efforts following the recent rains led to the fact that the drainage system of Karachi was mostly choked due to thousands of tonnes of plastic bags found in nullahs. 
“One can’t imagine how challenging it has become to restore our drainage system,” said Karachi administrator Wahab. “Despite spending huge money, deploying enhanced workforce and using every available machine, these bags fail every effort.”
“So it’s no more about thicker or some modified kind of plastic bag. We are going for a complete ban on this product. This is in the interest of everyone,” he said.

SSP-South Syed Asad Raza said some rowdy youths travelling in two cars manhandled a police constable in civvies and attempted to kill him over some petty issue at the tea shop near Clock Tower on Muslim Commercial, Phase-VI, DHA.
The Darakhshan police registered a case against six persons on the complaint of Constable Hamza Nasir Gujjar under Section 324 (attempted murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

He said the Madadgar 15 police got a phone call that some unknown persons opened fire on Gujjar and escaped in two cars. The police reached the spot and collected five spent bullet casings fired from a rifle and two bullets.
According to the FIR, the complainant said he along with his three female friends was sitting at the tea shop in civilian dress. He said an unidentified person, wearing a shirt and trouser, sat beside him and started using foul language against him and his friends. Later, he signalled five more persons who came closer and started beating him. When he identified himself as a policeman, the suspects tried to snatch his pistol but he managed to dodge them and ran away. In the process, the suspects fired at him to which he also returned fire in self defence. 
The SP said that the complainant told the police that the suspects also slapped one of his female friends.

14,Parties condemn KE over agonising power outages in Karachi,"PTI, Muttahida, PSP and JI voice concern over utility’s indifferent attitude towards Karachiites.","KARACHI: Severe loadshedding being carried out by the K-Electric for the past more than one week despite low demand due to prevailing cool and cloudy weather in the metropolis forced key political parties to condemn the power utility’s “inhuman business strategy” and questioned its performance.
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, one of the important partners in the coalition government at the Centre, expressed serious concerns over the KE for keeping its vested interests at the cost of other people.
“It seems the KE has only put its business interests supreme regardless of people’s sufferings,” said the MQM-P in a recent statement.
“Karachi was known for its lights and life andit is fast descending into darkness and disaster. The hours-long loadshedding in the city has made people’s lives miserable, and put them under severe mental and physical stress,” it added.

PTI, Muttahida, PSP and JI voice concern over utility’s indifferent attitude towards Karachiites

The party demanded that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif take notice of the excessive loadshedding and rein in the KE. 
Also on Sunday, senior MQM-P leader Wasim Akhtar warned that his party would free to set its future course of action if coalition parties — Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Pakistan Peoples Party — would not fulfil the written agreements that signed with the MQM-P.
Speaking at a press conference, he said that his party would never support those who ridicule the country’s judiciary and armed forces.
PTI slams federal govt, KE
The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, which got the largest electoral mandate from Karachi in the 2018 general elections, said that a “blame game” was being played between the government and the utility company with a tacit understanding.
PTI’s parliamentary party leader in the Sindh Assembly Khurram Sher Zaman said in a statement that the federal government blamed the K-Electric and the company counter-blamed Islamabad for power shortages, loadshedding, losses, etc.
“Both are deliberately making people fool as in reality they protect each others’ interests. The government on one hand claims that it has not received dues from KE for the past one year. Then why did it not cancel the licence of the company? It won’t...because they both are operating in connivance with each others.”
He said that Finance Minister Miftah Ismail did not hold a single meeting with KE over the issue of prolonged loadshedding, while “Karachiites are forced to live in hell for the last one week”.
JI demands forensic audit
City chief of Jamaat-i-Islami Hafiz Naeemur Rehman called his party’s struggle against the KE and said that it had turned into a massive public movement amid its fast deteriorating performance and recent stories of corruption by its former head Arif Naqvi of Abraaj Group.
He demanded that the government order a forensic audit of the financial accounts of the power utility.
“You would find every single political party condemning the KE under public pressure,” he said and added: “But you won’t find a single leader questioning Arif Naqvi and his Abraaj Group because all political parties and their leaders are beneficiaries of his dirty game in Pakistan.”
“I wonder how the ruling parties are celebrating the verdict of the Election Commission of Pakistan against a certain party, but they aren’t ready to move against the biggest mafia founded by Arif Naqvi. But enough is enough. The people of Karachi have now learnt to raise their voice under the leadership of the Jamaat-i-Islami,” he said.
He condemned the KE for increasing loadshedding in the metropolis.
PSP demands more licences 
The Pak Sarzameen Party also condemned the KE for carrying out unannounced and “announced” loadshedding in the metropolis.

15,A dying tradition kept alive by children,Sabeels are set up with the advent of Muharram.,"KARACHI: The eyes of young occupants of a small tent in Saddar lit up all at once on seeing this scribe approach them. The tent is a sabeel (or refreshment stall) offering water and cool summer beverages for free in pretty colourful plastic glasses to passers-by.  
While little Shahzeb Ali, Abdul Wahid, Mohammed Zeeshan and Hamza Ali look on, Haji Ahsan Ali, the eldest among the boys, nags for monetary donations after offering cool beverages.  
“Oh come on,” he argues when met with the shaking of the head. “How do you expect us to run this sabeel without your valuable donation?” 
Shahzeb Ali and Abdul Wahid are also looking up hopefully at the prospect of getting some much-needed donations.  

Sabeels are set up with the advent of Muharram

“We get a variety of excuses whenever we ask for donations,” says Shahzeb. “Some say that they will surely give us some money after they get their salary, some say they don’t have small change on them,” he adds. 
“Others tell us that they will pay a visit to their bank before giving us some money. Yet others make an excuse of going to the nearest ATM. But we don’t get to see them again,” says Abdul Wahid.
Mohammed Zeeshan and Hamza Ali inform that they are all cousins. Before them, their older brothers or other cousins were responsible for the same stall being set up here by their maternal uncle.
“Our uncle pays for the basic tent and decorations, along with the plastic glasses. We set up the stall on the first of Muharram and start offering cool glasses of water from the second of Muharram,” says Zeeshan.  
“From Muharram 8, we will offer cool sherbet, too, which we will be doing throughout Ashura,” says Hamza Ali.
The uncle, Syed Sultan Shah Naqvi, then approaches the stall. “I set up a sabeel here, at this very spot, every year. Earlier, it was my other nephews who helped me decorate it and run it. Now when they are busy elsewhere, I have their younger brothers. The children are here every day in this heat offering cool water to passers-by. In return, if they ask for donations, please don’t frown at them,” the uncle smiles.  
“My older nephews will also be seen in action on Ashura day when they will be supervising the cooking of 20 cauldrons of haleem and as many cauldrons of biryani,”the uncle announces with pride. “And the money for all that food, to be distributed for free, will also come from the money collected by the young ones,” he adds.
The sabeel in Saddar was one of the first ones to be set up in Muharram. Though sabeels are a dying tradition now, some can still be seen in neighbourhoods like Liaquatabad, Malir, PECHS, etc. They are all usually set up by children who go around asking their elders and neighbours for donations. If they happen to live in a densely populated area, or in apartment buildings, all the better, as then they can collect more funds from more donors without doing much legwork.  
Many times, it has also been seen that the children, despite being annoying and a nuisance, are also helped in kind. For instance, someone’s Baji would freeze ice cubes for them, another Apa would wash their water coolers before refilling them with different kinds of sherbet or squashes or grind dried fruits to be added to the milk.
There is also no specific community involved in all this work. The kids hail from Sunni homes as well as Shia homes. Some are not even Muslim as Christian, Sikh and Hindu children are also invited by the Muslim children to come and join them. The more the merrier. And more kids also mean more volunteers to ask for more donations.

16,Urdu marsia has great potential to guide human thoughts,KARACHI: Marsia is the most powerful and significant genre of Urdu poetry that still owns a great potential to guide...,"KARACHI: Marsia is the most powerful and significant genre of Urdu poetry that still owns a great potential to guide human thoughts because it glorifies the battle of Karbala as a metaphor of disobedience to injustice, tyranny and oppression. 
Technically, marsia means a poem of grief over a great tragedy or lamentation for a departed soul. But now this genre is used precisely to commemorate the martyrdom of Ahle Bayt, especially the sacrifices of Imam Husain and his companions in the battle of Karbala. 
After getting the great technical and poetic strength from the two geniuses of Urdu poetry, Mir Babbar Ali Anis (1803-1874) and Mirza Salamat Ali Dabeer (1803-1875), the classical marsia started a new journey in the 20th century when the British Empire was striving to make its illegal regime stronger in the subcontinent by suppressing people in their own land.
It was the time when the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which is also called the massacre of Amritsar, took place in 1919. The Indian freedom movement was at its peak and some enlightened poets and intellectuals like Molvi Muhammad Hussain Azad, Altaf Hussain Hali, Shibli Nomani, Ismail Merathi, Akbar Allahabadi, Molana Zafar Ali Khan, Allama Iqbal, Chakbast Lucknowi, Hasrat Mohani and many others were writing to make people aware against the designs of the colonial power and its conspiracies. 
During that time, the famous revolutionary poet Josh Malihabadi started writing marsia with a new poetic elegance, radical spirit, and grandiloquence. 
The second marsia of Josh Malihabadi entitled ‘Husain and Inqalab’, helped him get fame as the poet of revolution in the subcontinent. After the preamble of revolutionary style in Urdu marsia, the Urdu literature witnessed an emergence of strong metaphors inspired by the battle of Karbala. The battle of Karbala became the treasure of metaphors while the writers and poets belonging to the Indian Progressive Movement largely used such metaphors in their writings. 
In this connection, Molana Muhammad Ali Johar’s two poetic lines represent the great meaning of Karbala: 
Qatl-i- Husain asl mein marge Yazid hai 
Islam zinda hota hai har Karbala k baad 
Answering a query about the prominence of marsia in Urdu poetry, famous poet and intellectual Prof Saher Ansari told Dawn that literature was all about language. 
Marsia owned a vital place in Urdu literature as it had all prime linguistic characteristics, he said, adding that without marsia, Urdu poetry might be deprived of the highest values of ethics.
By the characters of Karbala, marsia communicated the great values of life to humanity, he said, and added that Josh Malihabadi transformed the genre by adding up revolutionary sentiments and values, which showed the vigorous spirit of marsia to guide human thoughts. 
Prominent scholar and writer Dr Muhammad Raza Kazmi highlighted the importance of the message of Karbala, saying that the message of Karbala was universal because sacrifice was a universal value. 
He said: “Edward Gibbon did not name Hur, but he wrote ‘A chieftain from the opposing side crossed over to claim the partnership of inevitable death’.” 
Not only Hur, but Umar bin Khalid and Yazid bin Ziyad crossed over from the safety of the army of Yazid to the side of Husain where there were pitifully few; where there was hunger; where there was thirst and certain death, Dr Kazmi said.
Simon Oakley has mentioned the scene when Qays bin Ashath asked Husain why he did not bow to the will of his cousins. Husain replied in front of the whole army: “I will not give my hand in his hand in humiliation neither shall I flee like a slave.” 
Dr Hilal Naqvi, a famous critic and marsia writer, said that marsia was an inevitable part of Urdu literature as it had provided the great treasure of words to the Urdu dictionary.
He pointed out: “Marsia, whether it is new or classical, is the only kind of Urdu poetry that voices against the malice, brutality and imperialism.” 
Quoting Anis as saying: 
Lanat khuda ki mazhab-i-Ibn-i-Ziad per, Dr Naqvi said that poetic line had great meaning condemning the oppressors and tyrants of all time. 
Marsia drew the attention of people towards the voice of Imam Husain against the satanic powers of the time, he observed. 
Eminent scholar, intellectual and poet Firasat Rizvi said that the previous century had witnessed the flood of revolutionary movements, fatalities of the first and second world wars, colonialism, and darkness of fascisms, deprivation, and global depression. During that time marsia was describing the sacrifices of Imam Husain and his companions to encourage the people of the subcontinent to live their life with full energy. 
He pointed out that the first marsia of Josh Malihabadi entitled, ‘Awaza-i- Haq’ had pointed toward the emergence of political awareness in the genre of Urdu marsia. Talking about the spirit of marsia, he said: “Marsia teaches people to raise voice against tyrants, support disadvantaged people, condemn Yazidi ideas and encourages to opt for the path of Husainiyat.”
