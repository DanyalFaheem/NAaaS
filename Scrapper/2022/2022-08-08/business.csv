0,The mystery of the missing seths,The absence of local money deprives the ecosystem of a major avenue for growth capital and limits mergers and acquisitions.,"


 
Despite a clear slowdown in fundraising around the globe and in Pakistan, the last two weeks have been pretty happening. First, Tania Aidrus-led DBank announced a $17.6 million seed round, marking the first investment of Sequoia — one of the most renowned venture capital firms — in the country. This was followed by a few more deals, including OneLoad’s $11m which had Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation joining the capital table.
Sure, some of the deals were likely done months ago but that doesn’t dampen their importance, especially considering the profile of the investors. Anyway, that is beside the point. The question is with all this investment coming into the country, where is the local money? All those uniformed and non-uniformed seths with their conglomerates. Their absence has long been a cause of concern for it deprives the local ecosystem of a major avenue for growth capital and limits the potential mergers and acquisitions activity.
In fact, their lack of participation is alarming. According to numbers compiled by Data Darbar, of the 464 disclosed investors who invested in the country between January 2019 and June 2022, only 126 were local. That includes everyone: from angels to funds and everything in between. If we filter them out and limit ourselves to venture capital (VC) and corporates, the picture becomes even bleaker: 171 of the 216 institutions that took part were foreign.
Mind you, that is despite classifying firms domiciled abroad but focused on Pakistan as local. Basically, all the top active VCs over the past few years, be it Zayn, Fatima Gobi, or Indus Valley, are registered in foreign jurisdictions. In its Pakistan Startup Ecosystem Report 2021, Invest2Innovate also highlighted this problem: “the existing Private Fund Regulations (2015) do not allow foreign VCs to raise money from Pakistan unless licensed in the country, which carries ramifications for the scale at which local capital from family businesses can be mobilised.”

The absence of local money deprives the ecosystem of a major avenue for growth capital and limits mergers and acquisitions activity

The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) also seems to have realised the extent of the problem and released “A Diagnostic Review of Pakistan’s Private Funds Industry”. While it’s common knowledge (to those tracking the space) that the number of locally registered private equity (PE)/venture capital (VC) funds has remained largely static, the report puts numbers on how much behind the curve we are.
As of March 2022, there were only seven entities with a PE/VC license from the SECP which had a combined asset base of Rs10.99 billion, despite a healthy 64.3 per cent increase compared to Rs6.69bn in June 2021. Don’t get excited by the growth though, for it dwarfs in contrast to the investments raised by Pakistani startups.
For example, the size of the SECP-regulated private funds (PF) was Rs7.89bn by the end of 2020, compared to Rs13.5bn direct investment into startups. The following year, this gulf widened further as the former stood at Rs9.74bn while the latter hit Rs65bn. The report attributes some of the blame to the burdensome tax structure, which has three layers: first 29pc on the income of the investee company, then an equal rate on the income of the fund itself, and finally another 15pc on the dividend to PF investor.

Regulations do not allow foreign VCs to raise money from Pakistan unless licensed in the country, which carries ramifications for the mobilisation of local capital

Another issue pointed out was how VCs were being regulated like asset management companies despite their substantially different nature. For example, the former sources its money from already sophisticated limited partners (LPs), who have access to lawyers and other professional advice, and therefore do not need a similar level of protection as your average Basheer.
The regulator lists a number of remedies taken to address this problem, such as allowing pension funds to invest up to 5pc of the net assets of equity sub-funds in units of SECP registered PEs and VCs. However, it adds that no such investment has been made so far. Even if they had, it would have been a drop in the ocean considering how small the two industries are in total. This is in contrast to the US, for example, where pension funds and endowments were pivotal in driving up the liquidity of the VC industry.
Among the host of recommendations put forward, the SECP alludes to a government fund — in line with the demand of many industry stakeholders. But if the past is prologue, it’s best to take that bit with a handful of salt. After all, it was only this year that the National Investment Trust denied President Arif Alvi’s claim of launching a Rs1bn fund at an event.
While this entire exercise is indeed admirable and a step in the right direction, it ignores the broader issue of misaligned incentives. At the end of the day, capital will be channelled towards the asset class that’s given the most preferential treatment. That is obviously the real estate where one can defraud people, avoid taxes and at the end of the day, whiten all the wealth in the eternal amnesty scheme. But no one really wants to fix that.

1,Poor man’s fintech,China-backed OPay plans to invest nearly $100 million in digital financial and payment infrastructure,"

Ali Mubashar Kazmi
President of OPay Pakistan

 
With its large cash-based retail economy, coupled with a vast unbanked population, Pakistan offers endless possibilities for investment and growth in the digital banking and payments industry. No wonder a China-backed fintech, OPay, a one-stop mobile-based financial services platform that offers digital payments, digital wallet and financing solutions to its customers, is already here with plans to invest nearly $100 million in digital financial and payment infrastructure in the country.
“We are not just a payment company. We are here to enable the country’s unbanked population to enjoy financial inclusion and help document the economy,” Ali Mubashar Kazmi, the president of OPay Pakistan, says in an interview with Dawn.
Incubated in Nigeria, the fintech plans to bring multiple value-added services through its smart POS (point of sale) terminals to make financial services accessible to most people. “With our POS terminals, a merchant may act as an ATM and become a bank for their neighbourhood as these machines can be used to offer to their customers all branchless banking services ranging from payments to deposits to withdrawal to lending,” explains Mr Kazmi, who has over 25 years of experience in the banking industry.
“We want to be the power that can help Pakistan achieve faster economic development. Our economy needs what we are doing and what we plan to do; we can use our POS machines to not only help document the economy but also provide access to the 80 per cent financially excluded population of the country to small ticket loans,” the president says.

China-backed OPay plans to invest nearly $100 million in digital financial and payment infrastructure

With only around a fifth of the population linked to financial services (mostly limited to the very basic service of opening checking bank accounts) and less than 2pc people having access to capital/credit the sky is the limit for companies like OPay. “The unbanked population can’t even access the most basic financial services to invest in their businesses, limiting their potential. Nobody should be denied access to capital just because of their circumstances and social status. This needs to change now,” he says.
OPay’s entry into Pakistan was facilitated by its ability to raise funding of $400m from international investors led by Japan’s SoftBank. The company was valued at $2 billion.
In Pakistan, OPay has already deployed nearly 10,000 POS machines —about 11pc of the total 92,000 machines deployed across the country — in collaboration with commercial banks and plans to expand the number to up to 200,000.
“We think at least half a million POS machines can be deployed across Pakistan and we are ready to deploy two-fifth of this. With just 0.5pc of the approximately Rs8 trillion retail transactions done on credit/debit cards, the potential for growth in Pakistan is immense,” Mr Kazmi says as he explains the future plans of his company for expanding its footprints in the country’s digital financial sector.
“We intend to soon deliver a poor man’s credit card and small ticket loans for the unbanked and underbanked population. We are also in the process of launching our digital wallet,” he says, adding that his company has obtained regulatory permission for some of its operations while approvals for other products are being awaited. Some products will be launched in collaboration with the existing large banks.
“Our smart POS terminals are a bank branch where all kinds of payments can be made. Several value-added services like bill payments, mobile top up, cash-in, cash-out and money transfer to their customers can be availed by not only bank account holders but also cash-based customers,” he says.
However, most of the value-added services related to banking will be available on these terminals only when and if OPay secures a digital banking license. “OPay sees Pakistan as the most important market in the coming future as there is big space to work in the digitisation of the economy. But I feel things do not move at the speed at which they should in Pakistan. That remains a challenge,” says Mr Kazmi.
OPay has made major contributions to the Nigerian cash-based retail economy’s turnaround into a digital payments retail economy. “Since Pakistan has one of the lowest private sector lending penetration in the world and the highest cash-to-deposit ratio, we are planning our offerings in the digital banking space by targeting underbanked sectors such as small and medium enterprises, agriculture, and consumers from informal sectors whose financial needs are largely uncatered by commercial banks,” elaborates Mr Kazmi.
“If we are able to fix our banking and financial sector to serve our unbanked and underbanked population through the digitalisation of these services, half of our economic problems will soon be gone.”

2,A set of solutions for chronic problems,It is perplexing to see the celebrations by economic czars when the country gets dollar loans and deposits from institutions.,"Pakistan suffers from a chronic current account deficit whereby dollar outflows from imports materially exceed the dollar inflows via exports, remittances and foreign direct investment.
The country registered a mammoth current account deficit of roughly $21 billion in 2021-22 as the international prices of crude oil have increased significantly. The current account imbalance has been further aggravated by the sizeable mountain of foreign public debt worth about $90bn as of March 2022, resulting in an annual $20bn in foreign public debt interest and principal servicing requirements.
The country has approximately a $40bn dollar financing requirement for 2022-23 (recurring current account deficit and about $20bn in foreign public debt interest & principal servicing) compared to the State Bank of Pakistan’s meagre reserves of $8.4bn as of July 29. The precarious current account outlook is the primary driver of rupee weakness against the dollar.
It is perplexing to see the celebrations by economic czars in Pakistan when the country gets dollar loans and deposits from international institutions and friendly countries. Any borrowed dollars need to be repaid along with accrued interest in dollars at a later stage. Hence, the country ends up borrowing more dollars to service both interest and principal amounts of the existing foreign public debt in addition to a recurring sizeable current account deficit.

It is perplexing to see the celebrations by economic czars when the country gets dollar loans and deposits from international institutions and friendly countries since any borrowed dollars need to be repaid along with accrued interest

Below are a few avenues highlighted to control the external current account deficit over the next 3-5 years period.
The cost of doodh-patti
The government of Pakistan supplies heavily subsidised natural gas to about 10 million or approximately 30 per cent of households in Pakistan for domestic use. Imagine the value of gas (at prevailing international prices) used at homes to boil water to make doodh-patti chai.
The domestic natural gas reserves represent Pakistan’s competitive advantage in global trade and should be used for industrial use such as fertiliser and textile. As part of a multiple-year plan, the government should introduce electricity-based cooking hobs in the country and wholly divert domestic gas for industrial use or exports.
The domestic gas consumption is greater than the imported regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) volume worth $3.4bn in 2020-21. The diversion of gas away from domestic use to the industrial sector will eliminate RLNG imports, lower the industrial base production cost (no cross-subsidisation of domestic use needed) and reduce the gas line losses (leakages, theft) as Sui Southern Gas Company and Sui Northern Gas Company Ltd will focus on maintaining a smaller dedicated industrial gas network (versus ubiquitous domestic gas transmission system).
The existing long-term RLNG import contracts are significant “in-the-money” (contracted rates are materially below the prevailing spot rates) and could be renegotiated to provide a significant foreign exchange windfall to the Pakistani State.
A case for patience
Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDC) and Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) are the two most profitable state-owned enterprises (SOEs). These SOEs have zero gross debt on the balance sheet with sizeable financial assets and cash (Rs223bn for OGDC and Rs92bn for PPL) and trade receivables (Rs442bn for OGDC and Rs346bn for PPL) as of March 2022.
Typically, the balance sheet of upstream energy players like BP and Shell are heavily levered (indebted) because of their highly stable cashflows. OGDC and PPL have financial means via a strong balance sheet and scope for leverage to pursue aggressive onshore and offshore oil & gas exploration activities like what Turkey has accomplished in the Black Sea via the Sakarya field discovery.
Arabian Sea has been largely unexplored by OGDC and PPL despite India finding sizeable offshore energy reserves in Gujrat. This is a long-term strategy which would require patience and luck.
Energy security is as paramount as water or border security for Pakistan, and energy imports represented $3.6bn or about 45pc of June’s total imports. OGDC and PPL capital expenditure was only Rs19bn and Rs14bn in 2020-21 respectively despite significant liquidity on the balance sheet and scope for leverage.
The scope of railways
Pakistani urban cities severely lack integrated public transport networks. Replacing costly imported-fuel private transport with public transport will help control petroleum import volume as well as environmental degeneration.
Imagine the impact on ease and cost of doing business if the truck fleet used to transport containers from GT Road to Karachi Port is replaced by Pakistan Railways. World economies in the present day are introducing railway networks to facilitate business activities in their respective countries while Pakistan have a nationwide railway network since its independence. ML-1 and urban transit projects should be prioritised to reduce the imported fuel volume.
The irony of import-based electricity
A major portion of installed electricity capacity is based on imported fuel. For example, the electricity generation capacity from coal in Pakistan is 5,280MW of which 75pc is imported coal-based.
It is an irony if one considers that Pakistan has one of the largest coal reserves in Thar and the mighty Indus with rugged terrain in the north is ideal for hydroelectricity generation. Pakistan must rapidly shift to indigenous inexpensive fuel sources (eg Thar coal, natural gas).
The persistent current account deficit has resulted in a progressively weaker rupee against the dollar which has been the primary reason for inflationary pressure in Pakistan.
In 2021-22, Pakistan imported $90bn worth of goods and services which equates to about 25pc of GDP ie every Rs2.5 out of Rs10 spent by Pakistanis is on imported goods and services. Fixing the current account deficit on a sustainable basis will help mitigate the inflation in the country with a corresponding lower interest rate to promote investment.
To summarise, Pakistan will remain permanently wedded to the International Monetary Fund and friendly countries’ support unless we structurally fix our current account deficit to surplus. Thereafter, we have to use the excess dollars inflow from the current account surplus to repay the mountain of dollar-denominated foreign public debt worth $90bn (as of March 2022) over time.

3,The peril of imports,The tenuous recovery of the rupee is highly contingent on the trade balance which in turn is influenced by global economic trends.,"


 
The rupee lost 16.8 per cent of its value to the US dollar in July. But it regained 6.4pc in just five working days of August. This happened as exchange-rate positive news poured in and the central bank took action against currency speculators, banks and exchange companies.
The acting Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Dr Murtaza Syed told a gathering of business leaders on August 3 in Karachi that the rupee is still “undervalued.” He would not say, however, what he thought was the actual value of the rupee and how would it reach that level. The rupee shot up to 224.04 to a US dollar on August 5 in the interbank market from 239.37 a week earlier.
This healthy development and the SBP chief’s remarks about the rupee have enlivened hopes among many. They hope it would continue its winning streak and could rise to as high as 180-190 to a dollar within months.
But all hopes are not necessarily built upon facts. It is true that in July, and during the April-June quarter, the rupee had lost part of its value against the US dollar due to speculation and currency smuggling amidst the growing political instability in Pakistan. But our external sector’s weaknesses (a huge current account deficit of $17.4 billion in 2021-22 ending in June and growth in external debts earlier necessitating increased external debt servicing) were the two primary reasons for the rupee’s colossal losses against the greenback.

The tenuous recovery of the rupee is highly contingent on the trade balance which in turn is influenced by global economic trends

Pakistan’s imports of goods fell 12.8 pc to $4.861bn in July this year from $5.575bn in July last year. Exports of goods declined by about 5.2pc, from $2.43bn to $2.219bn, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS). Consequently, the trade deficit in July 2022 shrank 18.3pc to $2.642bn from $3.235bn in July 2021.
However, even the reduced trade deficit is huge. And, one month’s data is insufficient to project that the deficit for the full fiscal year will contract sharply. Besides, even this monthly trade deficit of $2.64bn exceeds the monthly average of remittances. This means that in this fiscal year as well, the combined earnings of merchandise exports plus remittances cannot cover the entire goods’ imports bill. What does that mean? That means that the current account deficit will remain in place.
Movements in demand and supply-driven exchange rates will continue to depend on the rate at which the current account deficit grows month after month.
Keeping this in view the recent appreciation of the rupee must not be taken as a sign of the rupee becoming stronger and being able to hold the ongoing rising trend for long. The rupee’s massive depreciation in July was primarily due to structural weaknesses of our external sector and the rise of the greenback in the international market. But political instability, polarisation, currency smuggling and flight of capital, delay in the outcome of Pakistan’s negotiations for the resumption of the International Monetary Fund loan and all such exchange-rate negative news and sentiments also contributed to its fall.
Its recent recovery owes more to the reversal of some of the exchange-rate news and sentiments and an obviously overdue correction in dollar-rupee parity than any real inflows except for the rollover of the Chinese commercial loans and state-level placement of funds. Together that amounts to $4.3bn and it was precisely due to these roll-overs that Pakistan managed to hold its foreign exchange reserves at the level where they are.
Forex reserves held by the SBP stood at $9.816bn at the end of June but despite the roll-overs of Chinese loans sank to $8.385bn on July 29.
This amount of reserves is equal to a little more than one and a half months of goods’ imports. But going forward, as imports begin to grow more reserves would be required even to keep the one-and-a-half months’ import cover.
Will imports grow in the coming months? Yes, of course. But how fast they grow depends primarily on three factors. First, international fuel oil prices and the pace of domestic economic growth. Second, global food commodity prices, local consumer and industrial demand for imported food items and raw materials — and the level of growth in domestic agriculture. And thirdly, overall economic growth at home particularly the performance of industries and exports.
Most importantly the course of global economic activity will have a big impact on all other factors listed above. After two quarters of negative economic growth, the US economy is technically in recession (though economists in the US and elsewhere debate intensely whether this rule of thumb is enough to define it as a recession or should the world wait for further proof).
If the US recession remains short-lived and its spillover impact on the global economy remains limited, then the volume of imports into Pakistan cannot decline much from where they are. (Past trend shows they will rather increase. Imports in the first month of the fiscal year remain low).
High economic growth of 6pc in 2020-21 is still having its spillover effect on various sectors of the economy and despite all the interest rate hikes and fiscal belt-tightening, domestic demand cannot be cooled off beyond a certain limit.
If volumes of imports grow then that would wipe off the benefit of lower international fuel oil and food commodity prices. Besides, it is uncertain whether the recent declining trend in fuel oil and food commodity prices will hold throughout our current fiscal year ending in June next year.

4,Brand-driven agri growth needed,Pakistan can earn at least $100m per annum more against the current volume of exports of agricultural commodities.,"


 
Agriculture plays a major role in the development of an agrarian country like Pakistan. The sector contributes over 37.44 per cent of total employment and more than 19pc of GDP in the national economy. Over 63pc of Pakistan’s population is rural, deriving at least a part of their income from agriculture or its sub-sectors. As a majority of them are small farmers, any addition to the value of the commodities they produce can help reduce the rural poverty level in the country.
One way, hitherto ignored, of increasing the value of the commodities is by branding them for creating extra consumer demand and giving producers leverage in negotiations with buyers. This also enables the producers, whether individual farmers, companies or countries, to reach out to a wider audience and make the maximum profit by selling their produce with a distinctive brand name.
Various studies suggest that consumers are influenced 25pc by price and packaging and 25pc by communication and promotions, whereas the quality of a product, positioning, availability and origin each has a 12.5pc impact on consumers. That means consumers are influenced more by branding and marketing than the quality of the product.
Market players say lack of awareness on the part of producers, a certain mindset of consumers, cost escalation and apathy of the government towards creating an enabling environment are stumbling blocks in the ways of promotion of branding culture, particularly in the agriculture sector.

Based on guesstimates, Pakistan can earn at least $100m per annum more against the current volume of exports of agricultural commodities if the consignments are sent as branded products

“Poor awareness on the part of producers and/or sellers about the positive impact of branding on sales is more to blame than any other factor for the absence of this important marketing tool in the country,” says Shehzad Ali Malik, CEO of Guard Agricultural Research & Services.
“There is no concept of branding of agricultural commodities when we stepped into the market with our brand of rice around three decades ago. The commodity used to be sold in the loose form then. But we challenged the mindset of the consumers about packed commodities and these are now claiming a major share in the local market.”
Building a brand, however, requires a consistent investment of both time and money. Many producers lose patience and sell their commodities without any branding at the cost of their premium.
Ahmad Jawad of the Pakistan Business Forum argues that a small expense on attractive packaging to improve the presentation of the product may help earn a premium price for the same quantity of a commodity because jo dikhta hai woh bikta hai (what is seen is sold).
Highlighting the growing importance of packaging, he quotes Statista, a statistics portal for market data, claiming that the global agricultural packaging market is expected to cross the $5 billion mark by the end of 2023. He assesses that Pakistan can earn at least $100 million per annum more against the current volume of export of agricultural commodities if the consignments are sent as branded products.
“But branding is not just a name or symbol that one spends a petty amount on to get a logo designed and a label affixed to differentiate one’s products from others,” says Mr Malik. “Rather, it’s more about attaining and maintaining high standards in production and processing and ensuring consistency of the product. Only then can the seller claim a premium price,” he explains.
“It takes years and a worthwhile financial investment to establish a brand. But most people prefer earning easy money through the sale of loose commodities rather than hard work in terms of time and money needed to build their brand.”
The impression among consumers that branded products cost more is another factor that dissuades producers from going for branding. Consumers are mostly not ready to pay the premium price for the guaranteed quality of a product and that’s a dilemma for the producers.
“Branded products do cost more because publicity campaigns and printed wrappings have their price and added to it is the margin we have to pay to distributors because self-distribution is close to impossible,” says Mr Malik. “But, you have to convince the consumers that the benefits they are getting by paying the premium are worth it ie a guaranteed quality and quantity of the product and all other stated attributes. A brand will do anything to save its reputation, whereas ordinary producers/sellers may compromise on these fronts because they have nothing to lose in the trade.”
Unlike the local market, the cost is not a factor for exports, says Mr Jawad. “The cost of the produce of an export consignment may not be more than 45pc and the rest will be logistics (by sea or air), packing charges and labour costs. Attractive packaging, like for a 10kg pack, costs not more than a dollar and that can be easily adjusted.”
Domestic branding is the first and inevitable step before going to international consumers, says Mr Malik, complaining that no official support is available for exploiting the world markets unlike neighbouring India, where the government had set up a Rs100bn fund to lend technical, marketing and branding support to micro food enterprises for modernising their production techniques and branding their produce.
New Delhi is also launching the Brand India Campaign to give momentum to exports of both services and products in new markets, he says.
He suggests that the government should re-initiate the Ayub-era export bonus voucher scheme as a way to encourage brand exporters. Under the scheme, the exporters may be allowed to import raw material and machinery at zero duty for the amount equal to their export earnings. He argues that the development of a brand means branding a region and country too.
As the financial status of producers always plays an important role in branding, some believe that the government should offer easy loans to the local producers and farmers financially enabling them to focus on marketing. “Producers, a majority of them being small landholders, are financially weak people, who cannot afford to allocate funds for brand development. The government should incentivise them by offering low markup, if not interest-free, loans on soft terms,” demands Aamer Hayat Bhandara, a progressive farmer.
Other areas where the government should, and could, play a proactive role include creating a supportive regulatory environment, protecting against outside competition and domestic overproduction, working for grant of geographical indicators and introducing quality certification and grading systems as a help for those who wish to establish their brands, he says.

7,A glass half full approach to devaluation,"Though a weaker rupee is more closely associated with doom and gloom, it does have a set of advantages.","


 
The rupee is nosediving, foreign reserves are evaporating and political instability is proliferating. The financial watchdogs are painting a dismal picture of our future. The economic experts have earmarked us for imminent default. The consensus view is that rupee devaluation will have disastrous consequences for our already brittle economy.
However, less thought has been given to the opposite nature of rupee devaluation. Not everything is wrong with the downfall of our currency. Let me explain the bright side of rupee depreciation which is rarely discussed: the glass half-full view.
The foremost advantage of a weak rupee is that it increases the competitiveness of exports by making them cheaper and conversely making imports more costly. Pakistan, which is struggling to keep pace with the ever-increasing import bill, is likely to benefit from this arrangement as it will reduce our reliance on imports.
The export industry will gain more incentive to increase production and is likely to contribute to bolstering exports’ growth. However, all of this is contingent upon the rightful implementation of the austerity measures put in place to curtail our import bill and the reduction of the export refinance rate.

Though a weaker rupee is more closely associated with doom and gloom, it does have a set of advantages

Frequent payments on the import of oil have drained the foreign currency out of our economy and worsened the balance of payment crisis. But keeping an idealistic view of things as the international oil prices have fallen in the past few weeks, a weaker currency can help us shrink the existing trade deficit. With exports being our most significant foreign exchange earner in addition to remittances, an uptick in the former will provide much-needed stability to the fluctuations in the exchange rate.
Foreign capital inflows to Pakistan have dried up, owing specifically to the perpetual political instability. Even with such lucrative returns on T-Bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds, foreign investment is hard to come by as long as the creditworthiness of our economy remains in question.
But there may be light at the end of the tunnel. If the political infighting subsides in the next few months, foreign companies would be tempted to capitalise on the weak currency by investing in domestic industry and gain access to the relatively cheaper assets and labour market here in Pakistan. The inflow of foreign direct investment would not only tilt the exchange rate in favour of the rupee but create more jobs and influence the GDP positively.
Pakistan has accumulated a huge burden of foreign debts and the devaluation of the rupee will eventually make the interest payments even costlier than before. However, the bright side suggests a trade-off. A weak rupee would make the payments on domestic debt relatively less expensive as inflation would make the real returns on government-issued debt appear dwarf in comparison with the nominal returns.
Ukraine, which had an external debt of $130 billion at the conclusion of 2020, has depreciated its currency by almost 25 per cent to provide an impetus for its export market and ease up the pressure on its foreign reserves. Ukraine is a major exporter of iron, steel, and wheat and this move comes at a time when inflation and economic uncertainty have pushed this war-torn country back against the ropes.
China has also been notorious for currency devaluation on various occasions, most notably during the trade War with the United States back in 2018 which helped the Chinese exports gain traction in the international markets. Pakistan, though not deliberately, can benefit from the devaluation of the currency by cashing in its huge dependence on exports.
Rupee devaluation may turn out to be a blessing in disguise for us but getting the nod from the policymakers to endorse this unpopular opinion bears a significant political cost. Even if the Russia-Ukraine conflict is resolved, the other obvious impediment towards utilising rupee devaluation persists, ie the appeasement of voters.
The whole political narrative in Pakistan is built around a strong currency which overshadows the benefits likely to emerge from a weak rupee. Moreover, the public outcry on domestic inflation and rupee devaluation is difficult to evade, especially in the context of the general elections ahead.
That is why it is important to lure all the major political parties to put aside their blame games and sign the Charter of Economy, which would not only transcend political barriers but also direct inclusive economic institutions to act in the best interests of the country.

8,Striving for economic unity,"In current climate of political polarisation and crisis, the private sector is taking the lead in drafting a Charter of Economy.","


 
The country’s trade bodies have stepped up their efforts to persuade political parties to meet their demand of the Charter of Economy (COE) and develop a policy consensus on how to pull the political economy out of the deep-seated crisis.
Confronted by a political and economic mess, it is probably for the first time that the business community is looking at the big picture with the widest possible participation of concerned stakeholders to forge a national document pledged to the country’s salvation.
Though initially acting individually, a process is now being initiated to reach the consensus policy framework through joint coordinated efforts. In absence of policy continuity, this approach stands out in sharp contrast to the focus of trade bodies on day-to-day problems in its dealings with the decision-makers.
A CoE or a policy consensus, trade bodies hope, will end the extreme political polarisation the country is facing these days. Instead of the blame game, political parties would work for a common objective.

In the current climate of political polarisation and crisis, the private sector is taking the lead in drafting a Charter of Economy

The Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) wants to bring all the political parties in the Parliament and the provincial assemblies on one stage to discuss the way forward and steer the country out of the economic crisis. Its objective is to achieve consistency in economic policies irrespective of political change.
It is also aware that no consensus policy can be successfully implemented without the active participation of the federating units. (Here there is a major issue of disparity in regional development).
If an agreement on a comprehensive strategy may be difficult to reach because of the sharp divergence of views and conflicting interests of various stakeholders, the next best alternative may be an agreement on the common minimum agenda.
An All Parties Conference is planned for August 7 by the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) for the revival of the economy to highlight (critical) issues in discourse with decision-makers.
The Chamber is already engaged with several economists seeking their input and the collective thought of experts will be presented at the conference. And the technical suggestions finalised at the conference would be shared with all other chambers in the country and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) as well as provincial governments.
In addition to these efforts, the FPCCI has requested the State Bank of Pakistan to provide a strategy paper for the consumption of foreign exchange listing preferences of imported items.
A positive development is that PTI Chairman Imran Khan (IK), contrary to his earlier instance, is reported to have agreed to sign a CoE in a recent meeting with the Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry delegation. It may be recalled that Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif initiated the CoE proposal when IK became the prime minister. But no progress was made because of political polarisation.
In its campaign to bring all political parties on the same page the RCCI has also drafted a CoE. “We are pushing for all leaders and policymakers to develop a consensus on how to navigate from the situation of extreme distress and pull the economy out of this downward spiral,” said a statement issued by APTMA. APTMA, which represents the largest segment of the country’s industry, is haunted by the fear that the country is ‘on the brink of economic collapse.’
Included in the crucial issues raised by APTMA is that political stability is a serious impediment to economic progress which results in suboptimal short-term macroeconomic policies, frequent policy U-turns and non-completion of ongoing projects.
Roadblocks to entrepreneurship and innovation need to be mitigated so that we can empower our youth and our disfranchised talent to bring about a grassroots-level economic revolution. And the best mechanism is through supply-side intervention, by bringing more individuals into the economy and increasing the labour supply for which entrepreneurship and financial inclusion are critical.
Implicit in the national consensus policies is that the majority of the people should also benefit from them. To quote Dr Mahbub ul Haq, take care of poverty and this will take care of GDP. Social inequality constraints development. Any CoE should be a part of the manifestos of political parties if a referendum is not seen as advisable.
Political parties issue their manifestos just a couple of weeks before elections. To quote an analyst, each of these manifestos is mainly a wish list. The wish list rarely goes into the realm of actionable policy. This process, it may be added, apparently erodes the vote bank of mainstream political parties and generates social tensions.
APTMA also dispelled what it described as ‘the widespread misconception’ that exporters welcome rupee devaluation. In the long run, it added, the large devaluation of the rupee is worst for exporters, especially textile exporters, because it raises input costs, making exports less competitive. (Latest data issued by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics show that exports of merchandise fell 5.17 per cent to $2.21 billion in July from $2.34bn in the same month last year.)
Investors’ confidence cannot be met with a 15pc interest rate, says APTMA, and adds that interest rates should not be raised in order to stabilise the economy.
A CoE also needs to redefine the role of the private sector. It would be in the fitness of things that role should be voluntarily defined by businesses rather than bureaucracy or politicians.
Company managements have to take care of all other stakeholders in businesses: minority shareholders, workers, government, consumers and lenders. They should formulate a joint policy on how these stakeholders would share the fruits of economic progress driven by the private sector’s enlarged role in the proposed CoE formulated by them.

9,The coexistence of fintech and traditional banks,Financial technology is convenient but banks have access to larger sums of money and are more trusted by the public.,"


 
Fintech is a phenomenon that has completely changed the worldview regarding financial processes. Fintech’s market value is expected to reach $305 billion by 2025 at an exponential growth rate of more than 20 per cent per year. With the statistics provided, it is impossible to become oblivious to this revolution.
Financial technology or more commonly known as fintech is the combination of financial services and technology merged to provide a seamless user experience to businesses or consumers. Even though fintech is a relatively newer structure as a whole, the concept is not so much.
The first ever fintech product made available to the public was in the 1950s as the real breakthrough: credit cards, a product that is now an essential financial convenience tool around the globe. Later, in 1998 PayPal was founded as the first fintech company operating only on the internet and that is where it all began.
Fast forward to now, there are countless fintech businesses worldwide operating on algorithms, blockchain and data science. They provide a horizon of services from basic mobile banking or neobanks to investment and savings through companies like Finja and SadaPay. They are also the sole medium for cryptocurrency and blockchain companies such as Binance and Opeansea. Other services include machine learning and trading, payments, lending and insurance.

Financial technology is convenient but banks have access to larger sums of money and are more trusted by the public

The traditional banking system has gradually built its way up for centuries and thus its roots have been embedded deep into the soil. Traditional banks are regulated financial institutions with a central function of receiving deposits and lending to individuals and organisations.
However, they also provide a broad range of other services such as wealth and asset management, safe deposit lockers and currency exchange among others. The importance of traditional banking to any economy cannot be ignored since routine transactions take place through this channel such as withdrawals, deposits as well as bill payments. They are also the source of interest-earning for lenders.
Moreover, the banking system is not only limited to commercial banks; there is a major stake of corporate and investment banks involved in it as well, all of which are regulated by a central regulatory body of a country.
As in any two mediums of service, there are features of fintech and traditional banking services that set them apart from one another.
The procedures of traditional financial services were set in place decades ago which is why in the present day they are old, time-consuming and majorly outdated.
This is a massive setback for the banking system since customers today are yearning for anything that is quick and convenient to match their fast-paced life. This is where fintech comes in.
A digitised platform that provides any and all financial services for the ease of the customers. This concept eliminates the requirement of a physical location to carry out financial services which reduce the cost and hassle for both the providers and consumers.
Customers feel more involved and informed with the use of fintech as all data is disclosed at the speed of a few clicks. These platforms are user-friendly in comparison to traditional banking which consists of lengthy and complex steps; fintech skips all of that and only requires an online registration on a mobile app or website.
Fintech is wholly reliant on technology. Any advancement in tech has its ripple effect on advances in the fintech industry. They are built around machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide high-quality and smooth processing services.
However, this reliance on automation also causes a lingering risk of a breach in cyber security which can ultimately cause the entire fintech industry to collapse. This is because no physical data or money is stored instead all of it is stored via the cloud.
Banks are regulated by the national central banks of their country. These regulations are put in place for banks to adhere to legal requirements, restrictions and guidelines through which they may operate to safeguard public money and ensure transparency between banks and customers.
Fintech on the other hand is very loosely regulated which is why countless fintech start-ups easily make their way up. They operate faster and more in tune with their customers’ needs but the absence of rules and regulations makes it a risky industry for consumers. Due to this, the public at large feels safer when opting for traditional banks because it has a regulatory body at the back holding it accountable.
Is fintech a possible threat to traditional banking? On the face of it, traditional financial providers are adapting well to the entrance of fintech into the market. Most banks have now launched an extended fintech version of their banking system through online banking applications and websites where their customers can engage in online banking facilities such as mobile payments, peer-to-peer lending and digital security.
However, in a broader capacity, traditional financial service providers do consider fintech as a prominent threat. Since fintech’s business models are almost 10 times less costly than traditional banks, it cuts down on 90pc of human resources and thus requires more skill-based employees, especially in the tech space. This shift from human capital is a threat to employees of traditional financial services.
Furthermore, fintech has become a source of financial inclusion to (primarily low-income) individuals who were previously not on the grid.
Both fintech and traditional financial services act as intermediaries for the consumer. To expect either of the two mediums to have a 100pc control over the financial industry is beyond practicality because they both cater to different yet essential needs of the public. The complete shift to any of the two would in fact impact the financial processing methods of consumers leaving them at more unease than with the use of both simultaneously.
Ideally, if fintech and traditional banking collaborate in the long run, together they can amplify the quality of their services and features and make a bigger impact. Banks hold huge amounts of deposits whereas fintech holds relatively smaller amounts. To make full use of this, banks can partner with fintech to build better financial systems and fintech can in return benefit from the large sums of money.
This partnership can churn best of the best outcomes by combining the technology and innovation of fintech and the support and trust that the public has for traditional banking services to progress into a trusted digital future.

A view of a dollar and Cuban pesos in Havana can be seen. Last week, the Central Bank of Cuba reported that banks and exchange houses will begin buying dollars at a price of 120 Cuban pesos per bill, a rate similar to that of the black market, a mechanism aimed at capturing foreign currency.—AFP

 
The baloney of ‘metaverse’
The idea of a “metaverse” reached critical mass last fall when Facebook announced its new company name, Meta, and its intention to build “a 3D place where people can work, play, and connect with others in immersive, online experiences.” While Facebook’s name change has made it the public face of the future of the metaverse, other tech companies are also developing virtual and augmented reality technologies to make their own metaverse plays. And companies of all kinds are looking at what a robust metaverse means for them and their industry. Overall, “the metaverse is almost entirely hype and baloney right now,” said Philip Rosedale, at a recent Future Compute conference. Mr Rosedale’s company Linden Lab created the pioneering virtual civilisation Second Life. “If you’re worried about your company needing to jump in right this very minute to make your metaverse play, you can stop worrying.” “It’s not a technology, it’s not even an umbrella of technologies. It’s not a singular place, it’s not a singular protocol,” according to another expert.

Fading superhero mania
The share of adults who enjoy superhero movies ticked down slightly compared to a year ago, according to a Morning Consult survey, a worrisome trend for Disney’s Marvel franchise as its movies experience a rare relative slump at the box office and among critics — and Disney expands its investment in the properties. The poll found 36pc of all respondents enjoy superhero movies, down from 41pc last November. Perhaps most worrisome is the share of self-identified Marvel fans who enjoy the movies also fell, dropping from 87pc to 82pc. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has released 29 movies since its inception in 2008, including four in 2021 and three released or scheduled in 2022. Marvel content has become increasingly crucial to Disney, helping drive subscriptions to its Disney+ streaming service. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige unveiled 10 new Marvel titles movies at San Diego Comic-Con, including two Avengers films slated for 2025.

Stop undervaluing exceptional women
Despite progress toward gender equality at work, it still takes women longer to get promoted than men — and few make it to the top of the corporate ladder. Recent research suggests that gender-biased assumptions about retention are, in large part, to blame. The findings suggest that exceptional women are often taken for granted by companies who assume they’re not a flight risk — an assumption that likely contributes to the “glass ceiling” and the gender wage gap. When companies assume women will place loyalty to the firm over advancing in their careers through outside opportunities, they’re less likely to engage in preemptive retention efforts, such as bonuses, raises, and promotions. To stop taking talented women for granted and to avoid losing them to other firms, companies need to do more to recognise and address these biases.

Ditching green for sustainability
Starting August 1, Coca-Cola said it would ditch the bottle colour, which it has used to market its Sprite bottles for more than six decades, and would instead use clear bottles that are supposed to be more sustainable. The company said that it is easier to reuse clear plastic than green plastic for new bottles. Sprite’s green plastic is recyclable, but green plastic is more often converted into single-use items like carpets and clothing. Coke officials have said that Sprite’s green colour and packaging were meant to communicate that the drink tasted refreshing. The lemon-lime drink and its packaging have been green ever since Sprite launched in the U.S. in 1961. The drink has been one of Coke’s bestselling products, according to the company. Coke said that the other green bottles it sells in North America—including those for Seagram’s ginger ale, Mello Yello and Fresca—would also be sold in clear plastic bottles in the coming months.

11,The narrative of expected U-turns,The reversal of the fixed tax scheme on traders is seen as logical by some and political by others,"


 
While the government heaped the burden of consolidation measures on the masses to supposedly save Pakistan from a dreaded sovereign default, the optics of backstepping and scraping the fixed tax scheme for retailers/wholesalers was tauntingly painful though not necessarily unexpected.
The fixed tax scheme, announced in the budget, made traders liable to a pre-determined levy to be charged on the basis of electricity consumption and collected on a monthly basis along with the power bill. It was to discharge traders’ sales and income tax liability simultaneously.
Three slabs were notified for the purpose: Rs3,000 on monthly electricity bills up to Rs30,000, Rs5,000 on bills worth Rs30,000 to 50,000 and Rs10,000 on monthly electricity bills of over 50,000. The rate was to be doubled (cent per cent higher) for non-filers. Besides mobilising additional revenues of Rs30 to 45 billion the government hoped to broaden the tax net through this scheme by bringing a vast community into the tax fold that managed to defeat all such earlier efforts, by hook or crook.
Last week, however, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail and Energy Minister Khurram Dastgir Khan, in presence of jubilant traders, announced rolling back of the fixed tax scheme and reverting to the old system. According to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) statistics, cited online, trading and wholesale, which make up roughly 19 per cent of the GDP, chip in a minuscule Rs6bn in taxes to the national exchequer. Out of about 2.3 million traders and shopkeepers country wide, hardly 5,000 file tax returns.

The reversal of the fixed tax scheme on traders is seen as logical by some and political by others

Confirming the decision Foreign Minister Miftah Ismail said in a message: “The fixed tax is done away with. The old regime is back. The tax rate will not change for the first three months though we intend to revise it up a little afterwards.”
Energy minister Khurram Dastgir came out strong in defence of traders when approached for a comment and shared a copy of the relevant document. “Commercial consumers were already paying tax at the rate of 5pc up to Rs20,000 electricity bill and at the rate of 7.5pc on bills above that. They are also paying three other taxes. They will continue to pay at the current rate for the next three months and then we will negotiate for an increase. So instead of a fixed tax, ad valorem regime will continue.”
“If traders can force a surrender in the current hard situation it speaks of their strength and determination to resist any attempt to bring them on FBR’s list. Their strategy is to isolate opponents amid the growing vulnerability of the current government as its political base erodes,” said a top economist critical of the early removal of the PTI government that he thought hurt the democratic cause and destabilised the economy.
Hero of the current round of traders’ resistance, Naeem Mir, Secretary General, All Pakistan Anjuman of Traders, talking to this scribe supported the idea of making tax contribution of the trading activity resonant to its size in Pakistan but held successive governments and not traders responsible for the anomaly.
“Instead of enforcing half-backed unrealistic schemes from up above, blue-eyed experts and naïve babus should invite stakeholders to arrive at a workable plan of better outcomes. No, we didn’t browbeat but win the government over with logic.” He raised several points to make his case and expose weaknesses in the fixed tax plan that would have rendered it counterproductive.
Shabbar Zaidi, former chairman of FBR was disgusted at the rollback of the scheme. “Simply put traders of Pakistan are just not ready to fulfil their financial responsibility or accept the government oversight for the fear of exposure of their underhand dealings. It is not an accident that every time a government tries to discipline them to pay taxes at par with their equals in other sectors, they target the FBR and drag its name through the mud.
“It is an open secret that smuggled, dumped, under-invoiced imported products and even banned items are traded all across the country with immunity. During my time in the FBR, I tried to achieve the targets by shifting the onus of lawful transactions on purchasers but failed. I don’t think any government without the active support of civil society can force this defiant class to comply with the law of the land”.
A retired civil servant and an academic thought it would be silly to expect parties like PML-N and MQM that depend on this class politically to make a serious effort to make them fall in line. “Traders’ vote and street power may be exaggerated but they did successfully rise above all divides to put up a unified resistance whereas other taxpayers, especially the salaried/middle class badly split (socially, economically and ethnically) have to surrender every single time. Yes, it is unfair as we all know what the government conceded to them will be recovered from others, especially the captive salaried taxpayers.”
Nasim Beg a senior executive with a keen eye on the economy interpreted the reversal of fixed tax as a political move of PML-N to shore up its eroding political capital. “They can’t afford the risk of annoying their urban vote base at the current critical juncture.”
Malik Mehr Illahi, President Markazi Tanzeem e Tajiran Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, contested the perception that the latest decision on taxing traders was guided by politics. “It is irresponsible to paint a vibrant self-reliant segment of the economy in a negative light. Their big players can be counted on fingers; the vast majority comprises petty shopkeepers paying high commercial rates for utilities putting many more than the regular eight hours to sustain their shops. For those interested, we are willing to contest each and every charge at a public forum. Our strength is in our numbers and no we are not ready for mistreatment by tax sharks.”

12,Solar panels on every roof,Pakistan can either embark on the green energy revolution while it is still at an early stage or be a late-comer as usual,"The international energy demand/supply imbalance has resulted in a steep rise in the cost of energy inputs. Pakistan cannot control the international geopolitics behind the crisis, but taking emergency countermeasures to fix our energy situation is certainly possible.
In this article, I will argue why we need to launch a major programme of solar roof-tops to handle the current crisis and for the long-term sustainability of the power sector. I propose that Pakistan adds six gigawatts (GW) of new roof-top solar plant capacity within the next three years by putting the right measures in place.
Making 1GW capacity addition in 2022-23, 2GW in 2023-24 and 3GW in 2024-2025 may seem like an ambitious target given our slow track record of solar installations, but if the distribution companies (Discos) and the banking sector join hands it is fully achievable.
A substantial portion of our installed power generating capacity is based on imported fuels, mainly Liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal. Several recent attempts to buy LNG from the international market have failed as international suppliers prefer to supply to other customers, especially in Europe.

Pakistan can either embark on the green energy revolution while it is still at an early stage or be a late-comer as usual

The lesson for our policymakers is that Pakistan’s long-term energy security depends on reducing our reliance on imported fuels. Solar-based power systems, whose prices are now at a historical low in dollar terms and which have no operating cost unlike imported fuel plants, can be our saviour.
The National Transmission & Despatch Company’s new power expansion plan envisages utility-scale solar power plant additions in multiples of 50MW in the coming years through independent power producers. The roof-top-based solar systems have greater potential than utility-scale plants and can be installed far more quickly under a PPP (public-private partnership) scheme.
No capacity payments are involved nor is there a need to arrange sovereign loans. Unlike utility-scale plants, roof-top solar produces energy where it is needed, ie in urban areas, thus offsetting the need for building long-distance transmission lines.
A comprehensive investment programme may be launched under an empowered team drawn from the Alternate Energy Development Board (AEDB), Discos and the banking sector. The banks, in particular, must take on an active role unlike in the past whereby the concessional funds made available to them by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) have mostly remained unutilised. Each bank must be given a target of financing a certain number of megawatts of roof-top-based systems both of the net-metering and stand-alone types.
Roof-top solar offers an avenue for directing individuals’ savings towards a productive investment that brings financial returns in the form of a reduction in the energy bill of the participating consumers. Those, like myself, who have already installed net-metering systems have a reason to feel delighted every month when they see the financial savings accrued to them in the electricity bills.
The main items that are used in a solar power system are the panels and inverters both of which are presently imported and are a drain on the country’s meagre forex reserves. International financial institutions can provide long-term funding in foreign currency at fairly concessional interest rates. However, a robust and viable implementation plan will need to be presented to them to obtain their funding.
Any financing programme must have the full and active involvement of the SBP unlike in the past when it merely approved a re-financing facility at a 6 per cent interest rate without stipulating the actual lending targets for the banks. The result was that banks did not actively promote loans for solar projects. This time around, the banks would be given targets and compliance will be monitored by the SBP.
Thus far, the Discos have been acting as an approving body rather than seeking out active partnerships with consumers to promote solar projects due to some well-known concerns that need to be addressed. A new nexus between commercial banks and Discos must evolve so that together they can offer financial products to the “prosumers” — a term for consumers that are also producers of electricity.
A three-way contractual arrangement between the Disco, the bank and the prosumer will give comfort to the lending bank concerning the repayment of its loans through the monthly bills sent by the Disco.
The AEDB is expected to put together a fool-proof arrangement which has the buy-in and active involvement of all stakeholders. The quality of products and services given by the approved vendors will need major improvements as there is a common complaint that the registered vendors outsource the supply and installation of the project to those contractors who have substandard qualifications.
According to the International Energy Association May 2022 report, the world added a record 295GW solar capacity in 2021 while 2022 will see another new record of 300GW of solar capacity addition. Pakistan is lagging behind in the race as its present solar power capacity is dismally low.
If the last three decades were the decades of information technology (IT) it can be safely forecasted that the next three decades belong to clean energy developments and innovations. Pakistan has to decide whether it wants to embark on the green energy revolution while it is still at an early stage or be a late-comer to the game just as it was in developing its IT software capabilities.
