0,"Israel, Palestinians agree to truce in Gaza Strip",The hostilities leave 41 people dead in the Hamas-ruled territory...,"GAZA CITY: Israel and the Islamic Jihad group agreed to a Cairo-mediated truce on Sunday, raising hopes of an end to the most serious flare-up on the Gaza frontier in more than a year.
The truce came into effect at 20.30 GMT, Islamic Jihad and the Israeli government said in separate statements.
Since Friday, Israeli forces pounded Gaza Strip through the weekend, triggering longer-range rocket attacks against its cities.
The latest clashes have echoed preludes to previous Gaza flare-ups, though they have been relatively contained as Hamas, the governing group in Gaza Strip and a more powerful force than Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad, has so far stayed out.
Gaza officials said 43 Palestinians, almost half of them civilians and including children, had so far been killed. The rockets have threatened much of southern Israel and sent residents in cities, including Tel Aviv and Ashkelon,  to shelters.

The hostilities leave 41 people dead in the Hamas-ruled territory

Israel launched what it called pre-emptive strikes on Friday against what it anticipated would be an Islamic Jihad attack meant to avenge the arrest of a leader of the group, Bassam al Saadi, in occupied West Bank.
In response, Islamic Jihad said, it had fired hundreds of rockets at Israel. The group said the truce would involve al Saadi’s release. 
On Sunday, Islamic Jihad extended its range to fire toward Jerusalem in retaliation for the overnight killing of its southern Gaza commander by Israel — the second such senior member it has lost in the fighting.
Israel said its Iron Dome interceptor, whose success rate the army claims to be 97 percent, shot down the rockets just west of the city. Palestinians dazed by another surge of bloodshed — after outbreaks in 2008-09, 2012, 2014 and last year — picked through the ruins of houses to salvage furniture or documents.
“Who wants a war? No one. But we also don’t like to keep silent when women, children and leaders are killed,” said a Gaza taxi driver who identified himself only as Abu Mohammad. “An eye for an eye.”
17 Palestinians killed
Nine children were among 17 Palestinians killed on Sunday in Gaza, raising the toll to 41 since fighting began on Friday. 
Gaza’s health ministry said more than 300 people were wounded in Gaza since Saturday. Two rockets were intercepted in the centre of Israel’s com­mercial capital Tel Aviv on Sunday evening. 
“We haven’t slept for days (due to) heat and shelling and rockets, the sound of aircrafts hovering above us... is terrifying,” Nour Abu Sultan, 29, said. 
Since Friday, Israel has carried out heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of Islamic Jihad positions in Gaza, with the latter firing hundreds of rockets in retaliation. 
Buildings have been reduced to rubble in Gaza, while Israelis have been forced to shelter from a barrage of rockets. 
Dalia Harel, a resident in the Israeli town of Sderot close to the Gaza border, said she was “disappointed” at news of a truce despite her five children being “traumatised”. 
“We’re tired of having a military operation every year,” she said. “We need our military and political leaders to get it over with once and for all...we’re not for war, but we can’t go on like this.” 
Islamic Jihad extended its barrage earlier on Sunday to fire two rockets targeting Jerusalem, but they were shot down by the Israeli army. 
The military has said the entire “senior leadership of the military wing of the Isla­mic Jihad in Gaza has been neutralised”. 
Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director general of the Shifa hospital in Gaza City, said medics were treating wounded people in a “very bad condition”, warning of dire shortages of drugs and fuel to run power generators. “Every minute we receive injured people,” he said earlier Sunday. 
The Gaza health ministry said 15 children were among the 41 dead. Eyewitnesses saw six bodies at the hospital there, including three minors.

1,Imran to spell out ‘counter-fascism’ strategy on Aug 13,"Says country is being ruled by a ""cabal of crooks and their handlers"".","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan on Sunday said that in order to counter the “fascist” government led by coalition parties, he will announce a strategy to “counter this fascism” during a rally at Islamabad’s Parade Ground on August 13.
In a tweet, the former premier said “every era has its Yazids”. He equated fascism with Yazidiat and termed the rulers as present-day Yazids.
He said Pakistan is facing fascism today in the form of rule by a “cabal of crooks and their handlers” brought to power through US regime change conspiracy. “Will our people bow down before this conspiracy in fear or, as a nation, face up to the challenge?” he asked.

 





 

Says country is being ruled by a ‘cabal of crooks and their handlers’

The decision to organise what Mr Khan termed ‘Azadi March’ a day before Independence Day was taken by the PTI leadership on Aug 6.
In a comment on the upcoming gathering at Parade Ground, PTI leader Ali Awan claimed that the public meeting on Aug 13 will pave the way for “true independence”. 
Speaking to the members of regional advisory council in Islamabad, he claimed that it will be for the third time in the history of Islamabad that Parade Ground will be “completely filled” with people. “Every time only PTI has made it possible,” he added. 
Commenting on the decision by the party chairman that he will contest by-elections on all nine seats, Mr Awan said that the former prime minister has proved that he can fight against all his opponents alone. 
“Opponents don’t have the courage to face Imran Khan and now they have been trying to find technical reasons to stop him from contesting [elections] on nine seats. We are confident that Imran Khan will win all the nine seats and make a record in the history of Pakistan,” he said.

2,Muslims in New Mexico's Albuquerque urged not to walk alone at night,Police ask citizens to share any tips they may have about 4 recent murders that are being treated as hate crimes against Muslims.,"WASHINGTON: Police in the New Mexico city of Albuquerque urged citizens on Sunday to share any tips they may have about four recent murders that police are treating as hate crimes against Muslims. 
In a separate message, the Islamic Center of New Mexico (ICNM) urged Muslims in Albuqu­erque on Monday to avoid walking alone at night and to make sure they are not followed to their homes. 
A local newspaper, Albuquerque Journal, reported that “people are beginning to panic” after the fourth murder. All four victims are of Pakistani and Afghan descent. 
“We urge everyone to take precautions and be aware of your surroundings including making sure that you are not being followed home and avoid walking alone at night,” the ICNM community message said. “This is especially true for our members living in the southeast part of the city where these killings have taken place.” 
The Albuquerque Police Depart­ment (APD) said their homicide detectives were investigating an overnight murder of a Muslim man that might be linked to three similar murders in the area. The FBI is assisting them in the investigation. 
On Friday, just before midnight, APD officers in the southeast area responded to reports of a shooting in the area of Truman Street and Grand Avenue NE. An adult male was located and found to be dead. 
According to investigators, the victim, Naeem Hussain, believed to be in his mid-20s, is Muslim and a native from South Asia. They believe Friday’s murder may be connected to the recent murder of three Muslim men, also from South Asia. 
Detectives on Thursday determined there’s a connection between the Aug 1 murder of Muhammad Afzal Hussain, 27, and the July 26 murder of Aftab Hussein, 41. “Both men are Muslim and are from Pakistan,” police said. They were killed in southeast Albuquerque near Central Avenue.  
As a result of these murders, detectives are now trying to determine whether the Nov 7, 2021, murder of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim from Afghanistan, is also related to more recent homicides. Ahmadi was killed outside of a business he and his brother ran at 1401 San Mateo Blvd NW. 
Anyone with tips about these murders is urged to call Albuquerque Metro Crime Stoppers at 505-843-STOP (7867). 
The ICNM online message page said they have held several meetings with city and state officials and law enforcement agencies. “Every­one is working diligently to ensure that Muslims in our city remain safe and that the criminals are brought to justice,” the message added. 
ICNM officials said they have shared with the police “whatever tips and information we had.” 
The 2022 report by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) pointed out that in recent years, anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States has spiked. 
“Existing and proposed mosque sites across the country have been targeted for vandalism and other criminal acts, and there have been efforts to block or deny necessary zoning permits for the construction and expansion of other facilities,” the report said. 
Tahir Gauba, ICNM’s director of public affairs, said the local Muslim community — especially students who live near the area where two most recent shootings happened — “is feeling very afraid”. 
At a Saturday afternoon news conference at APD headquarters, city and police officials denounced the violence and assured the community that they were working together and devoting every possible resource to the investigation, Albuquerque Journal reported. 
“We urge our entire interfaith community of Albuquerque and all the people of Albuquerque to help law enforcement identify and catch the person or persons responsible,” said Michelle Melendez, the office’s director. “Please, please, call with any bit of information.” 
Deputy Chief Josh Brown, with APD’s Field Services Bureau, said the department was consulting its partners in the Muslim community to determine what they need and where they’re most vulnerable when deciding where to put its resources.
Their remarks were translated into Arabic, Farsi, Dari and Urdu.

3,"Russia, Ukraine trade blame for strike on nuclear plant","MOSCOW/KYIV: Moscow and Kyiv on Sunday blamed each other for a new strike on the Zaporizhzhia atomic power plant,...","MOSCOW/KYIV: Moscow and Kyiv on Sunday blamed each other for a new strike on the Zaporizhzhia atomic power plant, where recent fighting sparked a UN warning of a potential nuclear disaster.
Zaporizhzhia — Europe’s largest atomic power complex that was occupied by Russia early in its offensive — has in recent days been the scene of military strikes that have damaged several structures, forcing the shutdown of a reactor.
With Russia and Ukraine blaming each other for the attacks, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the Inter­national Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) warned on Saturday of  “the very real risk of a nuclear disaster”.
On Sunday, Russian occupation authorities in Energodar city where the plant is located said that overnight  “the Ukrainian army carried out an attack with a cluster bomb fired from an Uragan rocket launcher.” The projectiles fell  “within 400 metres of a working reactor,” Russia’s TASS state news agency quoted them as saying.
The strike damaged some administrative buildings and fell in a  “zone storing used nuclear fuel”.
However Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom that operates the plant said the  “Russian military keeps committing acts of nuclear terrorism” at the site.
“Yesterday ... the Russian occupiers once again fired rockets at the site of the Zapori­zhzhya nuclear power plant and the town of Ener­hodar,” a company statement said.
“One... employee was hospitalised with shrapnel wounds caused by the explosion,” it added. The company accused the Russians of aiming at spent fuel casks, which are stored in the open near the site of shelling.
“Three radiation monitoring detectors around the ... site were damaged,” the statement said adding that as a result radiation detection was impossible.Energ­o­atom had on Saturday said strikes on Friday had  “caused a serious risk for the safe operation of the plant”, damaging a power cable andforcing the shutdown of one of the reactors.
The operator on Sunday called for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the site and for it to be declared a demilitarised zone.
More grain sets sail
Four  more ships loaded with grain set off from Ukrainian ports on Sunday as  Moscow and Kyiv blamed each other for a new strike at a  Russian-occupied nuclear plant. Kyiv’s infrastructure ministry wrote on  Telegram that a second convoy of Ukra­inian supplies had just left,  three from Chornomorsk and one from Odessa.
It said the Mustafa  Necati, the Star Helena, the Glory and the Riva Wind were carrying   “around 170,000 tonnes of agriculture-related merchandise”.
Amnesty regrets report
Amnesty International apologised on Sunday for  “distress and anger”  caused by a report accusing Ukr­aine of endangering civilians which  infuriated Presi­dent Volodymyr Zelen­skiy and triggered the resignation  of its Kviy office head.
The rights group published the report on  Thurs­day saying the presence of Ukrainian troops in residential areas  heightened risks to civilians during Russia’s invasion.

4,Thousands trapped in China’s tourism hotspot,"Over 80,000 tourists stranded in resort city after a Covid flare-up leads authorities to impose strict travel restrictions.","BEIJING: Over 80,000 tourists are stranded in a resort city popularly known as “China’s Hawaii” after a Covid flare-up led authorities to impose strict travel restrictions. 
Tourism hotspot Sanya is a city of more than a million people on the southern island of Hainan, where 483 Covid cases were reported on Sunday. All flights out of the city were cancelled over the weekend, with authorities also halting train ticket sales. 
Tourists who want to leave must test negative in five PCR tests over seven days, health authorities said. Hotels in the city have been asked to offer guests a 50 per cent discount until the travel restrictions ease, an official said during a news briefing on Saturday. 
China is the only major economy still holding fast to a zero-Covid strategy with snap lockdowns and long quarantines, battering local tourism. 
The country’s borders have also remained largely closed since early 2020, halting international tourism. 
The latest Covid outbreak comes during peak tourism season in Sanya, a popular surfing spot. 
All entertainment venues including spas, karaoke bars and pubs have been closed since last week, but essential services such as supermarkets and pharmacies remain open.

5,Flight tracking exposure irks ‘billionaires and baddies’,Websites and Twitter accounts offer real-time views of air traffic — and sometimes major news like Pelosi’s Taiwan trip.,"WASHINGTON: How to upset Russian freight companies, Elon Musk, Chinese authorities and Kylie Jenner in one go? Track their jets. 
Flight following websites and Twitter accounts offer real-time views of air traffic — and sometimes major news like Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan trip — but that expo­­sure draws pushback ranging from complaints to gear seizures. 
Whether Russian air freight firms, Saudi Arabian plane owners or others, Dan Str­eufert said his group gets dozens of “requ­ests” each year to stop posting aircrafts’ whereabouts. 
“We have not removed anything so far. This is all public information. And I don’t want to be the arbiter of who’s right and who’s wrong,” added Streufert, founder of the US-based flight tracking site ADS-B Exchange. 

Websites and Twitter accounts offer real-time views of air traffic — and sometimes major news like Pelosi’s Taiwan trip

Limits do apply in some cases, but groups that piece together the flight paths note that the core information source is legally available and open to anyone with the right gear. 
US rules require planes in designated areas be equipped with ADS-B technology that broadcasts aircraft positions using signals that relatively simple equipment can pick up. 
A service like Sweden-based Flightradar24 has 34,000, mostly volunteer-operated receivers around the world to pick up the signals, a key source of information that’s routed back to a central network and combined with data on flight schedules and aircraft information. 
Figuring out or confirming to whom a plane actually belongs can require some sleuthing, said jet tracker Jack Sweeney, who filed a public records request with the US government that yielded a form bearing the signature of a particular plane’s owner: Tesla boss Elon Musk. 
Sweeney has gotten quite a bit of attention with his Twitter account that tracks the movements of the billionaire’s plane and even rejected Musk’s offer of $5,000 to shut down @ElonJet, which has over 480,000 followers. 
“There’s so much traction, I’m doing something right. The celebrity thing — people like seeing what celebrities are doing, that and the whole emissions thing,” he told AFP, referring to concerns over the planes’ greenhouse gas impact. 
“Putting it on Twitter makes it easier for people to access and understand,” Sweeney added. 
‘We will track anything’ 
Another of Sweeney’s Twitter accounts, powered by data from ADS-B Exchange, showed in July that US model and celebrity Kylie Jenner’s plane took a flight in California that lasted just 17 minutes. 

 





 
The internet was not pleased and she faced a torrent of criticism on social media over concerns about the message it sent regarding climate change. 
“They tell us working class people to feel bad about our once a year flight to a much needed vacation while these celebs take private jets every other day as if it’s an Uber,” tweeted @juliphoria, in an example of the outrage. 
Neither Sweeney nor Streufert evoked a distinct redline they were concerned could be crossed by publishing the flight data. 
“We will track anything because honestly, if somebody really was a bad actor, and they wanted to know where this stuff is, you can build the electronics for $100 and just deploy receivers to pick up the same signals yourself,” said Streufert from ADS-B Exchange. 
The services’ information  has significant potential for impact far beyond embarrassment of celebrities or the rankling of billionaires.
For example, ADS-B Exch­a­nge’s data was cited in a non-profit group’s report alleging Eur­ope’s border agency Frontex wor­ked to prevent migrants from crossing the Mediterranean, while US media used it to show sur­veillance planes flew over racial justice protests in Washington in 2020.
