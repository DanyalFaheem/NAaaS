0,Distance-based fares sought for Orange Line train,Transport operators in May raised fares by 20pc on all intercity and intracity routes across Punjab.,"LAHORE: The Punjab Masstransit Authority (PMA) has urged the government to allow it to introduce a distance-based fare for travelling by the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train keeping in view massive surge in the administrative and operational expenses.  
The authority also plans to revive a summary it had already tabled before the cabinet of last Punjab government led by Hamza Shehbaz Sharif, Dawn has learnt. 
“In fact, the authority had first taken up this matter with the Buzdar-led PTI government, explaining that the orange line train fares immediately need to be rationalised by abolishing the flat fare system. The authority had also proposed introduction of a distance-based fare from Rs20 to 40 (Rs20 stop to stop and increase gradually with distance) on over 27km-long route of the orange line starting from Dera Gujjaran to Ali Town via GT Road, Lakshami, GPO, Anarkali, Chauburji, Multan Road and Raiwind Road,” a senior official told Dawn on Sunday. 
The official said the Buzdar government had agreed to increase it to take out the PMA from increasing financial burden. But it couldn’t do so after a change in the government. After formation of the new government led by Hamza Shehbaz, the authority took up this issue with it. And finally this government asked the PMA to table a summary to the provincial cabinet through the transport department.  
“We prepared a summary seeking introduction of a stop-to-stop fare of Rs20 and sent it to the transport department for onward submission to the cabinet. The department after going through it tabled it before the then cabinet,” the official maintained, adding that the cabinet couldn’t take any decision.  
He said the PMA had now decided to brief the new transport minister on its roles and responsibilities besides requesting him to get this summary approved by the new cabinet.  
The PMA, according to the provincial government, is a statutory body established with the purpose of planning, construction, operation and maintenance of mass transit systems in the major cities of the province for providing safe, efficient and comfortable urban transportation system.  
Since the authority is supposed to focus on planning, contracting of services and oversight of contracts/operations, it, under the existing operational model, has outsourced all of its operation and maintenance services to tap the private sector efficiency.  
“Increase or rationalising or introduction of a distance-based fare has been initially proposed for the orange line alone under phase-1. The same fare model may also be applied to the Lahore, Rawalpindi-Islamabad and Multan Metro Bus systems and the Speedo bus service in Lahore and Multan under phase-2,” the official hinted.  
The transport operators in May raised fares by 20 per cent on all intercity and intracity routes across the province after first increase in the POL prices was made by Shehbaz-led government. Pakistan Railways (PR), later, also increased fares on all passenger and freight trains by 10 to 20 per cent with effect from June 1. The PMA also worked out a proposal seeking rationalisation of fare of the orange line keeping in view the increasing electricity cost but it is yet to be approved by the government.

More than 10,000 police officers will perform security duties on Muharram nine and 10 and the Punjab government also imposed a ban on pillion riding during Ashura.
Furthermore, mobile phone service will be suspended on the routes of the main processions on Ashur day at specific times and the program organizers have been directed to ensure adherence to the code of conduct, route and timings
Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Ghulam Mehmood said more than 10,000 policemen, including 14 SPs, 40 DSPs, 99 inspectors, 810 upper subordinates along with 370 female police personnel and anti-riot force would perform duty on Youm-i-Ashur to provide foolproof security to the mourners of majalis and processions as well as citizens.
More than 125 mourning processions and 600 Majalis would be held on Muharram nine and 10. As many as 3,868 Majalis and 460 mourning processions would be held during Ashura, whereas there are 5,235 majalis and 650 mourning processions in the complete month of Muharram.

6,Roadside vendors bear the brunt of traffic load management drive,"LAHORE: “I’ve suffered huge losses multiple times because the metropolitan corporation teams suddenly appear,...","LAHORE: “I’ve suffered huge losses multiple times because the metropolitan corporation teams suddenly appear, remove my counter from outside the shop, destroy it and don’t even compensate for it. I’ve to first pay a fine to get its remains back from the corporation and then get it fixed, all of which takes days during which my business remains closed and costs me around Rs12,000. I don’t even make this much money a month,” lamented Amjad, a roadside fast food vendor in the Chah Miran area.
Amjad is one of many such vendors and pushcart owners who have had their infrastructure removed during the joint ‘traffic load management’ drive of the Metropolitan Corporation Lahore (MCL) along with traffic police, Lahore Development Authority and other departments under way over the past few months on 24 major roads of the city.
While the authorities claim their only objective is to ensure smooth flow of traffic and they would remove anything that hampers vehicular movement, most of the affectees are small vendors who don’t own proper shops and only rely on their makeshift counters, kiosks, stalls and carts to eke out a living. Once these are snatched from them, they do everything in their limited means to resume business.
Amjad says the anti-encroachment teams never warn or issue prior notices.
“My counter was just a few inches over the footpath, still they picked it up and smashed it. I have no other source of income so I had to pay the fine, get its pieces back and have it repaired,” he says.
A lemon soda seller in the Thokar Niaz Baig area has a similar tale to tell.
“All of us in the area got our counters back after paying fines between Rs2,000 and Rs5,000 and resumed our business at the same spot,” says Zeeshan, also speaking for the halwa puri, gol gappay and other vendors around him.
When asked if they have any objection to moving away from the roadsides to dedicated spots, he says it’s not about alternate locations.
“They bother us everywhere. These officials only want money no matter where we set up our stalls. When they run out of money, they look for setups to raid on. They even take monthly bribe from us on the pretext of sparing us the raids, yet remove our counters. Even traffic isn’t an issue. We have wide roads in Lahore; it’s all about money,” the vendor tries to make a case for him.
Roadside vendors and pushcart owners in Mughalpura, The Mall and Lakshmi Chowk all resumed their activities at their original locations after paying a few thousands in fine just a couple of days after their setups were removed by the administration. These ordeals raise multiple questions – the efficacy of such drives; absence of dedicated spaces for these low-income traders where they don’t create ‘traffic nuisance’, as the authorities claim; need to create awareness among them; lack of urban planning and an encroachment policy, and standardised times for roadside businesses among others.
While the local administration says it doesn’t want to disturb the roadside business in a country where social welfare is booming and would rather adjust them appropriately, development experts say city management and not master planning is urgently required.
Ali Abbas Bukhari, the chief metropolitan officer, tells Dawn no poor person has been targeted but only illegal parking and bus stands, stalls and construction material shops. As for roadside vendors, only those that create repeated traffic nuisance are removed.
“First we surveyed illegal parking stands on each road, and then removed them, registered cases against shopkeepers, and also sealed many shops. Since it’s a traffic load management drive, anything that hampers smooth flow will be removed, and we have somewhat succeeded in our target on the 24 roads we selected but it’s a continuous process.”
When asked if roadside vendors could be allocated a particular space where they can smoothly operate from without hindering traffic flow, he says fancy model pushcarts for Rs50,000 each have been designed with the help of philanthropists.
“Footpaths should be cleared either way and timings could be assigned to them to begin their activities in the evening, as our regulations say. We have set up 50 so far at five spots and will gradually replace the remaining also as is the practice around the world. We have tried to model some markets on this pattern, including Moon Market in Iqbal Town and Gulshan-i-Ravi, and plan to replicate this in other markets. This is just the beginning because there must be around 3,000-4,000 such vendors around Lahore,” he explained.
An MCL official, who didn’t want to be named, admits that besides fines, the vendors pay monthly bribe to the corporation officials and, in many cases, the shopkeepers and residences outside which these counters are set up are also involved as well as area unions.
“Besides, if all traffic wardens deputed in an area perform their duties, half the problems will be solved,” he remarked.
Noted economist and vice chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, Dr Nadeemul Haque, is of the idea that master planning of cities is nonsense and it’s just a way for consultants to make money. In the absence of many facilities like spaces for walking and cycling to cut down on pollution, what’s needed is city management.
“Master planners decide how you and I are going to live; nobody can decide that because if cities can be planned, so can the countries. There’s a shortage of all kinds of facilities but loads of space for cars and then we say kiosks and counters or tables and chairs outside a small hotel are encroachments. What we need is city management. They need to manage their own services and the way they work, and not manage people,” he asserts.
Mr Haque tells Dawn the administrators need to “let our cities grow upwards, let people have flats” because, he believes, Lahore will be unlivable in six months because of pollution.
“They have made it a ‘car city’ because of which we can’t have roadside vendors. We need sidewalks, walking tracks, cycle friendly roads, kiosks etc.”

7,Punjab notes: Baba Farid’s legacy: distortion and subversion,Baba Farid (1188-1280 AD) is the first major poet of contemporary Punjabi language who is undisputedly accepted as a...,"Baba Farid (1188-1280 AD) is the first major poet of contemporary Punjabi language who is undisputedly accepted as a trailblazer.
He composed ‘Shlokas’/couplets) which have proved to be inexhaustible source of inspiration for all poets to come. ‘Shloka’ is an ancient poetic genre first introduced by sage Valmiki, the immortal author of Ramayana. It’s reported that when Valmiki had heard and learnt the oral story of the Lord Rama, he went to a river for a dip. He saw a pair of mating cranes in an ecstasy singing and dancing. A Nishada hunter killed the male crane with his deadly arrow. The female finding her partner bloodied writhing on the ground incessantly cried. Valmiki overwhelmed by compassion thought that killing a singing bird in the act of mating was not dharma. Moved by the cries of female crane, he spontaneously cursed the hunter: “Nishada, you would never be able to find peace because you shot down the male of the pair who had a surge of desire.” Suddenly Valmiki felt that he had spoken in verse and in a meter that he called Shloka. It was called Shloka because he uttered it in sorrow (shoka). The happening inspired him to compose his Ramayana. The word ‘Shoka/ shok’ in in the meaning of sorrow and grief is found in Zend / Avista and Persian languages as ‘Sog’.  
In Punjabi, we also use ‘Sog’ for mourning, sorrow and grief. It implies that genre of Shloka is meant for serious and thoughtful and thought-provoking poetry. Baba Farid’s Shlokas are austere but carry multiple layers of rich meanings which provoke and challenge the readers. Simplicity is simply deceptive. Had another great sage not collected his verses, they perhaps would have been lost.  
It was Baba Guru Nanak who collected and collated the poetry of great poets and saints including that of Baba Farid which later became an integral part of holy Sikh scripture ‘Guru Granth Sahib’ and got preserved for all times to come.
Spiritual vision coupled with concrete and mundane experiences permeate his poetic world as expressed in his verses. He emphatically stresses the virtues of simple life i.e. demanding and accepting as much as is genuinely needed for human life. Less is as detrimental to human growth as is more. Less leads to human impoverishment and more to waste of human and natural resources. While living a very austere life, he never forgets to emphasise the role of economic needs in human society and the importance of sharing. So much so that he declares that Islamic faith has six tenets, not five. The sixth one is roti which means food, provisions signifying the fulfillment of economic needs of an individual. And it is declared by a man who survives on the bare minimum out of his choice. His unequivocal stance on class oppression is loud and clear. See how his symbolism juxtaposes the deprivation of the masses with the life of indulgence of the elite: “Farida, roti maeri kaath di, laavan maeri bhukh / Jinhaan khaadi chopri, ghaney sahin gay dukh (O Farid, wood is my bread, hunger for curry I’ve got / Those who ‘ve eaten it rich, dense pains their lot (Trans: Muzzaffar Ghaffaar).”  
He unambiguously stands against exploitation and firmly sides with the oppressed. He debunks and denounces the oppressors who make life miserable for the people. It’s people who work hard, produce and create. He exposes the parasitic landlords and plunderers. “O Farid, these stalks being cooked though sugar-coated are poison / Some dropped dead toiling, some laid waste the crops” he says.  
Farmer traditionally has been the target of landlords, plunderers and invaders in our part of the world as he was the major producer of the surplus in pre-industrial age. The bulk of economy comprised agricultural products and livestock. The dichotomy was that who produced most was the most deprived as each powerful segment of society wanted its pound of flesh from the peasant.  
Another couplet says: “O Farid, some have measureless flour, some not even salt / Going ahead they’ll sense, who will bear the assault (Trans: Muzzaffar Ghaffaar).” 
He was as bold as a priest in medieval Europe who addressing a gathering of aristocrats said: “Gentlemen, you are not thieves but what you eat is fruit of theft.” One of Baba Farid’s disciples who had gone to eastern part of India after his studies, wrote him a letter with the request that he be guided as to how to conduct his affairs. The master replied that his (disciple’s) studies would provide the guidance. However, he wrote, he knew one thing: “A scholar’s knowledge drops dead when he knocks at a rich man’s door.” Now his descendants and custodians of his shrines stand for the values and practice a way of life which contradict what the sage upheld and practiced. One wonders how with the passage of time the legacy of a poet and sage who aligned himself with the people’s position has turned into its opposite? This sadly has happened with all others who had similar kind of worldview. The shrine is now a sanctuary that breeds superstition like other innumerable shrines that dot the country’s landscape. People, rich and poor, in search of a magical solution of their problems, visit the shrine of a man who exhorted: “You shriek O Farid, shriek like the keeper of the maize /Until the harvest ripens, shriek till then raise.” He points to the critical role consciousness and self-awareness play in the human growth. But now non-existent mysterious forces are touted as an arbiter of human destiny. The reasons for the decay are not unfathomable. Sage’s grave became a sacred shrine revered by common people he identified with all his life. For the custodians and descendants, it became an undying source of unearned income; people would make offerings in shape of money. The elite in order to be seen pious offered - still offers - lands and expensive gifts making the caretakers and their families rich and a part of the ruling segment. So the class concern of rich and powerful has blunted the revolutionary edge of Baba Farid’s vision; it’s subversion of the sublime and the mundane found in his creative expression. Consequently, the stress is on the rituals performed at the shrine, not on his poetry which is undoubtedly a beacon of hope for the wretched of the earth. — soofi01@hotmail.com

“Lack of democracy within political parties is turning them into family-owned enterprises and is failing to provide training platforms to the workers for a democratic setup at national level,” observes former National Assembly speaker Chaudhry Amir Hussain at a sitting of the National Public Forum, a political think-tank, here on Sunday.
He stressed that there should be internal democracy in the parties for establishing a model democracy in the country.
He urged that the armed forces should neither be discussed unnecessarily nor these should be dragged into political affairs.
Participants of the forum, in a joint declaration, demanded that all parliamentary forces should immediately initiate a dialogue to steer the country out of the worst economic and political crises it is facing.
The meeting also strongly condemned the negative social media campaign going on in the wake of the Lasbela helicopter incident.
Lt-Gen (retired) Ghulam Mustafa said that CPEC projects would have to be made 100 percent functional for retiring national debt. 
Forum Chairman Mian Manzoor Ahmed Wattoo said it was painful to see that political, democratic leaders were not ready even to shake hands with each other. “Who would run the country if the situation sustained,” he asked.
He said the Turks laid down under the tanks to protect democracy only because the political leadership of Turkiye enjoyed their trust.
Columnist Hafeezullah Niazi said the root cause of each issue was political instability.
Senior journalist Suhail Warraich said he along with Mujeebur Rehman Shami had met with Imran Khan before the recent political change in Punjab and that he found the PTI chairman positive about talks with political rivals.

Speaking at the occasion, he said the junior staff failed to implement the orders of the district administration. He informed Dawn that one month back, he had submitted different applications to Commissioner Salwat Saeed and the district administration for cleaning the route but no action was taken. He said he called on District Police Officer Sadiq Baloch also and asked for his favour.

14,Ahsan Iqbal predicts improved economy as rupee recovers,Says govt to complete term as polls impossible before next August.,"NAROWAL: Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal says the value of rupee is recovering fast against US dollar and the economy will improve in the next few months. 
“The government’s first priority is to stabilise the country’s economy and all institutions are working on one platform to strengthen it,” he declared while talking to the media in tehsil Shakargarh on Sunday. 
Mr Iqbal said the government would complete its term to fulfill the constitutional requirements.  
“If we go for elections immediately, there will be uncertainty in the country for the next four months. Three months will be spent in the election and one month in the formation of the government.” 
The federal minister said the process of new census had started and it would be completed by February 2023. He said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) needed four months to make new constituencies under the new census and the entire process would be completed by August 2023. He said all the political parties, especially of the Sindh province, were of the opinion that the upcoming elections should be held according to the new census. He declared that the federal government would complete its term to fulfill constitutional requirements.  

Says govt to complete term as polls impossible before next August

Ahsan Iqbal claimed that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government had left the country on the brink of destruction. Just 10 days before the start of the coalition government, he said, the former ministry of finance had announced that the country did not have enough money for installments of development budgets, which meant that the country’s treasury was empty and there were fears that Pakistan would default like Sri Lanka within days or weeks.  
“Today no one is saying that Pakistan is going to become Sri Lanka. The rupee which Imran Khan’s government had left on the slope in its last days is going to strengthen. In a few days, the rupee has restored its value against the dollar.” 
Mr Iqbal said that during the next few months, Pakistan’s economy would become stronger with further improvement.  
He said that all institutions, including the administrative machinery, the parliament, federal cabinet and the army, were playing their role equally in the country. He expressed hope that all would get Pakistan out of trouble and put the country back on the path of development with joint efforts.  
Ahsan Iqbal asked whether the man who committed corruption of billions of rupees, betrayed the people’s trust, took funding from the enemies of the country, made deals on the China Pakistan Economic Corridor and Kashmir with external funding and spread chaos in the country was worthy of following. He said the MNAs and MPAs of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had taken oaths of allegiance to the Constitution of Pakistan but not of personal loyalty to Imran Khan.  
Referring to Imran Khan, the minister declared that the man who disobeyed the Constitution and law of the country was not worthy to be supported.
