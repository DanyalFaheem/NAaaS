1,Inglis double sees NZ stun Pakistan 4-1,"Once Hugo Inglis scored a quickfire double in the second quarter for New Zealand, there was no way back for Pakistan.","BIRMINGHAM: Pakistan’s hopes of getting closer to a semi-final berth took a hit when they were stunned 4-1 by New Zealand in their second Pool ‘A’ game of the Commonwealth Games hockey tournament on Sunday.
Once Hugo Inglis scored a quickfire double in the second quarter for New Zealand, there was no way back for Pakistan, who opened their campaign with a 2-2 draw against South Africa on Saturday.
With the top two sides from each of the two pools advancing to the last four, Pakistan now need to win their remaining two matches against Scotland and Australia to go through.
Six-time champions Australia got their campaign off to a flyer with a 12-0 dismantling of Scotland, who had drawn 5-5 with New Zealand on Saturday.
With defender Mubashar Ali suffering from a blow to the head during the match against South Africa and being cautiously used, New Zealand were able to exploit Pakistan’s defensive fragility to get a crucial victory.
Pakistan manager Sameer Hussain said the team needed to pick itself up for the remaining matches.
“Our defence was not at its best today due to Mubashar’s injury. We were compelled to rest him time and again during the match and send his replacements as he was not fully fit,” Sameer told APP.
“We also missed our chances to score goals. Yesterday, we played our first game and today the second one. But there are no excuses for it as we needed to win this match.
“New Zealand put us on the back foot in the second quarter and we could not really get back into it. We were not at our best today. We have to accept that. We will pick ourselves up and try to win the next two matches to qualify for the semi-finals.”
After a goalless first quarter, Inglis scored back-to-back goals in the 17th and 18th minutes for New Zealand. Pakistan got back into the contest when Ghazanfar Ali netted a splendid field goal just before the halftime whistle.
New Zealand, however, made sure of the result when Dylan Thomas got their third in the 43rd before Sam Lone put the icing on the cake when he made it 4-1 in the final minute of the match.

2,Pakistan crushed by ruthless India in must-win clash,Skipper Bismah Maroof’s decision to bat first backfires as Indian bowlers put the choke on Pakistan batters.,"BIRMINGHAM: Pakistan women suffered their second consecutive loss at the Commonwealth Games as their arch-rivals India put up a ruthless performance to win their much-anticpated clash by eight wickets at Edgbaston on Sunday.
Skipper Bismah Maroof’s decision to bat first backfired as Indian bowlers put the choke on the Pakistan batters to bowl them out for a meagre 99 after a rain delay reduced the match to 18 overs per innings.
Indian spinners Sneh Rana and Radha Yadav stood out with two wickets each.
The chase was clinical too with Smriti Mandhana (63 not out off 42 balls), arguably the most attractive batter in women’s cricket, flaunting her range of strokes on way to a fine unbeaten half century.
The result was India gunned down the target in just 11.4 overs, two days after Pakistan lost to Barbados by 15 runs.
Having both lost their Games opener India and Pakistan arrived at the stadium knowing another defeat would just about end any medal hopes, putting more weight on a fixture that never needs any.
“Whenever we get the opportunity to play against Pakistan we always want to do well,” said India’s Harmanpreet Kaur. “This game was very important to win, not just because it was Pakistan.”
India can clinch a semi-final spot with a win over Barbados in their final Group ‘A’ match on Wednesday while Pakistan need victory over Australia and plenty of help in the tiebreaker scenarios to keep their slim hopes of advancing.
Mandhana’s special effort comprised three sixes, including a step out hit off spinner Tuba Hassan for her half-century. A seemingly effortless loft over cover of pacer Diana Baig in the third over was also of the highest quality.
It was the second time this year that an Indo-Pak contest failed to produce a close game with India winning comfortably against their opponents even in the 50-over World Cup in New Zealand.
Renuka Singh, who bowled a dream spell in a losing cause against Australia, started with a rare maiden in the T20 format.
Three balls later, Pakistan were one down with no runs on the board as pacer Meghna Singh induced an outside edge off opener Iram Javed’s bat with a ball that shaped away.
Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur went for the extra all-rounder in the playing eleven, bringing in Sneh Rana at the expense of spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad.
Rana made instant impact by removing a well set Muneeba Ali (32) and Bismah (17).
Muneeba played some bold strokes in her 30-ball effort, including a six with a slog sweep off S Meghna. Bismah perished while trying to sweep while Muneeba got beaten by the flight and offered a catch back to Rana.
Renuka made it 64 for four in the 12th over by getting rid of Ayesha Nadeem.
Even India opener Shafali Verma rolled her arm over and got a wicket of a sharp return catch.
Pakistan tried but were not able to break free from the shackles and ended up with a below par total.
FANS FIND COMMON GROUND
In the stands, Pakistan and India fans mingled during the clash, with supporters hailing the occasion as a chance to increase harmony.
While the India and Pakistan rivalry is centred around men’s cricket, the women fully understand its significance and their increasing role in it.
With Birmingham recognised as one of Britain’s most diverse cities with large Indian and Pakistani communities the crowd at the Edgbaston oval was the largest of the tournament.
The atmosphere outside the ground on a drizzly morning was more family outing than the hysteria that usually follows a men’s meeting as fathers and mothers with children in tow soaked up the fun.
“It’s just a game at the end of the day but a good game,” summed up one father in an India jersey accompanied by four young girls.
The Pakistani fans impressed with their fancy dress one dressed in a “Mad Hatter “-style costume in the national colours and another wearing a superhero-style outfit with a shock of green hair.
Pharmaceutical consultant Rahul Vyas said the match at the Commonwealths — otherwise known as the “Friendly Games” — was “a wonderful place to increase love, harmony and peace”.
Vyas travelled from London with his two teenaged children and his sister.
To him, sporting clashes between Pakistan and India present an opportunity for engagement between the two sets of supporters.
“This can be a uniting force,” the 47-year-old told the AFP news agency.
“If I cannot interact with my Pakistani friends how will I be friends with them? 
“This is a great opportunity today — look at that Pakistani boy, he is around the same age as my son.
“They both have the same passion for cricket, too many things are there for the basis of a friendship.” He added:  “There are certain things our two countries are fighting over but let others deal with political issues.
“Us normal Indian and Pakistani people we can form the roots of a bigger friendship through cricket.”
The occasion was not lost on the players or the fans, the cheering was loud and constant.
At the conclusion no one was leaving Egbaston and setting themselves on fire, as distraught fans have done in the past when results have not gone their way, but the smiles on the faces of India supporters signalled their trip home was going to be a more up beat one.
“It is always a special feeling when you play against Pakistan but I would like to say it is just another game and not like, “ohhhh Pakistan”,” said Sneh Rana. “But it is a good game always. It is a special feeling.”

3,Three cyclists taken to hospital after serious crash at velodrome,LONDON: Three cyclists were taken to hospital after a serious crash during the second heat of the men’s scratch...,"LONDON: Three cyclists were taken to hospital after a serious crash during the second heat of the men’s scratch race at the Commonwealth Games on Sunday.
The remainder of the morning session was cancelled and spectators were asked to leave the velodrome after Team England’s Matt Walls and Isle of Man’s Matt Bostock were involved in the crash along with several other riders.
Walls was catapulted over the barriers and into the crowd at the Lee Valley VeloPark, the 24-year-old receiving treatment for more than 40 minutes before leaving in an ambulance.
Spectators were also hurt after Walls and his bike came over the top of the barriers on the high banking at a corner of the track.
“Following a crash at the morning session of track and para track cycling at the Lee Valley VeloPark, three cyclists and two spectators have been treated by the onsite medical team,” a Birmingham 2022 spokesperson said in a statement.
“The three cyclists have been taken to hospital. The two spectators did not require hospital treatment.”
Walls, the Olympic omnium champion competing in the men’s scratch qualifiers at the London venue, was trying to avoid riders who had fallen in a crash lower down the banking, but he clipped another wheel and went over the top.
Team England said in an update: “Matt is alert and talking -- as he has been throughout -- and is being given medical attention in hospital.”
Witnesses said that, because of the gradient of the banking, spectators in the front row had been unsighted for the crash.
One man received treatment for cuts to his arm while a young girl also received medical attention.
Canadian Derek Gee also surfed the top of the barrier but managed to avoid following Walls into the stands.
Bostock was taken to hospital with head and shoulder injuries while Canadian Mathias Guillemette was disqualified for causing the initial crash.
A total of eight riders went down on the last lap of the race, with medics and coaches immediately rushing to help.
An England coach climbed up the banks to reach Walls in the crowd.
The session resumed with the men’s sprint quarter-finals.
Most of the events at the Commonwealth Games are being held in Birmingham but the track cycling is taking place in London.

McKeon, 28, swam the anchor leg as Australia won the women’s 4x100 metres relay to put her alongside Ian Thorpe, Susie O’Neill and Leisel Jones on 10 gold medals.
“It’s nice to do that 10th one in a relay,” she told Australia’s Channel 7. “It’s kind of all a bit of a blur, I guess. It’s been over a long time. I mean my first one was 2014 and I was so young.”
Scotland’s Duncan Scott avenged his Olympic defeat at the hands of his friend Tom Dean.
Scott beat England’s Dean in a thrilling men’s 200m freestyle duel, pulling away from the Olympic champion in the final 50m to win in a time of 1min 45.02sec.
The 25-year-old returned to the pool to take bronze in the 400m individual medley behind New Zealand gold medallist Lewis Clareburt, who won in a time of 4:08.70.
South Africa’s Lara van Niekerk won the women’s 50m freestyle while compatriot Pieter Coetze triumphed in the men’s 100m backstroke.
New Zealand dominated the track cycling events at the Lee Valley VeloPark in London, winning three of the four titles on offer.
Aaron Gate won the men’s 4,000-metre pursuit, with compatriot Tom Sexton taking silver.
Bryony Botha won the women’s 3,000m individual pursuit and Ellesse Andrews took gold in the women’s sprint, beating Canada’s Olympic champion Kelsey Mitchell.
For both Gate and Andrews it was their second gold of the Games.
“My grandma and my grandad love coming to watch racing,” said Andrews. “This is my first elite result in front of them because they weren’t able to come to Tokyo [Olympics].
“To be able to go and give them a big cuddle afterwards, I can’t even explain how special that is.”
Gate and Andrews had waited just 24 hours to add to their gold collection -- a blink of an eye compared to the 56 years it has taken a Trinidad and Tobago athlete to stand on top of the track cycling podium.
Nicholas Paul, 23, was the man to end the long wait since Roger Gibbon won two gold medals in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1966, storming home to win the keirin.
“To be able to race in London again, go to my second Commonwealth Games and to earn a gold medal is unbelievable,” he said.
Hosts England, lifted by vociferous home support, won the women’s team gymnastics title to go with their triumph in the men’s event.
But the support was not just for English athletes as Indian weightlifter Mirabai Chanu found to her surprise as she won the 49kg category for her second successive title.
“Every athlete wants the crowd to back them and roar for them and I was taken aback that there was such a huge Indian presence in Birmingham,” she said. “They were roaring their lungs out for me, and it pepped me on.”

LEIPZIG: German champions Bayern Munich survived a late comeback from RB Leipzig to claim a 5-3 victory in the German Super Cup on Saturday with an impressive first half attacking display and new signing Sadio Mane scoring on his debut.
Bayern, aiming for an 11th consecutive Bundesliga title this season, were eager to prove they remained a serious attacking threat despite the departure of top striker Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona, and they did not have to wait long.
They scored three times before the break through Jamal Musiala, Mane and Benjamin Pavard to take control of the game.Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann insisted his team deserved the victory. 
“We did very well in the first half but from the 60th minute you could see that we were running out of steam,” he said.  “We’ve only been in training for 19 days, you shouldn’t forget that. We deserved to win, there’s no question about that.” Musiala rifled in the opener in the 14th minute before Serge Gnabry cut through the Leipzig defence and delivered a perfect assist for Senegal international Mane to tap in the second goal in the 31st.
Leipzig’s collapse looked complete in first half stoppage time when Musiala weaved his way into the box and set up Pavard to drill the ball home.
Bayern’s backline was equally as effective in the first half with Leipzig having just one shot on goal in 45 minutes.
That all changed after the break with the hosts hitting the woodwork in the 56th minute with substitute Andre Silva’s powerful header before Marcel Halstenberg went one better with his own header three minutes later to cut the deficit.
Serge Gnabry briefly restored Bayern’s three-goal cushion when he fired into the top of the net on the rebound after Thomas Mueller’s shot was palmed away by keeper Peter Gulacsi.
A 77th minute penalty by Christopher Nkunku made it 4-2 before Leipzig team-mate Dani Olmo scored with a powerful shot to set up a nervous finale to an entertaining encounter.
However, late substitute Leroy Sane made sure of the first title of the season for Bayern, scoring on the break with the last kick of the game. The Bundesliga season kicks off on Aug 5.

Opening batsman Hendricks made 70 and Markram an unbeaten 51 in a total of 191-5, with recalled left-arm quick David Willey leading England’s attack with 3-25 in Southampton.
England are bidding to win their first series under new white-ball skipper Jos Buttler after South Africa levelled this three-match contest with a 58-run victory in Cardiff.
The decision to recall Willey in place of Richard Gleeson reaped an early reward when he had potential dangerman Quinton de Kock chopping onto his stumps for a three-ball duck.
But South Africa recovered either side of a brief rain delay, with the Proteas 53-1 at the end of the powerplay.
A further weather interruption could not prevent Hendricks completing a 42-ball fifty and he then upped the tempo with three boundaries in a 16th over bowled by Sam Curran.
He was eventually well caught by wicket-keeper Buttler off the expensive Chris Jordan (1-52).
But Markram, back in South Africa’s T20 team for the first time since last year’s World Cup, having first provided solid support, went on to a 36-ball fifty before Proteas captain David Miller, in his 100th match at this level, chipped in with a quickfire 22.

9,Nunez outshines Haaland as Liverpool beat City in Community Shield,LEICESTER: Liverpool struck first blood against Manchester City ahead of the new Premier League season as Darwin...,"LEICESTER: Liverpool struck first blood against Manchester City ahead of the new Premier League season as Darwin Nunez made an instant impact for Jurgen Klopp’s men to win the Community Shield 3-1 on Saturday.
In a tale of two big summer signings, Nunez came off the bench to win a penalty and score his first goal since a 75-million euro ($77 million) move from Benfica, while Erling Haaland had a City debut to forget.
“He’s good,” said Klopp on Nunez, who has been criticised for his pre-season performances.  “Today we played the smart passes. We saw Darwin in dangerous situations. He used the spaces and finished well too.
“All the subs made a real difference. It was the most important thing I learned today, that the boys are ready.” Trent Alexander-Arnold’s blistering strike gave Liverpool a deserved half-time lead in Leicester.
But it was City’s other new forward who hauled Pep Guardiola’s men back into the game after the break as Julian Alvarez equalised.
Tying down Mohammed Salah to a new three-year deal was Liverpool’s other major piece of summer business and the Egyptian was deadly from the penalty spot after Nunez’s header was handled by Ruben Dias.
The Uruguayan then got his own glory moment by stooping to head home in stoppage time before tearing off his shirt in celebration.
Victory saw Liverpool win the traditional season curtain-raiser for the first time since 2006 and lay down an early marker in what is expected to be another battle between the sides for the Premier League title.
City held off the Reds to win the Premier League for a fourth time in five years by a point in a thrilling finale to last season.
Guardiola’s men had to come from 2-0 down on the final day of the campaign to beat Aston Villa and were again guilty of a slow start.
Salah was the provider for the opening goal as he laid Thiago Alcantara’s crossfield pass back to the edge of the box and Alexander-Arnold smashed in off the post with the aid of a slight deflection off Dias.
City had played just two pre-season friendlies to Liverpool’s four and took half an hour to find their feet.
Haaland was denied by Liverpool stand-in goalkeeper Adrian with his first sight of goal.
However, the Norwegian should have opened his City account moments later as he failed to properly connect with Joao Cancelo’s inviting cross.
“It’s good for him to see the reality of the new country, new league,” said Guardiola on Haaland’s first taste of English football.
“He was there. Today he didn’t score - another day he will score.” Nunez was given his chance to shine on the hour mark, but fluffed his first big chance when Ederson prevailed in a one-on-one.
At the other end, City’s new South American striker also got his career in England off to a flying start.
Alvarez was quickest to react to the rebound after Adrian saved Phil Foden’s initial effort and the goal stood after a VAR review for offside.
It needed another the intervention of VAR for Liverpool to restore their lead seven minutes from time.
Referee Craig Pawson pointed to the spot after seeing a replay of Nunez’s header coming back off the arm of Dias.
Salah was deadly as ever from 12 yards as he drilled into the bottom corner despite Ederson going the right way.
Nunez then ended any doubt over the result when he pounced on Andy Robertson’s header across goal.
But City’s miserable day did not end there as Haaland hit the bar with the goal gaping deep in stoppage time.

HARARE: Liton Das and Mosaddek Hossain played key roles on Sunday as Bangladesh levelled a three-match Twenty20 international series in Zimbabwe with a seven-wicket victory.
Spin-bowling all-rounder Mosa­ddek took five wickets for the first time in his T20 international career as the tourists restricted Zimb­abwe to 135-8 at Harare Sports Club.
Faced with the modest target, Bangladesh were always ahead on run rate thanks to an impressive start propelled by opener Liton, whose 56 off 33 balls included two sixes and six fours.
The tourists cruised to 136-3 with 15 balls remaining and success was particularly joyful as it was only the second T20 triumph in their last 15 internationals.
Defeat ended a six-match winning streak by Zimbabwe in the shortest format since former star batsman Dave Houghton returned in June for a second stint as national coach.
The series will be decided on Tuesday before the teams change formats and play three one-day internationals. 
“I feel fantastic. When I am bowling I always think of bowling dot balls so I followed the plan strictly. We decided to start with spin so when I bowled I started with the right areas,” said Mosaddek. 
“We were looking to restrict Zimbabwe to 150 or 160 runs. When you lose five wickets in the powerplay, it will be difficult to score more than 150. 
“Bangladesh have the hunger to win the last match, we are confident now. Hopefully it will be a good match for us.” 
Mosaddek, who had never taken more than two wickets for his country in a T20 match, wreaked havoc with his victims including openers Regis Chakabva and captain Craig Ervine.
Zimbabwe, who will join Bangladesh at the T20 World Cup in Australia during October, were reeling at 31-5 by the time Mosaddek completed his off-break onslaught.
Sikandar Raza and Ryan Burl then stopped the rot for the hosts, adding 80 runs for the sixth wicket as none of five other Bangladesh bowlers could emulate Mosaddek.
Raza scored 62 off 53 deliveries, including two sixes and four fours, before being caught in the covers by Munim Shahriar.
Apart from Raza, Burl and Luke Jongwe were the only Zimbabwe batsmen to reach double figures.
Liton claimed his sixth T20 international half-century before trying to sweep former Zimbabwe captain Sean Williams, missing and being trapped leg before off the final ball of the ninth over.
Unperturbed, the visitors soon required less than a run a ball to succeed and an unbeaten 55-run fourth wicket stand between Afif Hossain and Najmul Hossain ensured a convincing victory.

12,Verstappen wins in Hungary as Leclerc misses out again,BUDAPEST: Red Bull’s Formula One championship leader Max Verstappen won the Hungarian Grand Prix from 10th on the...,"BUDAPEST: Red Bull’s Formula One championship leader Max Verstappen won the Hungarian Grand Prix from 10th on the starting grid on Sunday as Ferrari rival Charles Leclerc suffered another strategy nightmare.
Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton finished second for Mercedes with team-mate George Russell, on pole position for the first time, third in a repeat of the previous race in France.
Reigning champion Verstappen now has a massive 80-point lead — more than three race wins — over Leclerc after 13 of 22 races.
The Ferrari driver led for a while but ended up sixth as his tyre strategy unravelled.
“Amazing result. Who would have thought when we woke up that we were going to win the race,” Verstappen said over the team radio after taking the chequered flag in tricky conditions at the Hungaroring.
“That is right up there with your best,” said team boss Christian Horner.
“Unbelievable. Best way to go into the summer break and it doesn’t feel anything like summer today, I tell you,” he added, with raindrops falling as the race ended.
The win was Verstappen’s eighth of the season and 28th of his career. He now has 258 points to Leclerc’s 178.
Hamilton, a record eight time winner in Hungary but starting from seventh, felt he might have won had his drag reduction system (DRS) not failed in Saturday’s qualifying.
“We would have had the pace to win if we hadn’t had that DRS issue,” the Briton told his team over the radio after taking the chequered flag and banking an extra point for fastest lap.
Hamilton had bolted on a set of softs for the last 18 laps and passed Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz and Russell before setting off in pursuit of Verstappen, who was ultimately too far down the road.
Leclerc was left wondering, not for the first time this season, what might have been had Ferrari put him on a different strategy.
While the Italian team licked more self-inflicted wounds, others saw only blunders.
The Monegasque made three pitstops, one more than others, after starting on medium tyres, continuing on another set for his second stint and then going to the hards — losing performance and places — before finally switching to softs.
The Ferrari driver had swept past Russell to take the lead on lap 31 and pull away, with every indication it would be his day.
