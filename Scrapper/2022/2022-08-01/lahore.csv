2,Punjab police reshuffle spree continues,LAHORE: The Punjab government on Sunday reshuffled seven DIG-rank police officers including Punjab Counter Terrorism...,"LAHORE: The Punjab government on Sunday reshuffled seven DIG-rank police officers including Punjab Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) head Waseem Ahmad Khan and Lahore DIG Operations retired Capt Sohail Chaudhry.  
Contrary to the previous practice, “all the transfer/postings” were made on the recommendations of IGP Faisal Shahkar this time round. 
The government has made CTD Additional IG Waseem Ahmad Khan an OSD till further order. The posting orders were issued shortly after Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi interviewed the police officers at his office here on Sunday noon. 
An official told Dawn that the IGP faced resistance from the CM Secretariat for the appointment of the police officers he had proposed. He said the provincial police officer had proposed names of the police officers on Saturday with a request to the CM to consider them for the slots he had mentioned against the names of each of them. 
He said the officials in the CM Secretariat declared it an unusual practice and conveyed to the IGP that the posting of senior police officers used to be made on the directions of the CM office and suggested him to review his proposal or wait for ‘further order’ from the secretariat. 
However, he said, the PPO told them that he wanted appointments of all the proposed police officers against the slots and asked them to submit the summary to the CM for final consideration/approval. 
In the summary, the IGP had recommended to the CM to transfer Sargodha Regional Police Officer (RPO) Imran Mehmood and post him as new Additional IG CTD Punjab vice Waseem Ahmad Khan. 
DIG Intelligence Special Branch Punjab should be transferred and posted as new RPO Sargodha, while Afzal Mahmud Butt (awaiting posting) should be made Lahore DIG VVIP Security Branch vice Faisal Ali Raja who should be transferred and posted as DIG intelligence in Special Branch Punjab. 
The IG also proposed mutual transfer of DIG Operations Sohail Chaudhry and CTD Punjab DIG Afzaal Ahmad Kausar. 
In the earlier practice, the official said, the CM secretariat used to convey the IGP about the selection of police officers for field postings. As the summary reached the chief minister, he issued order to stop process on it while raising objections to the names of some police officers. The matter remained under discussion between the IGP office and the CM secretariat and Parvez Elahi directed Shahkar to send names of other police officers too. 
Following the “conflict” over the postings of the police officers, Faisal Shahkar on Sunday sent a request for an emergent meeting with the CM, which was accepted accordingly. Consequently, he met Parvez Elahi on Sunday morning and took up the issue with him, requesting him to give “some space” to the PPO in the core domain of transfers/postings of police officers. 
The official said Shahkar told the CM that the police circles were raising questions about the ‘jurisdiction’ of the IGP in transfer and posting matters as they believed that most previous reshuffles in police were “politically motivated”. The IGP further conveyed to the CM that some selective police officers were repeatedly getting field postings in the province and submitted a request to review this practice to avoid brain drain of competent/professional officers. After a brief brainstorming on the matter, the CM agreed to the proposal and called the police officers for an interview, the official source said. Except Waseem Sial, all other police officers reached there, he said, adding that an interesting development took place when Sohail Chaudhry suddenly left the CM secretariat a few minutes before his scheduled meeting with Parvez Elahi for interview. 
As for the probable reason, he said, PTI senior leader Shafqat Mahmood also reached the CM secretariat around that time and showed his annoyance over police action against his party leaders in Lahore. He said some police officers suggested to Sohail Chaudhry to leave the CM secretariat to avoid confrontation with the PTI leader and he immediately left without seeing the Punjab CM. 
A couple of hours after the interviews, the Punjab government issued notifications of the police officers in accordance with the summary sent by the IGP.  
Interestingly, the official said, the CM also held interviews of newly-posted Faisalabad RPO Moeen Masood and City Police Officer DIG Omer Saeed Malik two days after their appointment.

4,punjab notes: Sixteenth century Farid’s hagiography and Bhandara’s poetry,"It is well known that poetry in contemporary Punjabi had its origins in the 10th and 11th centuries, evidence of...","It is well known that poetry in contemporary Punjabi had its origins in the 10th and 11th centuries, evidence of which is found in a book of religious hymns known as ‘Ginan’, composed by Ismaili scholars in Multan. Later, we witness a larger-than-life figure, poet and saint, named Fariduddin Masa’ud, mounting the stage of history from the suburbs of Multan. He is undisputedly considered the pioneer of contemporary Punjabi literary tradition. His couplets (Shloka) carried such a socio-spiritual vision and aesthetic dimension that Guru Nanak Dev preserved them for posterity, which later became an inseparable part of Sikh scripture ‘Guru Granth Sahib’. 
Interestingly, one of the earliest prose writings in Punjabi, titled ‘Maslay Saikh Farid Kay’ is also concerned with his life, real and imagined. The book, edited by Prof Dr Nabila Rehman, has been published by the Institute of Punjabi and Cultural Studies of the Punjab University, Lahore. Prof Rehman is a well-known research scholar and writer. This is the first time that the book has been made available in Arabic-based Shahmukhi (a misnomer) script. 
‘Masla’ is the Punjabi pronunciation of the Arabic word ‘Masala,’ which has multiple meanings, such as a question, problem, issue, a thing asked, doctrine, precept etc. Here it means questions/matters of spiritual and mystical importance. In the form of stories, which have Baba Farid as their central figure, questions/matters are raised and solved. Stories look like parables designed to teach spiritual lessons and promote a certain moral vision. Consequently, it involves natural and supernatural elements, which may inspire the devotees of the saint but put the rationalists off. But it must be remembered that the book was composed in the late 16th century when superstition reigned (it reigns even now) and arcane practices were thought to be an integral part of spiritual life. So it offers hagiographic picture of his (Farid’s) supposed esoteric and mystical practices. 
What’s significant is not the structure of the stories but the inferences one is supposed to draw from them. The happenings narrated with disarming innocence carry nuggets of wisdom, moral views and glimpses into spiritual practice. 
Some ‘Maslas’ are stories full of wit and wisdom. In the second ‘Masla we come across this: “…Shaikh Farid starved for seven consecutive days. On day eight, his wife said to him; ‘look Farid, people toil daily (to eke out a living). You also toil for a few days so that we get something in our belly. We are starving.’ Saikh Farid thereupon replied to the woman; ‘I can’t toil.’ ‘Well, you can’t toil but can’t you even steal? Who else shall provide for us?’ she retorted…” 
Prof Rehman has quoted Pritam Singh’s apt remarks about Baba Farid’s character portrayed in the book. 
“The author of this book has created the character of Baba Farid modelled on some indigenous saint, not on the model of an alien proselytizer from Arabia or Iran. The author makes Baba Farid undergo nearly all the experiences, which are a product of a treasure trove of indigenous thinking. Here the alien Sufi movement has donned indigenous robes,” he writes. 
The book has 19 stories on different aspects of Sufi experiences and practice. The editor deserves kudos for her academic research on the history and evolution of the classical Punjabi prose spanning over centuries, which most of the scholars this side of the border are not aware of. 
Nabila Rehman has briefly explored diverse genres of classical prose. Her introduction to ‘Maslay’ is thorough and exhaustive. In her opinion, ‘Maslay’ is the product of Meherban Sodhi’s research and wit. He was the nephew of fifth Guru Arjun Dev. His real name was Manohar Das but came to be known as Sodhi Meherban, which seems to be his nom de plume. In literary history, ‘Maslay’ is mostly valued for being one of the early specimens of Punjabi prose. The language used has a blend of two dialects, erstwhile Multani (now Saraiki) and Lehndi, which is nothing unusual as the similar specimen of language is found in classical poetry. The book may prove a serendipitous gift for those interested in literature, culture and spirituality. It is a must-buy for libraries, private and public. 
Another book being reviewed is by a poet who also has some connection with Baba Farid, though obliquely. Mian Nasir Jalal Bhandara’s book of verse, titled ‘Sufna Such Te Udeek’ has been published by Akbar Lahori Foundation, Lahore. The suffix ‘Bhandara’ alludes to something interesting that happened to the author’s elders. His clan joined the resistance movement of 1857 against the white colonialists, led by famous Ahmed Khan Kharral in and around present day Sahiwal region. In the aftermath of locals’ defeat, the patriarch of the family ran away to Rajasthan. Later, the clan settled in Bahawalnagar and Pakpattan. In pre-partition days, a conflict arose between the two descendants of Baba Farid as to who would be the custodian of the shrine. The family sided with one of the claimants and using muscle power scared away the other. Now to show his gratitude, the custodian would invite an elder of the family and along with him inaugurate the annual ‘Urs’ of the saint. The elder would bring loads of food as a show of devotion. The traditional word for a place where food is stored is ‘bhandara’. Another meaning of it is feast. Since the family would do its bit to provide for the devotees, the people started calling them Bhandara and it stuck. 
Mian Nasir Jalal Bhandara is a land owner but what distinguishes him is his creative pursuits. He is basically a playwright and fiction writer with a number of publications to his credit. His plays have been recorded by Pakistan Television while the Alhamra Art Council staged some of his plays. He also wrote stories for films. With the publication of this book, he makes his debut as a poet. 
A quiet melancholy runs through Bhandara’s poetry. Time slipping out of hand like sand creates a sense of loss, which gives his verse an air of pathos. The unravelling of inherited sociocultural fabric under immense pressures of modern conditions is another theme that haunts him. But the lucky streak is that somber experience of changing life makes him neither a pessimist nor a cynic. What sustains him is his faith in human goodness and promise of tomorrow. 
Bhandara’s poetry is unpretentious, simple and accessible. “Days are the same/ Same are the nights/ But how did our conversations and tales vanish into thin air?” — soofi01@hotmail.com

The 25th edition of the parallel theatre festival was held at Alhamra Art Centre. 
The seven-day festioavl concluded with Ajoka’s two plays before a jam-packed audience. 
The first play was work by Ajoka’s Art of Writing student Ummer Amin, performed by Art of Acting students. The play, Suicide Point, was a scathing yet entertaining satire on the hopeless conditions of life where even death has become a costly option. The play revolves around a company called ‘Suicide Point’ which offers people fed of living, an ‘attractive’ package to end their lives. The play was directed by Ajoka Institute director Nirvaan Nadeem. The cast included Rai Kamran, Mian Meesam, Nyle Imtiaz, Haifa Ambreen, Shehroz, Zainul Abideen, Muzamil Khokhar, Ibtihaj Ahmad, Hammad Yousaf, Ahmed Shaykh, Abbas Salotra, Hassan Atif, Asif Ali khan and Sohail Afgen. 
The second play was an adaptation of Manto’s world acclaimed short story ‘Toba Tek Singh’, based on the events of the 1947 Partition when the governments of India and Pakistan decided on an exchange of lunatics on communal grounds. The central character is a Sikh resident of Punjab district Stovall Tek Singh and is worried about the fate of his birth town as a result of the Partition of Punjab. Creatively adapted by playwright Shahid Nadeem and originally directed by Madeeha Gauhar, it was an artistically brilliant and emotionally engaging production. The cast included M Qaiser Khan, Usman Zia, Fahad Hashmi, Rizwan Riaz, Shahzad Sadiq, Bilal Mughal, Luke Kelvin, Asad Bhatti, Nasir Mehmood, Hammad Yousaf, Hassan and Mian Meesam. 
LAC Executive Director Farhat Jabeen distributed certificates to the participating groups.

7,DG Khan has its first transpersons school,Students to be enrolled in primary to higher secondary classes...,"DERA GHAZI KHAN: The first school for transgender persons from primary to higher secondary education has been established in the city with the collaboration of Japan. 
The evening school has been launched at the Girls High School No 1, Dera Ghazi Khan, with the collaboration of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Punjab School Education Department. 
District Education Authority Chief Executive Officer Masood Ahmed told Dawn the government had decided to bring the transpersons community into the mainstream by educating its members. In this regard, a transgender persons school had been established with enrolment of 12 transgender students, he said and added that a four-member trained teaching staff had also been employed for the school where primary, elementary, high and higher secondary classes would be held. 

Students to be enrolled in primary to higher secondary classes

If the students go for primary level learning, they would be provided with abridged course with Package A, Package B and Package C in the form of integrated learning, developed by JICA, duly approved by the Punjab Curriculum and Textbook Board (PCTB) so that a learner may be able to start attending elementary classes within shortest possible time. 
Teachers would be provided with training for this Accelerated Learning Programme by technical assistance of JICA. In case, if any higher secondary student from transgender community arrives, she may be offered a chance of teaching if she is capable enough for this task. She would teach primary students and might continue her own studies in higher classes, as well. The idea is to educate all transgender students so that they may earn a decent livelihood. Furthermore, qualified transpersons would be welcomed and encouraged for teaching other members of their community. 
Primary Students would be taught English, Math and Urdu (integrated book for social studies, Islamiat and Science) while Elementary students Urdu, English, Mathematics, General Science, Islamiat and Pak Studies.  The syllabus for high school students would include Urdu, English, Mathematics, General Science, Islamiat and Pak Studies along with two elective subjects of students’ own choice in accordance with board of intermediate and secondary education (BISE) examination system.  
For higher secondary school students, it would be Urdu, English, Mathematics, General Science, Islamiat, and Pak Studies along with two elective subjects of students’ own choice in accordance with the BISE curriculum. It would be initially two-and-a-half hours school that may be further moved to three hours after a year. In summer, the timing would be from 3pm to 5:30pm and in winter, the timing would be 2:30pm to 5:00pm.

Nosher Ali, 55, of village Thatta Risalu, tehsil Bhowana, was arrested by the Kot Wasawa police late on Saturday. 
According to his widow, Kousar Parveen, the police took her into custody when she was alone at home and detained her at the police station. When Nosher came to the police station for her release, the police arrested him and let her go. 
She alleged the police tortured her husband the whole night and when he died, they threw the body back into the house. 
The relatives and villagers took the body to the Bhowana THQ Hospital for an autopsy where doctors demanded a police report for making a medical board, which was not provided by the police. The villagers protested outside the hospital. 
Kousar appealed to Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi to take notice of the murder of her husband and punish the suspects. She said Nosher was a labourer who worked on farms and houses to earn bread for the family. The family has three children. 
Spokesperson for police Mohsin Hassan said the deceased was taken into custody last night “on a tip-off by an informer” that he was a drug peddler. However, his condition deteriorated during interrogation and he was taken to his house when he was alive. Later, he died at his house. 
The protesters questioned why was he kept in the police station without the registration of any case for the whole night and why was he released without any punishment. If he was arrested lawfully, why the police preferred to release him and did not send him to a hospital in police custody? 
The villagers demanded a judicial inquiry into the grave police high-handedness incident and exemplary punishment for responsible police officials.

11,LWMC’s waste collection stations a public nuisance,"Stations are causing an unbearable stench and have become a public nuisance, especially in Lahore's residential areas.","LAHORE: Most of the temporary waste collection, dumping and transfer stations established by the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) in the provincial metropolis are causing unbearable stench and have become a public nuisance, especially in the residential areas.  
The situation is worst at the LWMC ‘s Johar Town dumping station (adjacent to the Lahore Expo Centre and near a well-known shopping mall and hotel) that is not only causing a great inconvenience to the residents and the commuters, but also the foreigners visiting the city to attend various mega events. 
“Look at this waste dumping station spreading over acres that has become a permanent source of stench, polluting the air being inhaled by the people in the area. Moreover, the guests coming from other countries, who stay at the nearby hotel and visit the shopping mall, while attending international events, are also being affected due to such poor waste disposal arrangement,” deplores a resident of Johar Town. “What impression these foreigners will have about our country? It is a matter of grave concern and the issue must be resolved immediately,” he demanded. 
The LWMC had taken over the control of waste collection and disposal work a year ago after relieving two leading Turkish companies to whom the job had been outsourced in 2012. However, after the 2018 general elections, the Buzdar-led PTI government started probing into all major initiatives, including the LWMC, taken by the PML-N government and finally decided against extending the contract in December, 2020.  
In the same month, the government, in a surprising move, took over all assets and installations (workshops, machinery) being used by the Turkish firms, besides getting registered cases against their senior officials. This led to a crisis, leaving most of the city areas dirty and smelly for weeks. 
The employees of the companies -- Albayrak and Ozpak -- on Dec 22, 2020 had also staged a protest demonstration against the LWMC management for “forcibly seizing” their machinery, equipment, workshops and field offices, despite stay orders issued by court.  
The companies also criticised the LWMC for not clearing their dues to the tune of Rs3 billion. However, the LWMC rejected the contractors’ stance that the machinery, under the contract, was to be handed over to the foreign firms.  
The issue was also reported by the international media, including various Turkish news oganisations and the Turkish government took the matter up with the federal government. 
After relieving the Turkish firms of the job, the LWMC took over the control of cleanliness operations to the extent of primary waste collection and outsourced the secondary waste collection to private firms. It also procured new machinery, equipment etc and started the operations. It also set up several temporary waste collection, dumping and transfer stations at Kamahan, Hando, Babu Sabu, Bhuptian, Johar Town, Mohlanwal, Raiwind, Thokar, Jadeh, Bhaati gate, Baradari, Saggian, Shadman, China Scheme and Ring Road for onward shifting of the solid waste to the landfill sites, including Lakhudair. 
“Setting up waste stations in the urban areas, especially those frequented by foreigners, is an unwise decision as it is adversely impacting the image of the country that is already facing the worst economic crisis for the last couple of years. The government must take notice of the situation,” said an official of the Lahore city district administration, seeking anonymity.  
“All such stations must be closed down with immediate effect to protect the public at large from environmental hazard. The environment protection and local government departments, besides the metropolitan corporation, should come forward and resolve this issue,” he suggested. 
A spokesman for the LWMC  said the issue of Johar Town waste station is already under discussion. “We have already reduced the total waste being brought to this station from various spots to 50 percent. Moreover, the transportation of waste from the station to the landfill sites has also been expedited,” he claimed.  
He said the company had also started looking for a new place to shift the waste station there, because of the public complaints.  
To a question, he said since immediate closure of the station would disrupt the primary waste collection operation, the company could not do so till finding an other site.  
Meanwhile, the LWMC has launched a cleanliness operation in the city for Muharram.  
Under the plan, a special operation has been launched to clean and wash 121 Imambargahs across the city. In this connection, Imambargahs in Ravi Town, Shalimar Town, Wahga Town and Aziz Bhatti Town have been washed.  
The LWMC CEO Ms Rafia Haider on Sunday visited the sites and supervised the cleaning and washing of various Imambargahs.  
“We have deployed all our machinery and more than 600 workers to provide cleaning services during Muharram in three shifts. The operation has been completed at Imambargah Rizvia, Imambargah Hassani, Imambargah Baba Karamat, Imambargah Bait Al Fadak, Imambargah Jamal Mustafa, Imambargah Jamia Fatima, Imambargah Jagir Ali and Haveli Syed Wajid Hussain Shah,” she said, adding that cleaning arrangements are also being made on the routes of Muharram processions and the sites of majalis.

12,Constable’s body parts cut off in name of honour in Jhang,Police have registered a case against 13 people; the victim has been admitted to the hospital.,"TOBA TEK SINGH: Thirteen people cut off the nose, both ears and a lip of a constable in the name of honour in the Sajjowal area of Jhang. 
Tahir Imran, a cousin of Qasim Hayat, a constable posted at the Kot Shakir Police Station, told Masan police that Iftikhar had suspicion that Qasim had illicit relations with his wife. Iftikhar, in connivance with 12 accomplices of his Sajoka Mukhtiana clan, chopped Qasim’s body parts off. 
The victim was admitted to the district headquarters (DHQ) hospital. Masan police registered a case against 13 people under sections 324,109,148 and 149 of the PPC.  
On July 16, the same police station had registered a case against Constable Qasim under sections 354 (assault on woman), 384 (extortion) and 292 (pornography) of the PPC in which Aftab, a son of Iftikhar, had claimed that Qasim, a neighbour, had forced his mother to make illicit relations with him with the threat of killing her son. 
When she met him to convince him to change his views, he overpowered her, made her movie and extorted Rs150,000 from her through blackmail on different occasions. He later made her video viral on social media.  
Masan police SHO Mehr Zulfiqar said impartial investigation would be made into both FIRs.

13,Flood-affected people scrambling for survival,Death toll rises to 21 with recovery of more bodies.,"DERA  GHAZI KHAN: A number of people in Taunsa Sharif tehsil and its  contiguous areas are fighting for survival amid ravages of hill torrents  and flood.  
With the recovery of two more dead  bodies -- an  infant and a young man who had been missing for the last few days, the  death toll on Sunday rose to 21. Rescuers found the bodies of  one-year-old Asif (son of Khadim Hussain of Chhitani Zinda Pir village)  and Ramzan, 27, (son of Allah  Divaya -- Bhuttaywali village).  
Deputy   Commissioner Anwar Baryar committed that the Punjab government would  provide  compensatory amount of Rs800,000 to each deceased’s family.  Financial assistance would be provided to the affected people by  estimating the losses of houses, crops and livestock, he said. Meanwhile, Chief  Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi ordered expeditious work on  reconstruction and repair of roads in the affected areas.

Death toll rises to 21 with recovery of more bodies

Plight of the populace 
Hundreds  of residents of the flood-hit villages are facing a trying ordeal  without home and hearth. They are at the mercy of the gushing waters  emerging from mountain drains, which are too strong to be stopped by any  dyke or concrete structure of Chashma Right Bank Canal.     
A  visit to the devastated areas revealed the plight of the people who are  hoping against hope that their houses will be reconstructed and they  will get back to their work. They are also at risk of contracting  diseases for being exposed to dirt and vermin.  
Murad, a resident  of Bhargari village, told Dawn that almost all dwellings in their area  had been reduced to rubble. “The government has given us tents and food  hampers but we need reconstruction of our houses and permanent  protection against the hill torrents,” he demanded.    
Ahmadani  village resident Rasheed sobbed out: “We need financial help as well as  moral support to come out of the trauma and be back to normal life once  again. The loss of a loved one and meagre belongings in the flood has  changed our lives,” he said.  
The flood has also damaged the Indus Highway and disrupted traffic. The police station near the village had its walls cracked.  
Khuda  Bakhsh, an elderly resident of the area, said the floods were the  outcome of “intervention in the traditional routes of floodwaters of  mountain drains.” The hill torrents, he recalled, were considered a  blessing for the people of arid zone as they would use the water for  irrigation of their chunks of land through a canal system.  
“The  farmers nowadays depend on turbines for irrigation and are no more  dependent on the natural flow of water. They have, in the process,  weakened the embankments or dykes,” he said.  
Negligence of the irrigation department officials had added to the problems, a resident of Qasim village said.  
The  deputy commissioner said 185 mauzas of 33 union councils were hit by  the flood and 80,000 people had been displaced. He said that on the  direction of the Punjab government, the district administration was  preparing data on the basis of which it would declare it the  calamity-hit area.

17,"Flood in Chenab, Indus inundates localities, triggers more evacuation",No threats to Bahawalpur areas from Sutlej river...,"MUZAFFARGARH/BAHAWALPUR: As the flood level in the River Chenab is rising, the district administration and the Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has issued an alert about the flood in the Indus River in the next few days. The Chenab flooding is heading towards Rangpur, Head Mohammed Wala and Muzaffargarh. 
Deputy Commissioner Ali Annan Qamar said that the next two days (Monday and Tuesday) are critical for the city areas and so far dozens of villages along the riverside had been affected by the medium-level Chenab flooding. Flood has touched Muzaffargarh’s main embankment and rescue teams have set up camps there to watch the situation. 
The administration has issued a red alert for the city area but there is no panic in the city as the people believe the vast riverside plains will be enough to spread the water. In the river belt, schools will not be opened from Monday while basic health units and schools have been converted into relief camps where livestock officials and health department officials are present. 
The DC said that the Chenab flood will also affect Alipur and Jatoi tehsils here where the Zamindara embankment is under threat. Hundreds of families were forced to evacuate their homes in Alipur and Jatoi. Also, the Shehr Sultan flood embankment was at high risk and thousands of people had been told to evacuate their homes. There is a lack of food items and tents as 10,000 to 20,000 people are waiting for relief.  

No threats to Bahawalpur areas from Sutlej river

In the Indus River, there is a medium-level flood as more than 200,000 cusecs water was flowing at the Taunsa Barrage. The irrigation department has decreased the Muzaffargarh Canal water to 3,000 cusecs from 8,000 cusecs and the TP-Link canal to 5,000 cusecs from 12,000 cusecs. Similarly, the Dera Ghazi Khan Canal and Kachhi Canal are running at reduced flows. The DC said that Abbaswala Bund was in good health to protect areas from the Indus flooding. 
BAHAWALPUR: The divisional administration has directed the evacuation of the inhabitants from the Panjnad Headworks touching the jurisdictions of several rural areas falling within tehsil Ahmedpur East and sub-tehsil Uch Sharif. 
Dawn learnt that due to the rise in water level in the River Chenab, Kachi Shikrani, Bakhtiari, Chak Kambal, Shikrani, Rasoolpur, Jagear Sadiqabad, Makhan Bela, Noorpur Jadead, Kachi Lal and others around 
Uch Sharif have been submerged. Rescue 1122 has established camps in the areas and shifted locals and their livestock to safer places. 
Bahawalpur Commissioner Raja Jahangir Anwar ruled out any flood-like situation at the Panjnad Headworks, saying the evacuation of the people illegally residing in the dry bed of both up and down streams of the Panjnad Headworks along the left marginal bund (LMB) may face a threat of the inundation of the vast area. 
The total discharge capacity of the Panjnad Headworks is 800,000 cusecs but only 200,000 cusecs were expected in the coming days. He added that although there were reports of releasing extra water in the Chenab river by Indian authorities, while the dried–up River Sutlej had also now abundant flood and rainwater but the situation was entirely under control as the water will take several days to hit the Panjnad Headworks and by then its quantity will naturally be decreased. 
Dawn learnt that the water level in the River Sutlej at Empress Bridge near the city is also satisfactory and a large number of people visited the bridge to watch the life in the river. The officials of the irrigation department said that the current water level will have no threat to the city population as the bed needed still required a large quantity of water to fill it to the brim.
