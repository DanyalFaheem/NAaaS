0,Literary notes: Baital Pachcheesee: an old Sanskrit legend and its Urdu versions,"BAITAL is a Sanskrit word and is also used in Urdu, though not commonly these days. Baital means ghost, demon, ...","


 
BAITAL is a Sanskrit word and is also used in Urdu, though not commonly these days. Baital means ghost, demon, sprite or fiend.
Some seniors among our readers might recall a story named ‘Agya Baital’. It was serialised, some 45 years ago, in an Urdu magazine published from Karachi. Agya means fire and Agya baital is a demon that supposedly rules the fire. Kids these days might give a strange look if you utter words like baital.
Pachchees is a word commonly used in Urdu and Hindi. It means twenty-five. Baital Pachcheesee, also spelt Baital Pachisi, is nearly a thousand-year-old Sanskrit legend that has twenty-five stories narrated by a baital or demon.
The legend has been translated into several languages including Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, Hindi, English and Urdu. Duncan Forbes, a well-known orientalist and lexicographer, who translated several Urdu and Hindi texts into English, had also rendered this legend into Hindi. 
In his intro to his version, named The Baital Pachisi or the Twenty-Five Tales of a Demon, published in 1862 from London with an intro in English, Forbes says that the legend was originally written in Sanskrit. The author’s name was Shivadasa and the work was titled Vetala-pancha-vinshati. 
Forbes adds: “The original of these tales is to be found in the Katha-Sarit-Sagara, a voluminous collection of Sanskrit tales in verse by Somadeva Bhatta of Kashmir”. Forbes also mentions that there are variant texts and various translations, even imitations, of Baital Pachchisi that are found in Indian vernaculars.
Forbes had asked John T. Platts, another orientalist and lexicographer, to translate Baital Pachisi into English. Platts’ English translation, based on Forbes’ Hindi text appeared from London in 1871. According to Platts, during the reign of Emperor Muhammad Shah, Raja Jai Singh Sawai, the ruler of Jainagar, had asked Surat, an eminent poet, to translate Baital Pachisi into Braj dialect. 
According to Dr Gian Chand Jain, it was rendered into Braj Bhasha in 1740. Dr Jain has also mentioned that the complete version of Baital Pachisi is found both in Birhat-Katha-Manjari — the 11th-century Sanskrit collection of folklores and fairy tales — and Katha-Sarit-Sagara — another 11th-century collection of tales and legends. But historians and researchers are divided on exact dates of creation of these tales and their guesstimates differ wildly. Dr Jain has mentioned that the texts of Baital Pachisi discovered in different languages differ and the versions found in Tamil, Tibetan and Mongolian languages have variant texts.
As for Urdu version of Baital Pachisi, John Gilchrist of Fort William College, Calcutta, had asked Mazhar Ali Khan Vila alias Lutf, a poet who worked at Fort William College as translator, to translate it into easy Urdu. Lallu Lal, another writer at Fort William, helped Mazhar Vila and Tarini Charan Mitra, the Head Pandit at Fort William, revised it. This Urdu translation by Vila was published by Fort William College in 1803 and was used as a reader for teaching Urdu to the British officers.
The Urdu versions of Baital Pachcheesee have been edited and published many times over but are rarely mentioned in scholarly works — save for Urdu’s research papers. Aside from the first edition published by Fort William College and some latter-day Urdu versions published from Lucknow and Delhi, Dr Gohar Naushahi had published an admirable Urdu version of the tale by editing and annotating Mazhar Ali Khan Vila’s text. It was published in 1965 by Lahore’s Majlis-i-Taraqqi-i-Adab.
Dr Naushahi had used some early Hindi editions and/or translations of Baital Pachisi and had collated his work with them, for instance, as he has mentioned in his foreword, he consulted a version named Hindee and Hindustanee Selections, published in two volumes from Calcutta by Fort William College in 1827. The first volume includes Baital Pachisi’s complete text in Devanagari script. Another edition published by Hindustani Press, Calcutta, in 1855, included the tale both in Urdu and Hindi scripts and with English translation.
In collaboration with Bantam Books, Chicago University Press published Tales of Ancient India in 1961. Rendered by J.A.B. Van Buitenen, it has English translation of Baital Pachisi’s 11 stories and, as mentioned by Dr Naushahi, the version differs from Vila’s works at certain places.
A new and easy Urdu version of Baital Pachisi was published a couple of years ago by Lahore’s Dar-un-Navaadir. Edited, simplified, explained and annotated by Dr Baseera Ambreen, the new version tries to use the easy and familiar vocabulary and modern rules of Urdu orthography to make it readable for the young readers and students. Dr Ambreen in her intro and her article annexed at the back of the book has critically evaluated the tale. She feels Baital Pachisi offers wisdom that we can relate to even today.

1,"Petrol price cut by Rs3, diesel sees Rs9 jump",Petroleum development levy equalised at Rs15 per litre on all products...,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Sunday reduced the price of petrol and increased that of diesel and kerosene with immediate effect for the next fortnight. It increased the rate of petroleum development levy (PDL) on all products to meet an outstanding pre-condition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
According to an announcement by the finance ministry, the rate of petrol was cut by Rs3.05 per litre while the prices of high-speed diesel (HSD) and kerosene were jacked up by Rs8.95 and Rs4.62 per litre, respectively. The PDL on all products was equalised at Rs15 per litre.
“Owing to the fluctuation in petroleum prices in the international market and exchange rate variation, the government has decided to revise the existing prices of petroleum prices to pass on the impact to consumers,” the ministry said.
The ex-depot price of petrol now stands at at Rs227.19 from Aug 1 to 15 against current rate of Rs230.24 per litre, showing a reduction of Rs3.05 per litre, or a miserly 1.3pc. 

Petroleum development levy equalised at Rs15 per litre on all products

The rate of light diesel oil has inched down by an inconsequential 12 paise per litre to Rs191.32 instead of Rs191.44 per litre at present.
On the other hand, the ex-depot price of HSD has been set at Rs244.95 per litre, with an increase of Rs8.95 from the existing rate of Rs236 per litre, showing a 3.8pc rise. 
Likewise, the ex-depot rate of kerosene has been fixed at Rs201.07 per litre, with an increase of Rs4.62 from the existing rate of Rs196.45 per litre, up 2.35pc.
The previous PTI government gave a commitment to the IMF for a Rs4 per litre increase in PDL in December 2021 on the first of every month to a maximum of Rs30 per litre but reversed it on Feb 28.
The government had committed a prior action with the IMF to increase PDL by Rs10 per litre on HSD, kerosene oil and light diesel oil (LDO) and Rs5 per litre on petrol to ensure a uniform rate of Rs15 per litre on all products at the start of August. 
As of July 31, PDL stood at Rs10 per litre on petrol and Rs5 each on HSD, kerosene and LDO.
On July 14, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced a reduction of Rs18 to Rs40 per litre in the prices of various products as international prices went down. This was the first time the PML-N-led coalition government reduced petroleum prices after it came to power.
Between May 26 and July 1, the petrol price had increased by 66pc or Rs99 per litre, while HSD price went up by 92pc since May 26 from Rs144.15 per litre, up by 132.39 per litre. 
Likewise, the ex-depot price of kerosene had gone up to Rs230.26 per litre, up by 95pc between May 26 and July 1. Similarly, the ex-depot price of LDO went up to Rs226.15 on July 1, up 80pc from Rs125.56 per litre on May 26, up by about Rs100.59 per litre.
Under the deal with the IMF, the government has to gradually increase PDL on oil products to a maximum of Rs50 per litre to collect Rs855bn during the current fiscal year.
The petroleum levy had come to an end on March 1 price revision as international prices went up and the PTI government decided to not only reduce petroleum prices by Rs10 per litre but freeze it for the next four months, i.e. until the end of June. 
After initial indecision, the coalition government had been increasing petroleum prices since May 15 under the IMF deal.
At present, the GST is zero on all the key products, including petrol, HSD, kerosene and LDO, against 17pc normal GST. The government is also charging about Rs20 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD.

2,Imran asks PTI MPAs to prepare for polls,"Says next general election ""around the corner""; praises CM Parvez Elahi for ouster of ‘unlawful’ govt in Punjab.","LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan on Sunday directed party leadership and parliamentarians from Punjab to make preparations as the next general election is “around the corner”.
The direction came during separate meetings with various party leaders, including provincial chief of the party Dr Yasmin Rashid, former chief Shafqat Mahmood, and Mian Mahmood-ur-Rashid, as well as with MPAs from six Punjab divisions.
The meetings took place at Punjab Chief Minister’s office, where he earlier met Punjab Chief Minister Parvez Elahi and former federal minister Moonis Elahi and congratulated them over the ouster of an ‘unconstitutional’ and ‘unlawful’ government from Punjab.
Some PTI leaders quoted the party chairman as claiming that the announcement for the general election could be made within two months, as the deteriorating economic conditions could bring the incumbent federal government to its knees making it difficult for it to rule the country.

Praises Elahi for ouster of ‘unlawful’ govt

Therefore, he said, all party cadres should be ready for the purpose instead of being caught off guard.
He also directed Dr Rashid to complete the organisational set-up of the party in the province so that workers could be mobilised by the local leadership as and when required.
At the CM office, Mr Khan earlier discussed political situation, administrative affairs of Punjab and law and order with Mr Elahi. Former federal minister Moonis Elahi was also present at the chief minister’s office during the meeting.
The chief minister lauded the political acumen of the PTI chief for standing firmly and resolutely on his point of view against the political turncoats, as both sides discussed political situation and administrative affairs of the province.
Steps to provide relief to the people of Punjab were also discussed during the meeting, according to a press release.
Mr Khan also met Dr Sania Nishtar and former provincial minister Hashim Jawan Bakht in which the former directed them to restore and expeditiously work on the Ehsaas Programme in Punjab. 
He denounced that the previous Punjab government halted this programme, which was meant to help poor families.
On the occasion, Dr Nishtar presented a report to Mr Khan with regard to the implementation of the Ehsaas Programme.

3,Climate change heats up need for private weather forecasts,"As citizens dispense updates on their own, official urges caution to avoid unnecessary panic.","KARACHI: On a rooftop of his 120-square-yard home in Karachi’s Azizabad neighbourhood and with a cell phone in his hand, Syed Owais Haider works through the drizzle under thick, dark clouds to collect data from his automated weather station. 
The integrated system of components used to measure, record and often transmit weather parameters, such as temperature, wind speed and direction, gives him data to make short-term forecasts amid the ongoing wave of monsoon rains in Karachi.
This is one of 11 weather stations he and his friends are operating across Karachi and 15 across the country for daily weather updates, data and forecasts under Pak Weather Network — a more than decade-old private weather forecasting and broadcasting source.
Mr Haider’s network is one of few private weather forecasting and broadcasting sources in the country, creating waves these days amid growing challenges of climate change and fast-changing weather.

As citizens dispense updates on their own, official urges caution to avoid unnecessary panic

“It was in 2010 when we took this initiative,” he says. “It all came out of curiosity and interest in meteorology.”
He says his team monitors upper air charts and current conditions, such as temperature, pressure, humidity and wind speed, and follows international weather models like the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) and Global Forecast System (GFS) to make local weather forecasts. 
Widespread popularity
Private weather forecasting groups have gained in popularity in recent years amid fast-changing weather across the country, leading to more frequent heatwaves, chilling winters and heavy rains.
What also fuels their rise is the impression that the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) operates with the same traditional conservative approach when it comes to weather forecasting and predictions about approaching conditions.
However, people closely monitoring them and working with them believe that such groups are still evolving and their lack of capacity sometimes creates panic. 
“I have learnt a lot through these private groups,” says Uneeba Waqar, a broadcast journalist who actually introduced these private weather station operators to the mainstream media through her reporting. 
“Until a few years ago, information regarding fast-changing weather conditions, developing situations and reasons behind different trends were hard to find. We could only report the official numbers,” she says.
Read: Engaging private sector to tackle climate change
However, she still feels that the aggressive approach of private weather groups and sharing of premature developments sometimes creates uncertainty and panic, putting everyone’s reputation at risk.
Despite the catch, she thinks it’s a good and healthy trend, especially amid the growing challenge of climate change and stresses the need for a collaboration between these private groups and government institutions.
Jawad Memon, who has been independently operating Weather Updates PK for the last 15 years and boasts nearly 300,000 followers on his Facebook page, agrees with the idea.
He believes that despite a lack of resources and capacity, things can significantly improve if support and collaboration come from the government level. 
“I am doing all this alone to keep people across Pakistan informed and updated,” he says. “From model analysis, collection of data and even videography, I don’t have any other source. I am doing all this out of passion and craze.” 
‘Unbaked data creates panic’
Dr Sardar Sarfaraz, the chief meteorologist at the PMD, also doesn’t discourage these private groups and finds it a healthy sign to see youngsters taking interest in meteorology and making efforts on their own.
He, however, calls for following the set protocols and standards for accuracy that he thinks private weather stations usually lack. “Meteorology is a complete science and making forecasts is absolutely a professional job,” he says. 
As an example, he says when “we at the PMD make forecasts, we even analyse regional countries’ data collected from them officially through some state-level arrangements”.
Dr Sarfaraz also denies the impression that the PMD holds the information or shares it at a slow pace. 
“The fact is that we are bound to certain protocols and can only share any data or info or make forecasts when things are mature,” he says. “Unbaked data and immature information always do the damage and create panic.”

4,Shahbaz Gill accuses ex-PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi of taking bribe from Indian firm,Alleges Abbasi took Rs140m bribe from Indian firm as a consultancy fee when he was petroleum minister in Nawaz Sharif's cabinet.,"LAHORE: Shahbaz Gill, chief of staff to PTI chairman Imran Khan, has accused former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi of taking a bribe from an Indian company when he was the petroleum minister in the cabinet of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, a charge denied by Mr Abbasi.
Talking to the media at Chief Minister Secretariat on Sunday, Mr Gill alleged that Mr Abbasi took a Rs140 million bribe from the Indian firm as a consultancy fee and the money was transferred to his bank account in three transactions, one in December 2016 and two in January 2017.
Mr Gill said he and Mr Abbasi had accounts with the same bank and demanded that details of both accounts be put before the public.
He claimed that Mr Abbasi had tried to give the impression of being an upright person as prime minister, but this was far from reality.
Responding to Mr Gill’s allegations, Mr Abbasi challenged the PTI leader to take the matter to a court of law if he had evidence.
In a statement from Islamabad, the former premier said the PTI and its “mudslinging brigade” had been ruling the country for four years and instituted two cases against him.
Mr Abbasi urged his political opponent to petition a court to file yet another case against him and present the “so-called evidence”.
During his press conference, Mr Gill also told reporters that PTI chief Imran Khan was briefed about the relief efforts to help flood victims in Punjab and the progress made on the Ehsaas social safety and poverty alleviation programme.
He said that the PTI chairman would also meet party lawmakers from six Punjab divisions separately to discuss party affairs and a strategy for the next general election.

5,"Two killed, 17 wounded in Gilgit clash",Police say clash between two groups began when top Shia leader of GB was hoisting Alam (flag) of Hazrat Imam Hussain.,"GILGIT: Two people were killed and 17 others were injured when two religious groups clashed here at Yadgar Chowk, near Gilgit deputy commissioner’s office.
According to police, the clash between the two groups began when the top Shia leader of Gilgit-Baltistan, Agha Rahat Hussain Al-Hussaini, was hoisting the Alam (flag) of Hazrat Imam Hussain at Khomar Chowk at the start of Muharram. 
The clash left two people belonging to the Shia community dead. They were identified as Syed Iqrar Hussain, 25, a resident of Nagaral of Gilgit district; and Mohammad Ali, 15, from Hoper valley of Nagar. The firing also left 17 people injured. They were taken to the provincial headquarters hospital and Gilgit City hospital, where condition of all the injured people was stated to be stable. 
According to chief secretary Mohyuddin Ahmed Wani, a shooting incident took place at Yadgar Chowk in Gilgit. He appealed to the people to remain peaceful.
GB Chief Minister Khalid Khurshid Khan, while taking notice of the incident, said a handful of miscreants were trying to disturb the peaceful environment of the city, but strict action would be taken against them. He appealed to the people to maintain peace and cooperate with the government.
Home Secretary Iqbal Hussain Khan said 44 suspects allegedly involved in the incident had been arrested and the arrest of more elements would be carried out on intelligence-based information. 
He said that Section 144 had been imposed in the area for the next two weeks.
He said that Rs1 million each would be paid in compensation to the families of the two people killed in the incident while Rs300,000 each would be paid to injured persons.

6,SITUATIONER: Declaring governor’s rule no longer a piece of cake,Ex-Punjab governor Latif Khosa thinks all this talk of governor’s rule is “political gimmick” as circumstances aren’t favourable.,"THE showdown between the PTI-PML-Q Punjab government and the coalition in power at the Centre had been escalating for days before things came to a head and the Supreme Court decided to annul Hamza Shehbaz’s contentious election as chief minister.
Now, with Chaudhry Parvez Elahi ruling the roost, the tone of PML-N leaders has become more confrontational.
However, a recent threat made by Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah — that he would move a summary to impose governor’s rule on Punjab if he is barred from entering the province — seems to be motivated more by personal acrimony than political expediency.
Recall that ahead of by-polls on 20 seats of Punjab Assembly, the PML-N-led administration had tried to prevent the entry of PTI leaders such as Ali Amin Gandapur and Maqbool Gujjar to the province, citing concerns of potential disruptions to the smooth holding of elections if they were allowed in.
However, the ban did not work and both leaders were eventually able to not only enter but remain in Punjab.
Perhaps it was in the same vein that PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry had threatened the interior minister with a possible entry ban when his party assumed power again, something that may have incensed the former Punjab law minister.
Constitutional experts and analysts, as well as political stakeholders, believe that imposing governor’s rule is no longer a cakewalk, or at least as easy as it used to be.
PPP leader Raza Rabbani, who is considered one of the architects of the 18th Constitutional Amendment, told Dawn the amendment stipulated the need for a resolution from the provincial assembly, but that didn’t take away the powers of the federal government to independently impose the governor’s rule.
“If it does impose it on its own, the proclamation has to be placed before both houses of parliament within 10 days who then have to approve it within a stipulated time,” Mr Rabbani said.
Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, president of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) think tank that works to strengthen democracy and democratic institutions, believes the president can also issue a proclamation on his own (essentially the prime minister) but it has to be subsequently approved by a joint session of parliament. In that case it could be challenged in a court of law and eventually undone.
“This process is also difficult because at least there will be a delay of 10 to 25 days because the president has to issue the proclamation on the advice of the prime minister, and the president won’t issue it readily. He could seek a clarification and even after that it can take 10 to 25 days. So in either case, it can be delayed but not fully avoided, and during that time the Punjab government can move court for a preemptive decision,” he told Dawn.
On the other hand, former Punjab governor Latif Khosa of PPP thinks all this talk of governor’s rule is just a “political gimmick” because circumstances aren’t favourable for it right now.
“A governor’s rule is imposed under Article 232 only when a province becomes ungovernable, there’s a law and order situation, no one is safe, it’s a war-like situation, [and] there’s loot and plunder. None of this is happening in Punjab, so it’s not easy now,” he told Dawn.
Veteran journalist and political analyst Sohail Warraich abhors the very idea of such a step. “It’s like robbing a provincial government of its rights that in turn impinges on the rights of a province. It’s just a bad precedent and its spirit is undemocratic,” he cautions.
He recalls that the last time a governor’s rule was imposed on Punjab was in 2009 by the then PPP government when Nawaz and Shehbaz Sharif were disqualified by the Supreme Court from holding any public office, giving the late governor Salmaan Taseer the powers to administer the province. “Later, the apex court voided the proclamation and the Shehbaz Sharif government in Punjab was reinstated. Before that it has happened only during martial laws.”
Another reason such a decision is not as uncomplicated as some in the government may like to believe is that courts have to be convinced the circumstances are conducive for dismissing a chief minister and having a province run by the governor, who’s a state representative.
Mr Mehboob of Pildat says the courts have a very proactive role in this process. One has to prove the situation in a province is unmanageable and its affairs cannot be run according to the Constitution. “This is the basis on which a proclamation for emergency in a province is sought from the president. The proclamation suggests a province would be run by the governor. The proclamation can be issued and a governor can start taking over the functions, but this will be immediately challenged in courts where if you can’t prove there was really a constitutional breakdown in the province it will be undone.”
Mr Rabbani — whose party is now in the coalition government along with PML-N — says given the level of political rhetoric coming from both sides, in particular the PTI and PML-Q, “one really doesn’t know which way the cookie is going to crumble”. But, he believes, as of now the circumstances don’t exist for taking such drastic measures, and at the same time suggests talks to resolve any political dispute.
“Going by the rhetoric given by these two parties, a little down the line there may be circumstances for such a step to be taken. But it would in any case be a very unfortunate day because politics is the art of dialogue and coexistence regardless of your principled position. So I hope better sense prevails on the Punjab government.”
Looking at the few days since the new government took over in Punjab, the veteran politician doesn’t see meddling by any side. He says if he uses the association between the PPP’s Sindh government and PTI’s in the Centre as a yardstick, the two sides enjoyed a good working relationship and “I didn’t find any undue meddling on the part of the federal government”.
Hopefully, better sense will prevail, as Mr Rabbani puts it, across the political divide, and those in high offices will desist from using threats of creating political instability to further their personal agendas.

7,1.4m farmers in Punjab get digital help amid crisis,"Internat­ional Fund for Agric­ultural Devel­opment project guides farmers, provides crop-related information.","ISLAMABAD: The Internat­ional Fund for Agric­ultural Devel­opment (IFAD) has said that around 1.4 million farmers in Punjab have benefited from a 19-month digital agriculture project that guided them to receive crop-related advice from agricultural specialists.
According to a statement released by IFAD, the advice was tailored to each stage of the cropping cycle — from how to prepare the land, select seeds, and sow crops for the best yield to how to apply fertiliser, irrigate fields and control disease.
The farmers also received tips on how to become more resilient by using animal manure, tobacco spray, and biopesticides instead of commercial products that were no longer available due to disrupted supply chains, the IFAD said.
In partnership with the Climate Forecast Applications Network, a local weather forecast system was developed to inform farmers what to expect in the coming days.

IFAD’s project guides farmers, provides crop-related information

The statement added that nearly 200,000 farmers were now getting voice notes with regular updates and advisories, including when to plant seeds and dig channels to divert floodwater. Another 300,000 cotton farmers were receiving advis­ories on environment-frie­ndly pest management methods.
The project was launched to provide information to the farmers to withstand the Covid crisis, during which farmers were unable to cope with the new challenges presented by the pandemic, such as finding substitutes for agricultural inputs that were no longer available or cost-effective produce with constrained resources.
In Punjab, traditional gender norms constrain women from accessing farming advice, even though they were often responsible for taking care of the household’s animals, it said.
“Through ‘digital agriculture,’ it was easier for women to receive this information,” the statement added.
However, while 104,000 women received informational messages, more needed to be done to ensure their access to mobile phones which were often only accessible to men in a household, IFAD said.
Combined with other factors, these digital tools were changing how people in Punjab farm. A study found that 34 per cent of farmers who used the platform adopted at least one new farming practice recommended by the programme, the statement claimed.
More than 40pc of the farmers credited the digital advisory services for this change.
The IFAD also said the project’s results made a case for long-term investment in digital agricultural extension, and it was working on other projects, such as a national poverty graduation programme to offer digital services to help Paki­stan’s rural poor improve their food security, nutrition and climate change resilience, using a fraction of the resources needed for face-to-face agricultural advice.
“For the IFAD, this shows why digital agriculture needs to be at the very heart of its work. As the world’s poorest people face spiralling food and energy prices, cost-effective interventions, like digital advisory services, can help them make the best decisions for themselves and their businesses,” the statement added.
Due to the rising global hunger and climate change which was  impacting the agricultural output, the IFAD will spend $1.55 billion during 2022-24 to combat poverty and hunger among the 3.4bn people who live in rural areas of the developing world, said the statement.
The IFAD annual report released last week said that the Fund has “doubled down on its commitment to the world’s poorest rural communities in 2021, increasing support to reach 128m small-scale farmers and vulnerable people, of whom 49pc of direct beneficiaries were women and 22pc were youth.”
The IFAD’s member states have recognised the role of the Fund in tackling hunger, poverty and effects of climate change by committing a record $1.55bn to the agency’s 2022-24 core resources with the aim of doubling its impact by 2030, it added.
“A crucial part of delivering on this ambition will be its ability to expand the size of investments in rural areas. If the final mobilisation targets are achieved, it will enable the IFAD to expand the programme of work to $11.1bn during 2022-24,” the report added.
The report estimated that more than 418m people suffered from hunger in Asia alone, representing more than half of those living in hunger globally.
Nearly 3m people in the islands of the Pacific were also suffering from hunger, said the report, while adding that transforming food systems was the Fund’s key objective in the region.
The report said that by the end of 2019, the IFAD had invested $2.6bn in the region’s ongoing portfolio for 59 projects in 20 countries.
