0,Pims employees want bill tabled to repeal MTI Act,ISLAMABAD: The employees of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) on Sunday appealed to Prime Minister...,"ISLAMABAD: The employees of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) on Sunday appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani and Minister for National Health Services (NHS) Abdul Qadir Patel to play their role in tabling a bill in the Senate to repeal the MTI Act.
Grand Health Alliance (GHA) ChairmanDr Asfandyar Khan, while talking to Dawn, said that services were suffering in the hospital due to the Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) Act.
“The health minister had promised that he will get the bill passed from the Senate but he has not taken any step in this regard. The bill, to repeal the MTI Act, has been passed by National Assembly and now we want it should directly be passed by the Senate rather than sending it to the standing committee for discussion,” he said.
An employee, Tanveer Noshahi, said that last month employees were holding protests and had closed outpatient departments to get the MTI Act repealed.
“However, we suspended our protest after getting assurance from the health minister. Now the health minister should honour his announcement. We have also called a meeting of GHA on Monday (today) to announce our future strategy,” he said.
In November 2020, President Dr Arif Alvi promulgated the MTI Ordinance suggesting that the hospital will be run through a board of governors (BoG). According to the ordinance, the BoG will deal with all affairs of Pims. 
The members of the board were appointed and notified by the ministry of NHS on the recommendation of a search and nomination council. Though the employees protested against the ordinance it sailed through the parliament. 
However, the current government had announced to repeal the Act and a bill suggesting its repeal has been passed by the National Assembly and needs to be tabled in the Senate.

3,HEC executive director gets another extension,The new chairman HEC will resume the office on Monday (today).,"ISLAMABAD: The Higher Education Commission (HEC) has given yet another extension to its executive director (ED) Dr Shaista Sohail while the Establishment Division issued a formal notification for the appointment of Dr Mukhtar Ahmed as the new chairman HEC.
The new chairman HEC will resume the office on Monday (today).
A notification issued by the the HEC dated July 29 stated: “The commission has accorded approval to extend the appointment of Dr Shaista Sohail as Executive Director HEC on contract basis for a period of six months w.e.f 01-08-2022  or till the appointment of a regular Executive Director whichever is earlier.”
A civil servant, Dr Sohail joined the HEC in October 2020 on deputation basis and retired from service in August 2021 after reaching the age of superannuation.
Since then, she has been holding the post of the ED on temporary and contractual basis as higher education regulatory body has no regular ED. The post of the regular ED, who acts as the principal accounting officer, fell vacant in October 2018 after resignation of Dr Arshad Ali.
After his resignation, the HEC advertised the post four times but, as per officials in the commission’s regulatory body, it could not find a suitable candidate. In the fourth attempt - in February this year - the HEC through a controversial selection board finalised some names to fill the post but the education ministry and the federal government refused to endorse the meeting of the selection board.
“Now, we have a new chairman HEC and soon we will start the process to appoint a new ED. Meanwhile, Dr Shaista, who has been performing brilliantly will continue serving as the ED ,” said an official of the HEC.
Meanwhile, the Establishment Division on Sunday, following a notification from the Prime Minister Officer, formally notified the appointment of Dr Mukhtar Ahmed as the HEC chairman for a two-year term.
Dr Ahmed had served as the ED and chairman of the HEC from 2014 to 2018. Sources said he will face several challenges as many issues at the HEC are awaiting resolution.
They said the new chairman will have to face the challenge while implementing the undergraduate and new PhD policies which were formulated during the tenure of the former chairman Dr Tariq Banuri but their implementation was delayed till September this year.
The majority of heads of universities have shown their concerns over these two polices. 
These policies were introduced by HEC in Dec 2020 and Jan 2021 which drew strong reactions from the vice chancellors resulting in the delay in their implementation.
The VCs were of the view that without getting any input from the universities, the major stakeholders, the HEC had finalised the policies which were 
practically not feasible for implementation in the current forms.
Similarly, the new chairman will face the challenge while handling the service structure issues of Tenure Track System (TTS) and Basic Pay Scale (BPS). Officials said above all, he will face the challenge of funding for universities as this year the government has earmarked a Rs66 billion recurring grant against the Rs104 billion demand put by the HEC. 
They said the new chairman will have to use his contacts for getting additional funds for the universities.

The decision was taken after a house, a portion of a road and boundary walls of other buildings were damaged due to a mountain slide after heavy rains in Gulshanabad, Adiala Road. 
However, no loss of life was reported in the incident.
Commissioner Noorul Amin Mengal took notice of the incident and ordered an inquiry against the private housing scheme and the authority which had approved the building plans and issued no-objection certificate (NOC) to the society without soil testing.
Talking to Dawn, the commissioner said the matter was brought to his notice after which he immediately sent a team from the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to evacuate the residents from the nearby area.
He said people living in the area were shifted to safer places, adding that the district administration had been asked to take necessary steps to avoid further loss to public property and human life.
Mr Mengal said as per an initial report presented to him, the mountain was sliding in the private housing scheme, causing damage to a house and the road and posing threats to the nearby area. 
However, the concerned authorities were taking precautionary measures to avoid further damages.
He said it was the responsibility of the regulatory authority to conduct a survey of the area and then test the soil as people had to make houses there. He said it was also the responsibility of the authority to approve building plans after checking the land.
On the other hand, an official of the housing scheme said due to rain, landsliding occurred in the area and damaged the structure of a one-kanal house. He said it was an under-construction house and its owners had not shifted there.
The official said a portion of the road was damaged due to the landsliding. “The road was constructed in 1999 and in over 20 years such damage was minor. Heavy rains were the main cause of the landsliding and it was not the fault of the planner or the administration,” he said.
Meanwhile, the residents of the area demanded that the government take action to avoid further landsliding in the area. They said the mountain was sliding and the highway department should help the residents avoid further loss to their properties.

7,Rawal Dam flyover expected to open in a week,CDA officials say work affected due to constant rain spells.,"ISLAMABAD: The flyover of Rawal Dam interchange project is expected to open to traffic after one week as constant rains have hampered asphalt work.
According to the target set by the Capital Development Authority (CDA), the flyover was supposed to be opened on Monday (today), however, officials said due to the ongoing rain spells during the last few days, the flyover would be opened after one week, provided that rain is mild.
A senior CDA officer told Dawn on Sunday that work on the flyover was almost complete despite heavy rains in Islamabad and initial asphalt work would be started in the next couple of days. He said base work had been completed and on Saturday, CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed and his team’s vehicles used the flyover to inspect construction work.
“Flyover after proper compaction and asphalt will be opened for traffic in four to five days provided rains remain mild,” he said, adding that granular material along with sand fill and rocks was used for filling so that ongoing rains do not compromise quality. However, he said as abundant precaution, more compaction would be carried out and some segments had been excavated and redone to remove any damage.

CDA officials say work affected due to constant rain spells

“Our target is to open the flyover bridge to traffic within one week. Meanwhile, balance works including underpass are likely to be completed within one month,” the officer said.
A press release issued by the CDA stated that due to special interest of the management, the project had entered its final stages, adding that filling work had been completed on both ramps of the interchange. Instructions have been issued to the formation concerned to carry out more compaction to minimise the effects of recent rains on construction activities in order to ensure provision of high and quality travel facilities.
The management has issued instructions to the departments concerned calling for work to be accelerated. All available resources should be utilised so the project can be completed on time, the press release stated.
According to the PC-I, the project is supposed to be completed in October this year and CDA officials are expecting that they would complete it by first week of September.
The project, worth Rs1.1 billion, was inaugurated in July 2020, but work on it formally began in October of the same year, which is to be completed in October this year.
Earlier, CDA faced a setback when contractors (a joint venture of two companies) after completing 50 percent work stopped it halfway, earlier this year, due to the rise in prices of construction materials. The work remained suspended for a couple of months until CDA engaged Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) to finish it.
During his visit to the construction site, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered an inquiry into it and said that it must be completed by September this year. Since then, the CDA management has been making effort to complete it in accordance with the deadline set by the prime minister.

8,American couple makes another summit attempt on K7,Priti and Jeff Wright are the first climbers to climb the east and west faces of K7.,"ISLAMABAD: After becoming the first climbers to climb the east and west faces of K7, two American nationals launched another nail-biting summit attempt on the K7 central, said the Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP).
It said the American couple — Priti and Jeff Wright — came as close as 100 metres of the summit when the crack they were climbing petered out. “That’s when they decided to descend,” an official of the Alpine Club said.
The duo descended via the central route, a canyon with overhanging seracs, some 60 metres high, avalanche chutes and endless crevasses barring their way.
“Although the duo did not summit, they climbed a huge new route alpine-style on a completely virgin terrain. They are now safely back in the base camp,” an official of the ACP said.
He said Priti and Jeff Wright were the first to reach the K7 central main summit and the first on the difficult and still un-climbed K7 central reaching 6,585 metres.
“For good reason, nobody has ever gone up or down this central couloir, but it allowed us to descend 2,000 metres of complex terrain back to the base camp in a day,” the climbers wrote on social media.
Meanwhile, on the 7,821 metres Masherbrum, the Czech team of Tomas Petrecek, Marek Holecek and Radoslav Groh found themselves in a dreamlike setting surrounded by beautiful high peaks but far from the crowded 8,000’ers, said the ACP said.
The trio has been acclimatising on the hills around 6,781 metres Biarchedi for the last four days. The expedition was preparing to attempt the un-climbed west face of the 7,821 metres Masherbrum.
Marek Holecek, Tomas Petrecek and Radoslav Groh, along with photographer Tomas Galasek, climbed as high as 6,200 metres on Sunday.
The expedition said: “It was not easy. Crossing the highly crevassed glacier was exhausting, especially in the scorching heat. For safety, we had to rope up and jump over the crevasses.” 
They described Masherbrum higher, harder and more beautiful than the surrounding peaks.
The ACP also said as three climbers from the Polish Beskid Expedition team — Mariusz Hatala, Piotr Krzyzowski and Radoslav Wozniak — scaled K2 on Friday, Bartosz Ziemski, also from Poland, summited Gasherbrum II on Friday and descended. None of the Poles used bottled oxygen.

10,ICCI urges political parties to find solutions to crises,"ISLAMABAD: Stopping short of declaring the current situation as an economic emergency, the Islamabad Chamber of...","ISLAMABAD: Stopping short of declaring the current situation as an economic emergency, the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) on Sunday asked all political parties to shun their differences and find a solution to the ongoing crises.
The ICCI said there has to be consistency in economic policies irrespective of political changes.
Past presidents and senior leaders of the ICCI held a press conference at the National Press Club and announced that the ICCI will hold an all parties conference for the revival of economy on August 6.
Addressing the news conference, Mohammad Shakeel Munir, president ICCI, said that the grave economic situation faced by the country was nothing short of a threat to the stability of the nation.
“The current economic meltdown is clear to you all, everybody is worried the whole nation is under the stress,” Mr Munir said.
“But the most serious problem is that multilateral donors as well as friendly countries are reluctant to help Pakistan and this is a clear sign that a massive storm for the economy has arrived.”
He said apart from the overall economic situation faced by Pakistan which included energy shortage, high inflation and heavy debts, many things were not visible to the general public and their chain reaction can have serious consequences in the overall retail end, which will eventually hurt the consumers.
The ICCI president said restrictions by the State Bank of Pakistan on letter of credit (LC) and the sharp declining foreign currency reserved can lead to a situation where goods and items will be in short supply in the markets.
“Such a situation will lead to public outcry and law and order situation mainly in urban areas where the economy is totally based on consumerism,” he said.
He announced that in the wake of the ground realities, the chamber had decided to reach out to all concerned decision makers and seek a solution to the economic crises.
“We are organising an all parties conference on August 6 to highlight these issues with the decision makers and pressure political leaders to devise a Charter of Economy,’ he added.
Khalid Iqbal Malik, former president ICCI and group chairman, said that the conference was an apolitical event and aimed to bring all those who mattered to one page because the current situation can lead to threats to the stability of the country.
“We want everyone, including the business community, politicians, general public and even the state institutions, on one page to seek a way out and ensure that such a situation for the economy does not happen again.”
Mr Malik added: “We are not into any political game nor are we here to extend support to any party.”
He said: “There is a need to reduce this political polarisation and bring all the parties in parliament and provincial assemblies at one stage to discuss a way forward and steer the country out of the economic crises.”
He added that the ICCI had already started discussions with economists, seeking their input and collective thought which will be presented in the conference.
Zubair Malik, former president ICCI and the FPCCI, said the country was already facing an economic emergency and among other things there was a need to reform the bureaucracy and the FBR.
He announced that technical suggestions finalised at the end of the conference will be shared with all other chambers of the country and the FPCCI as well as provincial governments.
“We want all political parties to understand that changes in the government does not mean changes in economic policies,” Mr Malik said.
He said consistency of policies was one of the key demands of local and foreign investors from all governments in Pakistan.

11,Artists highlight plight of the marginalised lot,ISLAMABAD: Two promising young artists have brilliantly portrayed the plight of subjugated segments of Pakistani...,"


 
ISLAMABAD: Two promising young artists have brilliantly portrayed the plight of subjugated segments of Pakistani society along with the liminal existence to which animals have been condemned. 
Their new body of collaborative artwork focusing on marginalised genders, cultures, faiths and classes opened at Dastaangoi Gallery on Saturday.
Works by Zainab Zulfiqar and Houria Khan were displayed at the gallery.
The show titled Liminal Spaces highlights the abstract space that the disempowered find themselves in when they feel like they do not belong anywhere, the show’s curator, Amad Mian, said.
Zainab is a Lahore-based artist who graduated from the National College of Arts (NCA) in 2021. Her art revolves around ritualistic flashbacks and nostalgia while coping with invasions of safe spaces within families, generational trauma and the documentation of how these systems affect an individual.
She is particularly interested in how isolation, surveillance and the absence of queer narratives have contributed towards changing her experiences of space, time and memory.
“In these particular works, I have tried to talk about the dissociative state of being and the abstract space that attracts the viewer,” she told Dawn.
She has touched upon some taboo subjects in The Shadow of God in the Garden and You Can’t Please All done in ink and gouache on wasli.
The video series includes I Will Never Forgive You I and II, The Waiting Room, Absurd Every Day and Before the Cat Looks.
Zainab is inspired by Bernard Tschumi, a Swiss architect, writer and educator.
“Tschumi’s art influenced me so much that I have used one of his titles in my current work,” she said.
She is also inspired by Indian artist Bhupen Khakar, famous for his unique figurative style and incisive observations of class and provocative themes, with a rare sensitivity and wit.
“While investigating the construction of spaces still maintaining pockets and traces of the abyss and voids as a necessary precaution, these voids act as liminal spaces for those who do not necessarily fit within their own social persona,” she said.
Zainab and Houria’s collaborative piece titled Takhreeb (subversion) stands out among the artworks, depicting a burning tree symbolising the destruction of nature.
Born in 1996, Houria is a visual artist from Rahim Yar Khan. With a major in miniature painting and minors in taxidermy, calligraphy and photography, she graduated with distinction from the NCA in 2021. She was part of the Maktab project completed under the guidance of internationally-acclaimed artist Imran Qureshi. She exhibited her work at Quad Gallery ’19 in Derby, United Kingdom.
Houria’s work reflects the agonies of religious minorities and the down-trodden class, violence against them and how it is often romanticised in our surroundings on an almost daily basis without any real perception of consequences that the marginalised have to go through. 
She uses fungi and flower pigment to capture the narration of the unwanted, unliked and the down-trodden in society. Inspired by her mother, who single-handedly brought up and groomed her, Houria says, “I have painted the marginality, resilience and agonies of women and the subjugated class.
“Just like in real life, this fungus grows untethered and I use it with utmost precision and control but it still lingers in the background.
“In these particular works, I have referenced the culling of dogs and the unnecessary brutality it inflicts upon them, while the ones who are in control of it treat it with utmost de-sensitivity or even as a hobby.”
Her paintings with Persian titles Kotah Amadan (Forget About It), Gand Zadan (Sabotage), Aashian Giriftan (Settle), Dum Giriftan (Standing in a Queue), Dil Kundan (Leave and Never Return) II, Gangaash (Conference) and the series of Lab Barchedan (Being Ready to Cry) done from shells and stones on handmade paper, gouache and fungus preserved on wasli are amazing and done with such sensitivity and mastery. Liminal Spaces can be viewed by appointment only at Dastaangoi Gallery until Aug 8.
