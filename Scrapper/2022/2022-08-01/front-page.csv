0,Punjab Assembly resolution seeks CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja's resignation,"Calls for formation of ""uncontroversial"" poll body; official says CEC won’t quit because of PTI’s ""tactics"".","LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly adopted on Sunday a resolution criticising the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and demanding the chief election commissioner and other members resign to pave way for the formation of an “uncontroversial and acceptable” poll body for fair elections. 
The move came a day after a meeting of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) top leadership on Saturday decided to file a reference against CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja for meeting leaders of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), the coalition that rules at the Centre. 
Directives were issued to the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapters of the party to get the resolutions passed from their respective provincial assemblies against Mr Raja, apparently as part of building pressure on him to step down. 
Sources in the ECP said on Saturday it was a matter of routine that political leaders met the CEC but the most number of leaders who had meetings with the CEC belonged to the PTI. 
They said just a few weeks ago, PTI vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi had a meeting with the election commissioner that lasted almost one-and-a-half hours. 

Calls for formation of ‘uncontroversial’ poll body; official says CEC won’t quit because of PTI’s ‘tactics’; ex-ECP secretary says move by party may warrant legal action

The resolution in the Punjab Assembly was tabled by ruling PTI lawmaker from Khanewal Syed Abbas Shah and was adopted unanimously in the absence of the opposition, which boycotted the session without a formal announcement. 
The resolution read: “This house condemns the despicable act of ousting the lawful government of the Tehreek-i-Insaf as a result of an ‘international conspiracy’. This conspiracy has led to uncertainty in the national politics and the fatal blows by the imported government on the national economy have caused a steep price-hike and economic deterioration. This house expresses its grave concerns on this situation. 
“This house expects that all political parties in the country will play a responsible role in the current national scenario and thinks that clean and transparent elections are the only solution to steer the country out of this vortex. 
“This house, on the basis of undeniable concrete evidence, expresses grave reservations against the incumbent Election Commission of Pakistan and demands that the current chief election commissioner and members of the Election Commission step down immediately so that all political parties may form an acceptable and uncontroversial Election Commission for clean, transparent and fair elections, which is need of the hour.” 
When contacted, a senior official of ECP said the PTI had been using delaying tactics during the hearing of the prohibited funding case against it before the scrutiny committee and then the commission, adding it was apparently disturbed after the commission reserved its verdict in the case.   
He said that now the fresh disclosure about charity money collected by the PTI from foreigners appeared to have increased its worries. He said the ECP would continue performing its duty under the law without any fear or favour, adding that CEC Raja would never resign because of such “tactics”.   
The official said PTI was free to move the Supreme Judicial Council against the CEC, but pointed out that the forum comprising senior judges of superior courts would never decide a reference on the basis of baseless allegations.   
He recalled that the name of Sikandar Sultan Raja had been proposed by then prime minister Imran Khan himself.  
Former ECP secretary Kanwar Dilshad believes that the MPAs had overstepped their legal bounds by adopting the resolution against the CEC whose status is equal to that of a Supreme Court judge, who could be removed only through a reference to be approved by the Supreme Judicial Council. 
The resolution, he said, might warrant a legal action by the ECP as such an act was unheard of in the country’s history. 
Mr Dilshad said all those lawmakers who had endorsed the resolution might be disqualified as well as jailed for three years under the legal rights available to the CEC. 
No central or Punjab PML-N leader was available for comment on the resolution and the opposition’s boycott of the provincial assembly session.

1,Tax rolled back to mollify angry traders,"Miftah announces withdrawal of fixed tax of Rs3,000 on small traders with electricity consumption of less than 150 units per month.","ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail on Sunday announced the withdrawal of a fixed tax on small traders with electricity consumption of less than 150 units per month in a bid to calm angry traders who have been protesting after receiving additional charges of Rs3,000 in their electricity bills for the month of July.
In the federal budget 2022-23, the government, after consultations with trade bodies, had imposed a Rs3,000 per month ‘full and final’ tax on small traders to be collected through their electricity bills. The government had also guaranteed the traders that they wouldn’t be questioned by the authorities after paying the tax.
However, as recoveries began through electricity bills, various trade associations, particularly those in Karachi — the country’s largest business hub — launched protests.
“We will waive the tax on small shops [that consume] 100 to 150 [electricity] units,” he said at a news conference, adding that all other businesses including industries, banks and big traders will have to pay the tax.

Finance minister concedes helplessness in controlling inflation; hopes rupee would soon recover its lost value; blames Imran for economic disarray

Mr Ismail added that an annual tax of Rs36,000 was not a big ask for those earning Rs1.2 million, since it included both income tax and general sales tax.
The minister also announced that manufacturers failing to export at least 10 per cent of their produced goods next year will have to pay an additional 10pc tax as “the government cannot continue to run trade deficit like the $48bn left by the previous government.”
‘I’m helpless in front of inflation’
Mr Ismail also conceded his “helplessness” to control the inflation adding that “his hands were tied”.
“Controlling the inflation and increasing economic growth should be the top priorities of any finance minister but I concede that both have not been my priority. My priority is to avoid default,” said Mr Ismail. “Let me save the boat first and then I will also serve food.”
However, he added that despite falling reserves, there was surplus wheat after importing additional one million tonnes, while funds have been released for utility stores to sell flour at a subsidised rate of Rs40, sugar at Rs70 and vegetable ghee and oil at Rs300 per kg.
Talking about the measures to fix the trade imbalance, the minister said that imports in June stood at $7.7bn, but declined to $5bn in July as a result of steps like the import ban and slow processing of other imports.
He said the government would continue taking measures to reduce imports and convert the current account deficit, which stood at $17.5bn in the last fiscal year, into surplus.
Pressure on rupee to ease soon
The minister once again tried to calm the antsy forex market by expressing hope that the pressure on exchange rate would ease in two weeks and the rupee would regain its lost value as the government has managed to cut imports by more than 35pc in July (month-on-month).
While conceding that dollar had gone out of control post the July 17 by-polls in Punjab, Mr Ismail said he still believed the value of rupee was far greater than where it was currently standing.
“Fundamentals are in my favour, but speculation and sentiments also play a role,” he said.
The pressure on rupee would reduce as about $800 million paid by the State Bank for oil imports in June would shave down next month, he added.
The minister said that the Economic Coordination Committee had already approved the removal of ban on imports, except that on vehicles, mobile phones and home appliance, but the cabinet was yet to ratify the decision.
Mr Ismail also added that all but one pre condition set by the IMF for the resumption of loan programme have been of completed while the remaining one would be delivered by Monday morning.
Crictising the previous government for bringing the country on the brink of default, Mr Ismail said the PTI government, in is four years, could not match the tax-to-GDP ratio left behind by the PML-N government in 2018.
“We had left it [tax-to-GDP ratio] at 11.3pc and the PTI took it to 9pc,” said Mr Ismail, adding that despite former prime minister Imran Khan’s claim to increase tax collection, it actually reduced every year while he was in power.
He said Mr Khan and his finance minister Shaukat Tarin ran consecutive highest ever fiscal deficits of 9.1pc, 7.1pc, 8.1pc and 9.5pc of GDP in the past four years despite heavy burden of indirect taxation.
The power sector circular debt was increased form Rs1.1tr in 2018 to Rs2.5tr in 2022, while a circular debt of Rs1.4tr was created in the gas sector during the previous government’s rule, he claimed.
“They did not work in any area. But kept appearing on media making false statements and now they question who is responsible for this?”
Just a day ago, PTI chief Imran Khan had tweeted: “8 March 2022 when VoNC tabled $ was at Rs178. Today it has reached Rs 250. On 8 March 2022 inflation stood at 16.5%; today it has spiralled to 38%. Not only is this Imported govt made up of crooks but it is thoroughly incompetent too. Question is who is responsible for this mess?”
 






Mr Ismail reiterated that the PTI-led government violated the commitment given to the IMF in 2021 when it subsidised petroleum products in February.

2,IMF likely to begin tranche release process this week,"""IMF Executive Board’s meeting could take place before Aug 20, if recommendations are sent to the board by Aug 6,"" says a source.","WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is likely to start the process for releasing the seventh and eighth tranches of a $6 billion loan programme for Pakistan later this week, IMF and diplomatic sources told Dawn.
The IMF’s summer recess ends on Aug 12. “So, technically the IMF Executive Board’s meeting could take place before Aug 20, if recommendations are sent to the board by Aug 6,” one of the sources said.
Pakistan and the IMF signed the $6bn bailout accord — Extended Fund Facility (EFF) — in 2019. But the release of a $1.7 billion (seventh and eighth) tranche has been on hold since earlier this year, when the IMF expressed concern about Pakistan’s compliance with the deal.
The last executive board consultation was held on February 2 this year. On July 13, the IMF reached a staff-level agreement on the combined seventh and eighth reviews for the EFF, which has to be approved by the board before it is disbursed.
The sources said Pakistan tried to get the board’s approval before the summer recess (Aug 1 to 12) and sent several officials to Washing­ton to persuade the Fund to do so. Earlier this week, Army Chief Qamar Bajwa telephoned US Deputy Secr­etary of State Wendy Sher­man to seek Washing­ton’s support for the package. “But the Pakistanis were informed that it’s not possible to hold a board meeting before the recess as a number of members are already on leave,” one of the sources said.
Another source said the IMF was “keen to help Pakistan out” and that “there has been no delay on their behalf”, but it was “not possible to expedite the process”.
The sources said the IMF had asked Pakistan to get assurances from Saudi Arabia and the UAE that they would give an expected $4bn loan to the country after the IMF releases its tranche.
“The Pakistanis received, and conveyed, the assurance from the two friendly countries,” a senior diplomatic source said. “So, we see no problem in the board’s approval.”
But other sources said Pakistan had been warned “not to allow the political situation to go out of hand”. The government had further been told that “street violence and protests by the opposition or a government crackdown on PTI leaders can have a negative impact on the deal”.
The US media, while commenting on Gen. Bajwa’s calls to US diplomatic and military officials three days ago, pointed out that “Pakistan’s military, which has directly ruled the country for more than half of its 75-year history, has closely worked with the US and is an official ally in the war on terror against Al Qaeda”. 
“And the calls have helped, but even the Americans cannot persuade the IMF to circumvent its procedure,” a diplomatic source said. 
“Pakistan desperately needs the IMF loan. In July, the fund said it would raise the value of the bailout from $6 billion to $7 billion, if approved by its executive board, usually considered a formality,” one of the reports said.
Another report noted that “the revival of IMF’s bailout package will help Pakistan and encourage other international financial institutions to engage with the country”. 
The report pointed out that since Imran Khan’s ouster, “Pakistan’s currency has plummeted to an all-time low amid uncertainty about IMF assistance”. 
The steady decline in the nation’s currency “has spread panic among its business community” and “rising food prices has made the Sharif government highly unpopular”.

3,Armed people ‘ruling’ KP’s southern districts: Fazl,"Claims local administration, police in southern districts of KP have become “powerless”; says will discuss matter with PM.","PESHAWAR: Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman claimed on Sunday that local administration and police in southern districts of Khyber Pakhtun­khwa had become “powerless” as armed people were “ruling” those areas.
Talking to reporters following the meeting of a tribal jirga of North Waziris­tan district, Mr Rehman said all the southern districts, including Dera Ismail Khan, Tank, Lakki Marwat, Karak, and North and South Waziristan, were under the control of armed people.
According to a Dawn.com report, Mr Rehman said the federal government’s decision to complete its tenure and hold general elections on time had PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s blessing. Mr Rehman said every person should understand the sensitivity of the challenge the current government had accepted by coming to power and called on the people to not vote again for the PTI.
“Voting for the PTI is [akin to] becoming a participant in the country’s destruction and this has no other meaning.”
Mr Rehman, who heads his own faction of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, said he will meet Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif soon to discuss this issue, adding the government would have to seriously consider reports about this situation and determine the root cause of the matter.
Mr Rehman recalled that Utmanzai tribe of North Waziristan had staged a sit-in, demanding protection against targeted killings. He said JUI-F’s tehsil emir, a union council chairman and a provincial assembly candidate were recently killed in targeted attacks in North Waziristan district. “A few days later, four or five other people were also killed,” he added.
The JUI-F leader said no one is secure in North Waziristan. “Local tribesmen know how to protect their area; however, the government has snatched their arms from them and put an end to practices like maintaining lashkar, leaving the tribesmen hapless,” he lamented.
On the other hand, he said, those wielding guns are completely independent as they raid areas and kill people at will. These “weaknesses” on the part of the state have led to maladministration, causing despair to the general public.
Mr Rehman regretted that those wielding powers lacked sense and those having sense lacked power.
He said the state and the institutions have to think about this and give the people right to protect themselves.
He said that before the merger, tribal youth were given hopes that after the absorption of the region, they will come on a par with those in settled areas. However, he claimed, the situation has rather taken a turn for the worse.
He said it was not clear as to what the establishment was up to at the time of merger or what kind of “international pressure” it faced as they did not pay any attention to the JUI-F’s opposition to the plan.
“Now there is no administration, police or development activities in the merged districts,” he said.
Mr Rehman alleged that even the money meant for the development projects was falling prey to extortion.
In reply to a question, he said they had received complaints that development funds were being paid as extortion.
Praising said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, he said under this project roads and power transmission lines were to be laid and Gwadar port was to be built, the second deepest in Asia.
He said Gwadar could have overshadowed Bandar Abbas and Chabahar ports. He said Gwadar could have become most successful seaport, but it was allegedly ruined by the PTI government. He said the Financial Times report about the PTI funding showed that UAE rulers had also contributed funding to ensure Imran Khan’s elevation to power and sabotage of the CPEC. He regretted that once the deepest port was now just 11 feet deep after being filled by sand.
