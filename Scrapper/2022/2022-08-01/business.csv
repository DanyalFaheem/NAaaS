0,The shift behind the scenes,"Over the last few years, the market for banking technology providers has substantially improved.","


 
There’s no doubt Pakistan’s banking is moth-eaten where the same set of uncles push on the same set of worn-out products in a new package while patting themselves on the back during their launch ceremonies. Lucky for the media, they pay decent money to get those useless press releases out as well. Everyone except for the customer gets something, who by now has pretty much accepted that it’s futile to have any hope from these organisations for a half-decent experience.
This is why so many jumped to Electronic Money Institutions despite their limited offerings. More people are hoping for the upcoming digital banks to disrupt the status quo. But all that obsession with pretty wallets and frontend apps masks the underlying shift taking place behind the scenes.
Over the last few years, the market for banking technology providers has substantially improved and gotten somewhat competitive. First, post Covid-19, most financial institutions were forced to find room for higher budgets in their coffers. According to numbers aggregated by Data Darbar, the total IT spending by 27 banks with complete annual reports clocked in at Rs46.6 billion in 2021, compared to Rs41bn in 2020.
Between 2018 and 2021, IT spending has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 12.77 per cent — almost twice as fast as the overall operating expenses at 6.7pc. Unsurprisingly, this has attracted some names to try their luck in this space, with leading software players entering through consolidation.

Over the last few years, the market for banking technology providers has substantially improved

The first was Contour buying Autosoft dynamics, a local banking solutions provider, and then Systems Ltd followed with the acquisition of NdcTech, which is the reseller of Temenos, arguably the market leader.
On top of this, new players — with experience in banking — have also entered the market. Among locals, Paysys Labs has made a decent name for itself, boasting some major projects including the overhaul of the National Savings Scheme. At the same time, BPC Group — a Swiss-headquartered banking tech company with business across the world — has aggressively expanded to Pakistan.
“The industry has evolved over the past few years when it used to be largely dominated by local players. But since 2015, there’s been a growing demand for Tier-1 products, creating room for international companies with a more product-centric approach and higher research and development capacity,” says Ahson Saeed, Pakistan Managing Director at BPC Technologies.
Mr Saeed has long been part of the banking and payments tech industry and was previously heading the global business development for TPS. While BPC has a global presence catering to both commercial and central banks as well as Payment Service Providers and neobanks, its expansion in Pakistan began with software licensing — the core offering. The company now lists the likes of Meezan, Allied and Apna Microfinance as its clients.
“Currently the biggest contributor to our revenue in Pakistan, and elsewhere, is SmartVista Card Management,” says Mr Saeed, referring to the software which basically helps banks with everything from issuing cards to merchant management and integrating with third-party payment networks. “We felt there were gaps in the card suites available in Pakistan and that there was a need for an end-to-end solution that could handle all types of cards be it credit, debit or anything,” he adds.
Now the company is looking to bring other solutions into the Pakistani market and expand its footprint, particularly in the digital banking, e-commerce and point-of-sale acquiring business. And there’s no shortage of opportunities here. As many as 20 contenders are waiting to hear from the State Bank regarding their digital banking license.
It probably helps that one of the applicants, TymeBank, is actually their client in South Africa and the company is serving some of the leading fintechs and neobanks in emerging markets. E-commerce has also been on a steep upwards trajectory post-Covid-19 in terms of throughput, attracting not only new Payment Service Operators/Providers but also a couple of banks.
Meanwhile, point-of-sale, after staying stagnant for a good few years, has gotten a second life thanks to some regulatory changes with respect to the acquiring business by the State Bank of Pakistan. That has led to some fresh competition in the space with the entry of Meezan and Nigerian unicorn OPay. As a result, the number of machines increased to 96,975 as of Q3FY22, compared to just 48,763 two years before.
Finally, there’s the regulatory push which is opening new business avenues for banking tech players. Raast is just one example, where all institutions need to integrate their various stacks into the micropayment gateway. For Mr Saeed, this means the market is big enough and believes they have already positioned themselves to ride on the high-growth opportunities.

1,A case for indigenous coal,Consuming Thar’s coals reserves could bring down electricity rates and reduce reliance on imports.,"

Amir Iqbal, CEO, SECMC

 
India discovered its lignite coal reserves in Rajasthan in 1963. Some 60 years later they have burnt almost the entire supply that helped them produce cheap electricity to power their economy.
Just across the border, Pakistanis began hearing the chatter about the discovery of one of the world’s largest coal reserves in Sindh’s Thar region in the early 1990s. It took almost two decades before the first concrete step was taken to use this huge energy source when the Sindh government entered into a joint venture with Engro Corp and a few other large private investors to set up the Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) to start mining Thar coal for generating electricity. It took another 10 years before the first mine started commercial operations in July 2019.
Currently, a 660MW plant set up at mine-mouth by Engro Powergen Thar is producing the cheapest electricity in the country. Its present generation fuel cost of Rs9/10 per unit will drop to under Rs5 a unit by the end of next year as the SECMC increases its coal production from the existing 3.8 million tonnes a year to 7.6m tonnes by the end of this year and to 12.8m tonnes by the close of 2023.
“It is time we switched to economical and reliable substitutes from expensive import-based fuel mix to tackling longstanding power sector challenges: availability, affordability and accessibility,” Amir Iqbal, CEO of SECMC, told Dawn in an interview.

Consuming Thar’s coals reserves could bring down electricity rates and reduce reliance on imports

“The recent energy market disruptions and the sharp spike in the fuel prices should be a wake-up call for us. Thar coal can be the next big opportunity for Pakistan (after the discovery of Sui’s now depleted gas reserves) to achieve energy security and power our economy.”
Pakistan’s longstanding electricity woes ranging from acute power shortages leading to long-duration blackouts to unaffordable prices to poor distribution infrastructure to the massive accumulation of inter-corporate debt of Rs2.5 trillion in less than a decade have been exacerbated by the recent Covid-related global supply disruptions and escalation in prices. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has lately worsened the supply situation, pushing the energy prices further up.
“Pakistan must rapidly shift to indigenous, inexpensive fuel sources to overcome affordability and accessibility challenges. With indigenous gas reserves forecasted to run out in a decade, Thar lignite is the only viable option for Pakistan to pursue to displace expensive imported fuels for sustainable economic revival and addressing the key power sector challenges of supply, affordability and access.”
Among other factors, growing energy imports are largely to blame for the nation’s worsening balance of payments position as the current account deficit surged to $17.4 billion last fiscal year. Likewise, the increase in electricity tariffs due to surging generation costs is suppressing demand, and encouraging power theft and default on bills.
Thar lignite is the cheapest indigenous energy resource with its 175.5bn tonne reserves having the potential to produce over 100,000MW electricity for 30 years. The heating value of Thar lignite reserves, according to Mr Iqbal, is estimated to be higher than the combined oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and Iran, and 68 times greater than the country’s total gas reserves.
Currently, 3.8m tonnes of lignite is being extracted annually from one of the 13 blocks spread over an area of 100sq km leased to SECMC, supporting the production of 660MW from the mine-mouth power plants. The SECMC production will double to 7.6m by the end of this year and 12.2m by the end of the next. So will mine-mouth generation capacity to 3300MW accordingly. “We are expanding output according to generation contracts,” Mr Iqbal points out.
Thar lignite is costing $60 per tonne now. The planned increase in coal production will bring the price to $45 by the end of this year and below $30 before the close of next. This compares with imported coal rates that recently spiked to well above $420 a tonne — and is still hovering around $375 — from around $100 due to the commodity super cycle.
SECMC has so far extracted 11m tonnes of coal to generate 10.5m units of electricity, which saved $700m of government spending. “The price difference shows the massive dividends the shift to indigenous coal can bring to the dollar-starved government in the form of foreign exchange savings and consumers through a huge reduction in generation cost while sustainably reviving the economy.
“Besides, it will protect our economy from the vagaries of international commodity markets as it will be insulated from global prices as well as supply disruptions,” says Mr Iqbal, who worked for Nestlé and headed Bayer before joining Engro as its chief commercial officer before taking over SECMC in October last year.
In Pakistan, coal power constitutes just about 12pc of the total generation capacity of over 39,700MW. The four independent power producers (IPPs) based on imported coal are bearing a large generation fuel cost, which recently rose to Rs30 a unit for the Sahiwal coal power project as imported coal rates surged to their peak.
Lucky’s plant at Port Qasim is using cheaper Indonesian coal costing it $110-120 and mixing it with that lignite to further reduce its generation cost. It will completely shift onto it once SECMC scales up its production.
Mr Iqbal points out that Pakistan could save $1.5bn annually in foreign exchange by converting imported coal power plants once the Thar coal price falls to $30 a tonne. Likewise, the conversion of the cement industry will save another $1.8bn. And if we convert coal into synthetic gas for urea production, it will save another $4bn a year.
“These savings of nearly $8-10bn are possible to achieve by 2030 by converting IPPs, cement industry and fertiliser manufacturing on Thar coal. But for that, we need more sustainable and conducive policies for expanding coal extraction and use,” urges Mr Iqbal.
SECMC has already commissioned a study for converting the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor coal plants in Hub, Jamshoro and Sahiwal to indigenous lignite. A 105km long Thar Rail project is being planned to connect Thar coal fields with Main Line at the New Chhor Halt Station to transport lignite to the power plants in the rest of the country.
The transportation of lignite by trucks to Karachi and Kallar Kahar shows its movement by road and rail is feasible and safe despite higher moisture. “Transportation is manageable; no combustion encountered during mining or transportation,” he adds.
Mr Iqbal contends that the present energy market conditions have compelled even developed nations to shift back to coal and fossil fuels. “Pakistan’s coal generation of 10-11pc is nothing compared to 56pc for China, 47pc for India and 20pc for Germany. Our energy footprint is very low. Our priority should be how can we become energy secure.

2,Mountains of debt weaken the rupee,"Pakistan has been fixing its balance of payments problems with borrowed foreign funds, increasing debt servicing requirements.","


 
During the week ending on July 29, the rupee lost 4.8 per cent more of its value against the US dollar. This brings the total loss the rupee has suffered since the end of Imran Khan’s government on April 7 to 27.2pc.
Meanwhile, foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) that stood at $11.425 billion at the end of March gradually shrank to $8.575bn as of 22nd July.
Falling reserves and declining rupee are hot topics of heated political debates with some blaming the post-IK political chaos for this debacle and some claiming that the current PML-N led coalition government had inherited mountains of external debts and weak fundamentals of the external sector.
Finance Minister Miftah Ismail says better days are not far off. He expects that after the approval of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) loan tranche of about $1.2bn sometime in mid-August, lots of foreign exchange would pour into the country from multiple sources and the reserves would grow in size and the rupee would stabilise. The SBP, too, has reassured the nation that the country is not on the brink of default at all and the exchange rates and reserve issues are expected to be fixed after the IMF’s lending.

Pakistan has long been fixing its balance of payments problems with borrowed foreign funds, increasing debt servicing requirements year after year

In nine months of the last fiscal year, between July 2021 and March 2022, Pakistan spent $10.885bn on external debt servicing, according to the State Bank of Pakistan. On average, the country’s quarterly external debt servicing stood around $3.628bn.
More recent data on the external debt servicing data has not been published yet but even if we assume that it was equal to the average of the previous three quarters, at least $3.628bn more flew out of our forex market during April-June 2022. (Actual April-June external debt servicing requirement this year must have been far larger. Even in the Jan-March quarter, the country had to spend $4.875bn under this head.)This is one big reason behind the ongoing depreciation of the rupee and the shrinking of precious foreign exchange reserves.
Full 2021-22 spending on external debt servicing can be safely estimated at around $15bn.
When we talk about the rupee’s health we need to keep in mind two important things. First, the fact that imports have grown too large now that even combined forex earnings from exports of goods and services and remittances fall short in financing just the imports of goods. In 2021-22, exports of services fetched $39.418bn and remittances $31.238bn. Against this imports of goods (FOB value) totalled $72.048bn.
Secondly, we spend more than double the amount of our total exports of services or about half the amount of our total exports of goods on servicing external debts. In 2021-22, exports of goods (FOB value) totalled $32.45bn and exports of services totalled $6.986bn.
This shows the gravity of the structural weakness of the rupee. Short-term factors like political instability at home and one-off external shocks like the historic rise of the US dollar in the global forex market or high international prices of fuel and food also weigh down the local currency. But they too have a more pronounced impact on the exchange rate only in the presence of structural reasons for the external account imbalance of our country.
Pakistan has long been fixing its balance of payments problems with borrowed foreign funds. As a result mountains of external debts continue to grow in size, increasing debt servicing requirements year after year.
Pakistan’s overall public external debt which stood at $75.357bn at the end of June 2018 gradually swelled to $100.296bn at the end of March 2022, according to the SBP. The external debts of the federal government alone increased from $64.142bn to $81.294bn during this period.
Growing external debts keep hitting the external sector more and more in two ways: first, it directly increases the cost of external debt servicing — and thus, the further need for more foreign borrowings. And second, the allocation of the rupee counterpart of the external debt servicing increases every year with the growing need for it.
That, along with the allocation for internal debt services, defence, and current expenses of the government squeezes fiscal space for development spending. And then, lesser development spending darkens the prospects of long-term growth of exports and also affects potential earnings through remittances. (Lesser development spending comes in the way of producing better professionals/managers and skilled workers that can earn more per-person wages abroad).
Structural issues in our external sector are serious. It would be naïve to expect the rupee to make big gains after the release of the IMF’s loan tranche. The government has already lifted the ban on imports of luxury items, with a few exceptions. And, after the release of the IMF’s funds, the SBP too would not be rationing foreign exchange for importers.
The first factor would raise the monthly import bill and the second one would increase intra-day demand for dollars. The two factors combined would keep the rupee under pressure. It is also naïve to expect that SBP’s forex would grow anytime soon to be equal to three months of goods’ imports bill — a level considered the bare minimum for countries.
Given the fundamentals of our external sector, this might take more than a quarter, if it is possible at all. It might remain a dream if the exchange rates become too volatile amidst growing political polarisation in the country, necessitating for the SBP to intervene in the forex market and start selling dollars to defend the rupee even for a little while.

3,Rain-driven date destruction,About 80pc of the crop in Sindh has been affected by the monsoon season.,"


 
The landscape always looks picturesque as one nears Khairpur district on the National Highway. Rows of tall date palm trees laden with bright golden colour bunches in orchards dot both sides of the highway. It is usually seen in the June-July period when the crop is about to be harvested.
However, this very view gives a painful feeling these days. Farm labourers had plucked bunches of dates and kept them on tarpaulins to dry them under the sun, as per the conventional practice, but the rains washed them away.
From July’s first week onwards, rainwater in the wake of the pre-monsoon downpour has inundated fields on a wide scale. Date bunches which were still in trees were also damaged to a great degree. Only a smaller quantity, affected growers note, might remain unaffected in case it doesn’t rain more and the sun makes its presence felt in fields. Back-to-back spells of pre-monsoon rainfall have been very unkind to date palms orchards this year, spelling disaster for the crop in areas like Khairpur, Sukkur and Ghotki districts.
Multimillion rupees losses to palm growers and the economy in this under-developed date sector were reported. Rains which started in early July continued until a few days back intermittently. “It is a complete disaster,” said a veteran date palm grower from Khairpur, Qasim Jaskani.

About 80pc of the crop in Sindh has been affected by the monsoon season since the fruit was left open under the sun during the drying process

Last year, he said, rains didn’t cause such damage as the crop had been harvested before the rain spells. “Usually, it starts raining by the end of July/early August by which time growers have already harvested and are subsequently marketing,” he said.
Pakistan is considered the world’s fifth or sixth date producer with a 7 per cent share in global date production as per Pakistan Agriculture Research Council figures. In Pakistan, Sindh produces close to 0.28 million to 0.30m tones out of countrywide production of around 0.55-0.65m tones.
Within Sindh, 85pc of production comes from Khairpur, considered home to date palm cultivation. Climatic conditions here suit the fruit’s production. Around 100kg dates are produced per tree if weather conditions are favourable. Mostly aseel and karblain varieties are grown.
Dates are dried under a conventional process to prepare chuhara for marketing. All varieties are handled in the khajoor mandi of Khairpur and Sukkur, involving around 200 traders. A large number of exporters are associated with dates’ exports besides workers, who arrive from Punjab every harvesting season for work of daily wages.
Soon after harvesting, growers dry dates under sunlight which exposes the crop to all sorts of weather conditions amidst potential risk of damage in case of rains. Reports indicate rains in Khairpur and Sukkur destroyed almost 80pc of produce.
“Everything was floating in rainwater to our misfortune. Around 20pc of the crop might be saved if it doesn’t rain more in the area,” said Haji Khan Khan Mohammad. In his 150 acres orchard with 60,000 trees, he said, he lost 70pc of produce in the Khairpur taluka.
Waqar Phulphoto, another date palm grower, referred to last year’s conditions which he said were favourable. It rained after a major portion of the produce had been plucked in 2021. “I exported 80,000 tonnes of dates safely last year but this year, the weather upset everything,” said Mr Mohammad.
Chuhuara, produced in big quantities, is exportable mainly to India via Dubai. Sindh’s farmers export them to China as well. “From Dubai, dates land in India as trade between Pakistan and the latter has remained closed for quite some time,” said one exporter in Sukkur.
Sukkur-based date trader-cum-exporter Nand Lal assessed that hardly 25pc of the crop might be saved by growers. “I exported 20 containers with 550 bags [each bag of 50kg each] to Dubai last year. Now I don’t think I will be able to export even five containers,” he said. If, for example, 4m bags of chuhara were produced in a season this might drop to 1m bags this year due to widespread damages, he said.
According to Mr Jaskani, the early harvesting of the variety loori had only a negligible share in production and only this variety remained safe. The remainder of the crop was dried on mats under the open sky for a week. “Since the weather was cloudy the drying process got badly affected,” he said.
The horticulture sector rarely gets the required attention from policymakers. The date sector was covered under the World Bank funded multibillion rupees project Sindh Agriculture Growth Project (SAGP) but veteran date growers, who were part of it, believe project authorities didn’t go beyond the conventional approach of distributing mats instead of undertaking some major result-oriented interventions for the sector’s larger interests.
Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB) vice president Mahmood Nawaz Shah pointed out that technology and methodology were missing that otherwise could help in mitigating risk and ensuring better value. “We don’t attach much importance to horticulture as the crop is smaller and the focus remains on major crops thus such areas take a back seat,” he said.
Since, he said, dates have not become table fruit and farmers don’t get the required price they avoid making an investment. “In developed countries dates’ bunches are covered to improve its quality and avoid impacts of climatic conditions inclusive of rains,” he said.
He added sheds are created for the dehydration process that generally is not done here as we opt for sunlight-driven dehydration of fruit which exposes it to all sorts of environmental effects. It requires expenses which our farmers avoid since it increases their investment,” he said.
Sindh Agriculture department says that date palm orchards stood at 41,026ha in Sindh in 2021 when compared with 40,313ha in 2020 and this increase in acreage was attributable to SAGP-related initiatives that motivated farmers to cultivate date crops on a large scale. In terms of production, 224,030 metric tonnes of dates were produced against 219,925 metric tonnes in 2020. Data also showed that Sindh has a share of 38pc in countrywide date palm acreage and over 53pc in terms of fruit production.

6,Adding salamati to savings,"As the finance sector grows, Sharia-compliant banking is growing steadily more popular.","


 
Moody’s Investors Service, a reputable think tank, commented in its latest report that the Islamic banking industry in Pakistan has, on average, grown annually by 24 per cent over the last decade — expanding by 30.6pc in 2021 alone. It is expected to grow beyond 50pc in the next few years in sync with the financial markets of major Islamic countries that have already crossed this target.
To understand this aggressive switch to Islamic banking, let’s begin with a simple insight. Islamic Banking, as the name denotes, is a Sharia-compliant option for handling financial instruments in a rapidly diverse market that is constantly evolving to address new challenges.
According to Islamic Sharia, Islamic banking cannot deal in transactions involving interest/riba (an increase stipulated or sought over the principal of a loan or debt). Further, they cannot deal in the transactions having the element of Gharar or Maiser. Moreover, they cannot deal in any transaction, the subject matter of which is invalid (haram in the eyes of Islam). Hence reducing the risk at all levels.
Perhaps keeping that in mind, the Islamic banking sector feels more empowered to take the bull by the horns. It is this trust in the financing and Sharia compliance (Riba-free) which is the major magnet that is now gravitating the public toward this form of banking.

As the finance sector grows, Sharia-compliant banking is growing steadily more popular with the increase in confidence in Islamic instruments

According to the KAP study (Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices) survey conducted over 10,000 households in Pakistan by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in 2014, 74pc of respondents showed a willingness to switch to Islamic Banking while 17pc were still considering the option.
This shows that a clear majority is not just receptive but also supportive of the Riba-free banking system. So, while we see tremendous growth in the overall banking sector, we also see a substantial increase in confidence in Islamic instruments.
The Islamic Banking industry has gradually introduced various products which can be an alternative to the products offered by conventional banks. The induction of these products was done keeping in mind the demand of the local masses and the compliance with Sharia standards which are established by the global authority, Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions.
Products like Roshan Digital Accounts, housing and auto finance, Hajj scheme, financing schemes for businesses etc picked up pace including Islamic Refinance Export and Islamic Long-Term Financing in the last few years. Roshan Digital, in fact, has become one of the most consistent supports for the finance sector in Pakistan.
The government now prefers to raise funds through Sukuks, an alternative Sharia-compliant instrument of the government’s bonds. And the reason is very valid, the amount of financing is less than the lending cost of interest-based bonds. The savings are substantial, in the billions, and this attracted the government to avoid borrowing from Medium-Term Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs).
Last year, the SBP also introduced Sharia-compliant Open Market Operation (OMO) facility for Islamic banks to manage their liquidity issues effectively. This facility has extended the room for the growth of Islamic banks in the future. Sukuks raised by the government surged to over Rs2 trillion, according to the data released by the SBP.
One important advantage that the Islamic banking industry retains over conventional banking is its non-performing financing which stood at 2.7pc against 7.9pc.
Speaking of the market status presently, out of 25 mainstream commercial banks, five are full-fledged Islamic banks, and 17 conventional banks are offering the services of Islamic banking through separate divisions and windows. Two out of ten microfinance banks also commenced Islamic banking services. A few of the banks are planning to go ahead with Akhuwat, the Islamic microfinance institution, due to its potential to grow big in terms of quick rolling and turnover.
There are presently almost 4,000 branches and 1,500 windows operated across the country by these banks. Nearly 500 new branches were added across the country in 2021 and more branches will be added as we move forward.
These branches not only enhance the penetration of Islamic banking instruments but convert an otherwise non-banking section of the population (people who avoid using commercial banking due to some reason or the other including faith concerns) into a productive part of the growing economy.
Islamic banking institutions in Pakistan are more profitable than their conventional counterparts and their loan performance is better. For 2021, they reported a return on assets of 1.3pc and a return on equity of 21.4pc, compared to 1.0pc and 14.1pc for conventional banks. The difference in profitability was due to lower loan-loss provisioning needs at the Islamic banks, given their better loan quality and their lower funding costs, Moody’s report said.
While given the industry’s growth potential and strong financial performance, we expect more banks to apply for Islamic banking licenses and for conventional banks to convert to fully Islamic systems. We have the example of Faysal Bank Limited, with around 3pc market share, already in the process of converting from conventional banking to Islamic, the report further mentioned.
The share of Islamic banking in overall deposits and assets has increased to nearly 20pc at present. It is set to increase to 30pc by 2025 as per the strategic plan by the SBP. It also plans to enhance the branch network of the Islamic banking industry to 35pc of the overall banking industry and 10pc and 8pc share of small and medium enterprise Financing and Agriculture Financing respectively in private sector financing.
As stated earlier, if we look at the next five-year projections, with the industry growth at a conservative 10pc, Pakistan could convert half of the banking and financial sector into using Islamic instruments in the next 15 years.
The signs are that Islamic banking will be leading (significantly) to further on-board the banked population of the country which has surged to over 20pc already. The use of banking services in Pakistan will increase, the use of cash will slow down gradually and the money will circulate in the financial sector. More importantly, the GDP-to-saving ratio is likely to improve by double-digits.
At least ten Islamic countries have already achieved a significant market share of the domestic banking and financial sector including Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Keeping in view, the demand pattern and growth curve of Islamic banking and the financial sector in the country, Pakistan should be rapidly moving to shift a substantial part of its financial systems and economy towards Sharia guidelines through the Islamic Banking initiative in near future.

7,Barriers to work opportunities,"Employing the deaf, the food truck Abay KHAO! is facing numerous regulatory challenges in Islamabad","Developing economies worldwide confront various challenges in their quest for economic progress. While each emerging economy has its unique set of issues, most are confronted with issues such as equitable income distribution, job creation, widespread poverty, and infrastructural and institutional deficiency. The high unemployment rate among educated youth is one of Pakistan’s key issues.
The study, “Pakistan’s opportunity to excel: now and the future,” by Dr Nadeem ul Haq, vice chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics and Dr Durre Nayab, Director, PIDE, conducted an in-depth examination of the labour force survey, which revealed that the unemployment rate among university graduates is 31.2 per cent.
The sudden increase in the demand for education in the past decade, combined with a lack of job opportunities, has significantly contributed to this high unemployment rate. The high unemployment rate also indicates the inadequacy of educational institutions to connect their students to the labour market. The misalignment of university-industry linkages.
The goal of the government is to raise the standard of the regulatory environment and encourage private investment throughout the country. Pakistan’s rating in the World Bank Group’s Doing Business Report 2020 has increased by 28 points from 136 to 108 out of 190 economies due to recent business climate improvements. The report has used data-driven analysis to track advancements in 190 economies’ regulatory service delivery and business climate since its establishment in 2002.

Employing the deaf, the food truck Abay KHAO! is facing numerous regulatory challenges in Islamabad

The former prime minister of Pakistan has advised young people on several occasions that they should not limit themselves to becoming civil servants but instead pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. To achieve this goal, the government should establish an environment that encourages young people to start businesses and remove impediments to new business ideas from the market.
However, many people (particularly young people) meet numerous challenges when starting a new business. The same is the case with Abey KHAO!
Abey KHAO! is a social enterprise fast-food chain registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). It is a food truck business idea, initiated by a group of university students. They have created employment opportunities for the deaf community by managing an environmentally friendly food truck business rather than relying on the government’s jobs.
Keeping in mind the “decent work agenda” and “environmental issues”, Abey KHAO! has been conducting business in the market for more than two years and has had to deal with Capital Development Authority (CDA) regularly. The absence of a clear policy regarding mobile food vehicles is now Abey KHAO!’s biggest challenge in scaling the business and creating social impact.
The request for a no-objection certificate from the CDA was submitted two years back and is still not being entertained.
They look forward to expanding their business activities in sectors I-8, F-6, F-7, and F-11 in Islamabad.
Working on social impact, a unit of Abey KHAO! can employ 14 deaf individuals. This cause should be highlighted with maximum government and private stakeholders to support the mission ie, to work on reducing unemployment among the deaf community in Pakistan.
Companies like Coca-Cola or Pepsi will only collaborate with Abey KHAO! if they have formal permission from the authority ie, CDA.
PIDE has lately taken several policy initiatives. ‘The Ehsaas Street Hawkers’ is one of the current efforts. A memorandum of understanding was signed by Dr Sania Nishtar, the CDA and PIDE to protect the rights of street vendors in Islamabad. The idea of the food truck business somehow falls in the category of street vendors but they face many operating problems in Islamabad.
The most recent joint initiative of PIDE and CDA is the introduction of paid parking in Islamabad.
The most practical solution to Abey KHAO!’s concerns is in both of PIDE’s efforts. The authority should develop a basic guideline for street vendors and recognise the food truck industry within it, allowing them to operate legally in Islamabad. The parking issue will be the last to be resolved, and CDA, in collaboration with PIDE, will soon be able to design a paid parking system in Islamabad. It will be a win-win situation for both sides since the government will collect revenue and the business owners profit.

8,The need for people-centred development,"Globally, voices are calling for a paradigm shift in government and business policies, signalling the need for a cultural change","Going by public perception things are not moving in the right direction and status quo policies are deeply entrenched in the political economy. That is one aspect of the big picture.
However, voices that are calling for a paradigm shift in government and business policies and strategies are getting much louder, signalling the need for a culture change in the way politics, economics and society are organised. This view is also shared by certain policymakers.
It is against this backdrop that the recent remarks about the economic model of acting Governor of State Bank of Pakistan Dr Murtaza Syed assume significance.
He says “Pakistan needs sustained growth to finally begin punching its weight and realise its vast potential. Our present growth model is not fit for this purpose.”

Globally, voices are calling for a paradigm shift in government and business policies, signalling the need for a cultural change in politics, economics and society

In an article on ‘Sheltering from a Perfect Storm,’ he wrote that “the privileged among us need to bear most of the burden while protecting the more vulnerable through targeted transfers. This is the social bargain we need to uphold to prevent social tension.”
What is apparent from the current march of events is that movers and shakers of the economy are losing their grip over fast-changing realities by pursuing traditional approaches.
The growth strategy pursued for decades tends to create more problems than it solves with the fundamentals of the economy turning more and more fragile. Even a moderately high growth rate for a brief spell leads to unsustainable macroeconomic imbalances. And the policymakers are forced to take measures to curb the growth rate.
The problem of economic growth is becoming more complex and complicated when seen in the context of public goods it is expected to deliver.
Economists say the growth rate should range between 7-8 per cent per annum on a sustained basis to absorb the surging number of jobless. In 2022-23, economic growth is expected in the range of 3.5-4pc — half the needed level.
On the cost of living issue, Dr Hafiz Pasha says there has been an increase of 56pc in prices during the last four years whereas the earnings of the low-income group are estimated to have increased barely by 20 to 22pc whereas Pakistan does not have any income redistribution policy.
Prices of commonly used consumer items increased 21.3 per cent in June from a year ago mainly because of costly imported fuel and food items.
The poor facing a cost of living crisis will be further hit by the reducing job opportunities as the economy slows down. Growth with price stability has become a major problem. An increase in production does not bring price stability.
There is a need for a rethinking of business strategies to have a human and social lens too, says an analyst.
A well-known expert in financial services, Nasim Beg estimates that the government is giving away for free something between Rs2-4 trillion a year in subsidies to banks and other similar institutions. He suggests that this money could be reallocated to social and economic development that will bring long-term gains to the country.
Emerging markets and developing countries are now mulling different approaches to avoid boom and bust cycles which Pakistan may look at in evolving its own home-grown economic model. “The sustainability of our economic growth depends on our success in empowering the majority of our population to participate in the economy,” says South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.
And Chile has prepared a draft constitution which lays down that everyone has the ‘right to work’ and that ‘all forms of job insecurity are prohibited.’ How this will work out and how long it would take to implement this agenda is difficult to predict. Critics say it would not fit any business model. Yet it shows the direction in which Chile wants to move. The approval of the draft constitution will be sought from a referendum in September.
In the US the issue as to which is worse — inflation or unemployment — has cropped up following fears of a possible recession because of a sharp hike in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve.
Yes, a recession is worse than inflation, says Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve economist. She was referring to a debate among economists, which, supported by surveys on the responses of common citizens towards both the problems they face, reaches the conclusion: “Inflation is pretty bad, but unemployment is far worse.”
Former Finance Ministry Advisor Dr Ashfaq Khan says the free–fall of the rupee is taking the economy towards greater vulnerability.
The slide in rupee value is now attributed to political uncertainty and the strengthening of the dollar despite the fact that US inflation is at a 40-year high.
Stable interest and exchange rates are required to push investment, output, exports and import substitution while maximising the use of national resources and talents. Pakistan’s economic growth including its efforts to shore up its external sector will be adversely affected by the emerging international market environment.
In its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) released on July 26, the International Monetary Fund has cut its global GDP growth rate estimate for this year to 3.2pc which is about half the rate forecasted last year.
“Risks to the outlook are overwhelming tilted to the downside,” and if they materialise, the WEO warns, it could push the global economy into one of the worst slumps in the past half-century. Not ruling out stagflation, the WEO said, it could reduce growth to 2pc in 2023.
Looking at the developing global economic landscape, Pinelopi Koujianou Goldberg, a former chief economist of the World Bank Group believes that interest rate hikes by major central banks will not curb inflation and that a more comprehensive policy response is needed to rein in rising prices.
It may be recalled that the then emerging widely accepted idea — a people-centred development — in the 1970s was substituted by West-led financialisation of the global economy to tackle stagflation which seems to be returning.
Things are also getting worse in Pakistan because of political uncertainty and instability. Power politics is in full bloom with guiding cardinal principles of the 1973 Constitution only partially observed. And economic growth is not sustainable in the absence of a people-centred economic development with the required focus on self-reliance.

US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, alongside members of Congress, signs the CHIPS and Science Act, providing domestic semiconductor manufacturers with $52bn in subsidies to cut reliance on foreign sourcing, during an enrollment ceremony on the West Front of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, last week.—AFP

 
The problem with using emojis at work
Have emojis ever gotten you in trouble at work? Using emojis at work can lead to mishaps with clients and colleagues as many disagree on what they mean, a survey of 9,400 workers finds. About 71pc of US workers say messages without them are incomplete in meaning, according to a global survey by Slack and Duolingo. Many also say it makes communication more efficient: “They really can enable us to clarify emotional intent,” says Keith Broni, editor-in-chief of Emojipedia. But the increase in hybrid working and cross-border collaboration also means potential misinterpretation is rife, with 58pc of respondents saying they didn’t realise specific emojis have different meanings. Take the “slightly smiling face,” for example, a symbol generally associated with happiness and positivity. But one in five people in the US and Singapore use it to show exasperation — in Japan, just one in 20 employees would pick up on that more subtle, subversive meaning.

Tips for networking despite anxiety
It is your very first networking event. On the outside, things appear to be going smoothly. But below your blazer, you’re sweating profusely. Talking to all these new people feels much easier said than done. There is a name for this feeling: social anxiety. Symptoms manifest in different ways, but signs might include an intense fear of interacting or talking to strangers, being judged by others, or catastrophising. Here is what you can do: 1) Visualize how things will unfold beforehand. Our brains often don’t know the difference between imagination and reality. If you’ve already walked through the event in your mind, your brain is going to think, “Oh this is easy. I’ve been there, done that.” 2) Write a script. This can be anything from small talk to reflections on what’s happening in your local community. 3) Fuel up properly. Taking supplements or eating vitamin D and magnesium-rich foods several days in advance of an event can be very helpful, as they help to buffer the stress that your body feels.

Multigenerational living
As successive generations of young adults in the United States cope with rising student debt and housing costs, multigenerational living is increasingly providing a respite from the storm. A quarter of US adults ages 25 to 34 resided in a multigenerational family household in 2021, up from 9pc in 1971. Multigenerational living — that is, living in a household that includes two or more adult generations, typically consisting of those ages 25 and older — has increased among all age groups over the past five decades. But the increase has been fastest among adults ages 25 to 34. In 1971, similar shares of adults across age groups lived in a multigenerational household, but by 2021, young adults were far more likely than older Americans to have this type of living arrangement. The growth in multigenerational living among 25- to 34-year-olds has been especially pronounced among those without a college degree.

Silver linings of a recession
Some recessions feed on themselves as indebted households cut their spending or default cascade through a fragile financial system. With a few exceptions, today’s big economies suffer from few such vulnerabilities. In fact, households and companies look strong: the bank balances of the poorest American households are around 70% fatter than they were in 2019. Even the threat of an emerging-market financial crisis — the usual worry when the Fed raises rates — is not what it once was. The main global economic faultline is inflation. Thankfully, it is still short in the tooth. The last time the Fed tightened monetary policy so dramatically, in the early 1980s, prices had more than doubled over the previous decade. Today the figure is only 29pc. If the world emerges from the coming downturn with inflation under control and on the path to greener, more secure energy supplies, the pain will not have been for nothing.

10,Denying Karachi’s neglect,"Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the provincial government insists that the city’s dilapidation only exists based on","Karachi is hurting. It’s in pain over the divided polity, economic meltdown and the debilitating impact of monsoon rains on the already crumbling infrastructure of the megacity. The utter neglect and the government apathy, however, irk Karachiites the most.
Sindh government contested the perception of neglect that it believes is peddled deliberately with ulterior motives. Responding in detail to points raised, Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah wrote: “Transforming Karachi into a competitive, livable and prosperous city is one of the top priorities of the PPP government. We are cognizant that the city requires more investment than the provincial government can afford, therefore, we have leveraged public-private partnerships across multiple sectors to close the investment gap.”
Reports, images and footage of the past week sadly exposed the hollowness of the Sindh government’s tall claims yet again. The distress millions of families endured is hard to describe and can only be felt if one cares.
“The fact is that none of the three major political parties — PPP, PMLN and PTI — who ruled Pakistan over the past two decades can be absolved of the blame but the buck stops at the PPP-led provincial government. Post 18th amendment it was fairly equipped financially to deliver better,” a keen watcher quipped.

Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the provincial government insists that the city’s dilapidation only exists based on peddled perception and not reality

An insider thought the concentration of power in the hands of the chief minister who also holds finance and planning portfolios contributed to the underperformance.
Karachi, where 10 per cent of the country’s population resides, contributes about 60pc to the national kitty, more than what all other cities and towns chip in collectively. It supports more than half of the country’s export earnings and is the industrial, commercial and financial hub. No wonder job seekers from across the country gravitate towards Karachi and end up making it their second home. This perpetual influx, in absence of proper planning and upkeep, exerts more pressure on creaking systems.
There are numerous studies and reports highlighting inefficient, insufficient crumbling social and physical infrastructure, leaving residents of Karachi at the mercy of powerful mafias for provision of the very basic amenities such as water and security. People with higher stakes and deeper pockets buy solutions but even others struggling to survive end up paying through the nose for services they are legally entitled to.
Some years back Sindh government commissioned a diagnostic report by the World Bank on Karachi for evidence-based, cost-effective interventions to improve the management of the megacity. The 2017 report titled ‘Transforming Karachi into a liveable and competitive megacity’ identified issues, dissected problems and concluded that the city needs big doses of investment for sustainability.
The former federal secretary Younus Dagha who now heads the policy advisory board of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry has been hammering the need for more serious government attention and fair allocation of provincial and federal development budgets for Karachi.
A few months back he wrote: “Karachi’s share in Sindh budget fell from 20pc (Rs37 billion) in 2007-08 to a meagre 3pc (Rs38bn) in 2020-21. Had the transfer percentage of 2007-08 been maintained, Karachi would have received around Rs244bn in 2020-21. Around 85pc of Karachi’s dues are being regularly withheld since 2009 when the Provincial Finance Commission was turned dysfunctional.
“Similarly, the share of 6.6pc in the federal Public Sector Development Programme that Karachi had in 2007-08 dropped to just 2.1pc in 2021-22. In very conservative estimates, these cuts by the provincial and federal governments deprived Karachi of Rs949bn since 2009 (Rs663bn by the provincial government and Rs286bn by the federal government) almost equal to the cost of infrastructure gaps found in the World Bank report, rather more in net present value”.
Chief Minister Shah called it a fallacy to assume without evidence that the share of Karachi in the development budget has declined under the PPP rule. “This gross misrepresentation is instigated and perpetuated by some misguided elements who wish to stoke hatred in Sindh.
“The following data holds evidence that the share of Karachi in the provincial development budget has been increasing over the last decade: the size of the Annual Development Plan (ADP) increased by 38pc since FY13 from Rs161bn to Rs222.5bn in FY22 and the allocations for district-based schemes in the ADP have increased by 116pc from Rs75.4bn in FY13 to Rs163.2bn in FY22.
“The amount set aside for Karachi’s district-based schemes increased by 124pc from Rs25.2bn in FY13 to Rs56.5bn in FY22 and the allocation in district ADP schemes has increased from Rs3bn in FY13 to Rs5.4bn in FY22. Karachi’s share in the number of development schemes has increased from 16pc in FY13 to 21.5pc in FY22.
“On the non-development side, grants were released for Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (including octroi and zila tax grant and special grant-in-aid) worth Rs10.2bn in FY13 that increased to Rs13.7bn in FY22 (an increase of 34.3pc).”
He said that the World Bank’s ‘Karachi City Diagnostic Report’ acknowledged it. He quoted the report: “It is worth noting that the Government of Sindh has initiated several projects, especially in collaboration with international development organisations, to substantially transform the city and address the issues that plagued the city due to the ill-conceived planning and development of the previous regimes”.
Expanding his argument he said, “For example, the Karachi Neighborhood Improvement Project is a model worth emulating where the existing infrastructure is rehabilitated and revamped.
“We are strengthening the local government systems through the technical assistance of World Bank with projects such as Competitive and livable city of Karachi and Solid waste emergency and efficiency project.
“Several public transport initiatives are already being executed, most recently the People’s Bus Service has been started. In the 1st phase, 140 buses are running on five routes.” He listed all routes with distance covered.
“A robust network of Bus Rapid Transport system in Karachi with Green line and Orange line has already been completed. The Red line and Yellow line are in the works. The fleet of buses includes 80 for Green Line, 50 for Orange Line, 250 buses for Red Line, 268 buses for Yellow Line and 250 buses under the People’s Intra District Bus Service project that will ease the transport problem in the city.
“World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank have committed a loan of $1.6bn to the Government of Sindh over 12 years for Karachi water and sewerage service improvement project. Phase I of the project costing $84 million is under execution and Phase II costing $700m is expected to be signed by the end of this year.”
Murtaza Wahab, Administrator Karachi also defended the government and mentioned projects listed by the chief minister. “We are working tirelessly to improve the quality of life for Karachiites.”
Asad Ali Shah, a leading professional who keenly follows Sindh affairs pointed out ambiguities in the local government law. “Karachi, already divided between the provincial government, KMC, seven district municipal corporations and cantonments, was proposed to be further divided into a much larger number of towns. Neither the current system is working, nor I see much hope for the proposed revised one, owing to the low quality of manpower at the local level, the large number of ghost employees and lack of accountability for outcomes.”

11,Selling state-owned entities through G2G,"To facilitate such transactions, the government has introduced in the National Assembly a new piece of legislation.","• Their reform is part of the original agreement with the IMF
• The bill does not involve buyback options
Pakistan plans to sell shares of listed state-owned entities (SOEs) to some Middle Eastern countries on a government-to-government (G2G) basis to bridge a $4 billion financing gap for the current fiscal year over and above about $36bn financial plan estimated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
To facilitate such transactions, the government has introduced in the national assembly a new piece of legislation — the Intergovernmental Commercial Transactions Act, 2022 — to provide “for a mechanism to carry out a commercial transaction under an inter-governmental framework agreement to promote, attract and encourage foreign states to have economic and business relations with Pakistan”.
Finance Minister Miftah Ismail says the proposed transactions — initially of LNG-based power plants and minority shares of listed SOEs — would involve buyback options for the government but the bill introduced in the assembly does not explicitly provide for such a possibility unless changes are made later.
He may have a point here but the larger question on the subject has been the politicisation of economic and commercial decision-making. The manifestoes of almost all the mainstream parties advocate divestment of government stakes in SOEs to cut losses and reduce the government footprint in business yet none have been able to do so.
This is despite the fact that these SOE cost losses to the state of over 4.5pc of GDP, according to 2018-19 estimates, including almost 2pc of GDP on account of only three entities — PIA, PSM and Railways. Another 2pc of GDP worth of guarantees are provided by the government to keep them floating.
On the downside, the stock exchange is at its lowest ebb and share prices are at rock bottom while on the positive side, the involvement of foreign shareholding could improve governance structure and transparency in the operations of such SOEs and provide non-debt foreign inflows as well to the government. Because of repeated recourse to bilateral loans, there is apparent fatigue even among friendly lenders.
As things stand, there is no legislation for negotiating inter-governmental agreements. Under the proposed law, the federal government will constitute a Cabinet Committee on Intergovernmental Commercial Transactions and its primary function will be to enter into inter-governmental agreements to allow SOEs of both countries to carry out a commercial venture either in Pakistan or in a foreign country.
The inefficient SOEs have been a key target of the IMF programme since its inception in July 2019, hence improving the SOEs by modernising the legal framework is one of the central objectives. In fact, seven transactions with good sale prospects were part of the IMF’s original agreement. These included two LNG-based power plants (Balloki and Haveli Bahadurshah), two smaller banks (SME and First Women Bank), two real estate projects (Jinnah Convention centre and Services Hotel Lahore) and 19 per cent stakes in Mari Petroleum. None could materialise except the hotel in Lahore.
Furthermore, two structural benchmarks for the end of December 2019 and the end of September 2020 for the creation of the triage of SOE — sale, liquidation or restructuring — and improvement in the laws for governance and transparency — were part of the IMF quarterly review and failed.
Finally, the previous government could finalise by March 2021 a triage of 85 out of a total of 212 public sector companies for their ultimate privatisation, liquidation or retention in the public sector. The overall revenues of all these 85 SOEs in 2018-19 amounted to about Rs4 trillion while the book value of their assets stood at Rs19tr and yet caused about Rs287bn losses in 2017-18.
It was concluded that a total of 25 SOEs, which together earned Rs107bn in 2018-19 would be retained in the public sector while another 14 will be retained for restructuring. Ten other companies were already under the privatisation programme and yet another 24 companies were targeted for sale in the next phase between 2023 and 2024.
The Asian Development Bank and the IMF had been engaged all along till the finalisation of a new bill that seeks to override more than six major laws dealing with the country’s corporate, privatisation, procurement and securities laws.
Some of them specifically include the Companies Act, 2017, Privatisation Commission Ordinance, 2000, the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002, Public-Private Partnership Authority Act, 2017, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan Act, 1997, Securities Act, 2015 and other relevant laws.
The Asian Development Bank and the IMF had been engaged all along till the finalisation of a new bill that seeks to override more than six major laws dealing with corporate, privatisation, procurement and securities.
In a peculiar move, the law bars all courts from entertaining any application against any process undertaken for the G2G transaction and provides complete indemnity from any legal proceedings, procedural lapses or omission in the exercise or performance of any functions unless the act is shown, beyond a reasonable doubt to have been in bad faith.
Moreover, no agency or court will proceed against any procedural lapse or irregularity by any person in a commercial transaction or agreement unless there exists evidence of personal monetary gain with corroborative evidence of a link between such monetary gain to the undue benefit rendered to any party of the agreement.
Also, no person can be sued in his personal capacity for action taken in his official capacity and any procedural irregularity or lapse shall not affect, vitiate, set aside, annul or rescind a commercial transaction or a commercial agreement.
