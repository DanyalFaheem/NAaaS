0,Sri Lankan president seeks unity govt to save economy,COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s new president Ranil Wickremesinghe has formally invited MPs to join an all-party unity...,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s new president Ranil Wickremesinghe has formally invited MPs to join an all-party unity government to revive the bankrupt economy by undertaking painful reforms, his office said on Sunday.
Wickremesinghe took office earlier this month after public anger over the island nation’s worst economic crisis forced his predecessor Gotabaya Rajap­aksa to flee the country and quit.
In a meeting on Saturday with the influential monks of the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, one of Buddhism’s most sacred shrines, Wickremesinghe outlined his plans.
“As the president, I wish to start a new journey,” Wickremesinghe was quoted as telling the monks in his first meeting with the powerful Buddhist clergy since taking office.
“I would like to get all the parties together and go on that journey as well as to form an all-party government.” He has written to all lawmakers asking them to join a unity government.
A former opposition MP, Wickremesinghe, 73, took up the premiership for the sixth time in May after Rajapaksa’s elder brother Mahinda resigned and there were no other takers for the job.
Wickremesinghe went onto become the president after Gotabaya escaped on July 9 when tens of thousands of protesters angry at the economic crisis stormed the presidential palace.
He fled to Singapore from where he resigned five days later and Wickremesinghe became interim president and later won a vote in parliament confirming his ascension.
Sri Lanka’s 22 million people have endured months of lengthy blackouts, record inflation and shortages of food, fuel and medicines.
Since late last year, the country has run out of foreign exchange to finance even the most essential imports.
In April, Sri Lanka defaulted on its $51 billion foreign debt and opened bailout talks with the International Monetary Fund.

1,Two killed as UN peacekeepers open fire in DR Congo,"Soldiers from intervention brigade of MONUSCO force opened fire at border post for ""unexplained reasons"", says UN mission.","BENI: Two people have been killed and several others injured after UN peacekeepers opened fire during an incident in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on the Uganda border on Sunday, the UN said.
Video of the incident, shared on social media showed men, at least one in police uniform and another in army uniform, advancing towards the immobilised UN convoy behind a closed barrier in Kasindi. The town is in eastern DR Congo’s Beni territory on the border with Uganda.
After a verbal exchange, the peacekeepers appeared to open fire before opening the gate, driving on and continuing to shoot while people scattered or hid.
“During this incident, soldiers from the intervention brigade of the MONUSCO force returning from leave opened fire at the border post for unexplained reasons and forced their way through,” the UN mission in Kasindi said in a statement.
“This serious incident caused loss of life and serious injuries.” Barthelemy Kambale Siva, the North Kivu governor’s representative in Kasindi, earlier said that  “eight people, including two policemen who were working at the barrier, were seriously injured” in the incident.
Deadly region
Kambale Siva did not give a reason for why the UN convoy was prevented from crossing the barrier.
There are more than 120 militias operating in the DRC’s troubled east. The UN first deployed an observer mission to the region in 1999.
In 2010, it became the peacekeeping mission MONUSCO — the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — with a mandate to conduct offensive operations. There have been 230 fatalities among them, according to the UN.
Last week, deadly demonstrations demanding the departure of the United Nations took place in several towns in eastern DRC. A total of 19 people, including three peacekeepers, were killed.
Anger has been fuelled by perceptions that MONUSCO is failing to do enough to stop attacks by the armed groups.
UN under-secretary general for peace operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix was in the central African country on Saturday to  “talk to the Congolese authorities”, he said.
“(They would) examine ways in which we can both avoid a recurrence of these tragic incidents and, above all, work better together to achieve our objectives,” he said.
“We hope that the conditions will be met, in particular the return of state authority, so that MONUSCO can complete its mission as soon as possible. And to leave room for other forms of international support.”

2,Former Philippine president Fidel Ramos dies,Ramos oversaw a rare period of steady growth and peace that won him the reputation as one of the country’s most effective leaders.,"MANILA: Former Philippine president Fidel Ramos, who oversaw a rare period of steady growth and peace that won him the reputation as one of the country’s most effective leaders ever, has died aged 94, his family said on Sunday.
Known as  “Steady Eddie” for his unflappable demeanour during the country’s regular moments of upheaval, he was frequently pictured chewing unlit cigars as he guided the Philippines with a sure hand from 1992-1998.
A career military man who never previously held elected office, his professorial conduct was unlike the bombastic image of many Filipino politicians.
He was also the first Protestant to win the top office in the overwhelmingly Catholic nation, despite opposition from some in the Church. He later made an aggressive push for family planning to rein in rapid population growth. But like other top officials of his generation, Ramos played a role in the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, which saw thousands killed and thousands more arbitrarily imprisoned.
In a brief statement, the Ramos family said it was  “profoundly saddened” to announce the patriarch’s death. The cause was not released.

3,Chinese booster rocket makes uncontrolled return to Earth,US officials chide Beijing for not sharing information about the potentially hazardous object’s descent.,"WASHINGTON: A Chinese booster rocket made an uncontrolled return to Earth on Saturday, leading US officials to chide Beijing for not sharing information about the potentially hazardous object’s descent.
US Space Command  “can confirm the People’s Republic of China (PRC) Long March 5B (CZ-5B) re-entered over the Indian Ocean at approx 10:45am MDT on 7/30,” the US military unit said on Twitter.
“We refer you to the #PRC for further details on the reentry’s technical aspects such as potential debris dispersal+ impact location,” it said.

 





 
In a statement posted to its official WeChat profile, the China Manned Space Agency later gave coordinates for an impact area in the Sulu Sea, about 35 miles (57 kilometres) off the east coast of the Philippines’ Palawan Island.
“Most of its devices were ablated and destroyed during re-entry,” the agency said of the booster rocket, which was used last Sunday to launch the second of three modules China needed to complete its new Tiangong space station.
Malaysia’s space agency said it detected rocket debris burning up on re-entry before falling in the Sulu Sea northeast of the island of Borneo.
“The debris of the rocket caught fire while entering the Earth’s airspace and the movement of the burning debris also crossed Malaysian airspace and could be detected in several areas including crossing the airspace around the state of Sarawak,” it said.Nasa administrator Bill Nelson criticised Beijing on Twitter, saying the failure to share details of the rocket’s descent was irresponsible and risky.
“All spacefaring nations should follow established best practices, and do their part to share this type of information in advance,” Nelson wrote,  “to allow reliable predictions of potential debris impact risk, especially for heavy-lift vehicles, like the Long March 5B, which carry a significant risk of loss of life and property.” He added:  “Doing so is critical to the responsible use of space and to ensure the safety of people here on Earth”.

 





 
The Tiangong space station is one of the crown jewels of Beijing’s ambitious space program, which has landed robotic rovers on Mars and the Moon, and made China only the third nation to put humans in orbit.
The new module, propelled by the Long March 5B, successfully docked with Tiangong’s core module on Monday and the three astronauts who had been living in the main compartment since June successfully entered the new lab.
When China launched its first Tiangong module in April 2021, there was a similar frenzy around the possibility of damage caused by an unpredictable booster reentry.
Objects generate immense amounts of heat and friction when they enter the atmosphere, which can cause them to burn up and disintegrate. But larger ones such as the Long March-5B may not be destroyed entirely.
In 2020, debris from another Chinese rocket fell on villages in the Ivory Coast, causing structural damage but no injuries or deaths.
China has poured billions of dollars into space flight and exploration as it seeks to build a program that reflects its stature as a rising global power.

4,Australia PM links Indigenous rights to referendum,Says his government has not decided precisely when to hold the referendum.,"SYDNEY: Details for giving Australia’s Indigenous people a voice in parliament will follow a national referendum on the question, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday.
Albanese’s centre-left Labor Party government is seeking a referendum, required to alter the constitution, on recognising Indigenous people in the constitution and requiring consultation with them on decisions that affect their lives.
Australia’s Indigenous people have toiled for generations to win recognition for injustices suffered since European colonisation in the 1700s. The constitution, which came into effect in January 1901, does not refer to the country’s Indigenous people.
The prime minister revealed the plan on Saturday in a speech at an Indigenous festival in remote Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory.
In an interview with ABC television, broadcast on Sunday, Albanese said details on the voice would follow the referendum, if the proposal won support.
“The legislation of the structure of the voice won’t happen before the referendum,” he said.
Albanese said his government had not decided precisely when to hold the referendum, which he has previously said he wants in parliament’s current term.
The prime minister reiterated the Indigenous voice would not act as a third chamber in parliament.  “This doesn’t change in any way the primacy of our democratically elected parliament,” he said.
The proposal to enshrine an Indigenous voice in parliament was a pledge Labor took in May’s general election, where it ended almost a decade of conservative Liberal-National coalition government.
The ousted coalition have called the plan a  “positive step” but say more needs to be known about how the function would work.
Indigenous Affairs Minister Linda Burney said a formal truth telling process was needed, in addition to a voice to parliament.
“One of the things that we’re thinking about at the moment is what form that would take,” Burney told ABC television while paying tribute to prominent Indigenous Australian songman Archie Roach who died on Saturday aged 66.
Indigenous advocacy group, The Uluru Statement, welcomed the prime minister’s speech, writing on Twitter:  “we all now have the opportunity to make meaningful change for future generations of First Nations Peoples”.
Altering the constitution requires the support of a majority of votes in a majority of states, something that has occurred just eight times in 44 attempts.
A successful referendum would bring Australia in line with Canada, New Zealand and the United States in formally recognising indigenous populations.

5,Japanese national detained in Myanmar,"YANGON: A Japanese man has been detained in Myanmar’s commercial capital Yangon, an official at Japan’s embassy...","YANGON: A Japanese man has been detained in Myanmar’s commercial capital Yangon, an official at Japan’s embassy confirmed on Sunday, the latest foreigner ensnared in the junta-ruled nation.
A military coup last year sparked rolling protests and a deadly response from the junta, with more than 2,000 people killed and at least 14,000 arrested, according to a local monitoring group. On Saturday, Japanese and local media said filmmaker Toru Kubota, 26, was detained near an anti-government rally along with two Myanmar citizens.
“I can confirm a Japanese national was detained yesterday in Yangon,” an official at the Japanese embassy said, requesting anonymity. The embassy is  “in contact with the authorities and taking measures to secure their release”.
The Japanese official, who did not confirm the identity of the detained individual, said they had no information on whether he was arrested during a protest. A junta spokesperson was not available for comment.
A small crowd rallied outside Japan’s foreign ministry in Tokyo on Sunday, holding placards of Kubota. Several foreigners have been arrested in the military’s crackdown on dissent since the putsch.
Last year Japanese filmmaker Yuki Kitazumi was detained by Myanmar authorities while covering the coup’s aftermath. Under international pressure he was released and returned to Japan in May 2021.
Kitazumi expressed shock over Kubota’s detention, and said he hoped he would be released  “soon”. “He is a documentary videographer and there is no reason for him to be arrested if he was gathering materials,” he said.
Myanmar’s junta has clamped down on press freedoms, arresting reporters and photographers, as well as revoking broadcasting licences.

6,Thousands take to streets in Sudan to protest military rule,"“Down with Burhan,” protesters chanted, referring to General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, army chief who last year led a military coup.","KHARTOUM: Thous­ands of Sudanese protesters rallied in the capital on Sunday to demand an end to military rule and tribal clashes that have killed over 100 people, correspondents said.
“Down with Burhan,” they chanted, referring to General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the army chief who last year led a military coup that upended a transition to civilian rule following the 2019 ouster of president Omar al-Bashir.
Near-weekly protests have been held since, despite a deadly crackdown that has killed at least 116 people, according to pro-democracy medics.
“The authority is the people’s,” protesters chanted, demanding soldiers return to their barracks.
Since last year’s coup, Sudan — already one of the world’s poorest countries — has been reeling from a spiralling economic crisis and a broad security breakdown which has seen a spike in ethnic clashes in its far-flung regions.
On July 11, tribal clashes over a land dispute erupted in southern Blue Nile state, leaving at least 105 people dead and 291 wounded, and sparking protests demanding justice and calls for coexistence.
Protester Mohamed Ali said on Sunday that he was demonstrating for  “one unified nation”. The military council has  “turned a blind eye” to tribal violence, Ali said,  “because these problems allow it to stay in power”.
Pro-democracy activists have long accused Sudan’s military and ex-rebel leaders who signed a 2020 peace deal of exacerbating ethnic tensions for political gain.
The strength of the pro-democracy movement has ebbed and flowed since the coup, most recently rocked by a surprise announcement on July 4, when Burhan pledged in a televised address to step aside and make way for Sudanese factions to agree on a civilian government.
Key civilian leaders dismissed his move as a  “ruse”, and pro-democracy protesters have held fast to their rallying cry that there can be  “no negotiation, no partnership” with the military.
Other civilian factions have been more amenable to negotiations, seeing them as a necessary stepping stone to democratic rule.

7,Putin says United States is main threat to Russia,ST PETERSBURG: President Vladimir Putin on Sunday signed a new naval doctrine which cast the United States as...,"ST PETERSBURG: President Vladimir Putin on Sunday signed a new naval doctrine which cast the United States as Russia’s main rival and set out Russia’s global maritime ambitions for crucial areas such as the Arctic and in the Black Sea.
Speaking on Russia’s Navy Day in the former imperial capital of St Petersburg founded by Tsar Peter the Great, Putin praised Peter for making Russia a great sea power and increasing the global standing of the Russian state.
After inspecting the navy, Putin made a short speech in which he promised that what he touted as Russia’s unique Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles, cautioning that Russia had the military clout to defeat any potential aggressors.
Shortly before the speech, he signed a new 55-page naval doctrine, which sets out the broad strategic aims of Russia’s navy, including its ambitions as a  “great maritime power” which extend over the entire world.
The main threat to Russia, the doctrine says, is  “the strategic policy of the USA to dominate the world’s oceans” and the movement of the Nato military alliance closer towards Russia’s borders. Russia may use its military force appropriately to the situation in the world’s oceans should other soft powers, such as diplomatic and economic tools, be exhausted, the doctrine says, acknowledging that Russia does not have enough navy bases globally.
Russia’s priority was to develop strategic and naval cooperation with India as well as wider cooperation with Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and other states in the region, according to the doctrine.
“Guided by this doctrine, the Russian Federation will firmly and resolutely defend its national interests in the world’s oceans, and having sufficient maritime power will guarantee their security and protection,” the document said.
Putin’s speech did not mention the conflict in Ukraine, but the military doctrine envisages a  “comprehensive strengthening of Russia’s geopolitical position” in the Black and Azov seas. Relations between Russia and the West have undergone deepening strain during the five months of the Ukraine conflict.
The doctrine also sets out the Arctic Ocean, which the United States has repeatedly said Russia is trying to militarise, as an area of particular importance for Russia.
Russia’s vast 37,650 km coastline, which stretches from the Sea of Japan to the White Sea, also includes the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.
Putin said the delivery of Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles to the Admiral Gorshkov frigate would begin within months. The location of their deployment would depend on Russian interests, he said.
“The key thing here is the capability of the Russian navy... It is able to respond with lightning speed to all who decides to infringe on our sovereignty and freedom.”  Hypersonic weapons can travel at nine times the speed of sound, and Russia has conducted previous test-launches of the Zircon from warships and submarines over the past year.
In Crimea, Sevastopol governor Mikhail Razvozhayev said Ukrainian forces struck the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in the Russian-held port city early on Sunday, wounding five members of staff.

8,Sadr’s followers dig in for indefinite stay at Iraqi parliament,Analysts have said Sadr is using street protests to signal that his views must be taken into account in any government formation.,"BAGHDAD: Hundreds of followers of powerful Iraqi Shia preacher Moqtada Sadr camped at the country’s parliament on Sunday for a second day, protesting against corruption and political mismanagement.
Despite tear gas, water cannon and baking temperatures that touched 47 degrees Celsius (116 degrees Fahrenheit), they stormed the complex on Saturday after pulling down heavy concrete barricades on roads leading to Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone of diplomatic and government buildings.
The health ministry said at least 100 protesters and 25 security personnel were hurt in the confrontation. Nearly 10 months after October elections, Iraq is still without a new government despite intense negotiations between factions.
Analysts have said Sadr, a mercurial cleric who once led a militia against US and Iraqi government forces, is using street protests to signal that his views must be taken into account in any government formation. Both the United Nations and European Union warned about escalating tensions.
The immediate trigger for the occupation was the decision by a rival Shia bloc, which is pro-Iran, to pick former cabinet minister Mohammed al-Sudani for the prime minister’s post.
On Sunday morning, the demonstrators marked the Muslim month of Muharram with religious chants and collective meals.
“We were hoping for the best but we got the worst. The politicians currently in parliament have brought us nothing,” said one of the protesters, Abdelwahab al-Jaafari, 45, a day labourer with nine children.
Volunteers distributed soup, hard-boiled eggs, bread and water to the protesters.
Some had spent the night inside the air-conditioned building — which dates from dictator Saddam Hussein’s era — with blankets spread out on the marble floors. Others took to the gardens, on plastic mats under palm trees.
In multi-confessional and multi-ethnic Iraq, government formation has involved complex negotiations since a 2003 US-led invasion toppled Hussein.
Sadr’s bloc emerged from elections in October as the biggest parliamentary faction, but still far short of a majority.
In June, his 73 lawmakers quit in a bid to break a logjam over the establishment of a new government.
That led to a pro-Iran bloc becoming the largest in parliament, but still there was no agreement on naming a new prime minister, president or cabinet.
The occupation that began on Saturday was the second time within a week that Sadr’s supporters had forced their way into the legislative chamber. They left on Sadr’s orders last Wednesday after about two hours inside.
The protests are the latest challenge for a country trying to overcome decades of war and now facing the impact of climate change.
Despite oil wealth and elevated global crude prices, Iraq remains hobbled by corruption, unemployment and other woes, which sparked a youth-led protest movement in 2019.
As a result of past deals, the Sadrists also have representatives at the highest levels of government ministries and have been accused by their opponents of being as corrupt as other political forces. But protesters see in Sadr an opposition figure and champion of the anti-corruption fight.
One of them, Oum Hussein, 42, said the sit-in sought a government of  “people with integrity who serve the country”.
She accused Sadr’s opponents of choosing for a new government figures  “known for corruption”.
Sudani is the prime ministerial choice of the Coordination Framework alliance which includes lawmakers from the party of Sadr’s longtime foe, ex-prime minister Nuri al-Maliki.
It also represents the pro-Iran former paramilitary group Hashed al-Shaabi, now integrated into the regular forces.
On Sunday, a spokesperson for the European Union expressed concern about  “the ongoing protests and their potential escalation”. The EU called for  “constructive political dialogue”.
United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged  “peaceful and inclusive dialogue” to form an effective national government, his spokesperson said. Iraqi Kurdish authorities in the country’s north offered to host talks in their capital Arbil.

9,Crypto investors feel cheated as platform goes bankrupt,WASHINGTON: An Irishman at risk of losing his farm; an American having suicidal thoughts; and an 84-year-old...,"WASHINGTON: An Irishman at risk of losing his farm; an American having suicidal thoughts; and an 84-year-old widow’s lost life savings: people caught in the meltdown of crypto lender Celsius are pleading for their money back. 
Hundreds of letters have poured in to the judge overseeing the firm’s multi-billion-dollar bankruptcy and they are heavy with anger, shame, desperation and, frequently, regret. 
“I knew there were risks,” said a client whose letter was unsigned. “It seemed a worthwhile risk.” Celsius and its CEO Alex Mashinsky had billed the platform as a safe place for people to deposit their crypto currencies in exch­ange for high interest, while the firm lent out and invested those deposits. 
But as the value of highly volatile cry­pto currencies plummeted - bitcoin alone has shed over 60 per cent since November — the firm faced mounting troubles until it froze withdrawals in mid-June. 
The company owed $4.7 billion to its users, according to a court filing earlier this month, and the endgame is unclear. 
The letters — posted to a public online court docket — come from around the world and recount tragic results of users’ money being frozen. 
“From that hard-working single mom in Texas struggling with past-due bills, to the teacher in India with all his hard-earned money depo­sited in Celsius — I believe I can speak for most of us when I say I feel betrayed, ashamed, depre­ssed, angry,” wrote one client who signed their letter E.L. 
While the letters vary in their level of sophistication about the crypto world — from self-confessed novices to all-in evangelists — and the monetary impacts range from a few hundred dollars to seven-figure sums, nearly all agree on one thing. 
“I have been a loyal Celsius customer since 2019 and feel completely lied to by Alex Mashinsky,” wrote a client.

10,Israel makes cut in Palestinian tax money,Keeps in place a partial freeze on tax revenues it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority.,"JERUSALEM: Israeli ministers on Sunday kept in place a partial freeze on tax revenues it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority over its financial support for militants, an official said.
The sum withheld, around 600 million shekels ($176 million), would balance the amount the PA paid to assailants’ families last year, under legislation dating back to 2018.
Israel collects around $190 million a month in customs duties levied on goods destined for Palestinian markets that transit through Israeli ports, and it transfers the funds to the PA. When Israel began implementing the law in 2019, the Palestinians in protest refused to receive all funds for eight months. Israel alleges the payments to families of those who carried out attacks encourage further violence.
The PA, for its part, says the payments are a form of welfare to families who lost their main breadwinner.
An Israeli official said the ministers in Israel’s so-called  “security cabinet” approved keeping the freeze in place. The move prompted senior PA official Hussein Al Sheikh to accuse Israel of  “money piracy”.
Israel’s  “policy of financial blockade and steal(-ing) our money” would add  “to the daily escalation in our cities, villages and camps”, he tweeted.

12,Kansas puts abortion on ballot in test case for US,Heads to polls on Tuesday to decide whether to change state’s constitution to remove language guaranteeing right to abortion.,"LEAWOOD: Campaign signs dot the tree-lined streets of the affluent Kansas town of Leawood, as the Midwestern state prepares to hold the first major vote on abortion since the US Supreme Court ended the national right to the procedure.
Kansans head to the polls Tuesday to decide whether to change the traditionally conservative state’s constitution to remove language guaranteeing the right to an abortion.
Those in favor of the change —  “Yes” voters — say it would allow legislators to regulate the procedure without judicial interference.
“It just simply restores our ability to have a conversation,” says Mackenzie Haddix, a spokeswoman for the Value Them Both campaign seeking an end to the protections -- which stem from a 2019 decision by the Kansas supreme court.
“The people of Kansas can then come together... to reach consensus,” she said at a rally Saturday morning. Banning abortion is not the official goal of Value Them Both.
But in the opposing camp, activists see the campaign as a barely-masked bid to clear the way for an outright ban by the Republican-dominated state legislature — following in the footsteps of at least eight other US states since the Supreme Court’s ruling in June.
Advocates look nervously to neighboring Oklahoma and Missouri which have implemented near-total bans — the latter making no exceptions for rape or incest — while fellow Midwestern state Indiana passed its own rigid ban on Saturday.
And in Kansas itself, a conservative state legislator this year introduced a bill that would ban abortion without exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the mother, while a state senator was quoted as telling supporters he ultimately hopes to enact a law on  “life starting at conception.” Currently, abortion is legal in Kansas up to 22 weeks, with parental consent required for minors.
“It really does come down to the amendment taking away that right to personal autonomy that all Kansans enjoy,” Ashley All, a spokeswoman for the  “No” campaign Kansans for Constitutional Freedom (KCF), said.
“And it is a right that we are able to make decisions about our bodies, about our families, about our future, without government interference,” she said.
The vote, scheduled to coincide with primary elections in Kansas, will be the first chance for US voters to register their views on abortion since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.

14,Saudi women DJs go from hobbyists to headliners,Women DJs are becoming a relatively common sight in Saudi Arabia's main cities.,"JEDDAH: Standing behind her control tower with headphones around her neck, Saudi DJ Leen Naif segues smoothly between pop hits and club tracks for a crowd of business school graduates noshing on sushi.
The subdued scene is a far cry from the high-profile stages — a Formula 1 Grand Prix in Jeddah, Expo 2020 in Dubai — that have helped the 26-year-old, known as DJ Leen, make a name for herself on the Saudi music circuit.
Yet it captures an important milestone: Women DJs, an unthinkable phenomenon just a few years ago in the traditionally ultraconservative kingdom, are becoming a relatively common sight in its main cities. These days they turn few heads as, gig after gig, they go about making a living from what once was merely a pastime.
“A lot of female DJs have been coming up,” Naif said, adding that this has, over time, made audiences  “more comfortable” seeing them on stage.
“It’s easier now than it has been.” Naif and her peers embody two major reforms championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler: new opportunities for women and expanding entertainment options — notably music, which was once discouraged under Wahabism, a rigid Sunni version of Islam.
The possibility that DJs would be welcomed at public events, let alone that many would be women, is something  “we didn’t expect” until recently, said Mohammed Nassar, a Saudi DJ known as Vinyl Mode.
“You are seeing now more female artists coming out,” Nassar said. Before  “it was just a hobby to express themselves in their bedrooms”.
“Now we have platforms, and you know they could even have careers. So it’s really amazing.”
Winning over sceptics
Naif was first introduced to electronic music as a teenager by one of her uncles, and she almost instantly started wondering whether DJ’ing was a viable job.
While her friends dreamed of careers as doctors and teachers, she knew she didn’t have the patience for the schooling those paths required. “I’m a work person, not a studying person,” she said.
Unlike other women DJs, she had the immediate support of her parents and siblings.
Other Saudis, however, required some winning over.
Several years ago, a man came up to her mid-performance, declaring she was  “not allowed” and demanding  “Why are you doing this?” His complaints got Naif’s set shut down, but she doubts the scene would play out the same way today.
“Now I bet that same guy, if he sees me, he’s going to stand first in line just to watch.” Naif has benefited from official attempts to trumpet Saudi Arabia’s new entertainment-friendly image, which is often criticised by human rights groups as a distraction from abuses.
Her nomination to play at the Saudi pavilion of Expo Dubai 2020 gave her an international audience for the first time. But it’s the work at home that supports her day-to-day, earning her 1,000 Saudi riyals (around $260) per hour.
Here to stay 
Other women DJs have encountered more resistance. Lujain Albishi, who performs under the name  “Biirdperson”, started experimenting on DJ decks during the pandemic.
Her family disapproved when she started talking about DJ’ing professionally, preferring she strive to become a doctor. She stuck with it anyway, developing her skills at private parties.
Her big break came last year when she was invited to perform at MDLBeast Soundstorm, a festival in the Saudi capital Riyadh that drew more than 700,000 revellers for performances including a set by superstar French DJ David Guetta.
The experience left her  “really proud”. “My family came to Soundstorm, saw me on stage. They were dancing, they were happy,” she said.
Both Naif and Albishi say they believe women DJs will remain fixtures in the kingdom, though their reasoning varies.
For Naif, women DJs succeed because they are better than men at  “reading people” and playing what they want to hear.
Albishi, for her part, thinks there is no difference between men and women once they put their headphones on, and that’s why women DJs belong.
“My music is not for females or for males,” she said.  “It’s for music-lovers.”
