1,Rallies held for expulsion of illegal immigrants from Sindh,MIRPURKHAS: Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (JSQM) Mirpurkhas chapter took out a procession here on Sunday while Jeay Sindh...,"MIRPURKHAS: Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (JSQM) Mirpurkhas chapter took out a procession here on Sunday while Jeay Sindh Mahaz-Riaz (JSM-R) held a similar rally in Tando Mohammad Khan to press their demand for the repatriation to all illegal immigrants, including Afghans, from Sindh to their country of origin.
JSQM activists marched from Mirpurkhas railway station roundabout to the Post Office Chowk raising slogans against illegal immigrants, Sindh government and Hyderabad police.
Dr Niaz Kalani, who led the procession, spoke to the protesters at Post Office Chowk and condemned Sindh government for its failure to take action against illegal immigrants.
He deplored that thousands of Afghans were living illegally in Sindh and they were even busy in running illegal businesses but the government had not yet taken legal action against them. The growing number of illegal immigrants was changing the demography of Sindh, he said.
He said that Sindhi people should remain alert to the situation and if it did not change then all businesses would go into the hands of illegal immigrants within the next few years.
He said that Sindhis would not allow themselves to be changed into a minority in their own homeland and for this purpose the JSQM had launched this campaign along with other Sindhi nationalist organisations.
He appealed to Sindhi people to join the JSQM struggle and force the government to repatriate all illegal immigrants.
HYDERABAD: Jeay Sindh Mahaz-Riaz staged a protest rally in Tando Mohammad Khan to press its demand for expulsion of illegal immigrants from Sindh. The rally was led by party chairman Riaz Ali Chandio, Nawaz Shah Badahi, Mumtaz Brohi, Punhal Jamali and others.
A sit-in was also held at Seeratun Nabi Chowk. 
The leaders announced holding of rallies from Aug 20 to 27 in Jacobabad. Addressing the rally, Mr Chandio said that Afghans had been settled on entry routes of Sindh under a planning. He urged the United Nations to press the state for repatriation of illegal immigrants from Sindh.
He said that Afghans had created their own state at Sohrab Goth and different other areas in Sindh due to which locals were facing terror. He said PPP government was facilitating their settlement by regularising their localities.
He said that this was a conspiracy to convert Sindhis into minority and do away with existence of Sindhis in their own province. He said that since inception of the country, refugees were brought in an artificial manner. He said that now Sindh had 38pc population of non-Sindhis which was undermining their existence.
He alleged that illegal immigrants were involved in terrorist activities, drug and weapons trade and kidnapping for ransom. 
JSM-R vice chairman Nawaz Shah Badahi said that Supreme Court had called for repatriation of Afghans and other illegal immigrants but government had not implemented this order. He said that government had not cancelled their CNICs, domiciles and permanent residence certificates. He said it was good to see CM Sindh talking about expelling illegal immigrants including Afghans from Sindh. 
He said that practical steps should be taken in this regard and this should not be restricted to mere statements.

2,6 drown at Karachi's Hawkesbay as joyful picnics end in tragedy,Seven held for violating ban on swimming in sea; people avoid high tide warning as thousands head to beaches.,"KARACHI: Despite a ban imposed by authorities on bathing and swimming in sea, four friends drowned at Hawkesbay beach on Sunday morning — a day after two boys drowned in a separate incident at the same beach — showing failure of administration to implement the curb.
Officials said that four bodies have been recovered so far while search for two more drowned persons was under way.
On July 25, the Karachi commissioner imposed a ban on swimming at sea in view of ongoing torrential rains and high tides at the sea till July 31 (Sunday). A notification stated that there was an apprehension that swimming, diving, bathing and boating in the sea/beaches might cause harm to public life and there’s “high risk of drowning incidents at sea”.
However, local administration and police had failed to implement the ban.
“We are doing our best and will try even more to save lives and implement the ban, but the people, especially bikers, are going from dirt roads to beaches which stretches in miles and are hard to cover,” Keamari Deputy Commissioner Mukhtiar Abro told Dawn.

Seven held for violating ban on swimming in sea; people avoid high tide warning as thousands head out to city beaches

On Sunday morning, four youths drowned at the ‘Turtle beach’ at Hawkesbay. They were all friends and residents of Liaquatabad. They have gone to the sea for a picnic when they drowned while swimming.
An Edhi Foundation spokesperson said that the bodies of two people had been recovered while strong waves had taken away two bodies and Edhi divers were trying to recover the bodies.
The Mauripur police said that the bodies of Nihal Hashmi and Ubaid had been recovered while search for Shahrukh and Fahad was under way.
Earlier on Saturday, the Edhi Foundation spokesperson said, two boys had drowned at Sandspit. Their bodies were recovered on Sunday morning.
They were identified as Mamun Karim, 15, and Mohsin Zahoor, 16. They were students and lived in North Karachi.
The Keamari DC told Dawn that their tutor had taken the teenagers to the beach through dirt road and the police had registered a case against him.
Three checkpoints set up
He said that the police had established three check posts at Sandspit, Manora and Hawkesbay, where policemen in 12 mobiles were deployed to stop people from going towards the sea.
Keamari SSP Fida Husain Janwari said the coastline was 20 kilometres long where thousands of people came on weekends. He said youths coming by roads were stopped and this resulted in heated arguments between the police and picnickers.
“When they are stopped from moving towards the beaches, the youths and teenagers go to nearby villages and use dirt roads to reach the sea,” he said, adding that many picnickers went deep inside the sea for swimming neglecting high tides, which resulted in tragedies, he added.
He said the police arrested seven persons on charges of violating the ban and FIRs had been lodged against them.
Meanwhile, a minor boy drowned in a pond filled with rainwater in Baldia Town on Sunday.
An Edhi Foundation spokesperson said that six-year-old Shadab Raza drowned in Rais Goth. The body was fished out and taken to a hospital for medico-legal formalities.

4,Murad okays installation of two desalination plants,Road repair works ordered to ensure smooth flow of Peoples bus service...,"KARACHI: The Sindh government on Sunday decided to install two new desalination plants and acquire the one abandoned plant at the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (Kanupp).
The decision to this effect was taken at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah.
The CM said that the desalination plants, each having capacity of five million gallon of water per day (MGD), would help provide potable water to the people living in DHA and old city areas.
The meeting was told that the water requirement of Karachi stood at 1,200 MGD against which 655 MGD was being provided, showing a shortfall of 545 MGD.
Three locations for installation of desalination plants — Ibrahim Hyderi, Ayesha Masjid at DHA Phase VII and Seaview near Village Restaurant — were proposed. 

Road repair works ordered to ensure smooth flow of Peoples bus service

The CM approved the location of Ibrahim Hyderi at Korangi Creek, which is around two kilometres away from Dhari Island.
He directed the local government department to install another five MGD desalination plant near Lyari so that Lyari could be provided water from there.
He also directed the local government minister to talk to a private firm that had installed a 1.2 MGD desalination plant to provide water to Kanupp. He said that Kanupp had installed its own plant, abandoning the 1.2 MGD facility, which could be used to provide water to the city.
Bridge on Korangi causeway 
The CM approved a one-km bridge at Korangi causeway, approaching from the DHA.
Mr Shah set the timeline of the bridge and directed the local government department to complete its detailed design by Aug 31, bidders’ post qualification (international tender) by Sept 30, bid evaluation and award of work by Oct 31, and start of the construction by Nov 1.
Earlier, the bridge was proposed to be constructed under the public-private partnership mode, but now it would be a scheme of Rs5 billion in the annual development programme.
The CM was told that additional 65 MGD water would be brought through Haleji Lake to Pipri via an integrated system. The works proposed to be taken include four packages.
He directed the local government department to restart the work on the packages, from one to three, so that the project could be completed at the earliest.
He also discussed the Hub Canal overhauling project and directed the local government department to remove all issues of the project and start it. 
Peoples bus service
Meanwhile, presiding over another meeting, the chief minister directed the local government department to repair roads of all the routes of Peoples Bus Service to ensure smooth operation.
He was informed that the first route of the Peoples Bus Service in the city was launched from Malir to Tower on June 27, second route on July 1 and now more than seven routes were in operation with 250 buses.
Mr Shah directed the transport department to coordinate with the local government department and start all the repair and maintenance work on top priority. “I want you to complete the work within 40 days,” he said.

6,Rain spells wreak havoc on Karachi's fragile sewerage system,"Stagnant rainwater, sewage overflowing from choked gutters pollute environment.","KARACHI: The fragile sewerage system of almost the entire city seems to have collapsed following the recent spells of monsoon rains that submerged various roads and streets with rainwater and sewage.
The ponds and puddles of the rainwater mixed with sewage are polluting the environment in several localities, which have literally become breeding nurseries for mosquitoes and flies.
The worst affected are the areas in district South, the business district of the city, where two major sewerage lines have sunk, leading to a traffic mess at the PIDC intersection and the link roads, including those housing Governor House and Club Road.
A big sinkhole had developed in the middle of the PIDC House section of Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road last week when a 72-inch-diameter sewer caved in, leaving a 10-foot deep crater and causing overflowing of sewage all around.

Stagnant rainwater, sewage overflowing from choked gutters pollute environment

The same sewerage line had also sunk in 2007.
While the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board was still busy in fixing the main sewerage line, another 66-inch main sewerage line caved in near Shaheen Complex on Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road creating a wide crater that played havoc with commuters and passers-by.
Sources in the water utility attributed the development of sinkholes to overflowing gutters and choked sewerage lines and rainwater going into manholes.
The only possible way to drain out rainwater is to release the water into drains. Almost all major arteries and roads, besides streets and lanes in low-lying localities have been inundated.
A KWSB official, who did not wish to be named, said that the fragile sewerage system was badly affected during Eid days as not only mud and polythene bags, but a large quantity of offal and animal remains also made their way into the sewerage lines during the wet weather due to inefficiency of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board.
“Most of the main sewerage lines are choked and overflowing,” he added.
The rainwater mixed with overflowing sewage can be seen on portions of most of the roads in district South, including busy Shahrah-i-Iraq, M.A. Jinnah Road and I.I. Chundrigar Road.
The filthy sewage and rainwater have been causing hindrances in the smooth flow of vehicular traffic and inconvenience to pedestrians.
Ponds and puddles of filthy water in almost every locality of the city have created a stinking atmosphere and unhygienic conditions, exposing the residents of the affected localities to serious health hazards as reports from several areas suggested that filthy sewage has seeped into water supply pipelines.
People from different parts of the city called Dawn to inform that they had lodged several complaints with the water utility and other civic bodies about the choked and overflowing gutters, but to no avail as so far no effective measures had been taken to drain the filthy sewage from their respective localities.
A resident of Federal B Area said that the administration had miserably failed to clear rainwater from streets, lanes and open spaces in residential localities.
Another resident of Teen Hatti said that Jahangir Road had been submerged, completely destroyed and closed for commuters.
Similarly, residents of Korangi and Landhi said that several streets were completely unusable for the vehicular traffic due to stagnant water.
Situation in Malir, Model Colony, Moeenabad, Saudabad, Khokhrapar, Malir City, Shamsi Society, Shah Faisal Colony and Drigh Road was no different to other parts of the city.

8,Traders ask SHC to declare sales tax collection via electricity bill unlawful,Question how a private entity like KE is assigned govt role; court will take up petition on Aug 4...,"KARACHI: A provincial traders’ body has approached the Sindh High Court (SHC) challenging the new sales tax imposed on retailers through electricity bills.
The Anjuman-i-Tajran Sindh argued that the authorities concerned must devise a proper mechanism before imposition of the sales tax as the same was ultra vires to the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution.
Citing the federal finance secretary, Federal Board of Revenue, Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry, Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry and K-Electric (KE) as respondents, the petitioner, through its president Jawaid Shams, submitted that the association represented retailers and small traders across the province.
The petitioner association submitted that it was impugning the legality of the new sales tax regime in line with the Finance Act, 2022 under which a minimum Rs3,000 sales tax was applicable to all the registered retailers (filers) and Rs6,000 to non-filers across the country through electricity bills on a monthly basis.

Question how a private entity like KE is assigned govt role; court will take up petition on Aug 4

The counsel for the petitioner argued that the sales tax on small traders had caused immense chaos among small businessmen as the new levy had no procedure or defined mechanism while definition of a retailer was also not defined anywhere.
He also submitted that as per the Finance Bill, 2022, the ministry of finance had revised the applicable sales tax on retailers with effect from July 1, and thus it would start collecting such a levy through all electricity bills from the current month.
The lawyer contended that no survey had been carried out for charging sales tax through power bills. The whole system would get jeopardised as it was very difficult to determine sales through consumption of electricity.
He submitted that the effectiveness of such a tax could harm several businesses since the process was not defined because if two or more electricity metres were installed at a shop, how would that shopkeeper pay tax on each bill.
The counsel also stated that the collection of tax via a utility bill had created chaos since a private entity had been assigned the role of a government institution while the KE had already been facing immense criticism and a huge backlog in supply of power.
He argued that earlier traders were taxed annually as per their turnover, which was a justifiable fact and no one raised any objection as it a provision for taking the traders in tax net.
The lawyer contented that an alternative was also discussed with the government during negotiations about fixed income tax on an annual basis as provision for the same was available in law, but it had been ignored.
He stated that impugned amendments in Section 3 (9) of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 was discriminatory in nature against the fundamental rights of the petitioners and pleaded to declare the collection of new sales tax through power bills unlawful and unconstitutional.
The petitioner also sought directives for the respondents to devise a proper mechanism before imposition of sales tax and a restraining order from imposing and collecting such tax till the final order on the petition.
A two-member bench of the SHC headed by Justice Salahuddin Panhwar took up the petition and after a preliminary hearing adjourned the matter till Aug 4.

9,This week 50 years ago: Statements galore and KESC unions’ clash,THE language strife in Karachi had vitiated the political atmosphere of the whole country. In such a situation...,"THE language strife in Karachi had vitiated the political atmosphere of the whole country. In such a situation arguments and counter-arguments more often than not fan the flames. One comment made at the time by the President of Pakistan, Z A Bhutto, did not go down well with a certain section of politicians. 
On Aug 1, 1972, this newspaper reported that Shah Faridul Haq, leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly, and eight other MPAs had strongly criticised the statement of the president that the Opposition members in the provincial assembly played a dirty role during the language controversy. The leaders were of the view that it was not befitting of Mr Bhutto to use such words to hide the crimes of his party. They said it proved that he had not yet realised he’s president of the country and not just chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party.
On Aug 2, the leader of the opposition released another statement regarding something that G. M. Syed had stated. Mr Haq alleged that G M Syed was following the path of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman by raising the slogan of Sindhu Desh. He said Mr Syed’s statement that Sindhu Desh would be the changed name of Sindh within Pakistan was like the demand of Mujibur Rehman for Bangladesh within the country. History was not so old that the people of Pakistan had forgotten what came about as a result of that demand, he added.
The same subject was broached next day by Nawab Muzaffar Husain, an MPA from Hyderabad, who expressed fears that the proposed tour of the province by Sindh Muttahida Mahaz leader G. M. Syed would strengthen the hands of extremists. 
Addressing a news conference on Aug 2, he opined that from the reported press statements of Mr Syed one could easily sense the theme of his speeches during the tour which would nullify the efforts of President Bhutto and others to create amity and goodwill among the various sections of the people.
On Aug 4, 12 writers and poets appealed to the government to release on humanitarian grounds all those arrested during the language riots. They also mentioned that the warrant of Syed Ali Mukhtar Rizvi, a prominent member of the National Awami Party (NAP), should be withdrawn, expressing concern at the situation in Karachi and elsewhere created by vested interests. The signatories to the [appeal] statement were: Rais Amrohvi, Syed Mohammad Taqi, Abbas Ahmed Abbasi, Ibrahim Jalis, Khalid Alig, Jaun Elia, Tahseen Sarwari, Sultan Mehar, Mushfiq Khwaja, Naseer Turabi, Nayyar Nadim and Shamim Naved. 
Sadly, amity in those days was something hard to find not just among the political lot but among co-workers of a power supplying company. 
On Aug 3, at least six persons were injured in a clash between members of two rival unions of the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC, now KE) at Aimi House. The trouble started when the general secretary of the KESC Mazdoor Union, Mohammad Ishaque, came for negotiations with the management on certain matters, which were agreed upon at a meeting with some senior KESC officials earlier. He was allegedly beaten up by a group of workers belonging to a rival union. When the joint secretary of the Mazdoor Union arrived, he was also assaulted, along with four others. 
Later, the police arrived and arrested six men.

He said Rs110 billion was earmarked for the Higher Education Commission in the budget that was significantly higher than allocation made by the previous government.
He said that provinces had certain reservations over the single national curriculum introduced by the previous government so reforms were made and a national curriculum had been introduced while specifying minimum benchmarks.
Earlier, IBCC Secretary Dr Ghulam Ali Mallah said that the IBCC issued equivalence certificates for foreign educational qualification certificates and hundreds of certificates were registered with the committee for the purpose.
He said that for facilitation of students the entire process of equivalence certification had been digitised and over 40 per cent of applications were being submitted online while fees in this regard could be submitted in any branch of all the banks around the country.

The office of the provincial ombudsman sent a notice to KWSB officials Hanif Baloch and Usman Khaskheli stating that their staff concerned did not take any effective measure for proper supply of water in the said area.
“This indicates mismanagement on the part of KSWB,” it said, directing the officials to take immediate action against the staffers and ensure sufficient supply of water in the area.
The directives came on the plea of affected residents of Federal B Area’s Block 9. They complained that around 48 houses — from R-23 to R-60 — were not getting water since long.
Talking to Dawn, one of the affected residents, Aftab Alam, alleged that their share of water was allegedly diverted by KWSB staff to nearby residential and commercial buildings.
He said that an unauthorised water storage tank was constructed at a public park in Federal B Area’s Block 7, close to the houses of affected residents, and water meant for them was diverted and stored in the illegal facility.
Mr Alam demanded that the anti-water theft team of the local government department visit the said park and take action against the illegal water storage facility forthwith.

14,"Nothing being done to rescue thousands of marooned villagers, says PTI leader",Visits flooded areas of Dadu district...,"DADU: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader and former Sindh chief minister Liaquat Ali Jatoi on Sunday strongly criticised the provincial government for failing to undertake any relief and rescue operation in any part of the province, which was hit by a natural calamity. Thousands of people were marooned in the Kachho belt alone and had been waiting for relief and rescue for 11 days but neither any step was being taken to save their lives nor were proper arrangements being made to shift them to safe places, he said.
Mr Jatoi was speaking to the media in Johi after visiting Wahi Pandhi, Drig Bala, Haji Khan and other flooding-hit towns and villages in the Kachho area along with Sindh PTI vice president and former Dadu district nazim Karim Khan Jatoi on Sunday. 
The former CM said that during his visit, he could not see any government functionaries or volunteers helping out marooned men, women and children trapped in their destroyed villages. He also refuted Dadu deputy commissioner’s claim that boats were employed to shift people to safe places.
The Pakistan Peoples Party-led Sindh government did have funds amounting to billions of rupees but it seemed not ready to spend even on saving lives of poor and needy people, he said.

Visits flooded areas of Dadu district

The federal government, as well as corporate sector earning billions from oil and gas exploration in the area, also appeared indifferent to the affected people’s woes in their hour of need, he lamented.
Liaquat Jatoi and Karim Jatoi pointed out that road communication between each two of several hundred villages of Kachho belt was cut off by torrential rains and hill torrents and Johi also remained disconnected from them for many days but rehabilitation work had not been started till date.  
They noted that millions of rupees were got released in the name of water supply schemes every year but no such scheme was visible. All departments remained plagued with corruption over the tenures of PPP government, they added. 
They noted that heirs of a youth, Ali Khoso, revealed that he drowned in flood water while struggling to save his child from drowning near Johi. The family alleged that despite his hue and cry, the assistant commissioner of Johi and mukhtiarkar did not move to arrange a boat to rescue them. PPP ministers and lawmakers from the district did not render any service to people over the last 15 years of the party’s rule over Sindh, they deplored.
Liaquat Jatoi pointed out that bridges were built in the Kachho belt and major development works carried out in some other areas including Wahi Pandhi, Haji Khan Road and Gorakh Hills during his tenure as federal minister. He said he had also established electricity grid station in the Kachho area.
He condemned that law and order in Mehar was worsening but instead of arresting offenders, police at the behest of PPP government had recently implicated around 300 PTI workers in fake cases.

The veteran leader of Pakistan Peoples Party said at a ceremony for the distribution of offer letters among the successful candidates who had passed job test for teacher at Sukkur IBA on Sunday that the Martial Laws promoted culture of Kalashnikov, heroin, terrorism and Talibanisation in the country.
Even three rivers were sold out during the military rules but no one raised any objection and even so-called courageous journalists dared not raise such questions, he said.
He said that people were being misguided about politicians and made to believe that they preferred leading luxurious and ostentatious life to serving public.
Politicians had given many great things to Pakistan such as constitution, atom bomb, missile system and other programs and projects yet they were maligned on media, he said.
Shah said that he had always tried his best to serve people because he believed it was the greatest ‘jihad’ to fight against ones’ own ‘nafs’ and serve nation. 
About the status of teacher in society, he said that teaches were respectable because the Prophet (SAW) himself had raised their status. It was a prime duty of parents and teachers to teach children and make them a better citizen, he said.
He took credit for making Sukkur city a centre of education with five universities. Work on an IT tower and COMSAT Center would commence shortly while NICVD and cancer hospital would be inaugurated soon in Sukkur, said Shah.
He said that youth were nowadays being brainwashed as they were seen smoking and misbehaving with teachers and parents. 
About the role of a woman, he said that the development of the country depended on educated woman because a child received primary education in her lap. 80 per cent women were less educated or uneducated in the country, said the minister.
Truth was distorted and lies were fabricated on social media to spread misinformation among people, he said. 
He said that a politician who told lies was not a true politician as a man should rather die than tell a lie. A politician commented on social media about the dead bodies stuck at Sukkur barrage gates and claimed they were of people killed in a clash, he said. “When I phoned him and explained to him the real reasons behind the floating bodies, he deleted the post,” said Shah.
He said that issues about free-will marriage were discussed at great length but the real issues were not raised and debated on. It was a pity that governments were congratulated on clinching deals with the Internal Monetary Fund, he said.

17,Two Shia bodies settle year-long issue of majalis at Qadam Gah,"DC, SSP play important role in negotiations...","HYDERABAD: Observance of Azadari in Hyderabad began on Sunday in somewhat unpleasant manner amid tension between two Shia organisations over holding of Majalis (congregations) at Qadam Gah Maula Ali. 
A tense situation had already prevailed in and around the Qadam Gah as Anjuman-i-Imamia Sindh (AIS) several days back expressed its intention not to let Anjuman-i-Hyderi (AH) to hold its Majalis at the place despite having legal permits. The 10-day Majalis at Qadam Gah are held for almost seven decades.
Never before this year such a situation had been witnessed at Qadam Gah over holding of traditional programmes of Muharram. Police contingent remained deployed there. On Sunday, the AH was finally allowed to organise its Majalis as per the tradition after intervention of the Hyderabad deputy commissioner and SSP.
SSP Amjad Shaikh made it sure that the already set traditions were not disturbed. “I told them that no deviation could be accepted a far as observance of days including 10-day Majalis, central and 8th Rabiul Awwal processions is concerned,” the SSP told Dawn on Sunday, implying that the AH would hold its 10-day Majalis as per schedule and traditions.

DC, SSP play important role in negotiations

Trouble had started last year when the AIS, the custodian and management of Qadam Gah, had informed the AH that it would not allow it to hold the 10-day Majalis regardless of the tradition. The move was unacceptable to the AH.
The Qadam Gah, considered to be sacred not only in Fiqah-i-Jafria but also in Ahl-i-Sunnat’s Barelvi school of thought, is located off Station Road. A prayer mat of stone with imprints of Hazrat Ali Murtaza’s forehead, hands, knees and feet in position of prostration. It was brought by Talpurs from Iran in 1805. Since then the site is frequented by faithful.
Hyderabad-based AH, registered in 1948, has permits to stage the city’s central Ashura procession on 10th of Muharram, 10-day Majlis from Ist to 10th of Muharram, 10-day Majlis from 28th of Safar to 8th of Rabiul Awwal and ‘chup tazia’ procession on 8th of Rabiul Awwal.
However, The Shia sect calls Muharram’s first 10 days as ‘Ashra-i-Oola’ and Safar-Rabiul Awwal 10-day period as ‘Ashra-i-Akhir’.
For several days, AH and AIS had been talking to each other, directly or indirectly, but the talks remained inconclusive. One round of talks was held at the Hyderabad DC’s house in the presence of DC Fuad Soomro a few days back but still the matter remained unresolved.
On Saturday, the AH leadership brought things on record expressing its resolve to hold its Majalis at Qadam Gah “come what may”. At a press conference addressed by its acting president Ali Jawad Ansari, the AH made it clear that it would hold its first Majlis on the 1st of Muharram at Qadam Gah. He referred to a charter of demands drafted by the AIS which, he said, his organisation had refused to accept as it asked the AH would to hold its Majlais at Karbala Dadan Shah and not at Qadam Gah. The charger allowed the AH to continue to stage Ashura’s central and chup tazia processions.
Ghulam Mohammad Rind alias Chanda —chairman of the committee that had been mediating in the matter between the two sides for a year — spoke at length at the press conference. 
“Actually the administration is afraid of Sindh NAB’s DG Dr Najaf Mirza, who is brother of AIS’s Sadiq Mirza”, Mr Rind said.
“The AH has been holding its permitted events for decades. I, as the committee chairman, had asked the AIS to explain how the AH can be denied these activities and if there is anything wrong on the part of the AH, the latter can be asked to rectify it. The AIS, he said, was custodian of Qadam Gah but it couldn’t restrain the AH from holding its activities as it has valid permits for the events”.
Sadiq Mirza, the head of Qadam Gah’s management committee, had insisted on Saturday night that: “We will not allow them [AH] to hold 10-day Majlis of Muharram but it can hold the Ashura central and chupa tazia processions.” Mr  Mirza is brother of Dr Najaf Mirza.
Mr Ansari said: “We won’t tolerate obstruction in observance of days”. 
According to Nawaz Bhutto, the AIS had started creating problems during last year’s Ashra-i-Akhir. “We had settled things somehow. AIS is again behaving in a manner not acceptable to us,” he said.
“AIS is acting quite childishly rather foolishly. AIS can’t just do it as the AH has every right to hold its traditional programmes before and during Muharram,” remarked Kazim Mirza, a former AIS member. He served as head of Qadam Gah’s management for 11 years (1994-2005). AIS had revoked his basic membership and he filed a case which is pending adjudication. “My membership was cancelled by AIS’s patrons when they dissolved my management,” he said.
He accused AIS of trying to create chaos. AIS can’t deny anything to AH since it has valid permits for religious activities,” he said while referring to Mehfil-i-Hussaini, which holds one of the big Majlis on Station Road.
“Same goes for Qadam Gah for which the AH has valid permits to hold Majlais and start central and other processions. Even AIS can’t hold programmes at Qadam Gah sans permits. It is tantamount to causing provocation,” he remarked. 
DC Fuad talked to the Hyderabad SSP who eventually got the issue settled amicably.
