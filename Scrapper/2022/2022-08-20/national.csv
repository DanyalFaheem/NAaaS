0,Pakistan again urges US to unfreeze Afghan assets,Calls for allowing Taliban regime to use these funds for dealing with economic and humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday urged the United States again to unfr­ee­­ze Afghan assets and condit­ionally allow the Taliban regime to use those funds for dealing with the economic and humanitarian crisis in the war-ravaged country.  
Foreign Office spokesman Asim Iftikhar, at a weekly media conference, said the Afghan assets held in the US should be released urgently and “in a manner that would make it easier for the interim authorities to utilise this money.”  
He was responding to a question relating to reports that the process for the unfreezing of the funds could face delays because of renewed concerns in the US, after Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri’s killing in Kabul late last month, that the money could be diverted to terrorist groups.  
The US government had last year frozen $7 billion, ow­­ned by Afghanistan, aft­er the Taliban took over con­trol of the country. President Bid­en, earlier this year, split this amount equally between the families of victims of the Sept 11 terror attacks and aid for suffering Afghans.
Washington has since then been establishing a process for the release of those funds. Zawahiri’s kill­ing has reinforced doubts in the US about Taliban’s cou­n­­­ter-terrorism commit­me­nts.  
Mr Iftikhar recalled that Pakistan too wants that the release “shouldn’t be done without strings attached”. He particularly noted that the US provided a lot of hum­anitarian assistance for Afg­hanistan over the past year.  
The spokesman, while referring to recent visit by Centcom chief Gen Michael Kurilla and other bilateral engagements said that be­­sides the bilateral agen­­da, the two sides also discussed the situation in Afghanistan.  
“As far as this ministry and the political leadership are concerned, we recognise that, and I think similar recognition is there at the other end in Washington, that this is an important relationship, which we have to build on the basis of trust, mutual interest and mutual benefit. We will continue to do that,” he said about the efforts to rebuild ties after the crisis witnessed in the relationship earlier in the year because of allegations that the US government conspired to oust former prime minister Imran Khan from office.

1,Parliament panel sees loopholes in judges’ appointment process,Body okays ‘initiation committee’ to nominate names for consideration.,"ISLAMABAD: The Standing Committee on Law and Justice of Senate on Friday observed loopholes in the process for appointment of judges in the superior judiciary and stressed the need for empowering the parliamentary committee for such appointments.
The committee’s chairman, Barrister Ali Zafar, said that without independence of judiciary no nation could progress or society function and no state could survive.
In order to ensure indepen­de­nce of the judiciary, Barrister Zafar said the two most important things were transparency and security in the pro­cess of appointment and removal of judges. 
Tracing the history of appoint­ments and removal of judges, he said that previously there used to be an unofficial process of consultations between the executive and chief justices concerned and then judges would be appointed, but through the 18th and 19th amendments, a more transparent and robust process had been introduced in which the judges would be appointed in stage one by a judicial commission and then in stage two by a parliamentary committee.

Body okays ‘initiation committee’ to nominate names for consideration

He said that through a judgement of the Supreme Court, the powers of the parliamentary committee had been taken away, thereby denying it any role in approving or rejecting nominations of judges made by the judicial commission and, hence, the parliamentary committee had now been made a toothless body.
Barrister Zafar further said that a recent meeting of the judicial commission also showed there was need to maintain a balance between the executive and the chief justices so that in the matter of appointment of judges, the decision could be made in a more transparent and structured manner.
Regarding amendments, he said there were three potential areas. Firstly, the composition of the judicial commission had been changed and now instead of five judges being part of the judicial commission there would now be four judges, including the chief justice of Pakistan, while three others would be represented by the law minister, attorney general for Pakistan and a representative of the Pakistan Bar Council.
In this manner, he said, the majority of the judicial commission would still remain with the judges.
Barrister Zafar further said that the second part related to re-empowering the parliamentary committee and it had been decided that the parliamentary committee may accept or reject the nominations of the judicial commission and that its decision shall not be subject to challenge in the Supreme Court or a high court. 
In this manner, he said there would be a two-layered process to ensure that the best person was appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court.
The amendment also proposed that there would be an initiation committee which would nominate judges of high courts for conside­ration of the judicial commission and the parliamentary committee. 
Previously, there was no initiation committee and nominations for the appointment of high courts’ judges used to be made by the chief justice of Pakistan.
Barrister Zafar opposed this initiation committee and said that the matter of nominations should be left at the discretion of the chief justice of Pakistan and relevant judges of high courts because their nominations could be considered or rejected first by the judicial commission and then by the parliamentary committee and there was no need to add a third-tier, which would only complicate the matter.
He also pointed out that having representation by the Law Minister, Attorney General of Pakistan and Pakistan Bar Council at the stage of nominations would also lead to more conflict and confrontation. 
However, the amendment related to the initiation committee was approved. 
NAB chairman
Meanwhile, NAB chairman Aftab Sultan also appeared before the Senate Law and Justice Committee in respect of a public petition in which claimants of Eden Estate had demanded the compensation for non-availability of plots in the society. 
Barrister Zafar asked the NAB chairman to explain the case and give a framework of how and when the claimants could be compensated for their losses. 
The NAB chairman informed the committee that owners of Eden Estate had entered into a plea bargain of Rs16 billion with the bureau and all claimants would be paid the compensation. 
He also informed the committee that the payment would be made in three years on a pro rata basis.

2,Rs37.2bn cash assistance for flood-hit people launched,"1.5m families to be given Rs25,000 in immediate relief.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday launched Rs37.2 billion flood relief cash programme to disburse Rs50,000 cash assistance in two install­ments among 1.5 million affected families each in the country, particularly in Balochistan where hundreds died and infrastructure was damaged the most by floods amid heavy monsoon rains. 
Fund are being given through the Benazir Income Support Programme in collabo­ration with the National Disaster Manage­ment Authority and other allied departments.
The disbursement of cash would be completed within three days as assured by the NDMA chairman to help rain-hit people afford their food and other immediate needs, said Prime Minister Sharif at the launch of the flood relief cash programme.
In the next phase, he said, a joint survey would be carried out to assess damages to crops, houses, highways and bridges in coordination with provinces to carry out the rehabilitation work. “We have allocated a sum of Rs37 billion to provide some relief to the flood victims and for that I am thankful to Finance Minister Miftah Ismail for providing the funds,” Mr Sharif said. He said heavy monsoon rains that triggered floods affected all the four provinces, with Balochistan being the worst hit. 

1.5m families to be given Rs25,000 in immediate relief

Mr Sharif said: “The whole nation needs to unite to face this situation. The federal and provincial governments are also co­­op­erating with one another. Our international partners and donors are also extending their support.” In the third phase, he expl­ai­ned, the government would collaborate with international development partners to help redesign the infrastructure to prevent damages caused by floods in the future.
Beneficiaries in the Jhal Magsi area were seen through a video link at the launching ceremony receiving cash assistance. The programme has initially been laun­ched in four Balochistan districts namely Jhal Mag­si, Khuzdar, Qilla Abdullah and Lasbela. 
Being one of the five countries facing the worst impact of climate change, Pakistan needed not only to support its people but also to redesign its infrastructure to avert losses in future, Planning and Development  Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who also heads the flood relief committee, told the gathering.
Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Shazia Marri said the BISP would ensure cash disbursement.
NDMA chairman Lt-Gen Akhtar Nawaz said cash assistance would be disbursed across 724 union councils of the four provinces, which would be followed by compensation for the flood-caused losses.
Polio campaign 
While launching a nationwide polio drive by administering vaccine to children at PM House, Mr Sharif said a polio-free Pakistan was a national goal and urged citizens to cooperate with polio teams for the complete eradication of the crippling disease.
“This is a testing time with the resurgence of recent polio cases and the related security incidents, but we can and will overcome it,” he said, calling upon federal, provincial and district administrations as well as the general public to ensure children under five years receive polio drops.
The current anti-polio campaign for Kar­achi and six districts of southern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa started on August 15, while the national polio vaccination drive is scheduled to commence on August 22.
Mr Sharif, meanwhile, also chaired a meeting of the National Task Force for Polio Eradication, and expressed government’s resolve to taking practical measures for curbing wild poliovirus transmission in Pakistan. 
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, federal ministers Abdul Qadir Patel and Marriyum Aurangzeb, as well as represen­ta­tives of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation attended the launch.

3,"US, Pakistan working to reduce tensions","US has assured of support for Pakistan's economic growth, Islamabad has indicated it will support US moves on Russia at UN.","WASHINGTON: The US support for Pakistan’s economic growth and the assurance that the United States “stands by Pakistan in hard times” are the two key points that both sides highlighted in this week’s public statements on bilateral relations.
In return, Pakistan indicated that it would support US moves in the United Nations aimed at diplomatically isolating Russia for invading Ukraine.
Talks about reviving the once close relationship are echoing again in Washington as the United States and Pakistan observe the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic ties.
The United States was among the first countries to recognise Pakistan when it won independence from Britain in 1947.
This week, the United States sent emergency relief for the flood victims in Pakistan, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken availed this opportunity to assure Islamabad that Washington wants to stay engaged with this old ally despite recent irritants.
Blinken while anno­uncing an amount of $1.1 million for the flood affected, assured Islamabad that the US would also help “mitigate future impacts of the climate crisis”.
On Thursday, US State Depart­m­­ent’s counselor Derek Chollet spo­ke with Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood about the 75th anniv­er­sary of US-Pakistan diplomatic ties.
Later, the State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said in a statement that the two officials “discussed US support for Pakistan’s economic growth” and the recent health dialogue in Washington, attended by a high-level delegation from Islamabad.
“We also focused on Afghanistan coordination & solidarity with Ukraine,” Mr Chollet said.
On Thursday, Pakistan’s US Ambassador Masood Khan met Assistant Secretary of State for International Organisation Affairs Michele Sison in Washington. The conversation focused on how to “further strengthen our multi­lat­e­ral cooperation including on the UN Sustainable Development Goals,” Ambassador Sison tweeted.
The Pakistani embassy in Wash­ington also issued a statement, saying that Ambassador Khan and Ambassador Sison discussed “a host of issues — ranging from Pak­istan-US multilateral cooperation on SDGs, connectivity and digital inclusion.”

4,Punjabi becomes Canada’s second-most spoken language,"Urdu ranked fifth in ranking of 12  non-official languages, census data shows.","ISLAMABAD: Punjabi has ranked second after Mandarin among the non-official languages, spoken pre­dominately at home, by the largest number of people in Canada, new census data released by Statistics Canada has revealed.
The 2021 census, released on August 18, found that 4.6 million Canadians speak predominantly a language other than official English or French languages at home, among them Urdu has become the fifth top language in the ranking of 12 spoken languages in Canada. 
The number of people whose mother tongue is Mandarin or Punjabi, the two most spoken languages nationwide, has grown significantly, with the former increasing from roughly 610,000 in 2016 to 730,000 in 2021 and the latter increasing from 543,000 to 763,000. The Punjabis counted in the census have come mainly from India, speaking gormukhii Punjabi.
Other South Asian languages that also saw marked growth in terms of numbers of people reporting them as their mother tongue include Hindi (133,000 to 224,000), Tagalog (510,000 to 590,000) and Urdu (243,000 to 297,000). 

Urdu ranked fifth in ranking of 12  non-official languages, census data shows

Conservative estimates show that the number of Canadians of Pakistani origin is far more than the official estimates, and an official of the Pakistan High Commission in Ottawa when contacted said 500,000 to 600,000 Pakistanis live in Canada.
In 2021, more than half a million Canadians spoke predominantly Mandarin at home and more than half a million spoke Punjabi. Arabic language is spoken by 290,000 people, the census shows.
The growth rate of the number of speakers of these languages was at least eight times larger than that of the entire Canadian population. The number of Mandarin speakers grew from 2016 to 2021, but was outpaced by the growth in the number of Punjabi speakers.
Roughly one-quarter of the permanent residents who arrived in Canada from May 2016 to December 2020 were born in a South Asian country, according to the census results.
The results show while the number of Canadians who speak English or French predominantly at home has never been higher, their relative weight in the population has been declining since at least 2001 because of the more rapid increase of other languages.
The 2021 census also found that 4.6mn Canadians speak predominantly a language other than English or French at home. These individuals represent 12.7 per cent of the Canadian population, a proportion that has been increasing for 30 years. 
By comparison, the proportion was 7.7 per cent in 1991, when immigration levels were rising.
The vast majority of the Canadian population commonly uses English and French to communicate and access services. Although both are spoken throughout the country, English is a minority language in Quebec, while French is a minority language in other provinces and territories, as well as in Canada as a whole.
According to the Canadian statistics, the number of Canadians who spoke predominantly a South Asian language such as Gujarati, Punjabi, Hindi or Malayalam at home grew significantly from 2016 to 2021, an increase caused by immigration. In fact, the growth rate of the population speaking one of these languages was at least eight times larger than that of the overall Canadian population during this period. 
In contrast, there was a decline in the number of Canadians who spoke predominantly certain European languages at home, such as Italian, Polish and Greek.
In 2021, 189,000 people reported having at least one indigenous mother tongue and 183,000 reported speaking an indigenous language at home at least on a regular basis. Cree languages and Inuktitut are the main indigenous languages spoken in Canada.
A vast majority of Canadians knows and speaks at least one of Canada’s two official languages. In 2021, 98.1pc population in Canada could have a conversation in English or French, and 92.9pc spoke one of these languages at home at least on a regular basis.
Of the two official languages, most Canadians spoke English at home at least on a regular basis (74.2pc) or predominantly (63.8pc), and English was the mother tongue of more than half of the country’s population (54.9pc). From 2016 to 2021, the number of Canadians with English as their first official language spoken, rose from 26m to 27.6m.
More than 70 different indigenous languages are spoken in Canada. In many cases, incomplete transmission to future generations is reflected in the decrease and the aging of populations speaking these languages. In 2021, more than 20 indigenous languages in Canada were the mother tongue of 500 or fewer people, whose median age was 60 years and older.

5,Call for awareness among mothers about breastfeeding,"Newborn babies should not be given any other drink for six months, seminar told...","QUETTA: Health experts and pediatricians at a seminar on Friday underlined the need for creating awareness among mothers about breastfeeding, as mother’s milk is complete nutrition for babies, which not only helps in their healthy growth but also protects them from different diseases at an early age.
“Newborn babies should be breastfed within the first hour of birth, as colostrums are full of protective components,” said Health Secretary Hafiz Mohammad Tahir while speaking at the seminar on benefits of mother’s milk.

Newborn babies should not be given any other drink for six months, seminar told

Balochistan Coordinator for National Programme for Lady Health Workers Dr Sami Kakar, Unicef Child for Development Specialist Humayun Amiri, Mercy Corps representative Dr Saeedullah Khan, Director General (Health) Dr Noor Qazi, Quetta District Health Officer Dr Noor Bakhsh Bizenjo, Dr Ayesha Sadiqa, Dr Imdad Achakzai, Imran Ali Jatoi and Dr Bushra Bakhat Kasi also spoke at the event, held here with the collaboration of the National Programme for Lady Health Workers, Unicef and Mercy Corps.
They highlighted the need for breastfeeding babies for at least six months for their natural growth and foundation of their health. Complementary feeding should be initiated from the age of six months, they said, adding that supplementary feeding was also essential for good growth of the baby.
The law prevented presenting and advertising synthetic formula as a substitute for mother’s milk, they said. As mother’s milk ensures clean stomach of babies and increases their immunity against diseases, they should not be given water or any other drink, coffee or tea, for six months, they added.
Babies, six months old and above, should be given adequate amount of khichdi, seasonal vegetables (carrot, spinach, potato etc.) with minced rice, rice pudding, boiled mashed potatoes, butter, egg and bananas, they explained. Along with child’s age, the amount of food should also increase, they added.

8,PTI protest against Shahbaz Gill’s treatment derails Senate sitting,"Senate chairman abruptly prorogue session without transacting any business as legislators gather around his podium, shout slogans.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) senators upped the ante against the coalition government during Friday’s session over the ‘inhumane treatment’ being meted out to detained party leader Shahbaz Gill, prompting the chairman of the upper house to abruptly prorogue the house without transacting any business.
‘Down with the government’ and ‘we do not accept tyrannical rules’ reverberated through the house as the protesting PTI legislators, wearing black armbands, gathered around the chair’s podium shouting full-throated slogans, while a minister was on her feet to respond to the allegation of torture.
At the outset of the proceedings, Leader of the Opposition in the House Dr Shahzad Wasim rose in his seat to protest the manner in which Mr Gill was brought from hospital to court and tortured by removing his oxygen mask, which was given to him only after court’s intervention.
The PTI senator said a medical report clearly mentioned Mr Gill came to hospital with a severe asthmatic attack. “He has an old history of asthma, which triggered due to anxiety and stress,” he said. “Where should we take this Constitution, which guarantees fundamental rights? You are trying to choke breath of opponents. Your attitude today will haunt you forever,” he asserted. 
The opposition leader said there should be “no room for inhumane tactics and torture” and asked lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to take a united stand on it, setting aside political differences.
However, when Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman tried to respond, the opposition members rose from their seats and staged protest in front of the chair’s podium. The minister continued her speech and said there was “no question of endorsing torture”, and assured the house of a probe if it did take place. But a report submitted to the court indicated no evidence of torture, she said. 
Also, “the photographs shown to us have no signs of torture,” she said. She agreed that everybody had the right to a fair trial. “Your fascism and torture on political opponents is a separate story,” she said while taking a jibe at the PTI, amidst a continued uproar in the house by the PTI.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Murtaza Javed Abbasi alleged that the PTI, which had devastated the country’s economy during its rule, seemed hell-bent on vitiating atmosphere in the Parliament House. He said their protest had no justification at all while the PTI had set the worst example of witch-hunt against political opponents, who were kept on remand for up to 90 days, disallowing them to see their lawyers and relatives.
A ‘fake case’ had been registered against Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader Rana Sanaullah, who was then in opposition, at the behest of then prime minister Imran Khan, he said. Nawaz Sharif’s daughter had been handcuffed in front of him and ex-premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had been kept behind bars without any reason, he added.
While Senate chairman Sadiq Sanjrani kept on asking PTI members to return to their seats and lodge their protest from there, but to no avail. He finally had to prorogue the house even before the start of question hour.
