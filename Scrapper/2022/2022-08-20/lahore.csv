1,Senate body sees ‘conflict of interest’ in NTDC appointment,Also objects to retired officer’s hefty salary,"LAHORE: Senate Standing Committee on Power has expressed grave concern over appointment of a member of the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) Board of Directors as the company’s deputy managing director (DMD) against Rs1.82 million monthly salary package. 
Terming the appointment a clear example of conflict of interest, the committee also questioned posting of a retired officer of the company as DMD on the same package and promotion of a senior official of the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) facing 14 departmental inquiries. 
According to the minutes of the recent meeting of the Senate committee, senators Fida Muhammad, Syed Shibli Faraz, Saifullah Sarwar Khan Nyazee, Sana Jamali, Haji Hidayatullah Khan, Behramand Khan Tangi and senior officials of the power division attended the session presided over by Senator Saifullah Abro. 
During the meeting, Senator Fida raised the matter of “illegal” appointment of Mr Ali Zain Banatwala as NTDC’s DMD (system operations). He told the meeting that prior to the appointment, Mr Banatwala was serving as a consultant in the NTDC, receiving Rs1.83m salary per month. “The age criteria was also reduced from 58 to 56 years for appointment of Mr Banatwala,” read the meeting minutes, quoting Senator Fida as having said. 

Also objects to retired officer’s hefty salary  

Mr Fida also asked about total number of the posts of DMD in the NTDC, to which the committee was informed that currently the company had three such slots approved by its BoD.  
On a question about the DMD’s salary, Mr Ayub, an officer serving against the post and present on the occasion, told the participants that he was getting Rs0.35m per month, while Mr Banatwala and DMD Mr Manzoor Ahmad, who retired as the company’s GM, were getting Rs1.83m each per month. 
The committee chairman Mr Abro stated the age limit for a candidate seeking appointment as NTDC managing director (MD) was 62 years and it was discussed in the previous meetings that no general manager (GM) was competent enough to be appointed as as the company’s MD. He also stated that an officer, Azaz Ahmed, was appointed as MD against a salary package of USD15,000 per month and he worked only for one month before leaving the company. However, the next advertisement for the post of MD mentioned the age limit as 58 years.  
Power division could not so far give the reason for reduction in the age limit, he said.  
“The committee was of the view that that the age limit was put at 58 years with the intention that no GM over 58 years could apply for it,” the minutes quoted the chairman as saying. 
The chairman also observed that as a BoD member, Mr Banatwala could not be appointed DMD as there was a conflict of interest, adding that power division must have taken notice of it.  
Showing concern over the irregularities found in the appointment of DMDs, the chairman directed the power division to provide relevant record, besides taking action against those involved in it.  
Earlier, the chairman, as mentioned in the minutes, also raised questions on the process of promotion of officers in all power distribution companies (Discos) and alleged that Hesco Chief Engineer Tariq Bajari, who was facing some 14 departmental inquiries, was promoted two days before his retirement after being cleared of all inquiries in just one day. “The Hesco CEO is required to provide detail of his promotion and inquiries, along with minutes of the meetings,” the chairman said, as per the meeting minutes.

2,Mountaineer wants to see sport scale new heights,"LAHORE: After summiting three mountains over 8,000 metres high within a year, ‘Mountaineer Mom’ Naila Kiani now...","LAHORE: After summiting three mountains over 8,000 metres high within a year, ‘Mountaineer Mom’ Naila Kiani now plans to peak the remaining two ‘8,000ers’ in Pakistan -- Nanga Parbat and Broad Peak. 
Last week, the Dubai-based banker by profession and a mother of two, had reached the top of Gasherbrum-1 – the 11th highest mountain in the world – only three weeks after she climbed the world’s second highest mountain, K2. 
In 2021, she had set a record by becoming the first Pakistani woman to climb Gasherbrum-II (8,035m), the world’s 13th highest mountain. She was conferred with an award in December that year by the president in acknowledgement of her achievements and contributions to mountaineering. Naila also holds the record for becoming the first Pakistani woman climber to summit three 8,000ers in her first attempt. 
Speaking at a press conference here at the press club on Friday, she explained that the mountains 8,000m high and above were significant because the oxygen level decreased as one climbed higher. “The top zone is called the ‘death zone’ where there’s only 30pc oxygen. In this sport, conquering the 8,000ers is considered a big achievement.” 
Talking about how difficult it was to leave her two little girls – aged three and 1.5 years -- behind for her expeditions, Naila said after marriage and children, it was unthinkable for a woman in Pakistan to go climb a mountain. “But it was my passion since I saw K2 and thankfully, my family supported me. When my second child was only 6.5 months old, I used my maternity leave to climb Gasherbrum-II – my first 8,000er. I thought I had to become a role model for my children so they can look at my achievements and fulfill their dreams. It was very difficult to leave them behind, and I missed them dearly when I was starting the expedition. But that also became my strength and I thought my kids are small so I can’t afford to make a mistake and have to focus more.” 
Naila then went on to explain the intricacies of mountaineering and shared her experience of her three expeditions. Answering a reporter’s question, she said her aim was to first peak the over 8,000m mountains in Pakistan to promote the beauty of the country and its tourism and convey a positive message to the world, and then move on to the rest of the 8,000ers in the world.  
She further said she did not receive any kind of support from the government and was completely supported by the BARD Foundation, which also hosted the press conference. She appealed to the government to build mountaineering infrastructure in the country to attract foreigners, so Pakistan could become an industry like Nepal and earn through it. “We lack the infrastructure for mountaineering as a sport, any training for climbers, rescue, insurance for high altitude porters and climbers. There’s a lot to do,” she stressed. 
Also talking about her journey and the time it took to cross various levels of the mountains, overcoming obstacles such as inclement weather, the mountaineer said climbing needed a lot of patience and time. “There’s a lot of ice fall and rock fall. The most difficult part is climbing on blue ice as it is very hard. When we summited G-1 we shed some tears as we couldn’t believe we’d done it. But returning is more difficult than climbing because you’re already low on energy.” 
Also speaking at the event, Mehreen Dawood from BARD Foundation said, “Naila has inspired and motivated women across the nation to pursue their sports careers with zeal. She has also promoted gender equality in the sports community and proven, through her conviction, that women can surpass any challenge in their path. The Foundation will continue to nurture young athletes so they can become stars.”

“What is justification of charging TV fee and income tax, GST on electricity consumption,” he asked, saying the government was collecting ransom from the electricity consumers on the direction of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
“Stop looting people. It is cruel and sheer injustice. The JI would never accept it,” he said in a statement issued from Mansoorah here on Friday. 
Mr Haq rejected, what he called, the mini-budget and appealed to the masses to launch a movement against the cruel policies of the government.
The government took fresh measures of burdening the people with more taxes on the direction of the IMF and it’s ultimately the people who should raise voice for their rights, he said. 
The JI leader said the sources of earning for a common man had almost vanished while the wealth of rulers was multiplying on a daily basis. He said the ill-conceived economic policies, corruption and bad governance were the roots of the problems. The governments over decades, he added, never paid attention to address the basic issues rather they made dependence on foreign loans to fix the problems, which backfired every time. 
Sirajul Haq said the interest-based economy was the main evil and Pakistan being an Islamic country needed to get rid of it. He said the government must comply with the Federal Shariah Court’s decision against the interest-based economy and withdraw the appeal against the verdict. 
He said the three parties (PML-N, PPP and PTI) were opponents of impartial accountability. He said the country needed Islamic system and only the JI had the capability to introduce the Quran and Sunnah-based system in the country.

Livestock officials, however, say the small animals are affected by chickenpox virus whose symptoms are similar to those of the lumpy skin disease. 
Hundreds of goats and sheep are brought to the Kot Addu cattle market for trade. On Friday, there were few buyers and most of them were from outside the district and demanded animals on reduced rates due to symptoms of disease.  
“Goat farming is a lucrative business but the sale of the animal has dropped because of the lumpy skin disease,” said Malik Imran, a restaurant owner. He said his restaurant was near the river Chenab and locals and travellers stopped by to enjoy food but there was not much demand of mutton meat these days as people were aware of the disease. He said there were reports of spread of disease in Muzaffargarh and Layyah districts.  
Muhammad Ramzan told this correspondent that he bought four goats at the rate of Rs1,200 per kilogram but he was disappointed as the traders offered as low as Rs800 per kilogram due to news about the disease. He said he sold the goats at low rates.  
Rab Nawaz, a trader of Gilwala, said he had suffered financial setback due to loss of cattle. He said the lumpy skin disease had affected goats and sheep. He said when he contacted the livestock officials, they advised him to give Panadol tablet and herbal syrup to animals but the medicines were not available in the market. 
Livestock officials claim that the lumpy skin disease is reducing.  
District Livestock Officer Dr Tariq Chajra told Dawn that there were few cases of chickenpox in small animals. He said the symptoms of the viral infection were similar to those of lumpy skin disease and therefore, the traders were wary of buying it.
