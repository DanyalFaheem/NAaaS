Meanwhile, flooding in rivers and streams across Gilgit-Baltistan continued to affect lives and infrastructure.
In Balochistan, the latest rain-related deaths were reported in Quetta, Jaffarabad, Khuzdar and other areas. Heavy rains and flash floods also continued to batter Lasbela, Sibi, Zhob, Loralai, Bolan, Khuzdar, Kalat, Dera Murad Jamali, Noshki, Kharan and other districts, damaging roads and houses and rendering more people homeless.
In Bolan district, flooding in Bolan river washed away a 24-inch-wide gas pipeline pas­sing under the riverbed near Bibi Nani area, suspending gas supply to Quetta, Pishin, Mastung, Kalat, Pishin, Ziarat and other towns.
SSGC officials confirmed the incident and said efforts were being made to link the pipeline to a narrower 12-inch pipeline to restore gas supply. However, replacing the damaged pipeline might take at least three to four days after floodwater recedes, they said.
Official sources said all four major highways — Quetta-Karachi, Quetta-Sukkur, Loralai-Dera Ghazi Khan and Zhob-Dera Ismail Khan — linking Balochistan with Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were still blocked due to heavy landslides and floods.
Heavy boulders that fell on Fort Munro-Dera Ghazi Khan and Zhob-Dera Ismail Khan highways after the landslides could not be removed, leaving hundreds of people stranded. Several trucks carrying fruits, vegetables and other goods have also been stuck for the last two days.
Security officials said up to 10km of the highway had been affected and removing the boulders and heavy mud might take more than a week. The railway track connecting Quetta with the rest of the country has also not been cleared yet. 
Meanwhile, a fresh spell of rains and floods inundated at least 40 villages in Bela town of Lasbela district and more than 300 people were stranded after floodwater entered houses.
Flooding in Porali river submerged part of a national highway, suspending inter-district travel. A flood protection dyke was also washed away in the Bela area.
Gilgit-Baltistan
Meanwhile, flooding in rivers and streams across Gilgit-Baltistan continued on Friday, leaving many people homeless, sweeping away crops, agriculture land and roads, and power supply and internet services remained suspended. Continued flooding also hampered relief efforts, and residents of remote areas remained cut off from other areas.
According to the deputy commissioner of Nagar, Zaid Ahmed, flooding occurred in Hoper nullah fifth time since July 22. Residents said several homes in Shaman village had been damaged, leaving five families homeless.
Cattle farms, crops, agricultural land, and trees were swept away in Shaman. The flooding from Hoper nullah also affected the residents’ property in Tokorkot and threatened infrastructure such as bridges.
Mr Ahmed said affected people had been evacuated and shifted to a safe site where 14 tents had been set up and food packs were also distributed.

1,MQM warns of reviewing decision to participate in Sindh LG polls,"Protests ""unjustified delimitation, fake voters’ list and less count of population in 2017 census"".","KARACHI: In a strong message to “state powers” while reiterating its protest over “unjustified delimitation, fake voters’ list and less count of population in the National Census 2017,” the Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) on Friday warned that it would review its decision to participate in the upcoming August 28 local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad. 
The partner of the ruling alliance at the Centre went on to say with a caution that the party could even boycott the electoral process if the people of urban Sindh were left with a feeling that their original mandate was being stolen only to impose the “fake municipal leadership”, mainly in Karachi, the business capital. 
The fresh thoughts in the party ranks were shared by the top leadership during  a press conference at its temporary headquarters in Bahad­urabad where they were convinced for a “final move” despite repeated appeals to the power corridors. 

Protests ‘unjustified delimitation, fake voters’ list and less count of population in 2017 census’

Without naming any individual, institution or organisation, the MQM-P apparently, along with the president and prime minister, also addressed the powerful establishment for their role in addressing the grievances of urban Sindh. 
“I am here to ask the president, prime minister and those who are guardians of law and Constitution to suggest to us where we should go for justice,” said MQM-P convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui. 
He then shared the details of “unjustified delimitation and fake voters”, alleging that the population of Karachi was halved in the 2017 census. Explaining the reasons behind his presser only days before the local bodies’ elections to raise the same old issues the party has been protesting over for the past many months, the MQM-P leader came up with a direct warning that suggested the party was still indecisive about the August 28 polls. 
“After the by-election in NA-245 on August 21, we would go to the people of Karachi,” he said. “We would seek their opinion. We would ask them whether it would be beneficial for us or for our people to participate in an election in which their representation has been restricted to 25 per cent [of the total population], their population has been halved and voters’ lists are fake. We are not sure whether participation in such elections would strengthen or weaken democracy?” 
In reply to a question about the fate of “Charter of Rights” the party had signed with the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) in March 2022 to strike a deal with the Sindh’s ruling party on almost all of its years-old demands, which would be agreed under a guarantee offered from the leadership of the opposition alliance, Dr Siddiqui admitted that “nothing has been achieved” and made it clear about the future stance of his party on the agreement. 
“There are several issues on this particular agreement,” he said. “We have suggested several things and similarly they [PPP] have forwarded their proposals. That’s true the progress has not been made so far. But we believe this cannot go a long way this way. They have to make things happen, otherwise we would decide about this from our side.”

2,Abandoned yacht carrying guns sparks terror scare in India,MUMBAI: An unmanned yacht carrying assault rifles and ammo triggered a brief security scare after it mysteriously...,"MUMBAI: An unmanned yacht carrying assault rifles and ammo triggered a brief security scare after it mysteriously washed up on the Indian coast, officials said. 
Three AK-47 rifles and an ammunition cache were recovered from the Lady Han after it drifted ashore on Thursday in a sparsely populated corner of western Maharashtra state, close to the location of a deadly seaborne terror attack in 2008. 
Anti-terrorism investigators seized the UK-flagged boat after it was spotted by fishermen, but authorities established later that day the vessel belonged to an Australian couple who abandoned it at sea after an engine failure on July 26. 
British maritime security company Neptune P2P Group claimed ownership of the weapons and said it had been engaged to protect the vessel against pirates during its voyage through the Indian Ocean, Gulf of Aden and Southern Red Sea. 
“We would also like to thank the Indian authorities for their investigation and handling of the matter and remain on hand to fully cooperate with them and secure the retrieval of our security equipment,” the firm said in a Thursday statement.
The yacht had set off from the United Arab Emirates and was slated to sail into the Mediterranean. 
After a storm in rough seas, the entire crew including security staff were forced to abandon the vessel and were rescued by a Korean navy warship which tried and failed to tow the boat, the Neptune P2P statement said. 
Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said late on Thursday that authorities had for now ruled out “any terror angle” but added that the official probe would continue. 
More than 160 people were killed in Mumbai, north of where the Lady Han was found, after a group of militants arrived in the city by boat and launched a series of attacks on hotels and other landmarks in 2008. The incident was one of the deadliest terror attacks in India’s history.

3,"Internet, phone services restored after disruption","ISLAMABAD: Internet services in the country were restored on Friday afternoon, hours after heavy rainfall in upper...","ISLAMABAD: Internet services in the country were restored on Friday afternoon, hours after heavy rainfall in upper Sindh caused disruptions in the cable fibre systems of Pakistan Tele­communications Company Ltd (PTCL). 
The internet and phone cable systems coming from Karachi have a junction in Sukkur but the equipment was severely damaged after rainwater entered the exchange gateway when downpour battered the region on Thursday night. The outage affected even landline service in all over the central and northern parts of the country. 
The problem started to appear in parts of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after around 7am, but some wholesale clients of PTCL, including Nayatel, continued its service up to 9:15am through other sources. However, as the day progressed and internet load started to pick up the backup system of other Internet Service Providers also collapsed. Soon, the PTCL telephony too became non-functional. By around 1pm, the internet service started returning to normal in the federal capital followed by other cities and towns. By 2:54pm the PTCL said the technical fault in its optic fiber network had been repaired and the internet services had been restored. 
“We regret the inconvenience and thank you for your patience and understanding,” the company said in a statement. 
The PTA confirmed that all internet services in the country had been restored. As a large portion of mobile phone companies operate on PTCL’s fibre optic network the problem also caused slowdown and disruptions in the services of Ufone, Telenor and Zong.

4,"16m children to get Covid-19 jabs in Sindh and Punjab, quarantine centres open at Islamabad, Lahore airports",Drive to begin on Sept 19; authorities notice upsurge in number of Covid-infected passengers at airports.,"LAHORE: The federal government is set to begin a drive to vaccinate 16 million school-going children of Punjab and Sindh in the age group of five to 11 years, against Covid-19 from Sept 19, as it is likely to receive 36 million pediatric doses of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine from the US next week. 
This is the first time the government has decided to bring school-going children under Covid-19 vaccination coverage, an official privy to the information told Dawn.
Initially, the drive will cover only Sindh and Punjab. Earlier, the official said, several campaigns had been launched all over the country for Covid-19 vaccination of the adult population.
The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) has assigned the responsibility of the vaccination of school-going children to the Federal Directorate of Immunisation (FDI).
The FDI has conveyed to the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) to make arrangements for the six-day campaign. 
The official said the EPI would engage teams of Unicef and WHO as they had strong management skills and expertise to run several similar immunisation drives. 
In the past, he said, the federal government used to communicate directly to chief secretaries of the provinces to engage the district administration in such campaigns.
He said the US government had agreed to provide Pakistan pediatric Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine after having completed a similar drive for children in its own country. 
He said the NCOC had been informed that 36m doses would reach the country next week and the vaccine would be administered to the children in two phases. 
Quarantine centres at airports
Meanwhile, in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19, health authorities have decided to establish quarantine centres at the Islamabad and Lahore airports. 
The move came after the authorities noticed an upsurge in the number of passengers who were infected with the coronavirus. 
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) will donate 5500 square feet of land at both airports free of cost for the purpose of quarantine centers, which will house Covid-positive passengers. 
CAA will provide the land for five years without any rent whatsoever; however, the cost of construction will be covered by the health authorities.

5,Imran terms attack on Salman Rushdie ‘terrible’ and ‘sad’,Says attack can't be justified in name of Islam; media not oppressed in his time but people picked up three or four times.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan has termed the knife attack on award-winning author Salman Rushdie “terrible” and “sad” which could not be justified in the name of Islam.
In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, Mr Khan commented on the attack on the India-born author, saying: “I think it is terrible, sad.”
“Rushdie understood, because he came from a Muslim family. He knows the love, respect, reverence of a prophet that lives in our hearts. He knew that. So the anger I understood, but you can’t justify what happened,” the PTI chairman gave his two cents on the attack that had sent Mr Rushdie to a ventilator.
During the interview, Imran Khan also spoke about the situation in Afghanistan and enforced disappearances in Pakistan. 
“They [security forces] were responsible for picking up people, but according to them they were involved in this insurgency, which was going on in Balochistan and the tribal area bordering Afghanistan. So they would blame that, with some justification, because you could not convict terrorists in the courts because you wouldn’t get witnesses,” Mr Khan said in a comment on missing persons.
“In my time, we never tried to oppress the media. The only problem was that sometimes the … security agencies — three or four times we found out that picked someone up and immediately when we found out we would immediately have them released,” he told The Guardian.
About Afghanistan, Mr Khan said Afghans needed to take charge of their destiny. “Eventually Afghan women, the Afghan people, will assert their rights. They are strong people,” he said. “But if you push the Taliban from the outside, knowing their mindset, they will just put up defences. They just hate outside interference,” he was quoted by the newspaper as saying.

6,Strikes cripple London transport as UK slips into recession,"Public transport workers hold strikes over pay and conditions, cutting services on almost all rail lines in London.","LONDON: Public transport workers in London held fresh strikes on Friday over pay and conditions, cutting services on almost all underground and overground rail lines that link up the UK capital.
The latest walkout comes during a summer of industrial action across Britain, with workers in various sectors pushing for pay rises in line with decades-high inflation and the soaring cost of living. 
Britain’s slide towards a recession has gathered momentum after data this week showed inflation jumping above 10 per cent, wages lagging far behind price growth and consumer confidence sinking to a record low. 
The deteriorating picture for the world’s fifth-biggest economy comes after the Bank of England warned this month of a 15-month contraction from the end of this year, worse than the outlook for other big European economies and the United States. 
Higher-than-expected public borrowing figures on Friday underlined the hard decisions facing the next prime minister about how to expand help for the poorest households, which has so far fallen short of support given by most other European governments. 
The stakes were laid bare by a warning from public healthcare providers that Britain faced a “humanitarian crisis” as soaring energy prices put many poorer Britons at risk of physical and mental illness. 
“Many people could face the awful choice between skipping meals to heat their homes and having to live in cold, damp and very unpleasant conditions,” Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said. 
The scale of the hit to households from their energy bills will become clearer next Friday when regulators announce the latest leap in the cap on electricity and gas tariffs, which have surged since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
A spokesperson for Transport for London, responsible for most of the capital’s network, said there were “almost no tube (Underground) services” with only a couple of lines functioning with “very reduced services”. 
Members of the RMT transport workers union, which represents a majority of the workforce, called Friday’s strike over job cuts, pension security, pay and changes to working practices. 
The strike action comes after nationwide rail strikes on Thursday hit the majority of services, as union members have rejected an eight percent pay rise offer that is below inflation. There will be further nationwide rail strikes on Saturday. The RMT has refused to put an end date on the industrial action. 
London Mayor Sadiq Khan, an opposition Labour politician, told Sky News he did not back strike action but understood why transport workers are “frustrated and worried”, saying the government “shouldn’t be punishing hardworking transport workers.” The government has taken a tough line on strikes, vowing not to participate in talks. 
Transport minister Grant Shapps told Sky News that ministers want to push through modernisation that the RMT union opposes, including on Sunday working. 
Economic crisis 
Already almost double their levels of a year ago, the tariffs could double again by early next year. 
Next week’s announcement comes against the backdrop of a record fall in wages, excluding bonuses and adjusted for the jump in inflation which has hit 10.1pc, its highest level since 1982. 
Consumers provided some relief from the flow of bad economic news as data on Friday showed retail sales volumes unexpectedly edged up in July. 
However, the increase was largely driven by online discounts, and real-time figures on spending using debit and credit cards have shown a big drop in spending in early August. 
Retailers say they are already deep in crisis mode. “For many businesses, 2022 is proving to be every bit as challenging as the pandemic,” Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said. 
Soaring inflation and the Bank of England’s forecast of a long — albeit relatively shallow recession — have heightened the dilemma facing the central bank. 
It has already raised interest rates six times since December, slowing momentum in the economy, but signs of broadening inflation pressures have prompted economists to raise their forecasts for further hikes in borrowing costs. 
Analysts at Investec said on Friday they now expect the BoE to raise rates by half a percentage point for a second time in a row in September followed by a final quarter-point increase in November, before it cuts rates in 2023 to ease the recession.
