1,"Floods cause huge surge in fruit, vegetable prices in Punjab",The situation expected to worsen in coming days.,"LAHORE: Prices of various vegetables and fruits have massively surged in Lahore and other parts of the province and they are expected to increase further in the coming days due to short supply in markets and destruction of the crops by the floods in Balochistan and Sindh.  
The government is considering the option to import basic and necessary vegetables like onion and tomato from India through Wagah border, Dawn has learnt from a market committee official. 
“At present, we have a very limited supply of onion and tomato from Balochistan. The onion we are receiving from Balochistan these days is not of good quality as it is wet due to rains and floods. This all has led to an increase in prices of these two main vegetables up to Rs300 per kg (both) that were Rs80 to Rs95 per kg before the rains and the flood,” Lahore Market Committee Secretary Shehzad Cheema told Dawn on Saturday.  
“In next three months, the prices of these two vegetables and some others are expected to hike more due to their short supply to the market,” he warned.  

The situation expected to worsen in coming days  

According to Mr Cheema, the major Punjab cities, especially Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Sargodha, Sahiwal, Multan and Bahawalpur, as well as those in other provinces are presently getting the supply of tomato and onion from Afghanistan via Torkham border.  
“One hundred containers of tomato and around 30 of onion are being received at Torkham border daily, out of which two containers of tomato and one of onion is being brought to Lahore city on a daily basis and the number of containers is absolutely too short to meet the demand in the provincial capital of Punjab,” he explained and adding that the some vegetables, including Shimla Mirch (Capsicum or bell pepper), are also short in the market due to the floods.  
Shehzad Cheema said import of vegetables from Iran via Taftan border (Balochistan) was not viable as the Iranian government had increased taxes on its imports and exports. When asked, he said the import of onion, tomato and other vegetables from India through the Wagah border seemed to be the only option to meet the shortage and maintain prices.  
“We have heard that the government is considering this option these days,” he added.  
Mr Cheema predicted that the prices of date palm and banana would also go up in the coming days as most of the orchards in Sindh had been destroyed by the floods. Apple supply from Balochistan or other areas had also been stopped due to flooding. However, most of the traders had already stored a huge quantity of the fruit. “Hopefully, the apply price will remain stable,” he said.  
“The price of cauliflower, which also comes from Balochistan ranges from Rs200 to 250 per kg these days. It was Rs100 per kg in the first week of August,” said a vegetable vendor in the open market. He added that per 5kg price of onion and tomato in the wholesale market (Mandi) crossed Rs1,200 on Saturday.  
It may be mentioned that since May, the increase in the petroleum products already caused a massive raise in the prices of fruits, vegetables and other commodities in the open market. In May, the per kg price of potato, onion, tomato, garlic, ginger and cucumber was Rs27, Rs63, Rs66, Rs140, Rs205 and Rs57, respectively.

On a monitoring mission, Leghari visited the area along with Dera Ghazi Khan commissioner and Rajanpur deputy commissioner using a boat. Around two dozen displaced visitors who gathered around the boat were disappointed to find no food, mosquito nets and tents. 
“Your are here just for a photo session. You did not bring any tent and food. Although you are a minister, you are nothing for us,” a video clip showed a villager as telling the minister. “You are providing relief goods to your supporters only.”
They complained that no one from the government had come to help them during the last 15 days or so.  
The clip showed the minister and his team soon left the area with villagers in no mood to listen to them. 
Another video showed Leghari, riding his car in Rajanpur, tried to speak to people wading through stagnant flood water. Finding harsh response from a young man, the minister immediately closed the windowpane and sped away.
The reports about non-availability of tents and food are emerging on a daily basis.

6,Bulleh Shah’s 265th Urs celebrations: A melange of trance and ecstatic exuberance,"Driving through the congested bazaars of Kasur encroached upon by an army of motorcycle-rickshaws, you reach a busy...","Driving through the congested bazaars of Kasur encroached upon by an army of motorcycle-rickshaws, you reach a busy intersection where you park and start walking along a narrow road. Noticing many other people walking in the same direction and hearing the sound of drumbeat from afar, you know you’re on the right track.
The entire 5-7 min Railway Road track meandering up to the shrine of revered Sufi saint Baba Bulleh Shah is dotted with multiple security checkpoints and walk-through gates, though the officials manning them appear least concerned. It’s a vibrant market with several shops selling the very popular Kasuri falooda, Kasuri methi, andrassay, qatlamma, aloo chaat and kababs to jewellery, clothes and shoes.  
After entering from the rear gate of the high-walled barbed-wire shrine complex, the path to the main tomb is lined with devotees fanning visitors, and then you’re confronted with a massive swarm of people in the large courtyard. There’s a reason for this crowd: the 265th Urs of Baba Bulleh Shah is under way and these devotees have come to pay their respects.Devotional songs are playing aloud and hundreds of men of all ages, and a couple of women and malang, perform the dhamal in unison. There are children running around, while families sit in groups chatting or get some rest inside a large hall opposite the tomb.
Vendors roam around carrying nimko and other snacks, some devotees offer water to the visitors, there’s a stall in a corner selling Bulleh Shah’s kafis, jewellery and wristbands.
Saeen Mushtaq Ahmed, a malang is conspicuous by his appearance – as are most malangs, but this one is unique - clad in a loose white outfit, adorned with several beaded necklaces, dark sunglasses, and ghungroo. The 70-year-old devotee tells Dawn he’s been coming to the Urs all by himself for 35 years. Belonging to what he claims is the Kot Musa area, “I come here for my friend, my love. I love him and he loves God. These ghungroos are also his blessing; everything I’m wearing is his. I stay for the first day of the Urs and will return the next morning after Fajr prayers. This has been a ritual for over 30 years. I left home thinking I’ll offer Juma prayers in Bulleh Shah’s Kasur, and I did”, he says while swinging in a trance.Nimko vendor Ghulam Nabi from Sahiwal has two reasons for coming to the Urs: paying respects to Bulleh Shah and earning a living. “I’ve been coming here for seven years with my entire family. We stay here for all three days of the Urs. I’ve noticed an increase in visitors from the past few years.”
Dressed in a bright red flowing outfit is malangni Mai Mastani from Lahore. The bejeweled woman has been attending the three-day Urs celebrations for as long as she can remember. “I enjoy the langar; there’s no worry for food or anything. I come here at the doorstep of God’s own wali to walk on God’s path. This is haq ka rasta and we should walk on it, far from worldly matters. Besides, I also pray for whoever asks.”
Another devotee sitting on the white marbled floor outside the tomb is Rukhsana, who’s been attending the Urs since she was a child. She comes to Kasur alone from the Khuddian area. “I come here for our pir, our ancestors used to come here too and now it’s our turn. We pray here on all three days, donate and just play our part.” 
Then there are some families who have just come for the festivity and entertainment. As the sun sets, a live qawwali begins after the Maghrib prayers and a horde of entranced visitors sit silently in front of the qawwals as they sing Bulleh Shah’s poetry, and malangs do the dhamal as the celebrations draw to a close for the day.

7,Harking Back: Of ‘grievous betrayals’ that cost us our freedoms,"It seems like a familiar theme -- the betrayal to powers foreign. It seems like the story, rightly or incorrectly, ...","It seems like a familiar theme -- the betrayal to powers foreign. It seems like the story, rightly or incorrectly, on everyone’s mind. But then this is not a new story. In our history, especially that of Lahore Darbar, betrayal and loot are familiar topics.  
Last Sunday in the used books stall in the open market, I bought a book on ‘The Sikhs’ by the famous writer, the late Patwant Singh, a distinguished journalist, researcher, historian and writer. The book has a very long chapter on Sikh army generals under the topic ‘Grievous Betrayals’, which is a well-researched description of the treachery of Sikh generals and how numerous battles won were deliberately in reality lost, in many cases with detailed battle plans being supplied to the British before a battle.  
Mind you over time it was betrayal of various Lahore governors (subedars) to numerous Afghan rulers that led to earlier invasions. Very few cities in the world have been invaded and looted as has been old Lahore. Yet such is the inner strength of the people that it bounces back to its lost glory. The Mughals, themselves foreign invaders, were seeped of their strength by betrayals. Ancient history is full of such happenings. The trend continues.  
We see that it is a strong charismatic ruler with an attractive personality surrounded by wise counsellors that overcome such shortcoming. Names of Chandragupta Maurya, Akbar and Ranjit Singh stand out. Otherwise either the ruler proves to be a crook, and in the process, his followers become millionaires. This is true of governments and huge organisations. Pakistan is full of such examples with the stolen wealth of the poor stashed away in faraway havens.
In this piece let us discuss the doing of Lal Singh, a Hindu shopkeeper of Sahgol village in Jhelum, who moved to Lahore, allegedly converted to Sikhism, and through his connections with the Hindu Dogra chief minister Raja Dhian Singh Dogra, joined the darbar of Maharajah Ranjit Singh. He started off in a lowly position and from there rose in power. The death of the maharajah saw him shoot up and then he carried out two major undertakings.
The confusion concerning power in the Lahore Darbar saw Lal Singh plan and personally execute the murders of two leading court officials, they being Beli Ram, who actually introduced him to the court in the first place, and of Bhai Gukmukh Singh, son of a Sikh scholar and custodian of the Sri Darbar Sahib of Amritsar. Beli Ram was no less a scholar and when Maharajah Sher Singh rose to power he was his main advisor and in return being gifted with huge jagirs.  
But in the power struggle led by Raja Dhian Singh Dogra we see Lal Singh being assigned such murderous tasks. The murder of Gurmukh Singh led the ruler Sher Singh to suspect Dhian Singh for the killing, which led to Sher Singh and his teenage son being killed at a military parade in Lahore, only for his supporters to murder Dhian Singh and his brother in retaliation.  
In this confused state we see that Lal Singh had been promoted and made an army general, and this is where his betrayals touched new heights leading to the final defeat and collapse of the Sikh Empire. The Lahore Darbar before it collapsed actually tried this traitor, convicted him, but then through British manoeuvres allowed him to move to British India. He took all his wealth to this ‘foreign country’ and even today his family is among the wealthiest in Indian Punjab. It is amazing how even today the families of so many traitors are the wealthiest.  
During the First Anglo-Sikh War of 1845-46 he personally headed the Khalsa Army, and while they seemed to be winning battles, little did his soldiers know that he was supplying the British with all battle plans. He managed a secret connection with the Ferozepur-stationed Capt Peter Nicholson. He deliberately, according to East India Company records in the British Museum Library, kept his army stationed in Ferozeshah as the British attacked Ferozepur.  
At places where the Sikhs managed to surround the British and ready for an attack, he would mysteriously withdraw his army. His own army began to suspect him and he hid in a ditch, only to later with his personal guards’ desert and head back to Lahore. The battle was simply handed over to the EIC.
In the Battle of Sobraon on the 10th of February 1846, the Lahore Darbar Army was poised to crush the British, only for General Lal Singh to secretly hand over the complete battle plans to Nicholson, only to keep his artillery and cavalry far away from the field, then in a mystery move he returned with them to Lahore.
After the First Anglo-Sikh War, the British richly rewarded Lal Singh, confirmed him as the ‘Wazir’ of Lahore under Lord Lawrence, and allotted him huge jagirs in the British portion of Punjab. But then Punjabi spies discovered that the new Wazir, the super traitor, had supplied the British with plans and instructions to defeat Gulab Singh’s attempt to occupy the Vale of Kashmir, which the British had anyway under treaty handed over to him.  
The Lahore Darbar tried him and found him guilty, and the British passed a sentence sending him in exile to Agra with a pension of 12,000 rupees a year in 1846 value terms. He moved to one of his houses in Dera Doon and died in 1866 after the British had fully conquered the Punjab in 1849. Such were the rewards of being a traitor.
Another traitor was Gulab Singh, who had tried to stop the son of Ranjit Singh, the Maharajah Sher Singh, from taking over the throne in January 1841. He captured the Lahore Fort and left it only after an agreement to leave for Jammu with his army and the wealth in Lahore’s famed Toshakhana. This made him the richest raja north of the Sutlej.
In the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1849, which led to the final collapse of the Lahore Darbar and the Sikh Empire, the army of Gulab Singh was given the option of either deserting to fight with their original army, or of siding with the British. It was a tactic that allowed him to keep the British at bay.
If one was to read the ‘History of the Sikhs’ by Cunningham, a book that cost him his job in India, but has won him much academic acclaim, or even J.S. Grewal’s ‘The Sikhs of the Punjab’, the role of these two traitors comes across very clearly. But the treachery of Gen Lal Singh had surely done the most damage.
We know that in the Battle of Chillianwala, near Mandi Bahauddin, the British were sounded defeat with 2,512 deaths, as can be seen in the massive Commonwealth Graveyard there. One of the commanders was Lal Singh, who converted a battle won to a defeat. The British had started retreating but Lal Singh had other ideas. That is another story that needs to be in our textbooks.  
So the role of treachery and betrayal in every sphere needs to be narrated in detail in our textbooks and media. After another betrayal at Gujrat the Lahore Darbar Army finally surrendered at Rawalpindi in March 1849. At that spot the British built their new army headquarters. It still remains an army headquarters.

In...","LAHORE: Tahseen Sakina, a singer known for singing Sufi songs and poetry, is set to launch a seven-track album. 
In a recent talk with Dawn, Sakina says: “I have recently performed in the United Kingdom and before that in Norway. Wherever I go, people find resemblance of my singing with Abida Parveen Ji. She is a great singer and I always want to touch her feet”.  
She said her upcoming performances scheduled for the USA and Canada would be exciting as she would also do fusion with some foreign artistes during the tour. 
The lyrics of the seven songs in her album have been written by different poets and composed by different musicians. “It would have a great launch after Muharram,” Sakina hopes. 
She says Sufi singing is immensely popular not only in Pakistan but also abroad.  
“I stepped into Sufi singing when I was four years old. My father, Safdar Ghauri, a scholar and a Sufi singer, is my mentor in singing”.  
Sakina says the way forward to her singing career was a competition of Heer singing at the mausoleum of Jandiala Sher Khan, Sheikhupura, where she bagged the first prize. 
She says different private TV channels and the PTV have played a key role in promoting the Sufi music and that she first stepped into the PTV station for a performance back in 2016. 
To this question about an offer she got to perform in some of the production of Gurdas Maan from India, Sakina confirms that she did have the offer but the project could not materialise due to visa issues. Talking about the Punjabi legendary singer Gurdas Maan, she says he is very much into Sufi music and fond of poetry of Waris Shah and Bulleh Shah. 
About her striking similarity with Abida Parveen not only through her looks but also her singing also, Tahseen Sakina says, “Of all the Sufi singers, I am highly inspired by Abida Parveen for she is a treasure when it comes to Sufi singing. Perhaps this is the reason that I follow her style and try to sing in her way. But I can only attempt to do that as she is iconic and legendary”. 
To another question about her long standing association with Rafi Peer Theatre Workshop, Sakina says she has been performing from the Rafi Peer Theatre platform as she performs every Thursday at their Cultural Complex on the Raiwind Road. The response of the audience there has always been great as Sufi music lovers gather in big numbers there for the Sufi Night every Thursday.

HRCP chairperson Hina Jilani on Saturday launched a fact-finding report titled South Punjab: Excluded and Exploited at a press conference at a local hotel in Multan. HRCP vice chair Raja Ashraf, Multan Regional Coordinator Faisal Tangwani and an activist, Muhammad Saqib, were also present. 
Based on field visits and consultations with government officials and civil society, the report recommends that federal and provincial stakeholders initiate a political dialogue to recognise the Seraiki identity and ensure access to formal and effective policing systems to improve law and order. 
The state must also institute mechanisms to provide redress to survivors of gender-based violence and discrimination, such as forced conversion and forced marriage, and protect the rights of transgender persons in south Punjab. 
Religious minorities must be protected from grave violations such as land grabbing and malicious use of the blasphemy laws. Workers’ rights to adequate wages and social security must be ensured, with district vigilance committees made fully functional to monitor and report the incidence of bonded labour. 
District-level committees must also be established to redress farmers’ grievances. Cholistan must be given special consideration in view of the chronic invisibility of its people, while land in the area should be allotted only to indigenous Cholistanis and without discrimination on the basis of religion. 
National human rights institutions such as the National Commission for Human Rights and the National Commission on the Status of Women must be involved at every stage to address these rights violations. 
The HRCP reiterates its demand for the establishment of a national commission for minorities’ rights with statutory authority. 
The state must further upgrade the health, education and administrative infrastructure in the region, with sufficient budgetary allocations, particularly in extremely deprived areas such as Cholistan. The need for sustainable infrastructure is especially urgent in light of the devastation caused by recent floods. Ms Jilani also expressed solidarity with flood affectees in south Punjab. 
“We are aware that the scale of the disaster is unprecedented. At the same time, it is clear that the role of the government and local administration in facilitating and rescuing victims has been disappointing,” she said.
