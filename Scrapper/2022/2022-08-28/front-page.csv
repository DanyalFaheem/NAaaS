• ‘High-flood’ expected in Kabul, Indus rivers over next 24 hours; more than 350,000 evacuated from at-risk areas in Charsadda, Nowshera
• PM, COAS visit flood-hit areas, pledge to support all those displaced by disaster
• Rail traffic on Lahore-Karachi main line suspended until Aug 31
PESHAWAR / QUETTA / SUJAWAL: As the death toll from the calamitous floods sweeping the country crossed the 1,000 mark on Saturday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa visited the flood-hit areas of Balochistan and Sindh and vowed to make all-out efforts to compensate and rehabilitate all those affected or displaced by floodwaters. 
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, around 350,000 people were evacuated from flood prone areas of Nowshera and Charsadda districts, while at least 14 were killed in rain-related incidents in Lower Dir, Mansehra and Kohistan.
Meanwhile, fears of another flood in the River Kabul were averted after the Nowshera administration and Wapda authorities managed to restrict water discharges from the Tarbela and Warsak dams, preventing water levels from rising further. 
An irrigation department official told Dawn that though the flow in the River Kabul and other rivers and their tributaries had decreased, the situation was fluid at the moment and making any predictions would be premature.
In Balochistan, the destruction brought on by torrential rains and flashfloods caused by hill torrents continued as six dams burst in the Ziarat, Pishin and Mastung areas. 
At least nine more people were killed in rain and flood-related incidents across the province over the last 24 hours. In addition, multiple reports were received about more deaths, and damage to homes and settlements in Quetta and further afield. 
Separately, Pakistan Rai­l­ways (PR) has suspended all its operations from Lahore to Karachi on the main line, directing authorities to refund tickets for those who had already secured reservations for Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur and other stations.
Rail operations would remain suspended until August 31 and would be restored from September 1, subject to the completion of the repair and maintenance work and improvement in the weather.
A PR spokesperson told Dawn that the operations between Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad and Lahore, Rawalpindi and Peshawar would continue, as there was no affect on the track in these sections. 
PM’s visit
During his visit to the rain and flood-hit areas of Taluka Shahbunder in Sujawal on Saturday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited Faqirani Jat, Oplono as well as other parts. In his briefing to the PM, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah revealed that this year, Sindh had received 400 times more rains than usual. 
The chief minister said that this monsoon had dealt irreparable damage to agriculture and livestock in the province, with crops submerged and hundreds of thousands rendered homeless.

The PM acknowledged that few parts of the province remained dry, but the government would try to reach the affected population through helicopters and boats.
“All affected provinces of the country would get relief grants, Rs 38 billion have already been released by the federal government in this regard,” PM Shehbaz claimed, adding that Federal Minister Khurram Dastagir would stay in Sindh until the issue of power outages was resolved. 
Later, in a tweet, he summed up the devastation he had witnessed in these words: “The magnitude of the calamity is bigger than estimated. Times demand that we come together as one nation in support of our people facing this calamity. Let us rise above our differences & stand by our people who need us today.” 

 





 
Army chief’s visit
Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa was also in the field on Saturday, visiting the flood-affected areas of Balochistan. He went to the flood relief and medical camps established at Goth Sadoori, Lakhra, and Lasbela and inquired about well being of local people affected due to floods. 
According to ISPR, General Bajwa also met troops busy with relief operations and lauded their efforts. “The safety and well being of our countrymen comes first and we won’t rest until each one of the flood affected is not only reached but rehabilitated, no matter how much effort is required. The people of Pakistan are our priority and we won’t spare any effort to assist them in this difficult time,” COAS said.
He ordered that all available resources should be utilised to assist the civil administration for rescue, relief and rehabilitation of people and infrastructure in the flood affected areas. 
The Commander 12 Corps Quetta Lt-Gen Asif Ghafoor also visited Lasbela to meet flood victims, alongside the general officer commanding Gwadar.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
A National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) advisory said that very high level flooding will continue in River Kabul at Nowshera for the next 24 to 48 hours, while the River Indus at Chashma is likely to attain high to very high flood level in the same period.
River Kabul in Nowshera district was still in high flood on Saturday evening but water discharges recorded a slight decrease. On the other hand, even though water discharges in River Swat had decreased considerably by the evening, many areas of Charsadda district were still under water. However, no deaths reported from both districts.
The collapse of Munda headworks, which regulates the flow of River Swat near the Abazai village, on Friday night had sparked panic in the area. In Charsadda, at least 18 villages including Nisatta, Parang, Tarnab, Hisar, Yasinzai, Agra and Paidakhel were inundated. But by Saturday evening, the around 260,000 cusecs discharged from the headworkds on Friday night had decreased to 84,000 cusecs.
The Charsadda district administration said that of the 185,000 people evacuated, only a few thousand were staying at camps, while the majority were staying their families.

On the other hand, Nowshera district administration said that they also evacuated about 150,000 to 185,000 from low lying areas to safer places.
Several parts of the district, including Mohib Banda, Pir Sabaq, Pashtun Ghari, Banda Sheikh Ismail and Khesghi areas remained inundated.
The Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization said that it’s 17-megawatt Ranolia power station was badly damaged, while the 36.7MW Daral Khawar station in Swat was damaged due to floods.
According to Wapda officials, raging torrents of the River Swat also breached the protection dyke around the diversion tunnel of the under-construction Mohmand Dam, a few kilometres upstream of Munda headworks, hampering construction activities.
Two micro-hydel power stations were also washed away in the Kalam area of Swat.
Balochistan
Sources said nine bodies of those who were swept away in flashfloods, including three children, were recovered from Pishin, Dear Bugti, Hanna Orak, Mastung and Chashma Achozai areas 
Killi Nasaran, a locality on the outskirts of Quetta, was badly affected after the Spine Karez overflowed, near Quetta Cantonment, washing away over 250 mud houses and rendering 300 families homeless. The displaced were shifted to Police Lines, officials said. 
Officials said that three dams, including Kech, Pechee and Kawas dams, burst in Ziarat, while the road linking Ziarat with Quetta and other areas was also washed away.
Three dams were damaged in Pishin, Mastung and Bolan districts due to overflowing after filling of their maximum capacity.
In Sibi, seasonal rivers also overflowed, inundating many localities in the town and its outskirts.
The situation in Bolan district was not much better; after a 150-year-old railway bridge, the Bibi Nani bridge was damaged while another bridge on the Quetta-Sukkur highway was also washed away. 
Nasirabad, Sohbatpur, Jaffarabad and Jhal Magsi were also facing huge floods from the Lehri River. “Four to five feet flood water is standing in and around Dera Murad Jamali, Dera Allahyar and Sohbatpur area.”
Officials said on Saturday that traffic on the Quetta-Karachi highway had been restored.

1,Ahsan Iqbal decries ‘flood politics’,"Says govt and the nation will not abandon those affected by the flood in Balochistan, Sindh and KP.","ISLAMABAD: Recalling that the current wave of unprecedented monsoon rains were part of a global pattern of climatic shift that was leading to heavy rains and floods in countries such as the US, Bangladesh and others, Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Saturday criticised the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf for playing politics at such a critical juncture. 
Addressing a press conference from the headquarters of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Mr Iqbal, who is also chairman of the flood relief committee, appealed to all Pakistanis to: “please discourage all those things which promote pessimism.”
“We are a brave nation and we have fought major natural disasters in the past too like the massive 2005 earthquake and the gigantic floods of 2010,” he said, adding that the government and the nation will not abandon those affected by the flood in Balochistan, Sindh and KP.
He was critical of Imran Khan and his party, which has been vocally critical of the government. 
“Today, Imran [Khan] said that massive damage occurred because we did not build efficient infrastructure – this is a false statement… it is irresponsible and it should not happen,” the minister said. He asked Mr Khan whether the government was also responsible for the devastations caused by the floods in US, India or Bangladesh. “Are we in the government there too?”
He said that the most infrastructure damage has been witnessed in KP, alleging that this was because the PTI-led government had allowed the construction of structures, mainly hotels, along the banks and beds of rivers over the past eight years.
“But we are not playing politics over this issue, only collective efforts can steer the nation out of the current crises,” he added.
He referred to a bridge in KP that was washed away in the 2010 floods, and while rebuilding it the National Highways Authority (NHA) enhanced its height by five meters. But even then, he said, the water reached that level, showing the magnitude and severity of current floods.
He also called for wholehearted donations to the relief fund established by the prime minister, and contributions to relief camps established by the NDMA and the Pakistan Army.

2,"Miftah, Jhagra to seek resolution of KP surplus row","IMF sources say Jhagra’s letter ""will not affect"" deal.","ISLAMABAD: In an attempt to avert any possible move to endanger the IMF deal, federal Finance Minister Miftah Ismail will sit down with his Khyber Pakhtunkhwa counterpart on Monday (tomorrow) to resolve differences between the Centre and the province over outstanding issues.
Talking to Dawn on Saturday, Mr Ismail confirmed he had called KP Finance Minister Taimur Khan Jhagra for a meeting, adding he was ready to help resolve any issue and release due financial flows to the province. 
The meeting comes against the backdrop of a series of events emerging out of a letter written by Mr Jhagra to Mr Ismail on Friday, just three days ahead of the IMF executive board’s meeting scheduled for Aug 29 to approve the disbursement of a $1.18 billion tranche to Pakistan under a bailout package.
In the letter, Mr Jhagra informed Mr Ismail that his KP administration might find it difficult to run a provincial surplus this year in view of flood-related damages.

IMF sources say Jhagra’s letter ‘will not affect’ deal

Mr Jhagra also highlighted outstanding issues like budget allocations for ex-Fata, monthly transfer of net hydel profits as per agreed terms, and immediate revival of the National Finance Commission award.
The KP government earlier signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) as part of a key IMF condition that provinces would provide a budget surplus this fiscal year.
Asked whether he or his ministry took up the letter issue with the IMF, Mr Ismail replied there was no need for it. “We have not shared it,” he said, adding it would be shared if need be.
Meanwhile, sources at the IMF said Mr Jhagra’s letter “will not affect” the deal Pakistan is negotiating with the lender.
Mr Ismail told Dawn his ministry had provided KP with a total of Rs112bn so far for rehabilitating people displaced by the floods. “We are ready to support the province,” he said.
As for erstwhile Fata regions, Mr Ismail said he had already requested the provincial government to provide details “in black and white” of employees in tribal areas now part of KP.
“They have not provided details so far,” he said, adding that it was the right of the federal government to know where the money would be spent. “We really don’t know how many posts were created in the tribal areas.”
Mr Ismail slammed PTI leaders Fawad Chaudhry and Shaukat Tarin for suggesting that Punjab and KP governments would not cooperate with the federal government over the IMF programme.
‘You have to shout to be heard’
When approached, Mr Jhagra confirmed to Dawn that he had received a call from his federal counterpart. “We finally have time on Monday to resolve our issues,” he said, adding that he was requesting for a meeting for the last 50 days.
“So sad that in their [the new government’s] Pakistan, you have to shout to be heard,” he said, adding that previously six dates were proposed for a meeting but were never honoured.
He said the signing of the MoU (for a budget surplus) was conditioned with the resolution of all outstanding issues of the province.
He said the provincial government was bearing the insurance payment of Sehat card of six million ex-Fata residents. Besides, KP was contributing to the salaries of tribal employees from the provincial budget.
He also claimed that despite commitment, the federal government reduced the budget allocation of ex-Fata to Rs63bn from Rs75bn. “The reduction was made in the last cabinet meeting,” he said, adding that the actual commitment was more than Rs100bn at the time of Fata’s merger with KP.
Mr Jhagra also alleged that the government was not reviving the National Finance Commission award and blamed the federal finance ministry for not properly involving the provincial ministry in any international commitment.
PTI Secretary General Asad Umar also come in Mr Jhagra’s support, saying he had asked for “KP’s rights” and no one should “suppress his voice”.
Mr Umar said the KP finance minister was “demanding the right of the province. Don’t you dare try to suppress his voice”.
Mr Umar said the coalition government was “attempting to pin the blame for its own failures” on Mr Jhagra. He said the federal government was “incompetent” because “no agreement with the IMF has been reached in four and a half months”.
‘Derailing political machinery’
Meanwhile, during his visit to Sindh, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif mentioned that a meeting with IMF officials was due to be held on Sunday (today).
Criticising the PTI without naming it, he said a party was trying to “derail the country’s political machinery” for its “own selfish interests” when it should be supporting the government in this “troublesome time”.

3,FIA detects Rs787m transaction from ‘secret’ PTI account,List of four operators includes man named in Pandora Papers leak.,"ISLAMABAD: A hefty amo­unt of over Rs787 million was deposited and then withdrawn from an undeclared account, allegedly maintained by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) with a now-defunct bank, a probe by the Federal Investi­ga­tion Agency (FIA) has revealed.
The revelation comes some three weeks after the Election Commi­ssion of Pakistan (ECP) ruled that the PTI obtained funds from prohibited sources, something which the PTI still denies.
The FIA is currently seized with the prohibited funding case against the former ruling party.
A document, obtained by the FIA from the defunct bank — seen by Dawn — reveals that the PTI had officially authorised four individuals to operate the account.
The list of names includes Fariduddin Ahmed, who came to prominence after the release of the Pandora Papers regarding the offshore holdings and potential tax evasion by bigwigs, released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in October of last year.

List of four operators includes man named in Pandora Papers leak

In the disclosures, it emerged that two offshore companies, namely Hawk Field Limited and Lock Gate Investment, were registered in the name of Mr Ahmed. Documents showed his address in Pakistan as 2-Zaman Park, Lahore – the residence of PTI chairman Imran Khan.
At the time, Mr Khan’s special assistant Shahbaz Gill had denied Mr Khan’s association with Mr Ahmed, claiming that neither the PTI chief knew the man personally, nor had he ever met him.
Later, Mr Ahmed had also denied any link between Mr Khan and his offshore companies, but said that both he and Mr Khan had a shared Burki heritage.
Another authorised account holder is Omer Farooq aka Goldie, the owner of Shapes Gym, who is said to be a close friend of Mr Khan. The two others include Hamid Zaman and Rai Azizullah.
The decision to allow these four persons to operate the account had been taken by the central finance board of the PTI, according to a notification issued on December 26, 2012, days before the account was opened. The notification carried signatures of the then-central finance secretary of the party, Sardar Azhar Tariq.
While almost all the banks shared statements and other financial details with the ECP, including foreign exchange remittances received by the PTI, the now-defunct bank in question has only now shared details with the FIA, having earlier refused to cooperate with the ECP.
In a letter written on July 16, 2018, the bank had initially sought more time from the ECP, and finally expressed its inability to share details with the ECP citing software incompatibility as the reason through another letter dated August 20, 2018.
It is interesting to note that during this five-week gap between the first and second letter, the country witnessed general elections (held on July 25, 2018) and PTI chairman Imran Khan took oath as the prime minister on August 18, 2018.
Dawn tried to contact several PTI leaders, including senior vice-president Fawad Chaudhry and Sardar Azhar Tariq, but they did not respond to requests for comment, despite repeated attempts.
When contacted, a spokesperson with the PTI’s Central Media Office said it was a “disbursement account” and not a collection account, adding that there was nothing illegal about it.

4,Court moved for booking Maryam Nawaz over contempt,Petitioner alleges Maryam used contemptuous language against SC judges on July 25 and 28.,"LAHORE: A sessions court on Saturday issued notice to the police on a petition seeking registration of a case against Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz vice president Maryam Nawaz for allegedly using contemptuous language against the Supreme Court judges.
Mohammad Nawaz, a citizen, filed the petition through Advocate Umair Saeed Butt claiming the PML-N leader had held press conferences against SC judges on July 25 and 28. He alleged that the respondent used contemptuous language against the judges, which amounted to ridiculing the judiciary.
He asked the court to order the police to register a case against Ms Nawaz for “scandalising” the institution of judiciary.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Liaqat Ali Ranjha sought a reply from the police on the petition by Sept 3.
Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court denied the police physical remand of two PML-N workers in a 2020 case of attacking a police team outside the office of National Accountability Bureau (NAB) when Ms Nawaz appeared in an inquiry into a matter pertaining to land allotment.
The Chuhng police produced the workers, Tahir Mughal and Rana Ali Raza, before the court and sought their physical remand for seven days. The investigating officer said that custody of the suspects was required to conduct their identification through videos of the incident.
ATC judge Ejaz Ahmad Buttar lamented that every new government started arresting workers of opponent parties. He wondered police needed physical remand of the suspects two years after the incident.
The judge turned down the IO’s request and sent the suspects to judicial remand.

5,"Rallies will be held in floods, even wars, says Imran","Calls out his opponents for running “planned campaign” against PTI; says party ""not out to derail IMF programme"".","GUJAR KHAN: Justifying his decision to hold political rallies at a time when the country was devastated by floods, PTI chairman Imran Khan on Saturday said that he was waging a fight for “haqeeqi azadi” (real freedom), which will continue during heatwaves, floods and even wars.
Addressing a public gathering in Jhe­lum, the former prime minister cen­su­red his rivals for what he claimed was ‘a planned campaign against the PTI’.
“A massive campaign is being run through newspapers, friendly media, journalists and one particular media house that always protects the thieves. They are saying that this is not the time to hold rallies.”
However, Mr Khan, denied that he was indulging in politics at a time of tragedy and instead called it a “fight for haqeeqi azadi”.
“I am waging war against these thieves who looted the country for 30 years. I am fighting for the supremacy of law. I am fighting for a country which was supposed to be an Islamic welfare state.

Calls out his opponents for running campaign against PTI; says party ‘not out to derail IMF programme’; announces telethon for flood victims; forms committee under Sania Nishtar to disburse relief funds

“I will keep helping my people, but I will not spare you,” he said, referring to his opponents.
Taking a jibe at the government, Mr Khan said that he is being asked not to hold rallies during floods, but the government continues to ‘push the country’s largest political party against the wall.’
“A terrorism case has been filed against me. They even came to arrest me. This news was reported all over the world. They called Pakistan a banana republic. We were mocked.”
“I only said that those who had tortured Shahbaz Gill should be tried as per law,” he said, asking whether he committed terrorism by saying this.
He also alleged that a certain Mr Y has been tasked with threatening the PTI in Islamabad and warned them that such attempts would be tantamount to treason.
Mr Khan also censured Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Finance Minister Miftah Isamail for alleging that the PTI intended to derail the IMF loan programme. 
Addressing the incumbent government, he said, when he left power, inflation was 16 per cent, now it is at 45pc.
“They [the current government] have devastated the economy, but today Miftah [Ismail] says the PTI wants to derail the economy.”
He claimed that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa finance minister has been asking for a meeting with Mr Ismail for the past two months.
Now, the KP finance minister was rightly apprehensive of managing a surplus budget when the province has suffered losses of billions due to flood, Mr Khan said.
“Our people are in distress from Swat, Chitral and Gilgit Baltistan to Sindh and Balochistan. Every area is under water,” he said.
He added that the scale of devastation is so big that the government alone couldn’t provide the relief unless the entire nation comes together.
During his visit to flood-hit  areas of DI Khan on Friday, Mr Khan had said that although he was under pressure  to collect funds for the victims, he would not do it unless transparency  is assured.
He also said that he could not collect funds for the  KP, as he had to collect donations for Shaukat Khanum Hospital, NUML  University and Al-Qadir University.
However, on Saturday, he changed his tune, saying he was gathering a force of volunteers to help the provincial government.
“...on Monday evening, I will conduct a telethon to gather funds from Pakistanis and overseas Pakistanis and give the funds to Punjab and KP governments.” A committee headed by Dr Sania Nish­tar would oversee the disbursement of the funds, he said.
He also criticised the past governments for not constructing dams, claiming that the current devastation could have been averted if there were more reservoirs.
