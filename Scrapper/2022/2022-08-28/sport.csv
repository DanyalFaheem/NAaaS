0,Babar unfazed by injury-enforced absences ahead of India clash,Arguably the greatest rivalry in cricket returns today when Pakistan and India collide in the Asia Cup at the Dubai International Stadium.,"DUBAI: Arguably the greatest rivalry in cricket returns on Sunday when Pakistan and India collide in a blockbuster Group ‘A’ opener of the Asia Cup at the Dubai International Stadium although both sides will be missing their pace spearheads.
Pakistan are without the injured Shaheen Shah Afridi, a vital cog of their side that beat India the last time the two nations clashed — incidentally also in Dubai, while their arch-rivals will have to make do without Jasprit Bumrah.
Babar Azam’s Pakistan were also forced to make a late change on Friday, recalling Hasan Ali in place of fellow fast-bowling all-rounder Mohammad Wasim, who sufffered a back injury during training.
The Pakistan skipper, however, was confident with the options he has and said his side’s victory over India at the Twenty20 World Cup last year would be a reference point.
“Shaheen is one of our best bowlers, he bowls with aggression and he leads the attack, so we will miss him,” Babar told a news conference on Saturday.
“If Shaheen was there, it would have been a different game. But our other bowlers are also good, we have high confidence in the camp.
“We have a squad full of quality cricketers and match-winners, who will step-up and take additional responsibility during the tournament.
“In [last year’s] T20 World Cup [where Pakistan reached the semi-finals], we have already demonstrated we are not a one-man squad. In five league matches, we had five different player of the matches.
“Everyone waits for the match between India and Pakistan. It is important to enjoy this game. Our bench strength is strong, injuries can happen, and it is part and parcel. I have faith in every player.”
Babar, though, wasn’t dwelling too much on the last game between the two sides, which was Pakistan’s first victory over their arch-rivals in a World Cup fixture.
“For me, every match is important and as captain, it is my job to give 100 per cent and we just try to give our best,” he said. “The T20 World Cup match has passed, it would be a new day tomorrow. You have the confidence, but it all boils down to the game day.”
Despite the hostile rivalry, players of both India and Pakistan have exchanged greetings during practice sessions. Pictures and videos of Babar and India superstar Virat Kohli meeting on the sidelines of a practice session went viral.
“As a sportsman, you try to meet different players,” Babar said. “We have met everyone, it is normal. You try and talk to players about cricket and other things.”
On Friday night, there was another video of a candid conversation between Babar and his Indian counterpart Rohit Sharma, who was also looking forward to Sunday’s clash.
“When we are on the ground, fans want to see the match as well as meet players,” Sharma told a news conference on Saturday. “As far as the rivalry is concerned when two quality teams play then we see a good match. As players, we just want to focus on our game.”
Like Babar, Sharma reckons that last year’s clash will no bearing on Sunday’s match.
“Yes, that loss did hurt us but some time has passed since that game was played,” he said. “So, for us, we have got another challenge in front of us now. There is no point thinking about that loss now.
“Since then, we have played a lot of games and we have tried to correct our mistakes. You learn from mistakes, it is a fresh start for us. The team is coming out of playing a lot of T20 cricket, and we know now to win games. Opposition will challenge you, but you need to find ways to counter that. The losses obviously hurt, but we have moved on from that loss.”
Rohit was also hoping star batter Kohli, who returns to the side after being rested for India’s series against the West Indies and Zimbabwe, will come up with a big performance on Sunday.
“From what I have seen, Virat is looking in good touch, he is working hard on his batting,” said Sharma. “It is not looking like he is thinking about things a lot. There are no extra-ordinary changes.
“He is coming back after one month, there is freshness that we can spot. He is looking in good touch, we try to give everyone a chance to prepare to the best of their ability. Preparation wise, we have put our best foot forward.” he added.
Sunday’s game could be the first of three matches between India and Pakistan during the Asia Cup. 
With Hong Kong being the other team in Group ‘A’, the two subcontinental giants are favourites to advance to the round-robin Super Four stage. Beyond that, they could also meet in a tantalising title clash.
It will be Sunday’s clash, though, that will set the tone for the campaign ahead for both Pakistan and India.

1,"Liverpool hit nine to equal EPL record, Haaland hits City treble","On a remarkable day, 10-man Chelsea beat Leice­ster City 2-1, while Manchester United’s revival continued with a win.","LONDON: Liverpool equalled the Premier League’s record win with a 9-0 demolition of Bourn­emouth, while Erling Haaland’s hat-trick inspired Manchester City’s comeback 4-2 victory against Crystal Palace on Saturday.
On a remarkable day in the top-flight, 10-man Chelsea beat Leice­ster City 2-1, while Manchester United’s revival continued with a 1-0 win at Southampton.
Liverpool stole the spotlight as they recovered from Monday’s lacklustre 2-1 loss at United in astonishing style.
After three games without a win, the Reds rebounded by equa­lling United’s 9-0 wins against Ipswich in 1995 and Southampton in 2021, as well as Leicester’s thrashing of Southampton in 2019.
It took just three minutes for Luis Diaz to strike at Anfield as the Colombia winger headed home Roberto Firmino’s cross.
Three minutes later, Liverpool moved further ahead as Harvey Elliott bagged his first Premier League goal with a20-yard curler.
Trent Alexander-Arnold rifled into the top corner from 25 yards in the 28th minute.

After providing three assists, Firmino scored himself with close-range volley to put the result beyond doubt by the 31st minute.
Virgil Van Dijk headed in Andrew Robertson’s corner on the stroke of half-time as Liverpool scored five in the first half of a Premier League game for the first time.
Chris Mepham’s own goal from Alexander-Arnold’s 46th minute cross was followed by Firmino grabbing the seventh in the 62nd minute.
Fabio Carvalho’s first goal since his summer move from Fulham made it eight in the 80th minute.
Diaz notched the historic ninth from Kostas Tsimikas’ corner with five minutes left as Liverpool equalled their biggest ever top-flight margin of victory, set against Palace in 1989.
Champions City staged another impressive rally as they came from 2-0 down to beat Palace at the Etihad Stadium.
Palace went ahead in the fourth minute as Eberechi Eze’s free-kick deflected off John Stones into the net for an own goal.
City fell further behind in the 21st minute when Palace defender Joachim Andersen was left unmarked to head in Eze’s corner.
But the champions came from 3-1 down to draw at Newcastle United last weekend and Bernardo Silva gave them hope of a repeat with a 53rd minute effort that deflected in off Jeffrey Schlupp.
City equalised in the 62nd minute when Phil Foden’s cross reached Haaland and the former Borussia Dortmund striker headed his first home goal since joining in the close-season.
In the 70th minute, Haaland got his fifth in four games, prodding home from Stones’ pass after a flowing move. The Norwegian sealed his hat-trick from Silva’s pass in the 81st minute.
Raheem Sterling scored his first goals for Chelsea in a dramatic win over Leicester.
Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher was sent off in the 28th minute for a needless foul on Harvey Barnes just moments after being booked.
Sterling struck in the 47th minute, the former City forward’s shot deflecting off Daniel Amartey into the net.
Sterling doubled his tally in the 63rd minute as he tapped in from Reece James’ cross before Barnes squeezed in a low shot three minutes later.
Erik ten Hag said United have learned from their dismal start to the season after Bruno Fernandes clinched a hard-fought win against Southampton.
Ten Hag’s side sat bottom of the Premier League after losing their opening two games.
But United have recovered from that embarrassing start to secure successive league victories for the first time since February.
Fernandes netted in the 55th minute when he met Diogo Dalot’s cross with a volley from just inside the area.
“I think the players learnt some lessons from Brentford. We were more compact on the long balls. Of course we were really happy,” Ten Hag said.
Vitaly Janelt scored an 85th minute equaliser as Brentford drew 1-1 with Everton, who took the lead through Anthony Gordon’s 24th minute opener.
Brighton beat Leeds United 1-0 with Pascal Gross’s 66th minute goal at the Amex Stadium.

2,"Nadal, Medvedev lament Djokovic’s absence at US Open","NEW YORK: Rafa Nadal said it was sad news that his great rival Novak Djokovic will be missing from the US Open,...","NEW YORK: Rafa Nadal said it was sad news that his great rival Novak Djokovic will be missing from the US Open, adding that the absence of a player of the Serbian’s calibre was an important miss for the hardcourt Grand Slam.
Djokovic, who won Wimbledon to take his major singles titles to 21, has opted not to be vaccinated against Covid-19. He said on Thursday he could not fly to New York for the year’s final Grand Slam.
Rules require travellers to show proof of vaccination to board flights to enter the United States.
“From my personal perspective, it’s very sad news,” Nadal, who leads the men’s Grand Slam race with 22 titles, told reporters on Friday.
“It’s always a shame when the best players of the world are not able to play a tournament because of injuries or because of different reasons.
“In this case, not having one of the best players of the history in the draw of Grand Slam is always an important miss, no?”
The 35-year-old Djokovic was also unable to play the Australian Open at the start of the year after being depo­rted from Melbourne over his vaccination status just ahead of the tournament.
Nadal said it was tough for both players and the fans as everyone want the best players to compete at big events.
“But on the other hand, I repeat what I said plenty of times: the sport in some ways is bigger than any player,” added the 36-year-old, who has been plagued by injuries during the last two seasons.
“The tournament continues. Even if it’s not a good news for everyone, the world continues and tennis will continue after me, after Novak, after Roger [Federer].
“Without a doubt, Novak is one of the most important players of the last 20 years, the history of our sport. In a personal way I feel sorry for him that he’s not able to travel here.”
World number one Daniil Medvedev said he was disappointed his US Open title defence at Flushing Meadows would kick off without Djokovic.
The lanky Russian pulled off one of sport’s greatest upsets with cat-like agility a year ago when he denied Djokovic a calendar Grand Slam in a straight sets win on Arthur Ashe Stadium to collect his first major title.
“I wish he would play here,” Medvedev told reporters ahead of the US Open main draw, which starts on Monday.
“The rivalry against Rafa is really I feel like heating up in a way. Twenty-two, 21 [Grand Slams], a joke of a number,” he said.
“It’s a pity he [Djokovic] is not here. It would be a great story I think for tennis. Not only tennis-wise, but it’s not us tennis players, it’s American government rules. Completely understandable also.”
Medvedev rolls into the US Open after a handful of uneven performances, winning at Los Cabos before suffering a shock early exit in Montreal. He reached the semi-finals at Cincinnati, where he has often thrived.
His hunger for a second major title is as fierce as ever after losing a five-set thriller to Nadal in the Australian Open final. The six-foot six-inch, power-serving Russian said he wanted to try  “something big” in New York.
“I’m working well. I’m working well with my team. I’m confident in myself,” he added.

Petersen is not out on 42 and Van der Dussen, who is batting with a broken finger, has 41. The pair have put on an unbeaten 87 runs for the fourth wicket after England took three wickets in the morning session.
It has been slow going, with 118 runs scored in 56 overs on the third day. But South Africa are desperate to build a lead to make England bat again and give themselves a chance in a game that the home side have dominated from the first ball.
After a difficult morning for batting, the wicket has flattened out to a degree and it was largely a session of toil for the home bowlers, though they will see the new ball in 15 overs time as a chance to make further inroads.
The visitors resumed on their overnight 23 without loss and captain Dean Elgar was the first out for 11 when he was bowled by James Anderson with a superb delivery that crashed into off-stump.
In doing so, the England seamer became the joint highest wicket-taker among fast bowlers across all formats, drawing level with Australian Glen McGrath on 949 scalps.
Opener Sarel Erwee never looked comfortable at the crease but made his way to 25 before he edged Ollie Robinson to wicketkeeper Ben Foakes.
Aiden Markram’s wretched time with the bat continued when he was caught by second slip Zak Crawley off the bowling of Stuart Broad.
Markram scored six having been bowled by Broad off a no-ball in the seamer’s previous over. He could not take the life given.
England are seeking to level the three-match series after South Africa won the first Test at Lords by an innings and 12 runs.
Scoreboard
SOUTH AFRICA (1st innings) 151
ENGLAND (1st innings) 415-9 decl.

The 14-time victors travel to Glasgow for their Group ‘F’ clash on September 6, the same night that French champions Paris St Germain entertain Italian giants Juventus in Group ‘H’.
Real Madrid’s bitter rivals Barcelona are in the toughest looking group along with German champions Bayern Munich and Italian side Inter Milan.
Barca, though, open their Group ‘C’ campaign against Czech outfit Viktoria Plzen whilst Bayern are away at Inter Milan on September 7.
Those games serve as the appetizer before Barcelona host Bayern on September 13.
Liverpool, beaten by Real in last season’s final, travel to Napoli for their first Group ‘A’ match on September 7.
Premier League rivals Chelsea and Manchester City are also both away.
Chelsea — who beat City in the 2021 final — travel to Dinamo Zagreb in Group ‘E’ and Manchester City are at Spanish side Sevilla in Group ‘G’ on September 6.
Two other British clubs enter the fray on September 7 — Tottenham Hotspur host Marseille in Group ‘D’ whilst Rangers, who are in the same section as Liverpool, play Ajax in Amsterdam.
The group stage has been compressed this season due to the World Cup kicking off in Qatar on November 20.

5,Labuschagne dropped as Australia opt for all-rounders against Zimbabwe,BRISBANE: Skipper Aaron Finch said Saturday that Australia plan to test a new structure that provides greater ...,"BRISBANE: Skipper Aaron Finch said Saturday that Australia plan to test a new structure that provides greater batting depth and more bowling options in their opening ODI against Zimbabwe, with Marnus Labuschagne dropped.
Australia play three one-dayers against Zimbabwe in the northern Queensland city of Townsville from Sunday, followed by three against New Zealand in Cairns starting September 6.
Finch confirmed an almost full-strength side, with the hosts welcoming back a number of players absent from their last match in Sri Lanka in June.
That includes spinner Adam Zampa, who missed the tour due to the birth of his first child.
But Test stalwart Marnus Labuschagne was omitted from the first game as Australia shake up the batting line-up.
Finch told Cricket.com.au that Alex Carey would be elevated to number four, with Steve Smith filling Labuschagne’s number three position and Mitch Marsh sliding from three to six.
“The reasoning behind Marnus [missing out] is we’re just going with an all-rounder-heavy side,” he said.
“Two quicks plus Zampa and Cameron Green as the fourth genuine bowler. And then using Marsh, [Marcus] Stoinis, [Glen] Maxwell as our fifth bowler effectively.
“It’s a way of lengthening our batting, and I think it’s important we keep trying to juggle the structure of the team around a bit over the next little while.
“We don’t want to get pigeonholed into playing in one particular structure of team.”
Test captain Pat Cummins will miss the series and the subsequent one against New Zealand as he takes a breather ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup and a busy home summer.
Zimbabwe have not faced Australia in the 50-over format since 2014 and are missing several key players including injured captain Craig Ervine, opening bowler Tendai Chatara and spinner Wellington Masakadza.
Squads:
AUSTRALIA: Aaron Finch (captain), Sean Abbott, Ashton Agar, Alex Carey, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Marnus Labuschagne, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, David Warner, Adam Zampa.
Zimbabwe squad: Ryan Burl, Regis Chakabva (captain), Bradley Evans, Luke Jongwe, Innocent Kaia, Takudzwanashe Kaitano, Clive Madande, Wessly Madhevere, Tadiwanashe Marumani, Tony Munyonga, Blessing Muzarabani, Richard Ngarava, Victor Nyauchi, Sikandar Raza, Sean Williams.

6,Lazio sink Inter to take top spot,ROME: Spanish duo Luis Alberto and Pedro Rodriguez struck late to guide Lazio to a 3-1 home victory over Inter Milan...,"ROME: Spanish duo Luis Alberto and Pedro Rodriguez struck late to guide Lazio to a 3-1 home victory over Inter Milan that took their side top of Serie A on Friday as the visitors dropped their first points of the season on coach Simone Inzaghi’s return to his old club.
Lazio provisionally lead the standings with seven points from three games, while Inter are a point behind in fourth.
“We’ve been sending some good signals lately, as we go through periods of being under pressure without actually risking much at the back,” Lazio coach Maurizio Sarri told DAZN. “This team has gained in solidity and organisation, so we are capable of beating anyone on the day, but our problem has always been consistency.”
It marked another disappointing evening for Inzaghi who has yet to pick up a point at the ground he graced as a player for over a decade and where he managed until 2021.
“It was a very bad loss,” Inzaghi told DAZN. “It was an even game. We had a good first half but Luis Alberto’s goal shifted the balance.”
Lazio flew out of the traps against Inter in an attempt to gain an early advantage and Felipe Anderson put them in front with a 40th-minute header after the Brazilian was perfectly set up in the box with a cross by Sergej Milinkovic-Savic.
Inter, who lacked a clear chance in the opening period, equalised from a free kick in the 51st as defender Denzel Dumfries nodded the ball to the unmarked Lautaro Martinez who netted from close range.
Sarri brought on Luis Alberto and Pedro just before the hour mark and Luis Alberto restored the Lazio advantage in the 75th minute with a superb shot which left Samir Handanovic stranded in the Inter goal before Pedro wrapped things up four minutes from time.
In Friday’s other game, promoted Monza slipped to their third defeat of the season when they lost 2-1 at home to Udinese who collected their first win.
Andrea Colpani put the Silvio Berlusconi-owned side ahead just after the half-hour but the lead only lasted four minutes before Beto levelled for Udinese. Monza were looking good for their first point of the season until 19-year-old defender Destiny Udogie, on loan from Tottenham, knocked in the winner 12 minutes from time.

Sainz’s Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc, 80 points adrift of Verstappen in the title race, took fourth in qualifying but was also demoted.
With fifth-placed Esteban Ocon also among the sanctioned seven, Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton fill the second row. Both are on the hunt for their first wins of the 22-race season.

Hobbs won in 10.87 seconds ahead of Jackson (10.88) while Ivorian Marie-Josee Ta Lou was third (10.89).
Jamaica’s Elaine Thompson-Herah, who had won in Eugene and Rabat, was disqualified for a false start while compatriot Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, a three-times winner this year, pulled out of the final due to a hamstring injury.
Hobbs is only the second non-Jamaican sprinter to win a women’s 100m title in the Diamond League this year after Britain’s Dina Asher-Smith in Birmingham.
“I had a good start today and I know that if I start well I can get great times. I’m happy with the 10.87, it’s another sub-10.9 for me,” Hobbs said. “This is my first time running in Lausanne. Funnily enough, I was supposed to make my professional debut here a few years ago and I got injured and couldn’t race so it’s great to finally be able to run on this track.”
In the men’s 200m, Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Noah Lyles ran a great bend to win his third Diamond League title of the season with a time of 19.56 seconds. He beat compatriot Michael Norman by two-tenths of a second in an American one-two while Jereem Richards of Trinidad & Tobago was third.
Double European champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen set a world leading time of 3:29.05 as he won the 1500m ahead of Kenya’s Abel Kipsang.
Treble European champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands smashed the meeting record in clocking 52.95sec to win the 400m hurdles. Former world record-holder Dalilah Muhammad of the United States finished well off the pace in seventh.
A loaded women’s 100m hurdles featured all three medallists from Oregon: Tobi Amusan, Britany Anderson and Jasmine Camacho-Quinn. The latter claimed the win in Lausanne in a meet record of 12.34sec, with Amusan at 0.11sec.
And there was another meet record, by more than 5sec, for Burundi’s Francine Niyonsaba, who marked her return from injury with victory in the 3,000m in 8:26.80 ahead of American Alicia Monson and Kenya’s Beatrice Chebet.
Dutchwoman Sifan Hassan came in fourth while Britain’s Laura Muir finished seventh.
Jamaican Rasheed Broadbell pulled off a surprise win in the 100m hurdles, going sub-13sec for the first time in his career as he beat a strong field in 12.99sec. Americans Trey Cunningham and Grant Holloway completed the podium.
India’s Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra returned to winning ways in the men’s javelin following his silver at the world championships last month. His mark of 89.08 metres with his first throw was enough for victory.
Chopra was forced to skip the Commonwealth Games earlier this month due to injury and his mark was well ahead of the second-placed Czech Republic’s Jakub Valdeich (85.88m) and American Curtis Thompson (83.72m).

Yusuf Yazici’s breathtaking volley gave the visitors a 17th minute lead followed by strikes for Jonathan Bamba near halftime and defender Tiago Djalo midway through the second period. Bamba converted a cross from Jonathan David and a Djalo free-kick after 67 minutes made it 3-0 to the 2021 Ligue 1 champions.
Cyrille Bayala headed in an 83rd minute consolation for the home side before David’s late penalty hit the post to deny Lille a fourth goal after they had been handed a 7-1 home drubbing by champions PSG last Sunday.
“The most important thing after the last match was to show that we had the strength to react,” said Lille defender Jose Fonte. “Good teams do not lose twice in a row. These are three important points.”
Lille are fourth with seven points, two behind leaders PSG who host AS Monaco on Sunday, while Ajaccio are third-bottom on one point and still looking for a first victory since their top-flight return after relegation in 2014.

In a game played in wet and wild conditions, Freiburg’s Italian midfielder Vincenzo Grifo scored the only goal in the 48th minute when he headed in his own saved penalty, which had been saved two times by Bochum keeper Manuel Reimann.
After the match, Freiburg coach Christian Streich said his side “at the end of the day were deserved winners, even if it could have also been a draw.”
“From the amount of goal chances we had, (our win) is deserved and I’m really happy, that we’ve now got nine points after four games — that totally helps us.”
Bochum midfielder Kevin Stoeger said his side deserved more out of the game — and out of their season.
“This is really frustrating. We’re still on zero points,” a dripping wet Stoeger said after the match. “In terms of performance, we deserved a draw. We played a good game, but what’s the point?” 
Bochum are bottom having lost all four games.
