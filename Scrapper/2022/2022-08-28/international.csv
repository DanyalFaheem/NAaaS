0,"Tunisia, Morocco recall envoys over W. Sahara row","The Polisario wants an independent state in the Western Sahara, which Morocco sees as a sovereign part of its own territory","TUNIS: Tunisia annou­nced on Saturday the recall of its ambassador to Morocco for consultations, a day after the kingdom did the same in response to Tunisia’s president hosting the Polisario movement’s leader.
The Polisario wants an independent state in the Western Sahara, a vast stretch of mineral-rich desert which Morocco sees as a sovereign part of its own territory. Tunisian President Kais Saied had on Friday hosted Polisario chief Brahim Ghali who arrived to attend the Japanese-African investment conference TICAD.
In response to what it called a  “hostile” and  “unnecessarily provocative” act, Morocco immediately withdrew its Tunis ambassador for consultations and cancelled its own participation in the high-profile conference. On Saturday, the Tunisian Foreign Ministry voiced its  “surprise” at Morocco’s reaction.
“Tunisia has maintained its total neutrality on the Western Sahara issue in line with international law,” it said in a statement.
“This position will not change until the concerned parties find a peaceful solution acceptable to all.” Saied spent much of Friday welcoming African leaders arriving for the TICAD conference, including Ghali who is also president of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Demo­cratic Republic (SADR).
Morocco accused Tunisia of  “unilaterally” inviting the Polisario chief  “against the advice of Japan and in violation of the process of preparation and established rules”.
But Tunisia said the African Union (AU) had issued a direct invitation to the SADR, a member state, to join the conference, noting that it had attended previous such gatherings — alongside Morocco. The foreign ministry in Rabat hit back, charging Tunisia’s response was riddled with  “many approximations and untruths”.
The tit-for-tat diplomatic row came as French Pres­ident Emmanuel Macron visited Morocco’s arch-rival and Polisario backer Algeria on a visit aimed at healing ties with the former French colony.
Diplomatic sources said Guinea-Bissau President Um­aro Sissoco Embalo, current chairman of the Econ­omic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), walked out of the conference in protest at the Polisario’s participation.

1,Russia blocks resolution on nuclear disarmament,Conference’s president says it is “not in a position to achieve an agreement” after Russia took issue with the text.,"NEW YORK: Russia on Friday prevented the adoption of a joint declaration following a four-week UN conference on a nuclear disarmament treaty, with Moscow denouncing what it said were “political” aspects of the text.
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which 191 signatories review every five years, aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, promote complete disarmament and promote cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
The nations had been gathered at UN headquarters in New York since Aug 1, participating in almost month-long negotiations, including a final session that was postponed for several hours on Friday.
In the end, the conference’s president, Gustavo Zlauvinen of Argentina, said it was “not in a position to achieve an agreement” after Russia took issue with the text.
Russian representative Igor Vishnevetsky said the draft final text, which was more than 30 pages long, lacked “balance”.
“Our delegation has one key objection on some paragraphs which are blatantly political in nature,” he said, adding Russia was not the only country to take issue with the text.
According to sources close to the negotiations, Russia was opposed in particular to paragraphs concerning the Ukrainian nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, which is occupied by the Russian military.
The latest draft text had expressed “grave concern” over military activities around Ukrainian power plants, including Zapor­izhzhia, as well as over Ukraine’s loss of control of such sites and the negative impact on safety.
Neutral and non-nuclear Austria condemned on Saturday the attitude at the talks of major powers, and not just Russia.
“While three-quarters of the 191 signatory states support credible progress for nuclear disarmament, it is mainly the nuclear-armed states, and above all Russia, which resisted,” the government in Vienna said in a statement.
It noted that contrary to treaty commitments, Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States are improving or expanding their stock of nuclear weapons.
“During the negotiations in New York, there was no perceptible willingness to meet the previously unfulfilled contractual obligations.”
The signatories discussed a number of other hot-button topics during the conference, including Iran’s nuclear program and North Korean nuclear tests.
At the last review conference in 2015, the parties were also unable to reach an agreement on substantive issues.
At the conference opening, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world faces “a nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War.”
“Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,” Guterres said.

2,Fresh shelling at Ukraine power plant as operator warns of radiation risk,The Zaporizhzhia plant in southern Ukraine has been occupied by Russian troops since early March.,"KYIV: Ukraine and Russia traded fresh accusations of shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Saturday, as its operator warned of a radioactive leak risk at the atomic facility.
The Zaporizhzhia plant in southern Ukraine has been occupied by Russian troops since early March.
Kyiv and Moscow have repeatedly accused each other of rocket attacks in the vicinity of the plant — Europe’s largest — located in the city of Energodar.
On Saturday its Ukraine operator Energoatom said Russian troops  “repeatedly shelled” it over the past day. Russia’s defence ministry issued a counter-claim that Ukraine’s troops were responsible for a salvo of 17 shells landing on the site.
“As a result of periodic shelling, the infrastructure of the station has been damaged, there are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is high,” Energoatom said on Telegram. The agency said that as of midday the plant  “operates with the risk of violating radiation and fire safety standards”.
Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian forces  “shelled the territory of the station three times” from the town of Marganets across the Dnipro River.
In a communique the ministry accused Kyiv of  “nuclear terrorism” and said shells landed near areas storing fresh nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. Radiation levels at the plant  “remain normal” the ministry said.
On Tuesday residents in Khortytskyi district — 45 kilometres north-east from the power plant — were given iodine pills to reduce radiation risk in case of a leak.
Residents closer to the plant said earlier this month that they received iodine pills at the very start of the war. On Thursday, the Zaporizhzhia plant was cut off from Ukraine’s national power grid for the first time in its four-decade history due to  “actions of the invaders”, Energoatom said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the power cut was caused by Russian shelling of the last active power line linking the plant to the network. It came back online on Friday afternoon but Zelensky warned  “the worst case scenario ... is constantly being provoked by Russian forces”.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is urging for a mission to the plant  “as soon as possible to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there”.
Agency head Rafael Mariano Grossi has said he wants to visit the site within days, warning of potential disaster. Ukraine energy minister adviser Lana Zerkal said an IAEA inspection  “is planned for the next week”.
But Zerkal told Ukraine’s Radio NV she was sceptical the mission would go ahead, despite Moscow’s formal agreement, as  “they are artificially creating all the conditions so that the mission will not reach the site”.
Britain’s defence ministry said satellite imagery showed an increased presence of Russian troops at the power plant with armoured personnel carriers deployed within 60 metres (200 feet) of one reactor.
Kyiv suspects Moscow intends to divert power from the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014. Washington has warned against any such move.
“The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine,” State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters, saying attempts to redirect power to occupied areas were  “unacceptable”.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — which this week entered its seventh month — has also prompted a wider global energy crisis. Anxiety over gas and oil supply has sent prices soaring.

3,Chinese drillers work fast for wells in drought-hit areas,"“When we got the notice to drill wells, we got up early and worked late, more than 15 hours a day,” says one worker.","JIUJIANG: Teams of drillers are working long hours to build wells to fight a devastating drought sweeping parts of China, farmers in Jiujiang city in the country’s central Jiangxi province said on Saturday. “These villages, all of them, are particularly dry,” said Gao Pucha, 42, who led one drilling team in Dashan village in Jiujiang.
“When we got the notice to drill wells, we got up early and worked late, more than 15 hours a day.”  In another nearby village, a 72-year-old man surnamed Chen scoured the fields for ears of rice left over from the paddy harvester to take home and feed to his chickens. “Sesame, corn, sweet potatoes, cotton in the drylands are all dried up,” Chen said.
Chen added that only the rice fields could be filled with water from nearby reservoirs,  “so they just filled them with a little bit of water and it was a little bit better.” 
China issued a national drought emergency earlier this month as record-high temperatures continued to scorch the regions along the Yangtze River.

4,"With new cardinals, pope puts stamp on Church future","Pope Francis asks new cardinals to remember  “poor families, migrant and homeless persons”.","VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis on Saturday inducted 20 cardinals from around the world, choosing men who mostly agree with his vision of a more progressive and inclusive Church and influencing their choice of his eventual successor.
Pope Francis, 85, presided at a ceremony known as a consistory, telling the new cardinals to show concern for ordinary people despite the high rank that will bring them into contact with the powerful of the earth.
The ceremony marked the eight time Pope Francis has put his stamp on the Church’s future with a new intake of cardinals who will serve as his top advisors and administrators at the Vatican and around the globe.
Those under 80 — 16 among the 20 newcomers — can enter a conclave to elect a new pope from among themselves after he dies or resigns.
They come from Britain, South Korea, Spain, France, Nigeria, Brazil, India, the United States, East Timor, Italy, Ghana, Singapore, Paraguay, and Colombia.
“A Cardinal loves the Church, always with that same spiritual fire, whether dealing with great questions or handling everyday problems, with the powerful of this world or those ordinary people who are great in God’s eyes,” Pope Francis said.
Sitting before the main altar of St. Peter’s Basilica, Pope Francis asked them to remember  “poor families, migrant and homeless persons.”
Pope Francis, elected as pope in 2013, has now chosen 83 of the 132 cardinal electors, or about 63pc. With each consistory, Pope Francis has continued what one diplomat has called a  “tilt towards Asia,” increasing the likelihood that the next pope could be from the region that is a growing economic and political powerhouse.
The 85-year-old pontiff said in an interview last month that if he does resign in the future for health reasons — instead of dying in office - he has no plans to do so anytime soon. This means he could name even more cardinals as soon as next year.
After reading his homily, Pope Francis gave them each their ring and red hat, the colour of which, along with their vestments, is to remind them that they should be willing to shed their blood for the faith.
Since his election as the first Latin American pope, Pope Francis’ has often broken the mould used by his predecessors in picking cardinals. Often he has preferred men from developing nations and smaller cities, rather than from major capitals where having a cardinal used to be considered automatic.
Archbishop Leonardo Steiner of Manaus, Brazil, becomes the first cardinal from the Amazon region, underscoring Francis’ concern for indigenous people and the environment.
Another unexpected new cardinal elector is Archbishop Giorgio Marengo, an Italian who is the Catholic Church’s administrator in Mongolia. At 48, he is the youngest of the new cardinal electors.
Mongolia has fewer than 1,500 Catholics but is strategically significant because it borders with China, where the Vatican is trying to improve the situation for Catholics.
“The Holy Father cares for the Church wherever it is in the world. (We) feel that a tiny community is as important as a large community,” he said before the ceremony.

5,Angola pays homage to ex-leader Santos amid vote dispute,LUANDA: Angolans started paying their final respect to former president Jose Eduardo dos Santos on Saturday as the...,"LUANDA: Angolans started paying their final respect to former president Jose Eduardo dos Santos on Saturday as the veteran strongman’s historically dominant party emerged from its worst electoral result.
Dos Santos, who ruled Angola with an iron fist for 38 years, died on July 8 at a hospital in Spain after suffering a cardiac arrest. His tenure saw members of his family plunder the nation’s oil riches while most Angolans remained mired in poverty. He will be buried at a state funeral on Sunday, on what would have been his 80th birthday.
The funeral is set to be attended by about a dozen foreign leaders, including the presidents of Portugal, Mozambique and South Africa.
A brown casket carrying dos Santos’s body and draped with the Angolan flag made the solemn trip through the streets to the city’s central Praca da Republica plaza.
Most people went about their daily lives while some watched the cortege slowly drive past.
The coffin will lie in state in a tent for the public to pay their last respects. Hundreds of blue seats neatly laid out in the square for mourners were empty with a few MPLA supporters filing past the coffin to bid their final farewell.
“We are here to salute our president, the president of peace, the president of national reconciliation, the president who helped us through the war, and we live in peace thanks to him,” said Solange Quiniani, dressed in the colours of the ruling party.
Religious chants echoed through loudspeakers in the vast plaza, where there were black flags and posters paying homage to  “Zedu” — dos Santos’s nickname.
