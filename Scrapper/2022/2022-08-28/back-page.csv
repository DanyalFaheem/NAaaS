0,Bilawal sees generous response to UN appeal,Slams PTI chief over political rallies amid flood devastation.,"ISLAMABAD: While Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Saturday expressed the hope that the world will generously donate in response to the UN’s Flash Appeal for Pakistan floods in a phone conversation with his Turkish counterpart, he separately criticised former premier and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman Imran Khan for holding political rallies amid the grave situation.
The UN will launch a $160 million Flash Appeal on Aug 30 to meet the urgent needs of millions of people in the country affected by unprecedented monsoon rains and resultant floods. 
In his telephone conversation with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who had called him, Mr Bhutto-Zardari thanked Turkiye’s aid and apprised his counterpart that extensive damage to infrastructure was impeding the relocation of people to safe locations and the effective delivery of assistance.

Slams PTI chief over political rallies amid flood devastation

Besides, speaking to BBC Urdu, FM Bhutto-Zardari said while the government’s priority was provision of tents, food and healthcare to those affected by the natural calamity, PTI leader and former premier Imran Khan can keep holding political rallies at such a crucial time.
Over 33 million have been affected by the floods. More than 1,000 people, including over 300 children, have died so far.
The foreign minister said no government in the world would have been able to cope with a disaster of this scale. Although nearly two months had passed since the floods began at the end of June, the country was still in the rescue and relief stage, he said. 
While criticising Mr Khan for holding political rallies at a time when the floods had wreaked havoc across the country, the minister said: “It’s unfortunate the politicking is taking place despite the devastation of this magnitude caused by the rains. The opposition may continue with politics, but our priority is to express solidarity with the people and provide them relief.”

2,Pakistan reports year’s 15th polio case,17-month-old boy from North Waziristan contracts virus.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan reported its 15th wild poliovirus case of this year after a 17-month-old boy from the North Waziristan tribal district contracted the disease, the National Institute of Health (NIH) said on Saturday.
According to an NIH official, all victims this year are aged under two years, and the only case outside North Waziristan was reported from Lakki Marwat last month.
According to an NIH statement, the country’s polio eradication programme has continued immunisation campaigns wherever possible despite adverse weather. The ongoing national 
anti-polio vaccination drive started on Aug 22 and health workers continue to reach children in all accessible areas, braving heavy rains and floods.

17-month-old boy from North Waziristan contracts virus

Pakistan reported this year’s first case in April after staying polio-free for almost 15 months. It detected only one case last year.
Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus and mainly affects children aged under five years. It enters the nervous system and causes paralysis and even death. Since there is no cure for the disease, vaccination is the most effective protection against it.
While repeated immunisations have protected millions of children from polio, allowing almost all countries to become polio-free, Pakistan and Afghanistan remained the only polio-endemic countries.

DUBAI: Fast bowler Fazalhaq Farooqi returned bowling figures of 3-11 to help Afghanistan beat Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the opening match of the Asia Cup Twenty20 tournament on Saturday.
Afghanistan elected to field and bundled out Sri Lanka for a paltry 105, a total their batsmen overhauled in 10.1 overs in Dubai.
Left-hander Hazratullah Zazai, unbeaten on 37, and wicketkeeper-batsman Rahmanllah Gurbaz, who hit 40, put on 83 runs for the opening wicket to build on the dominance started by the bowlers.
Afghanistan, in Group B with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, have made a thumping start to their campaign in the six-nation tournament that acts as a tune-up to the T20 World Cup in October-November in Australia.
Farooqi, a left-arm quick, stood out for Afgha­nistan after he struck with successive deliveries in the first over of the innings to send Kusal Mendis and Charith Asalanka trudging back to the pavilion for two and nought.
Naveen-ul-Haq then sent back Pathum Nissanka caught behind after the batsman reviewed the on-field call and the third-umpire upheld the decision despite no visible spike on the ultra-edge, leaving the batsman and dressing room stunned.
At that point Sri Lanka were struggling with just five runs on the board and three wickets down in the opening two overs.
Danushka Gunathilaka (17) and Bhanuka Rajap­aksa (38) attempted to hit back with a flurry of boundaries in a 20-run sixth over before spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman broke the 44-run stand.
Wickets kept tumbling with the 13th over providing two run outs, including the end of Rajapaksa while attempting a second run.
Chamika Karunaratne made 31 to take the team total past 100 before being bowled by Farooqi.
Afghanistan openers came out all guns blazing as Gurbaz smashed three fours and four sixes in his 18-ball blitz before falling to leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga.
Zazai kept up the attack with Ibrahim Zadran, who made 15 before being run out, to bring alive the Afghan supporters and silence the Sri Lankan crowd.
India meet Pakistan in a hotly-anticipated Group A clash on Sunday (today) at the same venue.
