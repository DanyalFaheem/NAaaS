0,‘One by one they were swallowed by floodwater’,"Search under way for the bodies, with little hope that the families will ever be able to bid final farewell.","MANSEHRA: Stranded on a rock, completely surrounded by gushing floodwater, four men in Sangai village in Lower Kohis­tan were devoured one by one in the river as they awaited help.
Locals who helplessly witnessed the gut-wrenching deaths say that the five men, who belonged to the indigenous community, tried to make their way out of the flooded river. However, all but one fell into it and died.
“It was a horrible scene [like] in films as hundreds of onlookers were shouting Allah-o-Akbar for the lives of those five people trapped there,” said Maulana Ahsanullah, a family member of the victims.
Mr Ahsanullah, who is also a resident of Sanagai village, recalled the tragic moments when the victims desperately tried to hold onto ropes while attempting to save their lives.

Search under way for the bodies, with little hope that the families will ever be able to bid final farewell

He said the incident happened when the Dubair stream, running parallel to a link road in Sanagai area suddenly started swelling as torrents of water from upstream made its way into the channel.
Two of the victims, Mohammad Obaidullah and Mohammad Riaz, who were drivers by profession, were passing through the road. They tried to park their vehicles at the corner as the water level rose. 
According to eyewitnesses’ account, their three fellows, Mohammad Anwar, Mohammad Fazl and Hazarat Bilal, tried to help them steer the vehicles away from the floods but they were swept away.
“When the water level surged, they jumped on a big rock. But, to their extreme misfortune, Ranowalia Bridge was washed away which further increa­sed the level and they were shoulder-deep into it,” Mr Ahsanullah narrated.
“Out of options,” he added, the five men tried to cling on to the ropes they were carrying and started climbing.
However, as their tenuous grips loosened, four of them vanished into the gushing water. Mohammad Obaidullah was the sole survivor.
Another relative Ashraf Ali said that the incident has shattered people acr­oss all villages and towns in the area. 
“Our people approached the administration and government through cell phones and social media to arrange helicopters for the rescue but our efforts weren’t fruitful,” another local told Dawn.
He added that he even approached Jamiat-i-Islami chief Sirajul Haq and sought help but to no avail. 
The search for the bodies was under way, however, there was no hope that the families would ever get to say the final goodbye to their loved ones.
“The deaths will be remembered forever, and they will always give us the sense that we are the inhabitants of a mountainous abode which is deprived of even basic necessities,” the local added.

1,Hundreds booked for ‘terrorism’ during PM’s visit to Sukkur,"Several flood-hit families claim police lodged a “fake” FIR against the protesters, who only wanted to meet the PM.","SUKKUR: The Sukkur police claimed to have registered a first information report (FIR) on terrorism charges against over 100 unidentified persons for allegedly attacking police personnel, pelting vehicles with stones, damaging public and private property and inciting flood victims outside a relief camp during the visit of the prime minister and foreign minister here on Friday.
PM Shehbaz Sharif along with Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and other ministers visited Sukkur district to assess the flood situation and interacted with displaced families in relief camps. During his visit to a camp set up near BA College, rain-affected families from different areas blocked some roads against the administration’s failure to drain out stagnant rainwater.
According to a police spokesperson, when officials were discharging their duty outside the camp, some rioters, including women, blocked the main road, creating a law and order situation and inciting the flood-affected families against the officials. He claimed rioters also smashed windshields of vehicles as a result of which traffic flow remained suspended for eight hours.
“We have lodged a case under Anti-Terrorism Act against the miscreants,” the spokesperson said, adding action would be taken against them as per law as soon as they were identified in CCTV camera footage and other videos showing them creating a law and order situation.
He warned that no one would be allowed to take law into their hands and disturb peace at this crucial time.
Meanwhile, several flood-hit families said that police have lodged a “fake” FIR against the protesters, who only wanted to meet the prime minister and foreign minister to bring to their notice that they had not been provided relief material such as food, tents, mosquito nets, beds and other resources.
Even after several days, the municipal and public health officials concerned were not taking measures to drain out the stagnant rainwater from their areas, the protesters complained.

2,IHC larger bench to try Imran for contempt,Shahbaz Gill moves SC against validation of his 48-hour custody by IHC.,"ISLAMABAD: A five-judge larger bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) has been constituted to proceed against Pakistan Thereek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan on the charge of contempt of court for ‘intimidating a female judge’.
The bench headed by IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah comprises Just­ice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Justice Babar Sattar.
The bench will resume proceeding on the matter on Aug 31 when the ex-PM is supposed to appear in person before the court. The IHC had earlier issued a show-cause notice to Mr Khan with the direction to appear before the court.
Initially, the matter was heard by a three-member bench. 

Gill moves SC against validation of his 48-hour custody by IHC

The show-cause notice to Mr Khan mentioned that the statement was made in a sub judice matter to get ‘favourable’ verdict and prima facie, this act was tantamount to obstructing the course of justice and due process and to undermine public confidence in the court of law.
“These remarks have been made with the motive of bringing the administration of law into disrepute and eroding the integrity and credibility of the judicial system.”
Prima facie Mr Khan committed “cri­m­inal as well as judicial contempt, punishable under section 5 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003”, it added.
Also, Yaseen Gill, brother of Mr Khan’s chief of staff Shahbaz Gill, has filed a complaint before the IHC chief justice against additional sessions judge Zeba Chaudhry.
It stated that “she had passed the order on August 17, 2022 [to hand over Mr Shahbaz’s custody to police] in grave violation and derogation of judicial norms and express provisions of law”.
Gill approaches SC
Meanwhile, Mr Shahbaz, who is currently lodged in Adiala Prison, approached the Supreme Court against the Aug 22 validation of his physical custody to the police by IHC for 48 hours despite strong evidence of custodial torture.
The petitioner moved two separate pleas before the SC, seeking a direction for the constitution of an independent medical board to ascertain the severity of physical torture, quantum of injuries and inhumane treatment meted out to him during the physical custody.
The SC was urged to set aside the IHC order “with full force” to avoid custodial violence and miscarriage of justice in future police investigations besides declare the investigation in the case (FIR No 691/2022) of Aug 9, including collection of evidence, as “unlawful”.
Earlier, a sessions court had adjourned till Monday the hearing on Mr Shahbaz’s petition seeking post-arrest bail.

5,Flooded lower Sindh reels in pain and destruction,"Thousands of peasants, including women and children, are the worst hit and homeless.","SANGHAR/MIRPURKHAS: Rows of improvised tents dot rural Sindh, devastated by successive spells of torrential monsoon rains since July. But Wali Kohli is determined to face the havoc wrought by extreme weather conditions this summer.
At 7:30am, she is ready to prepare food for her husband, Ganga Ram, and children out of the wheat flour her husband bought. Wali was, however, worried about her buffalo that sits paces away on a roadside facing an irrigation channel. “It is sick and supposed to deliver a baby,” she said while kneading the wheat flour.
Her house made of thatched straw has already caved in. Its remains are surrounded by muddy rainwater. She lives in a village located on a landowner’s farmlands she tills with her husband. “Nothing is left. We can’t enter our home so we struggle to face these conditions,” Wali states.

Districts in lower Sindh are facing massive devastation, miseries and pain. Monsoon rains have affected millions. But thousands of peasants, including women and children, are the worst hit and homeless. Wali and many others like her have been living under the open sky with no immediate end to their miseries.
They have temporarily settled on roadsides in their respective towns ever since rains wreaked a catastrophe for this marginalised section of society. These are in addition to those staying in relief camps in urban centres.
Agricultural fields and villages are fully submerged in these districts. “Destruction of the cotton crop means we won’t be able to pick cotton. I will be looking for alternate labour to make both ends meet,” says Ganga.  
The displaced communities are dependent on food provided by philanthropists or local organisations. Scenes of flood victims chasing vehicles distributing food are now common.
Villages are mostly located on farmlands that are now completely submerged. Their inhabitants wade through rainwater to grab necessary items that have remained safe from the heavy rains and bring back to their makeshift tents.

“Do you think we are sitting on roads out of pleasure?” asked an elderly Hamraj Bheel in Jam Nawaz Ali taluka. Around 70 mud houses in Hamraj’s village have collapsed. “We spend sleepless nights because of mosquitoes, and our animals are in pain too,” he argued.
Flood victims burn wild bushes and wood to produce smoke to keep mosquitoes away from them and their cattle. Animals are an important asset which they sell in such dire times.
“I cherish my cattle more than anything as it helps me eke out a living,” says Cheetan Kohli in Sanghar. His community fellow, Ramo Kohli, points out they have been leading a miserable life for a week. “They [women] go somewhere nea­rby to defecate. There is no other opti­on as our village is totally inundated, otherwise what is the need for sitting here on the road,” argued Ramo. “We don’t know where the government aid goes. Nobody comes to us, except a few,” he complained.
These communities apparently prefer staying on the road near their village instead of relief camps. Their cattle are a major factor that prevents them from moving into camps. “Somehow, this remaining fodder in the field is cut to feed my animals,” said a female peasant.
The Sindh Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) in its Aug 25 report put total casualties at 339 and 974 injuries. Among the dead were 117 men, 46 women and 108 children, while 98,260 cattle had perished, and 191,030 houses were fully damaged and 395,080 partially.
According to the PDMA, over 4.9 million people in Sindh were affected. It claimed the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was providing relief to the PDMA in terms of 3,880 ration bags, 3,600 mosquito nets, 4,900 plastic tarpaulin, 4,835 tents and 95 dewatering pumps.

Those like Cheetan Oadh who have alt­e­r­nate places in the less-affected districts are opting for short-term migration. Oadh is travelling with his 15-member family in a vehicle on the Tando Adam-Mirpurkhas road. “We are going to Ume­rkot as my brick kiln workplace is entirely submerged in rainwater,” he says.
Jhuddo town is the worst hit besides Tando Jan Mohammad in Mirpurkhas. “People from Jhuddo are migrating,” said Manoj Kumar, a local resident. Like several others, he was present at the RD-305 of the spinal drain of the Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) system to see if the water levels in the drain are dropping. “There is around 2.5 feet of water in every street of Jhuddo,” he added.
The accumulated rainwater in different towns of Mirpurkhas is disposed of in the LBOD, which has now peaked. The Naukot Jhuddo road remained completely flooded at RD-305. Even the bridge over the LBOD is under 2.5-foot water, disconnecting the land route between Mirpurkhas and Tharparkar.
The spinal drain has, luckily, not developed a breach, unlike the 2020 rains when a few breaches occurred in it in Mirpurkhas and Badin districts, inundating areas right up to Kaloi in Tharparkar. Districts such as Badin, Sanghar and Mirpurkhas were facing a drainage issue. Agricultural runoff following the monsoon rains is usually disposed of in sub-drains of the LBOD.
Irrigation officials along with local labourers are struggling to protect the main embankment of the spinal drain — currently carrying 10,000 cusecs against a capacity of 4,000 cusecs — by raising its height through stacking of gunny bags. Once the LBOD starts disposing of rainwater at zero point, water levels in towns would also start receding.
