• Announces plans to begin nationwide protest drive from today
• In response to remarks, Pemra bans live broadcast of PTI chief’s speeches
ISLAMABAD: After threatening to file cases against the police, bureaucracy, the Election Com­m­ission of Pakistan and political opp­o­nents over the treatment allegedly meted out to his chief of staff, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Saturday warned the judiciary against its “biased” attitude towards his party, saying that it should brace itself for the consequences.
Despite the imposition of Section 144 of CrPC and Section 16 of the MPO  in the federal capital, a large number of residents came out to attend  the rally led by Mr Khan. The procession started from Zero Point and  reached F-9 Park where the party leadership and their ally, former  minister Sheikh Rashid, also addressed the participants.
Addressing a party rally in the capital’s F-9 park to express solidarity with embattled leader Dr Shahbaz Gill, Mr Khan called out Additional District and Sessions Judge Zeba Chaudhry, who had  approved Mr Gill’s two-day physical remand at the request of the  capital police, and said she should prepare herself as action would be  taken against her.

He also pointed out that there was no action against Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Defence Minister Khwaja Asif, who he claimed had also made statements against the armed forces. He said if a case could be registered against Gill, the PTI would file cases against “everyone”, including former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah.
Mr Khan again called on the “neutrals” (a euphemism he uses for the military establishment) to stand with the nation rather than the “gang of thieves”, in reference to the ruling coalition. He said he wanted to ask the neutrals if they were “really neutral”. He also alleged that the Islamabad police was taking orders for action against his party leaders from ‘someone’.
“When I asked the police to ‘tell me what did you do to Shahbaz Gill’, they said ‘we did nothing, we got a boot from behind to follow orders’,” he said while announcing to move the Supreme Court against the alleged torture on Gill.
Moreover, he alleged that when the PTI-backed government in Punjab started taking action against police officials involved in torturing party workers on May 25 during their long march, the authorities got scared as they started receiving calls asking them not to touch the law enforcers.
On the other hand, the PTI chief said, Gill was caught and tortured to send a message and frighten people that if he could be broken mentally then anyone could be. About his decision to hold the rally on a 24-hour notice, Khan said it was because Gill was being treated inhumanely and restrictions were imposed on the service of ARY News.
He further claimed ARY had been suspended to send a message to other channels that they could face the same consequences.
At the end, the former premier announced that he would present a roadmap to the public in the party’s rally at Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh on Sunday (today), adding he planned to take to the streets across the country from today. “I’m going to take the nation along and tell them, including children and women, that Pakistan cannot become the country it was meant to be as envisioned by Allama Iqbal and Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah until we break the shackles of slavery,” he concluded the rally.
After Mr Khan’s speech, the electronic media regulator slapped a ban on all satellite TV channels from carrying the PTI chief’s speeches live. The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) communiqué – issued late at night – held that channels had failed to implement a time-delay mechanism which could curtail such occurrences.
In a four-page document that included a specific reference to Mr Khan’s speech on Saturday night, where he had targeted police and judicial officers, the regulator said that only recorded speeches could be telecast, and those too would only be allowed if a time-delay mechanism was in place. 
Although the order was not posted on Pemra’s official Twitter account at the time of going to print, a senior government functionary confirmed its authenticity.
In a separate statement, PML-N, PPP, MQM Pakistan and JUI-F called on the judiciary to take legal action against Imran and his aides for threatening a female judge and intimidating police officers, APP reported.

1,PM orders inquiry into traders’ fixed tax issue,Suspends fixed sales tax collection through electricity bills; tells ministers to take traders on board before making decisions.,"• Suspends fixed sales tax collection through electricity bills
• Directs ministers to take traders on board before making any decision
• Ordinance may be issued in the next few days to change collection mechanism, says official
LAHORE: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered an inquiry into how a fixed sales tax imposed on traders doubled at the imposition stage and suspended the tax collection through electricity bills.
Presiding over a meeting on the issue in Lahore on Saturday, the premier also ordered that a new mechanism be devised to collect the sales tax and directed the ministers concerned to take the trading community on board in this regard.
The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail, Energy Minister Khu­r­ram Dastgir, Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman, relevant federal secretaries and other senior officials.
In the budget, the government decided to collect a fixed tax from retailers through electricity bills. The tax rate was decided to be Rs3,000 on a monthly bill of up to Rs30,000; Rs5,000 on a bill ranging from Rs30,000 to Rs50,000; and Rs10,000 on a bill above Rs50,000. These tax rates were to be doubled for retailers not on the Active Taxpayers’ List. 
However, under pressure from protests by several trade bodies, the government announced rolling back the fixed tax scheme and reverting to the old system.
Sources said the government might soon issue an ordinance reviving an old mechanism effective since 2014 under which sales tax was collected at the rate of 5pc on a monthly bill of up to Rs20,000 and at 7.5pc on a bill above Rs20,000.
However, a finance ministry official said that since the new rate was imposed in the finance bill, the government would need an ordinance to change the collection mechanism, something that could happen “in the next few days”.
The official said the collection of the fixed tax would remain suspended in the meantime.
During the meeting, the premier also directed the participants to consult traders’ representatives before taking any decision on collecting tax from shopkeepers through utility bills.
According to FBR data, trading and wholesale make up roughly 19pc of GDP but chip in a minuscule Rs6bn in taxes to the national exchequer. Out of about 2.3 million traders and shopkeepers in the country, hardly 5,000 file tax returns.

3,Imran’s papers for NA-118 by-election challenged,The appeal has been filed by a PML-N candidate from the constituency.,"LAHORE: An appeal has been filed with an appellate tribunal challenging the nomination papers of former prime minister Imran Khan for by-election in NA-118, Nankana Sahib.
Dr Shezra Mansab Kharal, a candidate of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz from the constituency, filed the appeal, saying the returning officer ‘illegally’ accepted the nomination papers of Mr Khan.
She alleged Mr Khan did not disclose, in his nomination papers, the gifts he had received from Toshakhana. She said Mr Khan also failed to disclose the details of the assets owned by him and his wife. 
Also, the appellant said, the nomination papers filed by the PTI candidate were not attested by an oath commissioner as required by the law. She said all those shortcomings had been formally raised before the returning officer, but he chose to ignore the objections and accepted Mr Khan’s nomination papers.
She requested the tribunal to set aside the decision of the returning officer and reject the nomination papers of Mr Khan for the by-election from NA-118.
Multan, Faisalabad seats

4,Fawad proposes multi-party panel to probe ‘torture’ claims,"• Suggests Saad, Shireen and Khokhar identify, bring to book those involved in ‘heinous crime’ • Marriyum rubbishes allegations...","• Suggests Saad, Shireen and Khokhar identify, bring to book those involved in ‘heinous crime’
• Marriyum rubbishes allegations of maltreatment as ‘propaganda’, releases video showing a ‘healthy Shahbaz Gill’ in hospital
ISLAMABAD: Conde­m­ning the alleged torture of party leader Dr Shahbaz Gill while in police custody, Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Sen­ior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry on Saturday suggested that a three-member multi-party panel be formed to expose the individuals responsible and bring them to book.
Meanwhile, the government claims the PTI’s allegations of torture on Gill were mere “propaganda” to divert attention from real issues.
Speaking to the media here on Saturday, Mr Chaudhry stressed that the violence and torture allegedly inflicted on Gill was unacceptable and intolerable. The gravity of the situation, he said, could be gauged from the fact that all political parties were raising their voice against it. He suggested a three-member “ind­­e­pendent” panel consisting of PPP’s Mustafa Nawaz Kho­khar, PML-N federal minister Khwaja Saad Rafique and former PTI minister Dr Shi­r­een Mazari, be formed to probe into the torture on Gill.
He further said the panel should be tasked with identifying the individuals invol­ved in the heinous crime and bring them to book, adding that no one could question the integrity of a panel with members from all  major political parties.
Commenting on cases against PML-N leaders in Punjab, Mr Chaudhry said the provincial government dealt with the issue in a very civilised manner, but the PML-N leaders fled to Islamabad instead of facing the court like the PTI did.
He further remarked that the PML-N’s Azma Bukhari had made a sensational statement that their sole purpose was to extract a statement from Gill against PTI chairman Imran Khan. He added it was difficult to trust the Islamabad Police in the current circumstances.
Govt terms torture claims ‘mere propaganda’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Marri­yum Aurangzeb slammed PTI chief Imran Khan for generating ‘false propaganda’ over the alleged torture on his chief of staff.
Addressing a press conference, the minister said the PTI’s claims of torture under police custody were nothing but “propaganda” to deviate from real issues, which she said were a “defamatory social media campaign over the Lasbela martyrs after the foreign funding verdict followed by Gill’s comments against a state institution”.
Responding to a question, she also challenged Mr Khan to name the agencies that provided him reports about PML-N and PPP, to support his claims in this regard. She stated Gill had violated “red lines given in the Constitution on the basis of which a case was registered against him under the law” and he was taken into custody for investigation.
“We want to make it clear that nobody should be tortured, and in this case there is no use of violence over Shahbaz Gill. It is only propaganda that has been launched by the PTI,” the minister said. “When Shahbaz Gill faces a camera he starts acting.”
She also addressed a video being circulated on social media to claim it showed torture marks on Gill, saying the clip was of another incident in Chakwal where a child predator was tortured by locals. Disseminating such edited videos was a violation of cybercrime laws, Ms Aurangzeb said, adding the torture claims were being probed and Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah would soon hold a press conference to present all the evidences and facts to the public.
On Imran Khan’s claims Gill was subjected to sexual abuse as well, the minister said if that was the case, it would have come up in his medical reports, adding a preliminary torture report was being prepared by the Islamabad Police.
She then played a video, supposedly from Saturday noon and purportedly showing Gill at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences along with Islamabad Police personnel, going through some documents while appearing healthy and standing on his feet.
“Is this the same person Imran Khan claims to have been subjected to severe torture?” Ms Aurangzeb asked, adding: “This video reflects Mr Gill’s real health condition.”
Fawad on ‘hospital’ video
A short while later, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry, reacting to the video shown by the minister, said if it was genuine then it’s good news. He, however, questioned that if Gill was indeed this healthy then why the party chief, lawyers and media weren’t being allowed to meet him. “Police should allow Imran Khan, lawyers and the media to meet him,” he said in a tweet.

5,PML-N leaders seek protective bail from IHC in Punjab Assembly violence case,"Tarar claims party members being targeted to ""avenge"" action against Gill.","ISLAMABAD: A day after police raids on their residences in connection with the violence witnessed in the Punjab Assembly during the chief minister’s election on April 16, at least 13 leaders of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Saturday approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to seek protective bail.
The party leaders, who made the state and Lahore’s Qilla Gujjar Singh police station head respondents in their identical petitions, inc­luded Rana Mashood, Saiful Malook Khokhar, Adil Cha­ttha, Attaullah Tarar, Shuaib Marth, Malik Ghulam Habib, Sardar Awais, Mirza Javed, Pir Khizer Hayat, Raja Saghir, Abdul Rauf, Bilal Farooq, and Rana Manan.
According to the petitions, the FIR against them was registered on the complaint of Deputy Superintendent of Police Shahzad Manzoor. The petitioners termed the contents of the FIR “frivolous” and based on “mala fide” intentions.

Tarar claims party members being targeted to ‘avenge’ action against Gill

The petitioners said they have a right to approach the court of competent jurisdiction and added that their liberty was at stake as there was strong apprehension of their arrest while approaching the said court for relief. The pleas requested the IHC to grant the PML-N leaders protective bail to enable them to appear before the court concerned for bail. The IHC is expected to take up the petitions on Monday.
The FIR in the case alleged that there was a call for the chief minister’s election in the Punjab Assembly when “a few members of the Assembly attacked the deputy speaker” who was subsequently escorted to his chamber. Meanwhile, a few unknown individuals entered the guest gallery and assaulted the MPAs, it claimed.
APP adds: Speaking to reporters outside the high court, PML-N leader and Prime Minister’s Special Assistant on Narcotics Control Attaullah Tarar, whose house was raided a day earlier, lashed out at the Punjab government, especially Chief Minister Parvez Elahi, for its role in the raids. He alleged Mr Elahi was facilitating the “anti-state narrative” of former prime minister Imran Khan and called him a “remote controlled” chief minister.
Mr Tarar said the cases registered against the PML-N MPAs in connection with the Punjab Assembly violence were “baseless” as he went on to accuse the Punjab police of allegedly robbing the houses of the said MPAs during the “illegal raids”. Mr Tarar alleged that the PML-N supporters were being targetted to allegedly avenge the arrest of Shahbaz Gill, a close aide of Imran Khan who has been booked in a sedition case.
“Imran Khan through a remote control [CM] was using the Punjab government to target his political opponents,” he alleged and warned of payback. “Parvez Elahi sahib, you and your son [Moonis Elahi] will face the consequences of this new trend that you have set,” Mr Tarar said, alleging that Moonis Elahi was issuing orders to the government officials without any official authority.
He said instead of the PML-N MPAs, cases should be registered against individuals who manhandled the deputy speaker on April 16.

6,Half a million to pick MNA for Karachi seat today,NA-245 fell vacant after the death of Aamir Liaquat Hussain who was elected on a PTI ticket in 2018.,"KARACHI / ISLAMABAD: After generating a degree of hype not seen in previous by-elections and amid heightened efforts by political parties to muster support, over half a million registered voters in NA-245 are expected to exercise their democratic and constitutional right of franchise today (Sunday) in the by-election. 
The by-election on the seat, which fell vacant after the death of Dr Aamir Liaquat Hussain in June, was originally scheduled to be held on July 27, but the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had to postpone it amid torrential rains.
Aamir Liaquat was elected on the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) ticket in 2018 general elections, defeating Dr Sattar of the MQM-P by securing 56,673 votes against his 35,429 votes. 

NA-245 fell vacant on death of PTI lawmaker Aamir Liaquat Hussain

In the race
Although there are 17 candidates contesting the NA-245 seat, the main fight is expected among Moeed Anwar of the MQM-P, Mahmood Baqi Moulvi of PTI, Muhammad Ahmed Raza of TLP and Dr Farooq Sattar, who will this time contest as an independent candidate with ‘lock’ as his electoral symbol. The PSP has fielded its senior member Syed Hafeezuddin for the by-poll. PPP’s Mohammad Danish Khan and JUI’s Aminullah have already withdrawn their candidatures.
The by-election turns out to be significant in that it is being held just a week before Karachi’s local government elections. The electoral history and voting trends in the neighbourhood suggest that other major political parties like the PSP, which has foothold through their organisational structures in the multi-ethnic constituency, doesn’t seem to have that promising chances in the today’s by-election. 
The situation has left more space for the leading contestants after the ruling party in Sindh, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), and some other parties in the ruling coalition in the Centre have decided to support the MQM-P candidate. 
The MQM-Pakistan had persistently been alleging that its mandate in Karachi had been stolen in the 2018 elections, and was faced with the challenge of proving it at a time when PTI’s popularity appears to be increasing.
Other factors that make the things more daunting for the MQM include the TLP and the PSP candidates as well as Dr Sattar who experts believe would divide the anti-PTI votes. 
This time, the PTI has given ticket to Mehmood Moulvi. His opponents inc­lude Moeed Anwar of the MQM-P, TLP’s Ahmed Raza and Dr Sattar who was the runner-up in 2018 general elections.
Like the NA-240 by-election, the Jamaat-i-Islami is not contesting the polls but it is taking out a rally today in connection with its ‘Karachi rights movement’. 
Areas in constituency 
The constituency comprises Jamshed Quarters and Ferozabad sub-divisions that include PECHS, Lines Area, Pakistan Quarters, Soldier Bazaar, New Town, Patel Para, Garden West, Martin Quarters, Teen Hatti, PIB Colony, etc. 
People in this area mostly belong to middle-class groups doing small businesses or employed with government departments and private sector and also daily-wage earners. 
Various ethnicities live in this area, including Urdu-speaking, Gujarati-speaking, Balochi, Punjabis, Pakhtuns, Sindhis, etc. 
There are over 515,000 registered voters in the constituency, indicating an increase of 71,463 voters since the July 2018 general elections. 
Presiding officer’s authority 
For today’s by-election, the Election Commission has set up 263 polling stations with 1,052 polling booths for voters’ convenience. The Election Commission, on the other hand, claims to have completed all arrangements for the Sunday’s by-poll where it has also planned to introduce the use of new technology on an experimental basis. 
“The security personnel of [Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) and Pakistan Army troops] are deployed (standby / QRF mode only) from August 20 to August 22, in the above-said constituency for the peaceful and smooth conduct of the poll, while performing the security duties they are supposed to first report to the presiding officer of any irregularity or malpractice they observe outside the polling station and act according to the instructions issued by the officer in that regard,” stated a recent ECP notification for the NA-245 by-poll.
