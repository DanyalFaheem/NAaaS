0,CJP urged to ‘avoid sweeping remarks’,PPP's Farhatullah Babar wants Constitution be interpreted to advance powers of all democratic institutions.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) secretary general and former senator Farhatullah Babar has expressed his concerns over the reported remarks of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial regarding “self-serving legislation” by the parliament, suggesting the top judge “to avoid sweeping remarks”.
“Honourable CJP implying that parliament is making self-serving laws throws dim light on the parliament. Respectfully, avoid sweeping remarks. Constitution be so interpreted that it advances powers of all democratic institutions, not of the honourable court alone,” wrote Mr Babar in a series of tweets on Saturday.

 





 
The reaction from the key PPP office-bearer came a day after newspapers reported CJP’s observation during the hearing of a petition filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan, through his counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, to recent amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO) on Friday.

Farhatullah wants Constitution be interpreted to advance powers of all democratic institutions

The CJP had wondered whether the parliament could be expected to make a “self-serving legislation” when it’s in a “transitory period and the elections have to be held”.
“We are the guardians of the Constitution and it is not a joyful enterprise for the courts to do legislation instead or show over activism. But we have to protect the Constitution, the constitutional machinery and the rule of law,” the CJP had reportedly observed. The case is being heard by a three-judge bench headed by the CJP and comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Ijazul Ahsan.
“The sweeping remarks that the accountability law by parliament is self-serving would be welcomed if everyone (including generals and judges) are subjected to same uniform law. Respects, but it’s no glory when those exempted from uniform accountability law call the law self-serving,” Mr Babar tweeted.

 





 
The former senator added: “With respects, when the nominees of honourable CJP for elevation were rejected by majority of Judicial Commission, no member [of the] parliament ever implied that nominations were self-serving. We believe that both nominations and their rejection were honest. Exceptional times indeed for everyone.”

 





 
On July 27, the National Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution seeking the formation of a special parliamentary committee to carry out judicial reforms after heads of the ruling coalition parties, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, launched a tirade against the judiciary over the decision of a three-judge Supreme Court bench, which overruled Punjab Assembly’s deputy speaker’s ruling and removed the premier’s son, Hamza Shehbaz, as the chief minister.
The resolution seeking the committee’s formation had been read out by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and was supported by the small opposition in the house after PPP chairman and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in his hard-hitting speech had held the judiciary responsible for the state of democracy in the country and accused it of validating all the military takeovers in the past.
Before passage of the resolution, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had accused the judiciary of having “double standards” in treating different political parties.

1,Police team in hot water for not collecting Gill’s phone,"Officials say the phone's last location was traced to Banigala but it has been switched off and is ""untraceable"".","ISLAMABAD: A departmental proceeding has been initiated to probe the role of the police team in black uniform and the official in charge for their alleged negligence during the arrest of PTI leader Shahbaz Gill, “resulting in escape of his driver along with vital evidence”, Dawn has learnt. 
Officials in the Islamabad police said the proceeding was initiated after the quarters concerned scolded the police chief and other officers over their failure to take custody of Mr Gill’s mobile phone, his vehicle and driver during his arrest, as the driver and the mobile phone went out of the reach of investigators, hampering access to ‘concrete evidences’. 
The police arrested Imran Khan’s chief of staff on August 9 after chalking out a proper plan and tracing his location, the officials said. The task was given to the department having black uniform under SSP’s supervision along with a police team of operations division. The teams intercepted Mr Gill at Banigala Chowk, but failed to take him into custody immediately as he locked himself in his vehicle and posted videos on social media bringing embarrassment to the police, the officials explained. 
Later, the SP (operations) reached there and arrested him. However, the police teams were confused about his vehicle. Despite a clear direction and an SOP to bring Mr Gill along with his belongings and associate to the designated place, all the belongings were left there and Mr Gill was transported in a private vehicle, they said. Due to this ‘negligence and carelessness’ the PTI leader was able to hand over his mobile phone to his driver, they added. 
Peshawar beyond reach? 
The driver reached Mr Khan’s residence before moving to his in-laws’ house from where he escaped on Aug 11. When the police conducted a raid, his whereabouts were traced to Peshawar, the officials said. 
“Presently, Peshawar is beyond our reach and assistance from KP police is out of question,” the officials said. Any attempt to arrest the driver in KP might result in physical confrontation or other mishap. 
The last location of Mr Gill’s mobile phone was traced to the Banigala area and it remained in use of ‘someone’ till Aug 12, the officers said, adding since then it seemed to have been switched off and ‘untraceable’. 
The investigators identified some other devices being used by Mr Gill and were trying to trace them, they said, adding the investigators had also traced a house in Banigala from where Mr Gill went on air. However, the mobile phone was not used in the beeper, apparently to avoid tracing of the location. 
Some calls were made and messages were sent from the house and received through different numbers before Mr Gill’s appearance in the bulletin, the officers said. Investigators also found and recovered the ‘script’ read out by Mr Gill for the news channel from the house in Gulberg Greens. 
On allegation of torture during interrogation, the officials said that police did not even touch Mr Gill for interrogation.  
Voice match 
Video of the bulletin sent to the FIA for voice matching along with samples of Mr Gill’s voice were matched, they said. 
Meanwhile, the police discharged the brother-in-law of Mr Gill’s driver in a case registered against him and others at the Aabpara police station on August 11, while challan has been submitted agaisnt the driver’s wife for trial,  they said.
They said Mr Gill was in court custody and hospitalised on court’s directives till Monday and he would again be produced in the court for legal procedure. 
Statements recorded 
Meanwhile, a committee under the supervision of DIG (headquarters) recorded Mr Gill’s statements at the hospital.  
PTI leaders Ali Awan, Khurram Nawaz, Imran Khan’s nephew Hassan Niazi and Fawad Chaudhry also came to record their statements. In evidence, they produced video clipping of some news channels’ talk shows, the officers said. Some media persons were also asked to appear before the committee but they did not come. 
Police comment 
When contacted by Dawn for comment on several matters such as the action initiated against the SSP counterterrorism department of police and other officials over their alleged negligence, possibility of arrest of other politicians and some media persons who were in contact with Mr Gill on the day the bulletin was aired and his remand, the public relations officer for the Islamabad police replied: “These are matters related to ongoing investigations and will be addressed during the course of investigation appropriately. All members of ICT Police are doing their job diligently.”

2,PTA asked to share tele­com­­munication infra­struc­ture provider licence details with SCO,PTA had earlier turned down the request on the grounds that the applicant was affiliated with an internet service provider.,"ISLAMABAD: The information commissioner has directed the telecom regulator, the Pakistan Telecom­mu­ni­cation Authority (PTA), to share the details of tele­com­­munication infra­struc­ture provider licence (TIPL) with the state-owned telecom company Special Communications Organi­sa­tion (SCO) by Aug 25.
The decision came on an appeal filed by an individual, Mohammad Ahmed, under the Right of Access to Information Act 2017, against the PTA while seeking details of licences granted to the SCO. 
The PTA earlier turned down the request on the grounds that the applicant was affiliated with an internet service provider, Nayatel.
After hearings, Chief Information Commissioner Mohammad Azam ruled that it was even the right of a company under the Right to Information (RTI) Act to seek such public information, as the purpose of this law was to make the government more accountable to its people and improve participation by the public in public affairs, reduce corruption and inefficiencies in government to promote economic growth and good governance.
The SCO, working under the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecom, was established in 1976 to develop, operate and maintain all telecom services in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
The information commission directed the PTA to share the details including the minutes of the its meeting when the final decision was taken to grant Telecommunication Infra­structure Providers Licence to SCO in 2014, and the details of the final decision over the matter taken by the PTA in 2019.
“The minutes of the official meetings are exempted from disclosures under the RTI Act only if final decision has not taken on the issue being deliberated upon in the official meeting, once the final decision has been taken, the minutes of the meeting become public information, unless hit by any of the exempted clause of the RTI Act,” the order of the information commission said.
It added that the details sought from the PTA did not fall in the exempted category.

3,Rs2.5bn grant  for Balochistan’s public varsities,CM Bizenjo review financial and administrative issues of universities in the province.,"QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Abdul Qudus Bizenjo has approved the release of a Rs2.5 billion grant-in-aid for the 10 public sector universities in the province faced with financial issues.
Mr Bizenjo took the decision in a meeting held to review the financial and administrative issues of universities in the province.
“The students studying in the universities of the province are our own children who need to be invested so that they are not left behind in education, skills, science and technology,” he said
Balochistan’s chief secretary, higher education secretary, vice chancellors, and other officials attended the meeting.
The grant was released after protests by staff and faculty members of the University of Balochistan and Balochistan University of Information Technology Engin­eering and Management Sciences (BUITEMS).
The higher education secretary informed the meeting that Rs2.5bn was allocated in the provincial budget to financially support the universities, which would be distributed among 10 universities according to an agreed formula. He said all the factors had been taken into consideration in the fixed formula for distributing the grant.
The meeting emphasised the need to create a ratio between income and expenditure while reviewing the financial affairs and structure of the universities.
It was agreed that universities were autonomous institutions and through better financial management they could be made self-reliant like other universities in the country and the world.
The vice chancellors told the meeting the Higher Education Commission (HEC) should give a 9pc share to Balochistan’s universities under the formula of the National Finance Commission (NFC), but the share given to the universities of the province was only 4.5pc, due to which the universities were facing financial problems and faced a yearly revenue shortfall of Rs2.9bn.
The total income of universities from tuition fees was Rs1.4bn, while Rs3.4bn was received from the HEC, whereas the provincial government’s grant-in-aid was Rs2.5bn.
It was decided that the chief secretary and the vice chancellors of major universities would meet the HEC chairman and discuss the provision of 9pc grants to Balochistan universities under the NFC award.
Chief Minister Bizenjo assured the vice chancellors of a lasting solution to their issues and stressed that the goal of developing Balochistan could only be achieved by improving its education system and equipping its youth with knowledge and skills.
