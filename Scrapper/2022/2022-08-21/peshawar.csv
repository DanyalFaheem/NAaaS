The Provincial Disaster Management Authority said that two women were killed after the roofs of their houses collapsed in Birmal tehsil of South Waziristan due to the downpour.
The Lower Chitral administration said that three people were killed after being washed away by flash floods in Shishikoh valley of the district. It said all bodies had been recovered.
Barenis Gol area of Lower Chitral district recorded heavy flooding, which destroyed irrigation channels, water schemes, bridges and agricultural lands. However, no damage to public life was reported.

Houses, roads and crops damaged to misery of residents

Also, Upper Chitral district’s Reshun Nullah, Pasum Gol, Chuinj Payeen, Parkushap, Khuz Payeen and Brep villages were flooded.
The PDMA said the downpour-induced flash floods destroyed water schemes and irrigation channels in the area. It added that flooding in Khuz Nullah destroyed many houses, irrigation channels and water schemes.
The people of Khuz area said that flash floods destroyed 18 houses forcing their residents to move to mountain for fear of more floods. They flayed the district administration’s ‘failure’ to come to their rescue and relief.
Floodwaters also caused widespread damages in Chuinj area and suspended traffic on the Yarkun Road in Pasum Gol and Shano Gul areas. They also restricted access to Chuinj area from Pasum Gol.
The calamity paralysed life in Dera Ismail Khan district’s Paroa and Daraban tehsils wiping out many villages and damaging roads to the misery of the residents.
The flash floods from Koh-i-Sulaiman mountains wreaked havoc in Daraban Kalan, Chodhwan, Musa Zai Sharif, Prova, Makarr, Ramak, Babar Kachha, Babar Pakka, Jhuk Chandna, Jhuk Tilkan and Bharki, Kirri Shamuzai, Fateh Ali and Khui Bahara areas. Hundreds of houses were damaged, crops destroyed and the cattle perished in dozens of villages, while traffic was suspended on several flooded roads.
The floodwater inundated the Prova grid station causing power outages across the tehsil. The Wapda officials reported damage to machinery and power breakers on the premises. They said the restoration of breakers would require several weeks for repair or replacement.
The officials said that they had yet to find out whether the floodwaters had damaged power transformers and if the damage was detected, the residents would suffer from prolonged power outages.
The residents said that the devastation caused by flash floods to houses, lands and sources of livelihood had forced many families in Prova and Daraban tehsils and adjoining areas to shift to safer places.
They criticised the elected representatives and district administration over ‘failure’ to ensure the rescue and relief of flood victims.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department forecast more rains in parts of the province for Sunday (today).
It said that Kakul received 53mm of rain, Balakot 24mm, Mirkhani 23mm, Patan 16mm, Lower Dir 13mm, Upper Dir 8mm, Malam Jabba 9mm, Drosh 3mm and Chitral city 2mm during the day.

3,Peshawar court orders release of three Afghan students,Dismisses illegal stay charge against them...,"PESHAWAR: A local court on Saturday ordered the immediate release of three Afghan students after dismissing the charge of illegal stay against them.
Judicial magistrate Salman Riayat issued the orders after hearing the counsel for students Abdullah, Rahimullah and Imdadullah and the state prosecutor.
The Afghan students were arrested a day ago by officials of the University Town police station and were charged under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act with staying in the country without valid documents.
As they were produced before the magistrate, their lawyer, Imad Khalil, contended that his clients studied in the Islamia College Peshawar and lived in the province lawfully.

Dismisses illegal stay charge against them

He argued that the students were awarded scholarship by the Higher Education Commission and were having all the valid documents required for staying in Pakistan.
The counsel pointed out that the local police had launched a crackdown on Afghan nationals celebrating their country’s Independence Day on Aug 19 and arrested the three students.
He said celebrating national day of a country here was not a crime unless the participants created disturbance and damaged public property.
Mr Khalil said Afghan students were peaceful and didn’t carry out any illegal activity. He requested the court that instead of conducting further proceedings in the case the students should be discharged of the allegations levelled against them as no crime had taken place.
He said keeping them behind the bars would be an injustice to them.
ACQUITTAL PLEA: Former secretary of the housing department Zakiullah Khan and his brother and former additional inspector general of police Zafarullah Khan have filed an application with an accountability court seeking their acquittal in the light of recent amendments made in the accountability law in a reference accusing them of possessing illegal assets.
Judge Haq Nawaz fixed Sept 2 for hearing the application.
The application was filed by advocate Qazi Jawad Ahsanullah on behalf of the two accused persons under Section 265-K of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which empowers the trial court to acquit an accused before conclusion of the trial if there is no likelihood of their conviction on the basis of available evidence.
The two brothers were arrested by the National Accountability Bureau in 2016 on the charge of possessing around Rs150 million worth of assets ‘disproportionate’ to the known sources of their income.
The applicants contended that the National Accountability (Second Amendment) Act 2022 was recently enacted and published in official Gazette on Aug 16.
They said that Act led to several amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999.
The applicants contended that amendment was also made to Section 5 of the ordinance providing that the law would be related to offences, including properties of the value not less than Rs500 million.
They pointed out that in light of those amendments, the accountability court no longer had the jurisdiction to deal with the case.
The applicants also said that the evidence available on record had so far not connected with the commission of the offence and they were entitled to be acquitted under Section 265-K of the CrPC.

7,Plan under consideration to change AJK status: Fazl,Says JUI-F has already opposed the idea.,"PESHAWAR: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has said that a plan is under consideration to change the status of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and declare it as a separate province. 
Addressing the party’s general council meeting here on Saturday, he said that JUI-F had opposed the plan and passed a resolution at the all parties conference not to change the existing status of Azad Kashmir. 
“The plan about changing the status of Azad Kashmir is still under consideration, but JUI-F would insist not to change the position of Azad Kashmir,” said Maulana Fazl. 

Says JUI-F has already opposed the idea

The two-day general council meeting of JUI-F started in Peshawar, in which over 900 members were participating. The council would discuss the prevailing political scenario, upcoming by-elections and the next general elections in the country. 
About the prevailing situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, particularly the merged districts, the JUI-F chief said that armed people surfaced in the region when peace talks started. He said that unarmed civilians were confronting armed people in the region. 
He said that his party believed in sustainable peace and was ready for playing a role in this regard, but at the same time the JUI-F leaders and workers also wanted their safety to be guaranteed. He said that his party was being punished for its role in supremacy of the Constitution. 
Criticising the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Maulana Fazl said that he had been warning from the very beginning that former prime minister Imran Khan was a foreign agent and that he was receiving funds from America and India. 
He said that his (Maulana) close friends were stating that his stance, regarding the PTI, was unnecessarily harsh, but the recent disclosures, particularly the foreign funding case, had exposed Imran Khan. 
He said that his party had never made a compromise with foreign agents. He said the JUI-F brought all genuine political forces on one platform and gave a message that Pakistan was politically stable. He claimed that no law in the country had been made in accordance with Islamic principles, since 1973. 
“Anarchy becomes inevitable when a country is on verge of default,” he said, and added that there were certain forces within the provinces who wanted such a catastrophe to occur so they could exploit the situation.
