0,13 killed as Somali forces battle Al Shabaab at besieged hotel,MOGADISHU: At least 13 civilians have been killed and dozens wounded in an Islamist militant attack on a hotel in ...,"MOGADISHU: At least 13 civilians have been killed and dozens wounded in an Islamist militant attack on a hotel in the Somali capital, officials said on Saturday, as security forces battled gunmen barricaded inside many hours after the siege began.
Fighters from the Al Qaeda affiliate Al Shabaab stormed the Hayat Hotel in Mogadishu on Friday evening in a hail of gunfire and bomb blasts.
Scores of people were trapped inside but officials said many including children have since been rescued. Sporadic gunfire and loud explosions could be heard into Saturday afternoon, but details remain difficult to verify in the chaos.
It is the biggest attack in Mogadishu since Somalia’s new president, Hassan She­i­kh Mohamud, was elected in May after many months of political instability.
Al Shabaab, which has been waging a deadly insurgency for 15 years against the fragile government in the Horn of Africa nation, has claimed responsibility.
“We are getting information about five more victims confirmed dead and that makes 13 the overall number of civilians killed by the terrorists,” security commander Mohamed Abdikadir said.
“The security forces rescued dozens of civilians including children who were trapped in the building.” Police officer Ibrahim Duale confirmed that more than 10 people had been killed, but said updated information would be released once the siege had ended.
“The security forces will announce any moment that the siege is over, it took a long time because of the complexity of the rescue mission,” Duale said.
The director of Mogadishu’s main trauma hospital, Mohamed Abdirahman Jama, said the facility was treating at least 40 people wounded in the hotel attack and a separate mortar strike on another area of the capital.
Dozens of people gathered outside the four-storey hotel to discover the fate of loved ones. “We have been looking for a relative of mine who was trapped inside the hotel, she was confirmed dead together with six other people, two of them I know,” said an anxious Muudey Ali.
There has been no official comment from the government, although East Africa grouping IGAD and Turkey, which has a military base in Somalia, both issued strong condemnations.
In another incident, a volley of mortar shells hit the seafront neighbourhood of Hamar Jajab, district commissioner Mucawiye Muddey said.
“Among those critically wounded are a newlywed bride and her groom and a family of three children, a mother and their father,” he said. There was no immediate claim for that attack.
Witnesses had reported at least two powerful explosions on Friday as gunmen stormed the hotel, a popular spot for government officials in a bustling area on the airport road.
Police spokesman Abdifatah Adan Hassan had told reporters Friday the initial blast was caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel with other gunmen. Witnesses said a second blast occurred just a few minutes later, inflicting more casualties as rescuers, security forces and civilians rushed to the scene.
Al Shabaab claimed responsibility in a brief statement on a pro-Shabaab website, saying its fighters were carrying out  “random shooting” inside the hotel.

1,North Korea imported Chinese masks before declaring Covid victory,"China exported 1.23 million facial masks to North Korea in July, worth $44,307, surging from 17,000 the previous month.","BEIJING: North Korea imported more than 1 million facial masks and 15,000 pairs of rubber gloves from China in July, shortly before declaring victory over Covid-19, Chinese trade showed on Saturday.
Pyongyang last week declared victory over the coronavirus, ending a little-detailed fight against  “fever” cases that had risen to 4.77 million. It has registered no new such cases since July 29.
Still, China exported 1.23 million facial masks to North Korea in July, worth $44,307, surging from 17,000 the previous month, according to data released by Chinese customs.
From January to July, the last month for which data is available, the North bought more than 11.93 million masks from China, data showed.
North Korea did not import any Covid-19 prevention and control products from China in May, the data showed.
China’s overall exports to North Korea surged to $59.74 million in July from $19.05 million in June.
Top exports were semi- or wholly milled rice, cigarettes, disodium carbonate and smoked sheets of natural rubber.
North Korea bought $5.16 million worth of semi or wholly milled rice, $1.98 million of soybean oil & fractions, $1.21 million of granulated sugar in July, the Chinese customs data showed.
China suspended cross-border freight train services with North Korea following consultations due to Covid-19 infections in its border city of Dandong, China’s foreign ministry said on April 29.

2,"Russian crops, fertiliser must move ‘unimpeded’, says UN chief","""It is important that all governments and the private sector cooperate to bring them to market,"" he says.","ISTANBUL/MOSCOW: Russian  fertilisers and agricultural products must be able reach world markets   “unimpeded” or a global food crisis could strike as early as next year, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Saturday.
“It is important that all governments and the private sector cooperate to bring them to market,” he said from the Joint Coordination Center (JCC).
The  JCC oversees the implementation of the Ukrainian grain export agreement  signed in July by Kyiv and Moscow with the UN and Turkey as guarantors.
The agreement also guarantees Russia the right to export its agricultural products and fertilisers despite Western sanctions.
“What  we see here in Istanbul and in Odessa is only the more visible part of  the solution. The other part of this package deal is the unimpeded  access to the global markets of Russian food and fertiliser, which are  not subject to sanctions,” Guterres said, adding that despite this, Russian fertiliser and agricultural exports still faced  “obstacles.” 
“Without fertiliser in 2022, there may not be enough food in 2023.  Getting more food and fertiliser out of Ukraine and Russia is crucial to  further calm commodity markets and lower prices for consumers,” he  said.
Guterres travelled this week to Ukraine, where he met with  the presidents of Ukraine and Turkey, Volodymyr Zelensky and Recep  Tayyip Erdogan, in the western city of Lviv on Thursday. He headed to the southern city of Odessa on Friday.
Earlier  on Saturday, he visited the first aid ship chartered by the United Nations  to transport Ukrainian grain on the southern shores of Istanbul in the  Sea of Marmara.
The Brave Commander left the Ukrainian port of  Pivdenny on Tuesday with 23,000 tonnes of wheat before crossing the  Bosphorus on Wednesday evening.
The UN chief vowed Thursday that  his organisation would try to  “step up” grain exports from Ukraine  before the onset of winter, which are crucial for food supplies in many  African countries.
Under the agreement signed in July, 650,000  tons of Ukrainian grain and agricultural products have left the  Ukrainian ports of Odessa, Chornomorsk and Pivdenny since August 1.
Ships  must use a safe corridor to travel in the Black Sea and then be  inspected by the JCC before being allowed to cross the Bosphorus Strait. Cereal  exports from Ukraine, one of the world’s leading producers and  exporters, were blocked for several months due to the Russian invasion,  raising fears of a global food crisis.
Drone shot down at Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters
A drone was shot down over the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea fleet in annexed Crimea on Saturday, a local official said. “The drone was shot down just above the fleet headquarters” in the city of Sevastopol, city governor Mikhail Razvojaev wrote on Telegram, blaming the attempt on Ukrainian forces.
“It fell on the roof and caught fire,” he said, adding that there was no major damage or victims. It was the second assault of its kind against the fleet headquarters in less than a month, after a drone attack on July 31 in its courtyard wounded five people and led to the cancellation of planned Fleet Day celebrations.
It was also the latest attack to target Russian military infrastructure in Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula that Moscow seized and annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

3,Fear for future after mass die-off of fish in Oder river,"It is still unclear what poisoned the Oder, Poland’s second largest river.","WIDUCHOWA: As thousands of dead fish neared the banks of the Oder River in the village of Widuchowa in western Poland on Aug 11, local people realised an ecological disaster that started in late July in the country’s south-west was heading towards the Baltic Sea.
As Widuchowa’s residents searched for tools to remove the lifeless bodies from the the river, the government began crisis response that many scientists say came too late.
“It’s been the hardest five days of my life,” said Pawel Wrobel, the mayor of Widuchowa, which is around 400 kilometres (250 miles) from the town where dead fish had first been spotted.  “I’d never imagined experiencing such a catastrophe, it is something you see in disaster movies.”  With the help of the local community, he gathered dozens of pitchforks, used to lift potatoes, to remove dead fish from the river, which marks part of the Polish-German border.
“We don’t know how to do it and what tools to use, we learn from our mistakes,” Wrobel said.
On Aug 12, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki fired the head of Poland’s national water management authority and the head of the general environmental inspectorate, saying that their institutions should have reacted earlier.
Despite numerous tests of fish and water samples conducted by Polish and foreign laboratories, and a 1-million-zloty ($211,775) reward for information on the source of contamination, it is still unclear what poisoned the Oder, Poland’s second largest river.

4,Thousands gather to fete South Africa’s new Zulu king,"Misuzulu Zulu, 47, is set to succeed his father, Goodwill Zwelithini, who died in March last year after 50 years in charge.","NONGOMA: Thousands of people gathered at the Zulu royal palace in South Africa on Saturday for the coronation of a new king in the country’s richest and most influential traditional monarchy.
Misuzulu Zulu, 47, is set to succeed his father, Goodwill Zwelithini, who died in March last year after 50 years in charge but a bitter succession dispute threatens to overshadow the ceremony.
Although the title of king does not bestow executive power, the monarchs wield great moral influence over more than 11 million Zulus, who make up nearly a fifth of South Africa’s population.
Men and women in colourful traditional outfits assembled outside the marble palace on the hills of Nongoma, a small town in the southeastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, the Zulu heartland. Tens of thousands more were expected to arrive throughout the day to honour the new sovereign. “Today the king will be acknowledged by the whole Zulu Nation,” Misuzulu’s sister, Princess Ntandoyesizwe Zulu, 46, said. Yet, an acrimonious family dispute over the throne raged.
On Saturday, a court in Piete­rmaritzburg was to hear an urgent application by a branch of the royal family to block all ceremonies.
In Nongoma, lines of Zulu warriors, known as amaButhos and holding spears and shields of animal skin, marched into the palace grounds.
Women — some bare-chested, others in pleated skirts and beaded belts or draped with fabrics bearing the effigy of the sovereign — sang and danced.
On Friday night, Misuzulu entered the palace’s  “cattle kraal” where he took part in a secret rite designed to present the new monarch to his ancestors. Only select members of the royal family and amaButhos were allowed in the enclosure which is protected from curious eyes by a thick fence of tree trunks.
“It’s a holy place, we can’t reveal to the world what is happening there,” said Muntomuhle Mcambi, 34, an amaButho.
Earlier this week, the soon-to-be king also killed a lion at a nearby reserve - in one of the last steps before the coronation.
Family spat
His path to the crown has not been smooth. King Zwelithini left six wives and at least 28 children when he died last year. Misuzulu is the first son of Zwelithini’s third wife, who he designated as regent in his will.
But the queen died suddenly a month later, leaving a will naming Misuzulu as the next king — a development that did not go down well with other branches of the family. Queen Sibongile Dlamini, the late king’s first wife, has backed her son Prince Simakade Zulu as the rightful heir.

5,Receding water levels of Yangtze reveal ancient Buddhist statues,The Yangtze’s water levels have been falling rapidly due to a drought and a heatwave in China’s southwestern region.,"BEIJING: Plunging water levels of the Yangtze River have revealed a submerged island in China’s southwestern city of Chongqing and a trio of Buddhist statues on it that are believed to be 600 years old, state media Xinhua has reported.
The three statues were found on the highest part of the island reef called Foyeliang, initially identified as built during the Ming and Qing dynasties. One of the statues depicts a monk sitting on a lotus pedestal.
The Yangtze’s water levels have been falling rapidly due to a drought and a heatwave in China’s southwestern region.
Rainfall in the Yangtze basin has been around 45pc lower than normal since July, and high temperatures are likely to persist for at least another week, official forecasts said. As many as 66 rivers across 34 counties in Chongqing have dried up, state broadcaster CCTV said on Friday.
Weeks of baking drought across Europe have also revealed long-submerged treasures.
In Spain, archaeologists have been delighted by the emergence of a prehistoric stone circle dubbed the  “Spanish Stonehenge”. Another of Europe’s mighty rivers, the Danube, has fallen to one of its lowest levels in almost a century, exposing the hulks of more than 20 German warships sunk during World War Two near Serbia’s river port town of Prahovo.

6,"32 killed, dozens injured in two Turkiye accidents",Pakistan condoles deaths.,"ISTANBUL: At least 32 people were killed and dozens were injured in two separate road accidents in Turkiye on Saturday, each in places where collisions took place earlier in the day, local media reported. 
A first crash involving a bus and an ambulance killed 16 people and injured 21 more on a motorway in Gaziantep province, while at least 16 people were killed and nearly 30 injured after a truck driver hurtled into pedestrians in Derik in Mardin province. 
Governor Davut Gul said earlier the first accident involved “a bus, an emergency team and an ambulance” on the route between provincial capital Gaziantep and Nizip.  

Pakistan condoles deaths

The DHA news agency said a passenger bus had crashed into an ambulance, a firefighting truck and a vehicle carrying journalists at the site of a previous crash. Four paramedics, three firefighters and two journalists from Turkey’s Ilhas news agency were among those killed, local media reported. 
As the emergency services were attending an earlier incident at the site, at least 16 people were killed and nearly 30 injured after a truck driver hurtled into pedestrians in Derik in Mardin province, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca confirmed.  The accident in “occurred after the breaks gave out on a lorry, which hit a crowd”, Koca wrote on Twitter. 
Soon after the first accident, Pakistan’s Foreign Office in a statement condoled loss of life in the tragedy.
The FO spokesperson said: “We are deeply saddened to learn of the tragic traffic accident in Gaziantep, Turkiye, resulting in the loss of a number of precious lives and injuries to many more. We seek Allah Almighty’s blessings for the departed souls, and pray for swift recovery of the injured. We also convey our deepest condolences to the brotherly people and Government of Turkiye in this hour of sorrow.”

7,Odinga vows to contest election loss in court,NAIROBI: Kenya’s veteran politician Raila Odinga on Saturday defended plans to make a court challenge to the...,"NAIROBI: Kenya’s veteran politician Raila Odinga on Saturday defended plans to make a court challenge to the results of last week’s  “joke” election that handed victory to Deputy President William Ruto.
Ruto was declared president-elect on Monday, scraping past Odinga with a margin of less than two percentage points, after an anxious days-long wait for results of the August 9 vote.
The outcome has been challenged not only by Odinga’s camp but also, in a bizarre twist, by four out of seven commissioners at the election body that oversaw the vote.
“We want to see justice done so that peace can be found,” 77-year-old Odinga said at his Nairobi home after a meeting with religious leaders.
“We have decided to use the law to go before the Supreme Court and table our evidence to show that it was not an election but a joke.” The veteran opposition leader has now been defeated in all five presidential votes he has contested, even though this year he ran with the backing of outgoing President 
Uhuru Kenyatta and the weight of the ruling party behind him.
No presidential poll outcome has gone uncontested in Kenya since 2002, and the disputes have led to bloodshed in the past.
In August 2017, the Supreme Court annulled the election after Odinga rejected Kenyatta’s victory. Dozens of people were killed by police in post-poll protests.
The aftermath of this year’s court decision is being keenly watched as a test of democratic maturity in East Africa’s richest economy.
Kenya’s worst electoral violence occurred after the 2007 vote, when more than 1,100 people died in bloodletting between rival tribes.
Odinga — or any other challenger — has until 1100 GMT on Monday to file a petition at the Supreme Court.
The seven-judge tribunal will then have 14 days to issue a ruling. If it orders an annulment, a new vote must be held within 60 days. “We are doing this to defend the democracy of our country that many people fought for,” Odinga said.

A man and a woman were wounded in a shooting at a mall in the southern city of Malmo on Friday, with the man eventually succumbing to his injuries and the woman hospitalised.
On Saturday, the chief of Malmo police, Petra Stenkula, told a press conference that  “Actually, everything leads us to believe that this man was the target of this execution.” Police have said that they have arrested the 15-year-old suspected shooter.
The woman victim, who was in serious condition, was thought to have been a passerby. Police consider the shooting to be  “an isolated criminal incident” and have excluded any terror links.
“Firing in shopping mall is absolutely pitiless with a total disregard for others’ lives,” Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told a press conference while on the campaign trail in Malmo.
In July, three people were killed in a shooting in a shopping mall in the Danish capital of Copenhagen, around 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Malmo. Crime has become an important issue weeks ahead of elections.

9,Macron heads to Algeria to relaunch ties,Ties hit a low last year after Macron reportedly questioned whether Algeria had existed as a nation before the French invasion.,"PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron will visit former colony Algeria next week in a bid to improve strained ties between Paris and Algiers, the French presidency said on Saturday.
French-Algerian ties hit a low late last year after Macron reportedly questioned whether Algeria had existed as a nation before the French invasion and accused its  “political-military system” of rewriting history and fomenting  “hatred towards France”.
Algeria withdrew its ambassador in response, but the two sides appear to have mended ties since.
“This trip will contribute to deepening the bilateral relationship looking to the future... to reinforce Franco-Algerian cooperation in the face of regional challenges and to continue the work of addressing the past,” the presidency said in a statement after a call between Macron and his opposite number Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune. Macron is to visit Algeria from Thursday to Saturday next week.

Algeria recently became a centre of attention for the European Union in its efforts to  cut back imports from Russia

The North African country won its independence from France following a gruelling eight-year war, which ended with the signing in March 1962 of the Evian Accords.
On July 5 of the same year, days after 99.72 percent voted for independence in a referendum, Algeria finally broke free from colonial rule — but memories of the 132-year occupation continue to haunt its ties with France. Algeria’s war of independence left hundreds of thousands dead.
French historians say half a million civilians and combatants died — 400,000 of them Algerian — while the Algerian authorities insist 1.5 million were killed.
But six decades on, despite a string of gestures by Macron, France has ruled out any form of apology for the colonial period. The French presidency announced Macron’s visit as Algeria reels from devastating wildfires.
Fires in northeastern Algeria — now largely extinguished — have killed 38 people, and ravaged more than 10 percent of a Unesco-listed biosphere reserve.
But firefighters were still battling blazes in the far west on Saturday, the Algerian civil defence said. 
Macron offered France’s land and air firefighting services to help, the presidency said.
This week’s trip will be the French president’s second to Algeria as head of state, after a brief one in December 2017 at the start of his first term when Abdelaziz Bouteflika was still president.
This visit is set to be longer, and take him to both the capital Algiers and second city Oran. Tebboune, Bouteflika’s former premier, won presidential elections in 2019, after mass protests forced his ageing predecessor to resign.
Earlier this year, he congratulated Macron on his re-election and invited him to come to Algeria.
Thanks to its large natural gas reserves, Algeria recently has also  become a centre of attention for the European Union in its efforts to  cut back imports from Russia.  Relations between Macron and  Tebboune last year soured when remarks made by the French president  about Algeria’s history led to a diplomatic dispute linked to the two  country’s shared colonial past.

10,Sea of yellow balloons cheers Angola’s Lourenco at election rally,"LUANDA: Waving flags and yellow balloons, thousands of supporters of Angola’s ruling party danced in jubilation on...","LUANDA: Waving flags and yellow balloons, thousands of supporters of Angola’s ruling party danced in jubilation on Saturday at a final campaign rally in Luanda by President Joao Lourenco, who is seeking re-election next week.
In contrast, Lourenco’s tone while delivering his last-ditch speech to supporters of the Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) party was steady and sombre.
The military officer turned politician addressed the cheering crowd gathered in a field on the outskirts of the capital Luanda, trumpeting economic reforms enacted during his first term in an effort to conjure confidence the MPLA, which has held power since independence in 1975.
“We made and restructured our economy,” he told the sea of followers donning the colours of the country’s flag of red, black and yellow.
He promised to invest in electricity production and build refineries to better capitalise on the country’s oil riches among other things.
“The speech was great,” said Aberto Leal Moniz, an MPLA activist and school teacher.
“Many services that the president promised in his last speech (in 2017) have mostly been executed. He promised us a new train, we have it. Everything is in place.” Over 14 million people are registered to vote Wednesday when polls open in what has been described as the tightest election since Angola emerged from a lengthy civil war two decades ago.
Little has changed
If the MPLA is nervous, though, there were no signs of it on Saturday. Supporters were on their feet for the hours-long rally, which included live music from a rapping duo — whose presence was a nod to the much sought-after youth voters.
Long favoured for having liberated the country from colonial powers and ending a brutal civil war in 2002, the MPLA’s firm grip on power is being tested amid rising poverty driven by inflation and the worst drought the country had seen in decades.
Lourenco promised to usher in a new era for Angola when he was first elected in 2017, having inherited an oil-dependent economy deep in recession.
The nearly four-decade tenure of his predecessor Jose Eduardo dos Santos saw members of his family capitalise on the nation’s oil while most Angolans remained mired in poverty.
Although handpicked by dos Santos, upon taking office Lourenco led an anti-corruption drive and launched an ambitious reform plan to differentiate revenue streams and privatise state-owned firms.
