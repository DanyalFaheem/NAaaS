0,Wahab says Rs1.5bn released for road repair works,KARACHI: City Administrator Barrister Murtaza Wahab on Saturday said that the provincial government had released...,"KARACHI: City Administrator Barrister Murtaza Wahab on Saturday said that the provincial government had released Rs1.5 billion for the repair of roads of seven routes of the Peoples Bus Service.
“In the first phase, the seven routes on which the Peoples Bus Service is running will be repaired where needed,” he said, adding that the construction and repair of other roads would also be started soon.
Speaking at a press conference here, Barriest Wahab said that the tendering process for awarding contracts of road repairs would start shortly.
He said that 157 development schemes had been approved for Karachi at a cost of Rs18bn in the current financial year, out of which 146 schemes were to be carried out under the annual development programme.
He said that Rs12bn had been released for these schemes, adding that no government wanted city roads to be in dilapidated condition as it caused hardship to the citizens.
The administrator said that the repair and construction of Chakiwara Road, Miran Shah Road, Sher Shah Road, 31 different roads in the SITE area, Shahrah-i-Noor Jahan in district Central, main road of Orangi Town, road in Federal B. Area leading to Gulberg, the roads around Civil Hospital and Jinnah Hospital and other roads were also part of these development works.
Ban on plastic bags
In response to a question, he said that the ban on plastic bags, commonly called shoppers, was essential for the city as plastic bags blocked drains and created other problems. He said that citizens should use baskets or paper bags.
The administrator also warned of strict action against those who make and use plastic bags. 
He said that the flyover in Gulistan-i-Johar would be constructed at a cost of Rs2bn, while a six-lane bridge would be constructed to solve the long-standing problem of the people of Korangi. “This project will cost Rs5.5bn,” he added.
Barrister Wahab said that the Rs72bn Red Line project was under construction in Karachi, while the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation was constructing a road from Machhli Chowk to KANUPP at a cost of Rs800 million. 
“The construction of a two-way road from Qayyumabad to Baloch Colony is also a part of the scheme,” he added.

1,Setback for Karachiites as Sindh govt cuts key routes of Peoples bus,A considerable number of buses have been parked at the depot for the past few weeks.,"KARACHI: The fast crumbling city infrastructure, poor road conditions and damaged thoroughfares following a few spells of monsoon rains have started taking toll on the recently launched Peoples Bus Service as in less than two months of its launch, the Sindh government has compelled to suspend its one route, cut short another and faces a serious challenge in completing the journey of its third route after several parts of the road are no longer ‘motorable’. 
The already dilapidated roads in the metropolis got further damaged after the rains which destroyed the sewerage system and left thousands of potholes on main arteries. 
Due to this “a sizable number” of the total of 90 buses plying on Karachi roads under the Peoples Bus Service programme were parked in the depot for the past few weeks, according to sources in the Sindh Mass Transit Authority. 
“The damage came to the very first route of the project launched in June,” said an official. “The Route-1 covers the distance from Model Colony to Tower via Sharea Faisal,” he added. 

A considerable number of buses have been parked at depot for past few weeks

“For the last almost one month, the route has been cut short. The buses, which were used to make their last stop at Model Colony Phatak [railway crossing], now stop at Model Mor — some four to five kilometres before the original route. It is because the recent rains have almost ruined the Liaquat Ali Khan Road in Model Colony. The road, which was already in a bad condition, has become worse after fresh downpours,” he said.
Similarly, he said, the Route-3 between North Nazimabad to Korangi Industrial Area had been suspended and its buses were parked in the depot after the roads were not ‘motorable’. 
The underpasses on the route, he said, were no longer used by vehicles and the same reason also led to a decision by the management of the Peoples Bus Service to suspend the route “for time being”.
“On another route, which carries passengers between North Karachi to Indus Hospital [Korangi], the drivers face serious challenges at one point in Korangi 3½ where the road condition doesn’t allow the bus to move ahead,” said the official. 
“The situation is very serious and the management is not sure how long it could continue on this route under these circumstances. These are actually low-floor buses and cannot be run on damaged roads.”
It was the last week of June when Foreign Minister and Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had inaugurated the Peoples Bus Service launching its first route. 
The Sindh transport department since then had launched five routes of the service in Karachi and one in Larkana. 
Although better late than never, the service was widely welcomed and seen as a relief to some extent for Karachiites yearning for better transport facilities for nearly three decades. 
However, the poor road infrastructure of the city for which the PPP government often comes under criticism of the opposition has put serious dent to the fresh initiative. 
“The government very much realises the problem and Chief Minister Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah has already directed Transport & Mass Transit Authority to coordinate with the local government department to repair the roads of all the routes of Peoples Bus Service so that it could operate smoothly and properly,” said a transport department official. 
“The PPP government has already allocated Rs5 billion for repair and maintenance of roads and sewerage system of the metropolis in addition to a grant of Rs1.5bn to repair damaged roads on the routes of the Peoples Bus Service.”

2,Six friends to face manslaughter charge in DHA high-rise  death case,"Adil Masood Khan, 26, died after falling from the multi-storey residential building on July 31.","KARACHI: Police filed a charge sheet against six young men for allegedly committing manslaughter of their young friend, who died after falling from a high-rise building in Defence Housing Authority Phase-VIII last month.
Syed Muhammad Ammar, Usman Ahmed, Owais, Uzair Ahmed, Ahmed Jamil, and Syed Faaz have been booked and arrested over the death of 26-year-old Adil Masood Khan, who died after falling from the multi-storey residential building on July 31.
On Saturday, the investigating officer of the case filed an interim charge sheet before Judicial Magistrate (South) Mazhar Ali under Section 322 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The charge sheet was silent about premeditated murder, Section 302 of the PPC, as the said section was incorporated in the FIR later.
The IO stated in the charge sheet that during the course of the investigation he found no evidence to suggest that the deceased was “pushed off” the balcony of the high-rise building or there was any “resentment” between him and the suspects.
The charge sheet stated that blood samples of the suspects had been sent to the University of Karachi’s International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS) for chemical examination and a report was still awaited.
The IO showed owner of the flat, where the incident took place, as absconder.
The magistrate took the interim charge-sheet on record and directed the IO to complete the investigation and submit the final charge sheet by Aug 25.
A case under Sections 322 and 34 (common intention) of the PPC was registered against victim’s six friends at the Darakhshan police station on the complaint of his sister, Varda Masood.
She alleged that the six detained friends of her brother left him unattended in an injured condition and the building’s management had shifted him to the hospital, but he could not survive.

3,Covid positivity ratio in Karachi  stays below 1.5pc,Thirty-seven deaths reported this month from Sindh.,"KARACHI: While Covid-19 positivity ratio continued to stay below two per cent in the metropolis, at least 24 patients of Covid-19 have succumbed to the infection over the past 12 days in Sindh, raising the death toll of the sixth coronavirus wave to 111, it emerged on Saturday.
Thirty-seven patients have so far died this month.
Sources said the majority of these deaths occurred at private hospitals in Karachi, which had seen a significant reduction in the number of coronavirus cases over the past two months.
The case positivity ratio in the city has dropped from 20-25 per cent in July to 1.48pc in the third week of August.
The sources said most of the victims were elderly patients with other health complications and they had been under treatment at hospitals for weeks.

37 deaths reported this month from Sindh

Nine of these deaths, according to the health department data, occurred on Aug 10 while six patients died on Aug 14. Three mortalities were reported on Aug 12.
Forty-nine patients are still in critical condition while 3,775 patients are under care and treatment. Ninety-eight per cent of these patients are under home isolation.
“We have had only two deaths in 12 days. Now, there are only 11 to 12 admitted patients at our hospital,” said Dr Abdul Wahid Rajput, the medical superintendent of the Sindh Infectious Disease Hospital and Research Centre.
The number of Covid patients had reduced drastically over the past three weeks and now there were no admission on a daily basis, he added.
The 150-bedded hospital with three intensive care units is the only state-of-the-art government facility dedicated to treatment for patients of infectious diseases including Covid.
Karachi was the most affected part of the province at the start of the sixth Covid wave in June with 340 positive cases in a week, raising the positivity rate to 10.69pc. The month saw 10 deaths while there were 64 deaths in July.
Experts held a new sub-variant of Omicron (BA.5), which had already been reported in other countries and Pakistan, responsible for the fast spread of the disease.
A vast majority of Covid patients, they said, did not report at health facilities at all and safely recovered at home.
They attributed the small number of patient hospitalisation to mass vaccination against the infection in the country.

5,Strict security as no polling station in NA-245 deemed ‘normal’,"Rangers deployed at ""highly sensitive"" polling stations; private guards not allowed.","KARACHI: As many as 2,630 policemen are deployed for NA-245 by-poll today to control any untoward incident and provide security to over 500,000 voters in coordination with Pakistan Rangers while Army will be on standby to meet any eventuality, said city police chief Javed Odho.  
The seat of National Assembly has fallen vacant after the death of PTI leader and TV personality Aamir Liaquat Husain in June. The polls were postponed in July due to heavy rains.  
There are total 17 contenders in the elections, including the main political parties like the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan, Pak Sarzameen Party, and senior politician Dr Farooq Sattar, who is contesting the elections as an independent candidate.  
Speaking at a press conference here, Additional Inspector General-Karachi Odho said that there were no ‘normal’ polling station, but they would focus on those polling stations, which were declared the ‘most sensitive’ in recent past.  

Rangers deployed at ‘highly sensitive’ polling stations; private guards not allowed

He said under guidance of the ECP, security framework had been enhanced to avoid any untoward incident.  
There were estimated to be over 500,000 voters with 263 polling stations and 1,048 polling booths.  
As part of the security plan, 10 policemen would perform their duty at each polling station under the guidance of ECP officials.  
Odho said that a two-tier security plan had been prepared comprising quick response force (QRFs) and reserve force.  
He said there were around 110 buildings where polling would take place and two police mobiles carrying 12-14 personnel would patrol as quick response force as 220 police mobiles would respond to any emergency.  
Thus a total of 1,540 policemen would be deployed for emergency response only. In addition to it, there would be a reserve force.  
The polling areas comprised the two divisions of police namely Jamshed Town and Gulshan town where security responsibility has been assigned to SPs (superintendent of police), DSPs and SHOs.  
The police chief said 50 policemen led by SP, 20-25 policemen led by DSP and 16 policemen led by SHO would perform security duty. They would respond to any emergency situation within ‘10 minutes’.  
He said they had started flag march along with Rangers to provide sense of security to voters so that they could cast their vote freely.  
The Additional IG revealed that the paramilitary force would be deployed at 110 polling stations out of total 263 polling stations.  
Mr Odho said monitoring had also been enhanced and control rooms had been established at DIG, SSP and KPO offices, which would be linked with the command and control room of the IG office to monitor the security situation.  
Replying to a question, the police chief said this time they had not categorised the sensitive nature of polling stations because they did not consider any polling station as normal.  
“We have sufficient force because it is only one seat by-polling.”  
However, the police would focus on 210 polling stations which were declared ‘most sensitive’ in the past.  
He recalled that during the by-polling on NA-240 in Korangi, some political leaders and workers had become ‘charged and emotional’ triggering scuffles and clashes and this time the police had made a plan to prevent such a situation.  
He said unfortunately, the atmosphere remained ‘charged’ during polling, but they have imposed Section 144 of CrPC, banning display on arms and unlawful gathering of people.  
No private guards
The city police chief said that political leaders would not be allowed to bring private guards for security and if any leader had security issues, the government would provide them security after proper evaluation.  
He recalled that during the recent by-polling in Korangi, the clash had taken place around one kilometre away from the polling station at an office of a political party. This time, they have decided that the action would be taken if the people gathered at any place ‘illegally’.  
He said since, the rains had occurred four-five times more as compared to the past, dewatering teams were ready which had removed accumulated rainwater from the areas.  
He said the district administration has installed CCTVs on sensitive polling stations.

Usually it...,"KARACHI: In recent times the phrase ‘behind the scenes’ has assumed great political significance. Usually it implies something happening in a secret way with conspiratorial connotations. The fact is that it can be applied to any walk of life for any kind of discussion. For example, toady the acronym BTS is widely used in showbiz. 
A group show titled Behind the Scenes (BTS), which was concluded on Thursday at the Full Circle Gallery, touches upon the same subject, which is mainly to do with the art community because its sub-heading is — a sketchbook project.
Isn’t it intriguing since to use a sketchbook alongside the main artwork is the most basic of art practices? This implies that the display aims to unearth the creative process, which is uniquely individualistic for every person, or how creativity helps an artist complete an idea for conveyance. 
The curators of the show — Ayesha Waseem, Muhammad Khubaib and Kashaf Rathore — state: “We have all wondered how a writer comes up with such creative ideas, how a philosopher conjures up answers to meaningful questions and how an artist creates their masterpiece. This show is a form of self expression in a safe space with a variety of ideologies. People with different personalities and backgrounds come together to show you what happens behind the curtains.”
The interesting thing is that when an exhibit is put on display, it loses all its curious elements that may have gone into its making. Now it’s for the viewer to decide whether the painting succeeds in putting across the feeling or message that the artist in his/her behind the scenes location tried to create. 
If truth be told, in the case of the ongoing show, the artists do succeed in a noteworthy way. While their sketchbooks reveal how they use their craft, their paintings give away how they bare their souls to give a physical shape to their creations. 
The participating artists in the exhibition were: Ayesha Waseem, Kashaf Rathore, Muhammad Khubaib, Marium Mansoor, Ahsan Ahmed, Yusra Taqi, S M Raza, Nayab Noor, Umaimah Khan, Halah Khan, Ali Saad, Buland Iqbal and Shazma Arshad.

7,Three suspected bandits held over house robberies in DHA,KARACHI: Police on Saturday claimed to have busted a gang allegedly involved in house robberies in Defence Housing...,"KARACHI: Police on Saturday claimed to have busted a gang allegedly involved in house robberies in Defence Housing Authority (DHA) by arresting three suspects, including one woman.
South SSP (Investigation) Dr Mohammed Imran Khan said the gang used to enter the bungalows over pretext of jobs, administer tranquilisers to the inmates and loot cash and other valuables.
The police recovered stolen gold ornaments, precious clothes and other valuables from their custody. The held suspects were identified as Misbah (who works in bungalows as domestic servant), Mohammed Mumtaz and Mohammed Muqeeb.
During initial probe, it was transpired that members of the gang were ‘professional and habitual criminals who have been involved in several such looting incidents during last one year’.
Separately, Boat Basin police conducted search operation in Shirin Jinnah Colony and Gulshan Sikanderabad of Keamari and arrested two suspects - Zakir and Abid Jan - who snatched cell phones, cash and ladies and gents suits from a tailoring shop in Khada Market of the DHA on Friday.
The police recovered four snatched mobile phones, ladies’ suits and one motorbike from their custody.
Meanwhile,  the City police on Saturday claimed to have arrested three suspected women drug suppliers from Chakiwara and recovered huge quantity of narcotics from their custody.
City SSP Shabbir Ahmed Sethar said the held suspects identified as Yunus, Sumera, Zahira and Nazia alias Gul Jan were members of the ‘inter-provincial narcotic dealers’.
The police recovered 15kg opium and over one kg crystal from their custody, added the senior officer.
The narcotics was brought from Turbat, Balochistan, and sold in Lyari and other parts of the metropolis.  
‘Street crimes declined’
The Karachi police chief claimed on Saturday that the incidents of street crimes were decreasing.
Sharing data of the crimes, Additional Inspector General of Police Javed Odho said total 537 incidents of robberies took place in month of June, while 453 robberies took place in July, thus there was 16 per cent decrease in the robberies. He added 13 people were shot dead by robbers over resistance in June, while seven people were killed by robbers in July.
He pointed out that total 2,600 mobile phones were snatched in June, but, in July, 2,154 cell phones were snatched, which shows there was also some ‘improvement’ in this category of the crime, despite the fact that the police were busy in providing security for Ashura and dealing with rain havoc. He said there might be some high profile individual cases, and vowed that the same would be resolved as the robbery incident at Teen Talwar in Clifton was also solved.
Mr Odho said if any SHO had committed any wrong, legal action would be taken against him after an inquiry, irrespective of his influence, and transparency would be maintained in such cases.

In those hard times, Watan Cards were provided to people on a directive of Asif Ali Zardari, currently the co-chairman of PPP. Mr Shah said that assessment of losses to people was under way and soon the affected families would get suitable compensation against their loss of crops, livestock and loved-ones. He said financial assistance of Rs25,000 would be provided to each affected family through the Benazir Income Supported Programme (BISP).
