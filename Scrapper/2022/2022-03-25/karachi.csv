0,Annual report calls for education emergency,"KARACHI: With the demand to improve learning outcomes in Sindh, the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) ...","KARACHI: With the demand to improve learning outcomes in Sindh, the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) Pakistan for 2021-2022 was launched here on Thursday. 
The ASER Pakistan is a flagship programme of Idara-i-Taleem-o-Aagahi (ITA). The report was released jointly by School Education and Literacy Department (SELD) provincial secretary Ghulam Akbar Laghari, chief programme manager of its Reform Support Unit Beenish Fatima Sahi, DG monitoring and evaluation Junaid Samo, Aga Khan University Examination Board director and Associate Professor Dr Shehzad Jeeva and former Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) chairman Mohammad Memon. 
The report says that in Sindh, ASER’s rural team collected data from 14,723 households in 25 districts and 720 villages. There were 41,536 children (58pc male 42pc female) aged 3-16 years and 35,506 children (5-16 years) assessed in grade two level language and arithmetic skills. At least 660 government schools and 114 private schools were surveyed. 
Looking at enrollment, in 2021 24pc children were reported to be out-of-school, which is an increase of 5pc. When compared with 2019 (19pc), there was an increase in out-of-school children (OOSC) across Pakistan during Covid-19. In Sindh, of the OOSC, 11pc never enrolled in a school and 13pc dropped out of school (more DOs). This calls for the urgency to address OOSC through second chance accelerated and bridge programmes through both non-formal education and mainstreamed SELD schools in afternoon/morning shifts on a fast track. 
If you look at enrollment by school type, then 76 pc of all school-aged children (6-16 years) were enrolled; 94pc (88pc in 2019) were enrolled in government schools, 6pc (12pc in 2019) were in non-state institutions (6pc private schools, zero pc madrassah, zero pc others). Private schools dropped by 6pc. This can be improved by supporting low cost public/private schools in rural areas through Sindh Education Foundation for OOSC. 
For Early Childhood Education (ECE), which includes children aged 3-5 years, the proportion of enrolled children has decreased in 2021 (34pc) as compared to 2019 (46pc). Around 66pc children of 3-5 age group are currently not enrolled in any ECE programme. Hence, a campaign for ECE in Sindh for foundational learning and holistic ECE (health/nutrition) is urgently needed. 
Looking at teachers’ qualifications, 14pc teachers of surveyed government schools have done graduation as compared to 40pc teachers of surveyed private schools. However, 11pc have completed MEd in government schools compared to 2pc in private schools. However, a shortage of teachers continues and there is a need to improve teacher adequacy, performance in government schools through peer and best practices support.The issue of urban slums in Sindh is massive with 52pc of the population in urban areas and there is high rural/urban migration not just from within Sindh but from across Pakistan. This remains a neglected area with no education planning for urban slums, no claimants and no one to take its responsibility. Only Karachi has more than 60pc population in urban slums. 
It was said at the launch that quality and inclusive education for all children should be seen as an emergency and should be accorded the highest priority. The ASER Sindh launch called for urgent implementation of the Right to Education Sindh Compulsory Education Act 2013 and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, an anchor SDG to meet all 17 SDG targets and goals.

1,Enthusiasm reigns supreme as JUI-F caravan sets off to Islamabad,"Sindh PTI set to follow suit, leaves today to join power show in capital.","KARACHI: A first glimpse of the mounting tension between the ruling party and its opponent parties amid approaching dates of their respective power shows in Islamabad ahead of a vote on no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan was witnessed here on Thursday when a caravan Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) left for Islamabad with hundreds of its workers and separately Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) gave final touches to its journey for the capital. 
A large number of JUI-F workers assembled near Sohrab Goth early in the day and it took more than three hours when the wheels of the caravan finally hit the road.
Led by JUI-F Sindh chief Rashid Mahmood Soomro and other senior leaders of the party, the opposition workers left the Karachi boundary by 1pm. The convoy is to spend Thursday night in Sukkur after passing through different cities. 
“The workers are excited to be a part of this huge national movement which would lead to end of an unjust and illegal rule. The days of PTI government are numbered,” said the party spokesman, Muhammad Sami ul Haq Swati.  
On the other hand, PTI also flexed its muscles and announced early morning departure of its “thousands of workers and supporter” for Islamabad where they would join the party’s March 27 rally.  

Sindh PTI set to follow suit, leaves today to join power show in capital

The prime minister’s televised call to the nation to participate in the PTI power show in Islamabad’s Parade Ground further fuelled the party activists’ enthusiasm. 
A large number of party workers led by Leader of the Opposition in Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh paid a visit to the mausoleum of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah prior to the beginning of their journey to Islamabad rally titled ‘Amr bil Maroof Jalsa’. 
“The PTI caravan from Karachi will depart to Islamabad on Friday [today] to become part of Amr bil Maroof Jalsa,” said Mr Sheikh.  
“We are here today at Mazar-i-Quaid to reiterate our commitment with the cause of PTI leader and Prime Minister Imran Khan who is striving to save Quaid-i-Azam’s Pakistan from corruption and plunder by thieves, and making our homeland as had the Quaid-i-Azam dreamt of.” 
Accompanied by MPAs Raja Azhar, Saeed Afridi, Shahnawaz Jadoon, Adnan Ismail and others, he said that hundreds of vehicles hired by the party and those owned by the workers and supporters would enter Islamabad well before the March 27 rally predicting it to be “the largest political activity in the country’s history”. 
“The caravan of Sindh will leave Karachi from Sohrab Goth on Friday morning while departure of other caravans will continue till the next day. People from all over Sindh will attend the rally,” he added. 
Addressing party activists at Hatri bypass, JUI-F general secretary Rashid Mehmood Soomro said that one person had misguided people in the name of ‘state of Madina, our Hyderabad correspondent adds.  
Mr Soomro said that false promises of providing jobs and houses were made but today people could not eke out a living. He sarcastically said: “Listen Khan sahab! we are coming to offer funeral prayers of your rule.”  
He said that PM’s lies would not work any longer now as people had awaken.  
He wondered why Imran Khan was delaying no-confidence motion when he himself had said that he would quit if members found him incompetent.  
He added that PM had lost confidence of parliament and 220 million people of the country.  
The JUI-F leader asked Imran Khan to desist from disturbing Maulana’s [Fazl’s] followers by resorting to name calling and warned they would not let him hide otherwise.
He said people were united under the leadership of Maulana Fazlur Rehman. He said people were bringing chicks and eggs for PM so that he could use them in jail.

3,‘Misuse of live virus vaccines aggravated lumpy skin disease outbreak in Karachi’: official,"DUHS, livestock dept plan to jointly develop new vaccine.","KARACHI: Only five districts out of 29 in Sindh have not yet reported a single case of lumpy skin disease (LSD) that has so far killed 250 cows. Its outbreak in Karachi got aggravated due to misuse of live virus vaccines.
This was stated by provincial livestock director general during a question-answer session at a seminar organised by the Association of Molecular and Microbial Sciences at Dow International Medical College, Ojha campus, on Thursday.
Explaining how LSD spread in cattle in the city, livestock DG Dr Nazeer Kalhoro said dairy farmers, out of despair, made an indiscriminate use of live virus vaccines apparently without consulting a qualified veterinarian. These LSD vaccines were reportedly smuggled in from South Africa.
Live virus vaccines carry risks and should be used with caution. “Most dairy farmers in Karachi had a few infected animals with signs of the disease which led them to believe that the rest of their herd was safe and could be vaccinated. However, this was not the case,” he noted.
Their other animals, Dr Kalhoro pointed out, were also infected but were not showing signs either due to their good immune system or because the virus was yet to complete its incubation period. These animals also developed full-blown disease when the live virus in the vaccine got combined with the pathogen already present in their bodies.

DUHS, livestock dept plan to jointly develop new vaccine

He claimed that the disease outbreak situation improved particularly in Cattle Colony when farmers heeded to government’s advice and stopped using live virus vaccines.
Currently, the livestock staff was administering goat pox vaccine (to affected animals), which provided 40 to 50 per cent protection against LSD.
Vaccine import
Asked about the LSD vaccine the government has planned to import, he said a total of four million vaccine doses would be imported from Turkey and would be administered free of cost to only healthy animals in Sindh.
“We have made plans to vaccinate two million animals in the first phase and start production of local LSD vaccine within eight to nine months. So far, 28,857 cows have been infected in Sindh whereas 13,000 animals have recovered,” he said, adding that the cured animals had developed life-long immunity against the disease.
Dr Kalhoro regretted the propaganda on LSD in the social media, clarifying that the disease had been there for a century but no case of LSD transmission from animal to human in science literature had been reported.
“This disease only affects cows and the infected animals experience a sudden and significant drop in milk production. Hence, there is no question of milk getting contaminated while there is no evidence that the disease affects [quality of] milk or meat.”
Earlier, Dow University of Health Sciences pro vice chancellor Prof Nusrat Shah told the audience that the university and the provincial livestock department would jointly develop an LSD vaccine very soon.
She also urged the youth to join veterinary sciences as the country was faced with a shortage of vets.
Prof Mushtaq Hussain also spoke at the seminar.

5,Provinces bound to comply with federal law: SHC,The court releases detailed judgment on the Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Test marks issue.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has observed that it is mandatory for the provinces to exercise their executive authority in a manner that is fully compliant with the federal law and not in a way that impedes or prejudices against the federal legislation and the executive authority being exercised by the federation.  
A three-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro through the March 18 short order had declared a set of notifications issued by the Sindh government following a decision of provincial cabinet to lower the passing marks of the Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Test (MDCAT) as void and without lawful authority.  
The bench issued the detailed order on Thursday.  
The detailed judgement said that irrespective of how the Sindh government had approached the matter and taken decision, the constitutional scheme envisaging obligations of the provinces in certain cases was quite clear under Articles 148 and 149 of the Constitution. 
These provisions enjoin the provinces to exercise executive authority in a manner as to secure compliance with federal laws which apply in the province, it added.  

Detailed judgement on MDCAT marks issue released

While referring to a judgement of the Supreme Court reported in 1998, the SHC noted that the federation had to regulate a situation that had arisen in which it was to be considered as to how the federal law must be made applicable in the province so that desired results were achieved and the law was made effective in true sense.  
“Hence, no room is left, in the light of these provisions, and for foregoing discussion, for the provinces to chart their own course on the subject, sans legislative and executive authority, in defiance of a federal law standing the field whilst, and act contrary to it”, it added.  
The order further said, quite strangely the Sindh government has only objected to fixing of benchmark (65%) to attain in the test to become eligible to admission and has otherwise expressly no issue to the whole mechanism employed for conducting the test, selecting procedure and syllabus for framing the questions, etc.  
“This we find rather paradoxical and unsustainable, as on the one hand it has questioned legitimacy of the law as a whole on the ground of having residuary jurisdiction over the matter, and on the other hand has invoked the same law for selecting students for admission by reducing pass marks to 50%”, it observed.  
About the contention of advocate general Sindh to question vires of the Pakistan Medical Commission Act, 2020, the larger bench further noted that the SHC had already declared Sections 4 and 18 and admission regulations framed under Section 8 (2) (f) of the PMC, Act as intra vires despite noting in detail including the concerns raised by AG Sindh here, non-compliances of certain provisions thereof relating to formation of the bodies to supervise implementation of the said law, and despite showing qualms over syllabus selected for formation of questions in MDCAT.  
“However, the matter is currently under scrutiny in appeal before the Supreme Court, we do not find any reason to proceed to either agree or disagree with or add anything into it for deciding the issue,” it added.  
“Last but not the least, we may observe that the impugned notifications, based as they are on the Sindh Cabinet’s decision, from a bare reading do not seem to be a result of any apparent legal authority or a law in the field, pari materia, etc. promulgated by the province of Sindh on the subject, post 18 amendment, empowering the Sindh Cabinet to make the impugned decision to even bear scrutiny of applicability of doctrine of occupied field in this case. We therefore, quash all four impugned notifications dated 07.12.2021 and 31.12.2021 and declare them to be void ab initio having been issued without a lawful authority and of no legal effect”, it concluded.  
The PMC had petitioned the SHC against a decision of the Sindh cabinet taken in its meeting held in December 2021 to lower the passing marks for MDCAT-2021 from 65 per cent to 50 per cent for Sindh and consequent notifications.

He also reiterated his demand of a new province to be carved out of Sindh for the people of urban areas. 
Addressing a public meeting held in Landhi on Wednesday night, he vowed to launch the struggle for the rights of Urdu-speaking community. 
A number of MQM-H workers and supporters, including women and children, attended the event. 
He said that these so-called elected representatives and coalition partner of the federal government should tell the nation as to how many jobs they got for Muhajir youths in federal departments during their over three-year stint in power. 

Reiterates demand for new province

Mr Ahmed levelled the allegation of corruption on rival leaders and said that if they did not get money they should answer as to why they did not get government jobs for Muhajir youths. 
He said that MQM-P leaders had betrayed Altaf Hussain for their own sake and not because of any ideological reasons as they had defended him earlier when he made a poisonous statement during a visit to India. “If they betrayed their father [Hussain] how they can remain loyal with the Muhajir nation,” he asked.

He said that dozens of wedding halls on Korangi Road had been demolished on the directives of the Supreme Court. He said he had utmost respect for judiciary but there was an impression that only Muhajirs were being punished in the name of implementation of SC orders.
Addressing the Urdu-speaking community, he asked them to set up muhalla committees and spend their zakat and donations on their own people instead of giving to some non-governmental organisations that would spend the money on ‘non-locals’.
He expressed concerns over the worsening law and order and rise in street crime in the metropolis and said that ‘non-local’ police were protecting ‘non-resident’ criminals. 
Mr Ahmed also demanded the federal government to issue passports to stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh and his party would bear their expenses.

11,Nine devotees die of heart attack during three days of Qalandar urs in Sehwan,Three days of 770th Qalandar urs celebrations conclude in Sehwan.,"DADU: With four more deaths of devotees on the final day of the 770th urs celebrations of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sehwan on Thursday, total death toll during the three days of urs reached nine, according to Edhi and hospital sources. 
The devotees, who hailed from different parts of the country, mostly died of heart stroke. 
Sehwan Edhi Centre in-charge Sarwar Shaikh said that Edhi ambulances had transported nine bodies over the three days. The centre picked bodies of four devotees from the Institute of Syed Abdullah Shah Medical and Health Sciences on Thursday.  
The bodies were identified as those of Arbab, 50, resident of Dadu; Ashraf, 45, resident of Lahore; Mehboob, 60, of Lahore; Shabnam, 60, a resident of Rahimyar Khan, he said. 
He said that three devotees had died on Wednesday, the second day of urs, and the centre had picked the bodies from the institute. They were identified as Akram, 55, resident of Arif Wala; Mohammad Asgar, 40, of Bahawalpur and Zamir, 60, a resident of Faisalabad, he said. 

Three days of 770th Qalandar urs celebrations conclude in Sehwan

He said the centre’s ambulances picked two bodies from the institute on Tuesday, the first day of urs. They were identified as Karam Bibi, 55, resident of Sadiqabad, and Imtiaz, 50, a resident of Orangi town Karachi, he said. 
He said that the bodies were sent to their native areas. 
Dr Moeenuddin Siddiqui, director of the institute, confirmed the death of four devotees at the hospital and said they had died of heart attack. None of them had died from heatstroke, he said. 
Three days of urs celebrations conclude 
Sindh Minister for Mines and Minerals Shabbir Bijarani and adviser to  Sindh chief minister on religious affairs, auqaf, ushr and zakat, Fyaz  Ahmed Butt, laid chador on the grave of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar to  officially conclude the three days of the 770th urs celebrations of the saint in Sehwan on Thursday. 
The minister and the adviser told journalists outside the shrine  after paying their respects to the saint that Pakistan Peoples Party’s  talks with Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan over the vote of no  confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan had entered final phase. 
Mr Bajarani believed allies of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf would  support the opposition parties’ move. All opposition parties were united  on one platform and the no trust vote was bound to be successful, he  said. 
He said that if Prime Minister Imran Khan was that much confident  about failure of the vote then why he was trying to escape from it. It  meant clearly that Imran Khan knew he had lost majority in National  Assembly, he said.  
He said that Imran Khan had pursued only on one-point agenda  hence even his major allies and PTI’s own members were not happy with  him. The prime minister had not done anything to develop the country nor  launched any development projects, he had only made false promises of  creation of jobs and provision of houses, he said.  
He said that PTI government would soon come to an end as a result  the struggle being waged by PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.  
He said that president and governor could not take any step  against the constitution and impose governor’s rule in Sindh, which  could be imposed only on the basis of solid reasons, which were absent,  he said.

12,Moot calls for quality research on life of Qalandar,HYDERABAD: Speakers at a literary conference held in Sehwan have called for research on the life of Qalandar Lal...,"HYDERABAD: Speakers at a literary conference held in Sehwan have called for research on the life of Qalandar Lal Shahbaz and the historic importance of Sehwan. 
There was still much room for quality research work on Qalandar and Sehwan, they regretted while addressing the event held under the aegis of the Sindh culture department the other night. They proposed use of modern methods and means to conduct research for the purpose, which, they said, would yield positive results. 
Presiding over the conference, Dr Anwar Figar Hakro appreciated the papers presented by different scholars on the occasion. He called for more research on the history of Sehwan Sharif.  
He said that quality work left Sehwan with the result that the desired results could not be achieved. He said that Sehwan had an important history. 
He said researchers had proved that the geography of those areas was very old and spiritual orders there were also quite older ones. The culture department should assist the researchers, he added.  
Pointing out that mysticism’s history traced back to Sindh, he said teaching of spiritualism started from Sindh. He said Rigveda might be a sacred scripture and revealed to some angle, but nothing could be said with certainty about it due to missing links of history.  
He said that it was indeed a pride that mysticism started from Karachi. Research was indeed needed on spiritual personalities of the pre-and-post Islamic eras, he added. 
Taj Joyo said Lakki Shah Saddar, Jalaluddin Rumi and others were contemporaries of Qalandar, which was indeed a blessing.  
Disagreeing with the view that Qalandar stayed briefly in Sindh, he said his stay could be verified from the number of his devotees in the province. He said a comprehensive research was needed on Qalandar Lal Shahbaz. 
A teacher of Karachi University, Prof Sher Mehranvi, discussed Qalandar’s era in his paper, saying that economic, political and social conditions were not good at that time.  
He said that according to one research, Qalandar had arrived in Sindh when he was nonagenarian. 
He reached there after performing pilgrimage to sacred places and travelling through different countries, he said, adding that he was known as “Sindhri ka Shahbaz”. 
Akhtar Dargahi said Lal Shahbaz was a revolutionary mystic and he was lost in spiritual trance and the colours of nature. 
Dr Ramzan Bamri said the poetry of Lal Shahbaz was of spiritualism, reflecting the divine love. His message was of knowledge. He urged people to follow his message to promote peace. He said Qalandar’s dhamal was evident of the “state of spirituality”. 
Dr Sakina Samoon said Sehwan had served as seat of power under different dynasties and arrival of Qalandar there was a blessing. She said that his shrine was a source of light in Sehwan. 
Khair Mohammad Buriro said Qalandar’s message clearly evinced the point of oneness. He promoted the message of God. He said he (Qalandar) was a learned man and followed divine teachings to achieve His love. 
Calling for research on different aspects of the life of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, Dr Makhmoor Bukhari said the knowledge should be compiled for better understanding of people about the role he played.  
He said history had a proof that Qalandar belonged to Marwand, an area in Azerbaijan. That point should form basis for research on him, he said. 
Nazar Hayat Sehwani, Agha Zafar and others said Qalandar was a poet, but research on him was still needed direly. 
They said that whenever tyranny ruled the roost, God sent people to eliminate the evil for the welfare of the mankind. He said that Qalandar was one such personality. 
Artists including Fateh Ali Khan, Ameer Ali Khan, Javed Abbasi, Shahina Ali, Tufail Sanjrani, Taj Mastani and others performed on the occasion.

Talking to media persons here, Mr Shah said that family of the slain Kumari had complained to police beforehand against possible assault on the girl but police did not bother to take their complaint seriously.
“If police had taken preemptive measures, Pooja Kumrani might have not have suffered death at the hands of her tormentor because her parents had already indicated to police about the alleged killers,” he said. 
“SSP Sukkur should constitute a team and investigate the matter seriously,” he said.
He said that Sindh police had become an estate police and it was least interested in serving people.
Mr Shah said that his party would field candidates in upcoming local bodies election in Sindh. “Though we are going to contest in LB election, yet we have reservations about transparency of the election,” he said.
He said that Pakistan Peoples Party had ruined all departments in Sindh, including health, education and agriculture.
“All departments have turned into dens of corruption,” said Mr Shah and added that the money earned through corruption from government departments was spent on horse-trading prior to no-confidence motion.
