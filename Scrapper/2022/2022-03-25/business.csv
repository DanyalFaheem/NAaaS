0,SBP reserves fall below $15bn on debt repayments,"Financial experts do not see the fall in foreign exchange reserves as ""very significant"".","KARACHI: A massive outflow of $869 million week-on-week mainly for debt repayments dragged the foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) below the $15 billion mark for the first time in almost a year.
The continuous decline in foreign exchange reserves is adding to the woes of the government which is already facing a record current account deficit of its tenure amid a steep devaluation of the rupee against the dollar.
The central bank on Thursday reported that its foreign exchange reserves in the week ending on March 18 plunged to $14.962bn, which is the lowest level since April 2021 when forex holdings of the central bank stood at $15.598bn. The SBP reserves in March 2021 were $13.493bn. 



 
Financial market experts, however, did not see the big fall in the foreign exchange reserves as ‘very significant’ saying it was not new and it happened in the past too.
“The falling SBP foreign exchange reserve is an indicator for low reserves but it does not reflect the situation is going out of control,” said Tahir Abbas, head of research at Arif Habib Securities.
The SBP forex holdings recorded a fall of $1.424bn in 18 days of this month while it has lost about $5.11bn since August 2021. During this period the State Bank received $2bn from the IMF and Sukuk proceeds. If the $2bn inflows are also counted, the total loss of SBP’s reserves reached $7bn since August.
The government is planning to launch another sukuk issue of $1bn during the current fiscal FY22 to support its falling foreign exchange reserves.
The situation looks grave, particularly in the wake of 47pc increase in imports and a $12bn current account deficit during the first 8 months of FY22.
“The 47pc increase in import bill resulted in a trade deficit of $12bn but the country has already paid this amount. It is the net reserves the State Bank currently possesses,” said Mr Abbas.
He said the government has also been making debt repayments as it has paid about $6bn during the first two quarters of this fiscal year while it had paid $13.4bn in debt servicing during the entire FY21.
He said the country paid $2bn to $2.5bn for the import of vaccines to counter the Covid-19 during the current fiscal year, which increased the import bill. Amid higher commodity prices mainly oil made imports very costlier ride.
Currency dealers in the interbank and open market were not sure whether the falling SBP reserves could cost heavily to the exchange rate.
“The dollar is appreciating due to many reasons including higher oil prices and higher demand from importers,” said Zafar Paracha, general secretary Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan. He said the dollar may rise further against the rupee in the coming days but not entirely due to falling SBP reserves.
The State Bank has been assuring the market that proper funding is available to meet the current account deficit and external debt servicing. It also believes to receive about $30bn remittances in FY22.

1,Highest housing loans disbursed in February,"Total disbursements reached Rs53.074bn at the end of February 2022, data shows.","KARACHI: The disbursement of loans for low-cost housing witnessed the highest increase of Rs9.3 billion in February FY22, highlighting no uncertainty despite the ongoing political crisis in Islamabad, data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) showed on Thursday. 
Total disbursements under the Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar (MPMG) reached at Rs53.074bn at the end of February 2022, the SBP data showed. 
The government launched the MPMG scheme in October 2020 and announced a number of incentives along with subsidised mark-up rates. The scheme aims to boost the housing sector in Pakistan so that economic activities could be accelerated in the country. 
However, banks were reluctant to disburse loans for this scheme and initially the response was poor. The government made it mandatory for banks to spend five per cent of their total private sector credit.
The data shows that the financing for MPMG accelerated during Dec-Feb FY22. The total disbursement till end of Nov 2021 was Rs28.744bn, while it reached Rs53.074bn at the end of Feb 2022.
During the three months under review, the disbursement under the scheme increased by 46pc to reach Rs24.33bn. Further details showed that the disbursement during the first eight months of the current fiscal year were Rs47.852bn.
Despite the increase in the disbursements, the scheme has yet not reached up to the expectations of the government and the SBP. The central bank has been trying to make the scheme successful and has involved large number of banks to participate in the scheme.
As per the scheme, the borrowers will be charged financing rate of 3pc for first 5 years, 5pc for next five years and Kibor (Karachi Inter-Bank Offered Rate) plus 350 basis points for the remaining financing tenure. 
Available in both conventional and Islamic mode, the scheme enables banks to provide financing for the construction and purchase of houses at very low financing rates for low to middle income segments of the population.
SBP is the executing partner with the Government of Pakistan and Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority.

2,16 cement factories to generate Rs600bn investment: minister,LAHORE: The completion of 16 under-construction cement factories in the province will generate an overall investment...,"LAHORE: The completion of 16 under-construction cement factories in the province will generate an overall investment of Rs600 billion and thousands of jobs. 
“Such a huge investment in the cement industry has never been made in history. It is the PTI government that created an enabling environment for new businesses,” Punjab Minister for Industry and Commerce Mian Aslam Iqbal claimed while presiding over a meeting held at the Punjab Board of Investment and Trade (PBIT) on Thursday.
Punjab issued dozens of No-Objection Certificates (NOCs) for setting up cement factories keeping in view its increasing demand in the construction industry. The 16 factories included four in Mianwali district, one in Pind Dadan Khan, two each in Taxila and Dera Ghazi Khan and seven in other parts of the province.
“The construction of three of the 16 factories is at an advanced stage, so they are likely to start production by the end of this year,” a source in the cement industry told Dawn. He said the new factories were being constructed along the limestone range from Salt Range to Kalabagh, Taxila-Karak-Kohat and DG Khan. 
“Construction work on the new factories was launched after each establishment acquired two NOCs -- permission for building and limestone leasing rights,” he added. To a question, he said except one, all other factories were being established by the existing cement companies.
The Punjab government had earlier issued 22 NOCs for setting up cement factories while ensuring that no unit was established in the areas declared “negative” by a study, including Kallar Kahar, as the underground water had fast depleted.
According to the study, the Salt Range area had been found as an ideal location as almost all the key raw materials, including limestone, clay and gypsum, were available there.
The minister further said 20 agreements were signed at the Dubai International Expo (World Business Conference) for investment in Punjab. “These agreements will result in an investment of Rs45bn in the province,” Mr Iqbal added. 
He directed the PBIT to expedite the implementation of these agreements and provide all possible facilities to the companies investing in various sectors in the province. Punjab had been made a hub of domestic and foreign investment in the 10 Special Economic Zones being set up here. 
“More than Rs350bn has been invested in Punjab during the last three and a half years,” he claimed.

3,"Govt implements mechanism for fiscal integrity, discipline",Exemption provided to Ministry of Defence.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has notified a fresh mechanism for annual and multi-annual financial commitment controls for all ministries, divisions and their attached departments and subordinate offices, except the Ministry of Defence, to improve the integrity of the budget and fiscal discipline.
“Expenditure arrears from the previous financial years are a major source of fiscal indiscipline and poor budget credibility in the government. These arrears build up because of the absence of an effective system of commitment control due to which government offices incur expenditure without matching allocations to discharge their liabilities,” said the Ministry of Finance while issuing a fresh notification.
Finalised in consultations with the Auditor General of Pakistan as required under Public Financial Management Act 2019 pushed by the international lending agencies, the finance ministry said the notified guidelines were meant “to minimise the build-up of expenditure arrears in the government and help improve fiscal discipline and budget credibility.
These guidelines would be applicable to all ministries, divisions, executive departments, public entities and offices established and controlled by the federal government receiving grant-in-aid or public money from the federal government. There would be an exemption to the Ministry of Defence because of its peculiar arran­gement under which defence allocations are a one-line transaction. It may make similar arrangements for defence services, if required, with the concurrence of the finance division.

Exemption provided to Ministry of Defence

Under the guidelines, annual commitments shall be recorded for both recurrent and development budgets for procurement of goods, services and carrying out civil works. These commitments shall be recorded when there is a properly authorised obligation, a contract or purchase order, to make a future payment against a budget allocation with a value of rupees one million or more.
This would also be applicable to goods and services for which the amount of transaction is known, the supplier has been nominated and a relevant officer has authorised the contract for procurement of goods, services or for civil works or a legal contract or purchase order has been entered with supplier.
The officer sanctioning or authorising a contract for procurement of goods, works, services above the thres­hold of rupees one million shall be personally responsible for communicating the commitment to the respective accounting office within one week of approving the contract using a specimen form. The concerned accounting office shall be responsible for recording the commitment in accordance with the provisions of the Accounting Poli­cies and Procedures Manual (APPM) within one week of receiving the request from the sanctioning officer.
The commitments will be reconciled among all the accounting offices. The Accountant General of Pakistan Revenue (AGPR) will provide to Finance Division, on a monthly basis, a summary statement showing consolidated commitments and monthly cash requirements of all divisions, departments and offices. 
Financial Accounting and Budgeting System (FASS) and RAAST Instant Payment System shall be used by the accounting offices for commitment control in accordance with the instructions issued by the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
Under the guidelines, annual commitments shall be adjusted when the payment is made and all annual commitments shall lapse along with the budgetary allocation at the end of a financial year.

4,Proposals invited from firms for Kamyab Pakistan Programme monitoring,The Ministry of Finance has sought technical and financial proposals within two weeks.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Thursday invited request for proposals from firms for setting up monitoring and evaluation unit of the Kamyab Pakistan Programme (KPP) including the wholesale banks, executing agencies and micro-borrowers.
In a memorandum, the Ministry of Finance has sought technical and financial proposals within two weeks from the relevant organisations and firms for monitoring and evaluation of five key components of the multi-billion rupees worth KPP. These components include loans for formers, business, construction of houses, skill based scholarship and Sehat card.
The monitoring of KPP would be on the basis of quarterly indicators including tracking of disbursements, guarantee limits, subsidies and billing, strength or solvency of the executing agencies, non-performing loans and recoveries, and early warning signs among others. Likewise, the evaluation would be on the basis of indicators like service effectiveness and breadth and depth of the outreach etc.
The financial performance of the programme will be examined on yearly outcomes like non-performance loans as percentage of outstanding portfolio, disbursements versus target, percentage of subsides. Outcomes of social indicators would be evaluated if business was created or expanded for which loan was provided, number of houses expanded, income levels increased, skilled developed or access to health facilities improved. On top of that, it would be also examined if the loan actually benefited the overall economy, or employment generation or revenue contribution.
The unit would generate monthly, quarterly, semi-annually and annual reports. In doing so, the selected organisation would serve as a focal point for monitoring and evaluation of KPP under approved operational framework and provide input to the KPP’s advisory board of steering committee in matters of features, design and execution.
The selected firm would also recommend improvements in the system through analysis, market feedback or stakeholders’ consultation and help remove bottlenecks. The firm would be hired for three years.

5,EU leaders plan energy security boost,BRUSSELS: European Union leaders are set to agree at a two-day summit starting on Thursday to jointly buy gas as ...,"BRUSSELS: European Union leaders are set to agree at a two-day summit starting on Thursday to jointly buy gas as they seek to cut reliance on Russian fuels, with some saying they would not comply with Moscow’s demand to buy oil and gas using roubles.
The invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Europe’s top gas supplier, pushed already-high energy prices to records and has prompted the EU to pledge to slash reliance on Russian fossil fuels by hiking imports from other countries and quickly expanding renewable energy.
Moscow on Wednesday said “unfriendly” countries, including EU member states, must start paying in roubles for Russian oil and gas, a demand some EU leaders said was at odds with supply contracts.
“There are fixed contracts everywhere, with the currency in which the deliveries are to be paid being part of these contracts,” German chancellor Olaf Scholz said.  “In most cases it says euros or dollars, this is the basis we are working on.”   “Nobody will pay in roubles,” Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa said.
In a draft of their summit conclusions seen by Reuters, the leaders will agree to  “work together on the 
joint purchase of gas, LNG and hydrogen” ahead of next winter, and coordinate measures to fill gas storage — moves aimed at building up a supply buffer of non-Russian gas.
