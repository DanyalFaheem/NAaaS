2,Streamlining of steps against climate change stressed for sustainable uplift,Updated Climate Change Policy also calls for better coordination among depts,"PESHAWAR: The updated Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Climate Change Policy, 2022, has called for streamlining of climate change mitigation measures in various sectors of economy and development projects to achieve sustainable development and resilience to natural disasters.
The policy, a draft of which is available with Dawn, aims to work towards a host of objectives such as formulation of a more appropriate and province-specific policy consistent with Pakistan’s updated National Climate Change Policy, 2021, developing and strengthening an enabling environment for Pakistan’s nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts and incorporate adaptation and mitigation strategies into major relevant sectors, policies, strategies, and plans, among others.
Under the updated NDCs, the government of Pakistan has set a cumulative aggressive objective of overall 50 per cent reduction in projected emissions by 2030, with 15 percent coming from domestic resources and the remaining 35 percent contingent on international grant financing.
The National Climate Change Policy 2021 sought to facilitate the transition to a resource-efficient, low-carbon economy in order to achieve sustainable growth.

Updated Climate Change Policy also calls for better coordination among depts

It provided a long-term framework for action to factor in resource efficiency in a balanced manner in several policy sectors, including climate change, energy, transportation, industry, agriculture, biodiversity, and regional development.
The draft KP Climate Change Policy, 2022, is an update of the provincial Climate Change Policy, 2017. Following the 18th Constitutional Amendment, KP was the first province to develop a provincial climate change policy that year. The policy update also seeks to make the provincial climate change action consistent with the updated National Climate Change Policy (2021).
The policy actions have been devised in keeping with the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that seeks to reduce international green-house gas emissions by setting national targets based on the concept of ‘common but differentiated responsibility’. This means that nations, which emit majority of GHGs, need to reduce GHGs at a greater rate.
Another international obligation is the Paris Climate Agreement 2015, a legally binding global treaty on climate change that aims to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this long-term temperature goal, all countries are required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century
To facilitate climate change adaptation and mitigation actions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including short-, medium-, and long-term climate resilient and sustainable development, the KP Climate Change Policy 2022 underscores the need to improve inter- and intra-departmental coordination and cooperation for effective planning and execution of actions against climate change.
Equally importantly, the policy seeks to integrate climate change risks and concerns as it impacts the vulnerable, marginalized, and indigenous communities in development strategies and planning through focus on pro-poor gender sensitive adaptation and mitigation initiatives.
To adopt mitigation measures in sectors such as energy, transportation, waste, industry, and urban planning etc, the policy outlines methods for capacity building and training of government line departments for sustainable development.
Climate change poses critical and significant challenges to Pakistan’s ecosystems, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province that could only be addressed through bold and creative climate actions.
The draft says according to scientific evidence, climate change-related disasters such as riverine floods, storm water, glacier bursting, heat strokes, droughts, and other vector-borne diseases are expected to become more common in the coming decades.
The adaptation approach to climate change seeks to reduce the vulnerability of natural and human systems or to capitalize on anticipated changes in climatic conditions, whereas mitigation seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through technological or through nature-based solutions.
A salient feature of the policy is specific measures for the sectors where adaptation and mitigation is required. Governance, planning, risk management, resources, communication, and monitoring are all critical to the successful implementation of the provincial policy, says the document.
Once implemented, says the draft document, it will open new avenues and attract the international climate financing in adaptation and mitigation sectors, allowing the KP to achieve sustainable development and create resilience against natural disasters, thereby securing the province’s fragile economy in the coming challenging environment.

5,21 illegal housing schemes sealed in Charsadda,PHC observes it will examine NOCs given to societies,"PESHAWAR: The district administration has sealed 21 illegal housing schemes in Charsadda and registered cases against seven owners, the Peshawar High Court was informed on Thursday.
Additional advocate general Sardar Ali Raza told a bench consisting of Justice Roohul Amin Khan and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim that a report submitted to the court disclosed that 21 illegal housing schemes in Charsadda district had been sealed and they were spread over an area of 2,803 kanals of land.
The bench was hearing a petition filed by advocate Asif Ali Shah against the establishment of housing societies on agricultural lands in Charsadda district.
The respondents in the petition are the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, senior member board of revenue, secretaries of agriculture, environment, and local government departments, and the Charsadda deputy commissioner.

PHC observes it will examine NOCs given to societies

Advocate Babar Khan Yousafzai appeared for the Charsadda tehsil municipal administration and said until a few years ago, the population of Charsadda was 400,000 but it had risen to around two million.
He said there was a committee of the district administration and with the approval of that committee, the TMA issued no objection certificates to private housing societies.
During hearing, Justice Roohul Amin Khan observed that the court would also examine how NOCs were issued to the legal societies, whether those were fulfilling the legal requirements or not.
The bench observed that it was a prerequisite for every society that there should be provisions for clean water, electricity, natural gas and proper drainage systems.
It was observed that the bench would see whether the relevant institutions, including the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited and Peshawar Electric Supply Company, were taken into confidence before the issuance of NOC to societies by the TMA.
The lawyer for TMA said he would file comments wherein the issues raised by the petitioner would be addressed.
The petitioner said the residents of Charsadda were dependent on agriculture, fishing and livestock. He added that Charsadda was contributing 85 metric tons of fish to the fish market in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He said Charsadda was the second largest producer of sugarcane in the province.
The petitioner said the livestock farming of the district contributed 940 million litres of milk.
He claimed that property dealers had started establishing illegal housing societies on the agricultural lands in Charsadda and the government employees were also hands in glove with realtors.
The petitioner contended that Charsadda was fast losing agricultural land to the rapid urbanisation, which was threatening agriculture, fishing and livestock farming.
He said under the law, nobody was allowed to use agricultural land for any other purpose except farming.
The petitioner said even the government, under the law, could not use the agricultural land for other purposes. He alleged that the revenue department and the district administration had closed their eyes to the illegal practices.

6,PML-N accuses PTI of using government resources to influence polls in KP,PML-N claims ruling party will suffer defeat over record inflation.,"MANSEHRA: Parliamentary leader of the opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Sardar Mohammad Yusuf has alleged that the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf is trying to influence the March 31 local body elections by using the government’s resources without let or hindrance.
“Federal minister for railways Azam Khan Swati and other PTI lawmakers have been utilising the government’s machinery and resources to sway voters in the favour of their party’s election candidate,” Mr Yusuf told a public meeting in Ganglan area here on Thursday.
The PML-N leader said the PTI had suffered a massive defeat in the first phase of local body elections in the province and the results of the second phase won’t be any different.“Upset by record inflation, unemployment and recession in the country, the people won’t vote for the ruling party,” he said.
Mr Yusuf criticised Prime Minister Imran Khan over failure to fulfil promise of providing the people with 0.5 million houses and one million jobs and said the PTI government’s poor economic policies had pushed the country to the brink of bankruptcy.

PML-N claims ruling party will suffer defeat over record inflation

He said PML-N supremo and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif would return home soon to lead the nation.
The PML-N leader said his party had finalised candidates for local body elections in the province, including Hazara division, and would emerge as the winner.
PTI OUSTER: Qaumi Watan Party chairman Aftab Khan Sherpao on Thursday said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf came to power through a ‘stolen public mandate’ and was on its way out.
“Prime Minister Imran Khan can’t survive no-confidence motion tabled by the opposition parties in the National Assembly and will be ousted,” the QWP leader told a public meeting held here in connection with local body elections.
Mr Sherpao said the PTI had suffered a humiliating defeat in the first phase of local body elections in the province and was trying in vain to claim victory in the second phase.
“It doesn’t suit a prime minister to address election rallies in violation of the ECP code of conduct,” he said.
The QWP leader said the opposition would march on the federal capital on March 28 leading to the prime minister’s ouster in line with the people’s desires.
He warned that the opposition would resist any unconstitutional move by the prime minister and his party.

10,10 more TB centres on the cards,"GeneXpert testing facility to improve detection of infection, says official","PESHAWAR: The health department is establishing 10 more tuberculosis centres in the province, especially for the early detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) due to the rapid spread of the infection, said an official on Thursday.
“The introduction of high-tech GeneXpert testing facility in district and tehsil headquarters hospitals has made the detection of MDR-TB possible at local level in the province. We are trying our level best to improve services to control TB,” project director of the TB Control Programme, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Dr Mudassir Shehzad told a workshop here on Thursday.
The event was held at the Khyber Medical University to mark the World TB Day. The speakers included head of the sub-office of the World Health Organisation, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Dr Mohammad Babar Alam, former director-general (health services) Dr Ayub Roz, director of the Institute of Public Health at the KMU Dr Saima Afaq, additional AIG at the prison department Rehan Gul Khattak, provincial coordinator of the Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Programme Dr Sahib Gul, and others.
Dr Shehzad said on average, the province recorded 40,000 new TB patients daily, so there was a need for scaling up public awareness of the availability of free drugs and diagnostic services at the government facilities.

GeneXpert testing facility to improve detection of infection, says official

“We have diagnosed 0.667 million people in the province with TB, a contagious disease, since 2002.” he said.
The project director said the province had five centres for the free TB detection, including the cases of MDR-TB, and they were located in Mardan, Abbottabad, Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan and Swat.
“10 more such centres are being set up,” he said.
Dr Shehzad said the main concern of the health department was the prevalence of MDR-TB among the residents.
He said the government had established the Provincial Reference Lab in the Hayatabad Medical Complex in 2014 with two bio-safety labs to ensure rapid detection of the infection in line with international standards.
Additional DG (health services) Dr Ubaid said TB was a bacterial infection, which spread through inhaling of tiny droplets from coughs or sneezes of an infected person and that it affected lungs and other organs, including abdomen, bones and nervous system.
He said a delay in diagnosis and follow-ups visits by infected patients were among the major causative agents of MTR-TB.
“We need to ensure that the patients continue treatment under proper supervision of qualified physicians so that they can get complete drug regimens for full recovery,” he said.
The official said the symptoms of TB included three-week continuous cough, weight loss, night sweats, fever, and loss of appetite, swelling of the neck, tiredness and fatigue.
He said the infection was curable if patients adhered to preventive measures for safety of others and regular follow-ups.
Manager of the National TB Control Programme Dr Abdul Wali Khan said Pakistan was ranked fifth among high burden countries for TB with 530,000 new cases surfacing annually.
He said most cases were reported in poor communities due to the overcrowded living conditions and other factors.
Dr Abdul Wali said every year, 259 TB cases were found in 100,000 people in the country.
He called for more efforts for TB control and prevention in view of the growing incidence of MDR-TB, which entailed high mortality.
Dr Ayub Roz said TB was no more a deadly disease due to the development of new drugs and diagnostic techniques and early diagnosis and safety measures were imperative to prevent it.

Sabra Sultana, who played the role of Ms Molly Ellis in a classic Pashto movie ‘Ajab Khan Afridi’ in 1971, has surfaced from her decades-long disappearance from the silver screen and has made an appeal to both federal and provincial governments to confer award on her in recognition of her services for Pashto cinema industry.
Narrating her story of her illustrious film career, she said that her family had been shifted after partition and settled in Karachi but film industry forced her parents to relocate to Lahore where she had been living with her grandchildren.
“We are Bangash Pathan, when Rahim Gul, the director of Ajab Khan Afridi film, offered the role to me, I readily accepted it as I knew the profile of the brave Pathan rebel against the British Raj who had kidnapped Molly Ellis, 18-year-old daughter of Major Ellis, on April 14, 1923 from Kohat garrison to take revenge for his home’s desecration by British soldiers during his absence,” she recalled.
The legendary actress said that during her stay in Mardan, Nowshera and Kohat, people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa treated her and the film team with memorable respect and hospitality and she still remembered those heart-touching moments. She said that her role was a real challenge, but she performed it with great confidence and it paved way for performing in several other Pashto flicks.
“I started my career with Radio Pakistan Karachi, PTV and then switched over to silver screen but my performance in ‘Ajab Khan Afridi’ fetched me unprecedented name and fame. Unfortunately, my best work for Pollywood was forgotten and I was never considered for presidential award, even junior artists have been honoured,” said Sabra Sultana.
“I, therefore turn to President of Pakistan Arif Alvi and governor to consider my name for an award in recognition of my past services. Though Punjab government gives me some monthly stipend yet living is hard with it and secondly the award would give a spiritual solace as I think I have served a noble cause,” she said.

Speaking at a function at the district health office earlier, the health experts said the function and walk was held to create awareness among people of TB and its prevention.
