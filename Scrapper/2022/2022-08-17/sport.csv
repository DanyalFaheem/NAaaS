0,Loyalties split as Pakistan cricket stars make first appearance on Dutch soil,"Before Tuesday’s game, Pakistan had played the Netherlands three times.","ON the outskirts of Rotterdam, near the airport and the sleepy neighbourhood of Schiebroek, chants of ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ and ‘Dil Dil Pakistan’ rolled off the tongues. With flags — some of them even belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf — shirts, bats, wigs and about everything they could find in green, Pakistani supporters descended on the modest but picturesque ground of the local cricket club, V.O.C. Rotterdam.
The venue, with makeshift stands and a capacity of 3,000, is surrounded by trees, ponds and waterways. All the meadows and greenery matched the passion of the Pakistani fans, who slogged their way across the continent from Germany, France and across the channel from England to watch the first ODI between Pakistan and the Netherlands.
Salek Chishti, an IT specialist from London, took the 3am train in Folkstone and then drove from Calais in France to be in time for the toss. Near the boundary, he got a chance to get Shaheen Shah Afridi’s autograph. He also clamoured for captain Babar Azam, with supporters asking stewards and photographers to move out of the way and not obstruct the view. Beaming, Salek said: “It’s a lovely and intimate ground. You get some contact with the players which doesn’t happen at Lord’s or some of the big English grounds.”
“You watch these players, absolute superstars back home, on TV and now they are here,” enthused Usama Liaqat, who lives in nearby The Hague, the capital of justice and home to the International Criminal Court. “It’s so cool.” 
It’s part of the reason why Salek, Usama and other fans came — to see Pakistan’s stars up and close, in the flesh, and to take in the colours, the smells and the textures. It was a grand day out. They cheered as Fakhar Zaman got Pakistan off the mark in a slow start for the visitors with little initiative to take singles. Stung by a wasp in the 17th over, Fakhar maintained a perfect strike rate to score 109 runs from 109 balls.
Before Tuesday’s game, Pakistan had played the Netherlands three times — the first coming in the 1996 World Cup at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. The second meeting came during the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka and third during the 2003 World Cup in South Africa.
This, however, is the first time Pakistan are touring the Netherlands. With the T20 Asia Cup on the horizon and very different wickets in the United Arab Emirates, some may question the wisdom of playing in Rotterdam, but the series was carried over from last year because of the coronavirus pandemic and the matches contribute to crucial World Cup qualifying points.
Hosts Netherlands are no powerhouse in cricket, but they have a major claim to fame. In 2009, the Dutch defeated England in the curtain-raiser of the Twenty20 World Cup by four wickets, prompting scenes of jubilation and ecstasy at Lord’s. Britain’s The Guardian encapsulated the match as “a thrilling contest as orange shone bright in the murky twilight of a memorable evening.”
“I simply couldn’t stop laughing,” recalled Sander Tholen, who has been following Dutch cricket for decades. “It was the opening game. At Lords! It was simply not supposed to happen.”
In the late ’50s, Tholen played as a part-time blower for Volharding Rap Amstels (VRA), one of the oldest clubs in the Netherlands, who played visiting teams from England in the Olympic Stadium, the Vondelpark and even at Museumplein, all landmark tourist attractions in Amsterdam. His uncle was a marquee player at VRA and so Tholen got enrolled in the club by birth.
He fears that Dutch cricket has flatlined since that heady night in London. “You have to be careful that the sport doesn’t stagnate,” said Tholen. “It is not taught at school and it is not very popular. Cricket got a bit of a boost because of the ‘new Dutch’, with new clubs and new umpires. Those second-generation immigrants simply love the game.”
Usama is one of those new citizens. The Netherlands counts 25,000 inhabitants with a Pakistani background, according to a 2020 Dutch census, with about half of that total living in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague.
Born and bred here, he identifies as Dutch, but it is often an awkward and difficult tightrope to walk, at work, in society and even at a cricket match.
“Over here, I am Pakistani and in Pakistan, I am seen as Dutch,” explained Usama, who plays for the reserve team of VCC, the Hague Club of Dutch and Mumbai Indians batter Bas de Leede. “Imagine a football game between the Netherlands and Turkey. Imagine you are Turkish, living in the Netherlands. You will long to support Turkey. But you don’t begrudge the Dutch a victory.”
His personal connection to De Leede aside, Usama and other Dutch-Pakistanis have another reason to cheer their adopted country. The Ahmad brothers in the Dutch team have Pakistani ancestry. The elder Ahmad, Musa, was even born in Lahore. But neither Musa nor his younger brother Shariz made the playing XI on Tuesday as Pakistan won by 16 runs.
On Thursday, Pakistan and the Netherlands return for the second ODI with a sell-out crowd expected. Once again loyalties will be split and once again anything but a Pakistan victory will be a major upset.

1,Afghanistan recall Shinwari for Asia Cup,KABUL: All-rounder Samiullah Shinwari was on Tuesday recalled after a two-year absence from Afghanistan’s cricket...,"KABUL: All-rounder Samiullah Shinwari was on Tuesday recalled after a two-year absence from Afghanistan’s cricket team, as the country announced its 17-man squad for the Asia Cup kicking off in the UAE later this month.
The 34-year-old all-rounder played the last of his 64 T20 Internationals in 2020 but regained his place after good performances in Afghanistan’s domestic cricket league.
Mohammad Nabi will lead the side in Afghanistan’s third representation at the Asia Cup, which was first held in 1984.
The Asia Cup will be played in the game’s shortest format in order to let subcontinental teams get in tune for the T20 World Cup to be held in Australia later this year.
Afghanistan are in Group B, alongside Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Defending champions India and Pakistan will be joined by a qualifying team in Group A.
Afghanistan will play Sri Lanka on Aug 27 in Dubai and then Bangladesh in Sharjah three days later.
The top two teams from each group will compete in the Super Four stage, from where the top two will play the September 11 final in Dubai.
Rashid Khan, Mujeeb ur Rahman and Noor Ahmad are the lead spinners in the squad.
Seam bowler Nijat Masood, spinner Qais Ahmad, and all-rounder Sharafuddin Ashraf are included as reserves.
Squad: Mohammad Nabi (captain), Najibullah Zadran, Afsar Zazai, Azmatullah Omarzai, Fareed Ahmad Malik, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Hashmatullah Shahidi, Hazratullah Zazai, Ibrahim Zadran, Karim Janat, Mujeeb ur Rahman, Najibullah Zadran, Naveen ul Haq, Noor Ahmad, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Rashid Khan, Samiullah Shinwari.

2,Ton-up Fakhar helps Pakistan edge Netherlands in first ODI,Opener hits his seventh ODl century to steer Pakistan to a 16-run victory.,"ROTTERDAM: Opener Fakhar Zaman hit his seventh One-day International century to steer Pakistan to a 16-run victory in the first of a three-match series Tuesday against the Netherlands in Rotterdam.
Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat in warm and humid conditions on a day where big scores were expected on a sluggish pitch at the VOC Cricket Club outside the Dutch harbour city.
The tourists however got off to a slow start before posting a commanding 314-6 after 50 overs.
Despite a valiant run chase, the Dutch finished on 298-8 against a spirited Pakistani team, backed by a myriad of vocal supporters.
Fakhar carved out a run-a-ball 109 while captain Babar Azam hit 74 before being caught after mistiming a delivery from Dutch paceman Logan van Beek.
The home bowlers initially contained Pakistan’s batting, with the visitors losing their first wicket, that of danger-man Imam-ul-Haq, lbw to paceman Vivian Kingma in the sixth over for a painstaking two off 19 balls.
But Fakhar and Babar eventually let loose and put on a partnership of 168 off 170 balls before Babar was caught in a soft dismissal when he mistimed a shot into the waiting hands of Tom Cooper at mid-off.
Fakhar was dismissed two overs later when he was brilliantly run out by Dutch captain and wicket-keeper Scott Edwards off a pin-point accurate throw by Bas de Leede at deep mid-wicket.
Pakistan looked set for a larger total but the Dutch bowlers did well to restrict them, with the spin bowling of youngsters Aryan Dutt and Tim Pringle causing problems.
The Dutch let themselves though down in the field and dropped several catches, Kingma notably fumbling a crucial high ball to hand Fakhar a lifeline when he was on 43.
Batting second, the Dutch lost hard-hitting Max O’Dowd in the second over lbw to ODI debutant Naseem Shah (3-51), with a fast ball nipping back onto his pads.
Naseem struck again later in the innings, dismissing Teja Nidamanuru, who dragged a delivery onto his stumps, and then trapping Pringle leg before for a golden duck.
Fellow quick Haris Rauf (3-67) claimed the important scalp of the veteran Cooper, who made 65 off 54 deliveries.
Cooper and 19-year-old Vikramjit Singh (65) put together a 97-run stand to steady the Dutch innings.
Edwards then took bat to ball and with three overs left, the Dutch required 48 runs off 24 deliveries.
Despite Edwards’ heroic knock of 71 off 60 balls the Dutch fell agonisingly short.
The second ODI will be played at the VOC cricket ground on Thursday, with the final match in the series scheduled for Sunday at the same venue.

The 78-year-old former batsman went into media work after captaining his country and was known for his frank opinions.
Chappell told The Sydney Morning Herald that retiring from commentating had been on his mind for some time.
“I had a minor stroke a few years back and I got off lucky, but it just makes everything harder,” Chappell, who made his Test debut in 1964 and played 75 times, told the newspaper.
“And I just thought with all the travel and walking up stairs and things like that, it’s all just going to get harder.” Chappell said he had taken notice of comments by recently retired veteran rugby league commentator Ray Warren.
“He said, ‘You’re always one sentence closer to making a mistake,’” Chappell added.

4,Ireland all-rounder Kevin O’Brien retires from international cricket,DUBLIN: Ireland all-rounder Kevin O’Brien on Tuesday announced his retirement from international cricket after...,"DUBLIN: Ireland all-rounder Kevin O’Brien on Tuesday announced his retirement from international cricket after falling out of contention for this year’s T20 World Cup in Australia.
O’Brien played three Tests, 153 One-day Internationals and 110 T20 internationals during a 16-year international career and had spells with a number of English county clubs and T20 franchise sides around the world.
The 38-year-old famously blasted the Irish to victory over England in a 2011 World Cup group match in India with a 50-ball century — still the tournament’s quickest.
The Dubliner scored 9,048 runs in total for Ireland, including the country’s first Test hundred, a second-innings knock of 118 against Pakistan in 2018, and took 276 wickets.
In a statement on Twitter, O’Brien, who for many years played alongside older brother Niall, said: “Today I announce my retirement from international cricket after 16 years and 389 caps for my country. 
“I had hoped to finish my career at the T20 World Cup in Australia, but having not been picked for the Irish squad since last year’s World Cup, I feel the selectors and management are looking elsewhere. 
“I have enjoyed every minute playing for Ireland, have made many friends off the pitch and I have so many happy memories to remember from my time playing for the national side.” 
Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie said he was “lucky” to have played with O’Brien. 
“Cricket in this country owes a lot to what Kev achieved on and off the field and he has left the game in a better place,” he said.
O’Brien has signalled his intention to develop his coaching career. 
“I want to continue to grow my own coaching academy here in Ireland and I have some exciting opportunities coming up in the near future,” he said. 
“I also want to continue to gain coaching experience overseas and hopefully will have more opportunities with some international and professional sides in the near future.” 
Andrew White, chairman of national men’s selectors, said: “It’s hard to put into words the impact that Kevin has had on our game in Ireland. “Through all the amazing and defining moments over the last 16 years he played an integral part and on plenty of occasions the lead role.”

5,Arshad Nadeem wants government to build track and field stadium,Javelin thrower returns to country after winning two gold medals in a span of six days.,"LAHORE: After winning two gold medals in a span of six days, Pakistan javelin thrower Arshad Nadeem wants the country’s government to build a new stadium specifically for track and field sports.
Arshad Nadeem arrived here in the early hours of Tuesday bagging gold medals in the Commonwealth Games and Islamic Solidarity Games.
The 25-year-old set a new Commonwealth Games record with his throw of 90.18 metres in Birmingham, England to finish on the top of the podium. He also became the first South Asian to pass the 90-metre mark.
At the Islamic Solidarity Games, in Konya, Arshad, bagged a second gold medal in a span of six days, recording a 88.64-metre throw.
Before the Commonwealth Games, Arshad had finished fifth in the World Athletics Championships held in Eugene in the United States.
While Arshad became the first Pakistani track and field athlete to win gold at the Commonwealth Games in 60 years, sprinter Shajar Abbas’ qualification to the Games’ 200 metre final spoke volumes of his potential as a medal-winning prospect in international competitions.
Arshad said Pakistan needed to provide athletes with the maximum facilities in order for them to be able to compete with their top international counterparts. 
“Pakistani athletes require better training from experts and a lot of work needs to be done by all stakeholders to see the country’s flag fly high,” said Arshad.
Arshad expressed satisfaction over his recent achievements adding that he wanted to bring more laurels to Pakistan.
“My achievements are the result of the hard-work and the prayers of elders and the nation,” said the athlete.
Arshad later reached his hometown Mian Chunnu where he received a warm welcome by his family and fans. He will travel to London next month to undergo a rehabilitation program to nurse the elbow and knee injuries he has been carrying since before the World Championships.
The Olympian will be looked after by Dr. Ali Sher Bajwa at the Cambridge University in the English capital. Arshad plans to return to the field in May next year.

6,South Africa keen to wreck England’s ‘Bazball’ party,LONDON: South Africa captain Dean Elgar says he does not fear “Bazball” as the Proteas seek to inflict...,"LONDON: South Africa captain Dean Elgar says he does not fear “Bazball” as the Proteas seek to inflict England’s first Test defeat of their swashbuckling new era under the leadership of Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum.
After a dismal run of just one victory in 17 Tests, England have won four from four under new skipper Stokes and coach McCullum heading into their series opener against South Africa at Lord’s on Wednesday.
That includes a 3-0 series win over world champions New Zealand, with England hunting down challenging targets on each occasion.
Stokes’s men then made light of a seemingly stiff target of 378 in the Covid-delayed fifth Test against India at Edgbaston, romping to victory by seven wickets. 
“Bazball” — a reference to McCullum’s nickname — has revitalised England’s red-ball fortunes at a time of renewed debate about the future of the five-day game.
But there are questions over whether the ultra-aggressive approach can work in all circumstances, particularly against a strong South Africa pace attack. 
“I’ve got absolutely no interest in the style that they’ve played,” Elgar told the Guardian. “I think it can go one of two ways for them and it can go south very quickly... I’d like to see them do it against our seamers.”
Stokes, on the other hand, hoped his team would retain their “venom” by the start of the series. Shrugging off Elgar’s claims, the England skipper said the die had been cast and they will not waiver from their plans. 
“The opposition seem to be doing a lot of the talking at the moment about it,” Stokes told reporters on Tuesday. “We just concentrate on what we do. We’ve got a style of play, they’ve got a style of play. 
“At the end of the day, it’s bat against ball and whoever plays best over a Test match is most likely to win. 
“For me, it’s just about reiterating the points that we were making at the start of the summer our mindset, attitude and everything like that about how we go out and play our cricket.”
Both teams appear to be stronger in bowling rather than batting although, with resilient opener Elgar leading from the front, the Proteas have won seven out of nine Tests under his captaincy, while the form of Keegan Petersen has helped compensate for the red-ball retirement of gifted shot-maker Quinton de Kock.
England will hope in-form batsmen Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow maintain their eye-catching form of earlier in the season.
South Africa spearhead bowler Kagiso Rabada is doubtful for the first game of the three-Test series with an ankle injury. 
“I’m hoping that he pulls through,” said Proteas coach Mark Boucher. 
“Rabada is a massive player for us as we all know so for him to be part of the final XI would be very special for us.” 
Boucher said his men were relishing their chance to write their names into Lord’s folklore. 
“Just watching the players’ reaction walking into Lord’s, there’s a lot of passion and emotions are running high in a good way,” he said.
Most of the England Test squad have been playing white ball formats since their last victory over India in early July and Stokes hoped they would quickly slip back into gear in the longer format. 
“It has felt like we’ve been a really long time away from each other obviously there has been a lot of different cricket, different formats played so there is a real excitement for me to get back in there, see everybody, and reminding everybody about what we’ve achieved and sticking to our guns,” he said.
Stokes confirmed wicket-keeper Ben Foakes will return to the starting XI in the only change from the side that defeated India. He missed that Test with concussion.
England XI: Zak Crawley, Alex Lees, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes (capt), Ben Foakes (wkt), Matthew Potts, Stuart Broad, Jack Leach, James Anderson.
South Africa squad: Dean Elgar, Sarel Erwee, Simon Harmer, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje, Keegan Petersen, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Lutho Sipamla, Glenton Stuurman, Rassie van der Dussen, Kyle Verreynne, Khaya Zondo.

The elections are being held at Lahore Garrison Club, which is located far away from the offices of the PHA in the National Hockey Stadium, perhaps to avoid any protest from the clubs of the Lahore District.
According to a handwritten press release, the affected clubs is going to stage a protest in front of the Pakistan Hockey Federation on Wednesday.
Dawn also learnt that some clubs had also sought stay-order against their respective district elections raising concern over the scrutiny process. Prominent among them are Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Dera Ghazi Khan.
The election commission scrutinised the clubs affiliated with Lahore District on Sunday. Overall, 37 clubs appeared in the scrutiny held at the Johar Town Hockey Stadium. But the EC cleared only 13 of them while raising objections over the documents of the remaining 24 clubs amid protest by those clubs.
Later, the EC gave some time to these clubs to complete the documents.
Though four more clubs have been cleared after scrutiny, still the EC kept pending the elections of Lahore District and is set to hold the PHA elections today.
It may be mentioned here that the PHF is holding the elections from district to national level after rejecting the four-member committee formed by the Pakistan Sports Board to conduct the elections, terming the move as interference by the government in PHF affairs.

8,Nunez sees red as Liverpool held to home draw by Palace,LIVERPOOL: Liverpool forward Luis Diaz cancelled out Wilfried Zaha’s opener for Crystal Palace as the teams drew...,"LIVERPOOL: Liverpool forward Luis Diaz cancelled out Wilfried Zaha’s opener for Crystal Palace as the teams drew 1-1 in the Premier League at Anfield on Monday, with Reds striker Darwin Nunez sent off for a head-butt on his home debut. 
Just two games into the season, Liverpool trail leaders Manchester City by four points with their new 75-million-euro (63 million, $77 million) striker largely to blame. 
Nunez had scored in his first two appearances against City in the Community Shield and in rescuing a point as a substitute in a 2-2 draw away at Fulham last weekend. 
But the Uruguayan’s headbutt on Joachim Andersen just before the hour mark left his side with an uphill challenge in the match and increasing ground to make up already in the title race. 
“He knows that now himself,” said Jurgen Klopp when asked if Nunez had let his team-mates down. “Of course it was a red card. He was provoked but that is not how he should behave.” 
Liverpool dominated the opening half but it was Zaha who broke the deadlock, stunning the home crowd with a brilliant finish to a counter-attack in the 32nd minute. 
It marked the sixth league game in a row in which Liverpool had conceded the first goal, although they had over 75% possession in the first half and a whopping 17 attempts, albeit with only three on target. 
Nunez could have put Liverpool level just before the break, but his scuffed effort came back off the far post and Virgil van Dijk failed to connect properly with the rebound. 
However, the Uruguay international, recently arrived from Portuguese side Benfica, was shown a straight red card in the 57th minute, and he will now face a three-match suspension. 
The sending off inspired Diaz to grab the game by the scruff on the neck in the 61st minute as the Colombian cut in from the left beat several players and curled the ball beyond the despairing dive of Vicente Guaita to put the hosts level. 
Zaha had a golden chance to put Palace back in front after 78 minutes, ghosting behind the defence but volleying a low cross from Cheick Oumar Doucoure off the outside of the far post. 
Liverpool also went close to taking the lead on a number of occasions but Palace held firm to claim their first point of the new campaign. 
Palace boss Patrick Vieira was delighted to leave Anfield with a point, despite having an extra man for the last half-hour. 
“Overall we keep our organisation our discipline — this is a really tough place to come and try to perform ... it was a really good team performance and I’m really happy with the team, the way they played today,” he said.

Juve opened the scoring in the 26th minute through Angel Di Maria, who volleyed Alex Sandro’s cross into the ground with the bounce taking it over stranded goalkeeper Andrea Consigli. 
Vlahovic doubled Juve’s lead with a penalty in the 43rd minute, awarded after Gian Marco Ferrari prevented the Serbia international from scoring by holding him back with both arms. 
It was his 10th goal for Juve since joining the club in January from Fiorentina, having earlier fired wide of the post. 
Vlahovic got his second in the 51st when he pounced to score from an assist by Di Maria, who had to come off in the 66th minute with a groin problem and was replaced by Fabio Miretti. 
The 34-year-old Argentine forward joined Juventus as a free agent in July on a one-year deal after leaving Paris St Germain at the end of last season. 
“How do I feel playing with Di Maria? It is an incredible feeling, it is a great pleasure to play with such champions, I thank him for the assist,” Vlahovic told reporters. “What matters is being available for the team and win. He played an extraordinary match.” 
Vlahovic almost capped his performance with a hat-trick in the 86th but his attempt was deflected wide of the post. 
Napoli also got off to a flying start with a 5-2 win at Verona in their Serie A opener earlier on Monday but the victory was marred by racial abuse of Victor Osimhen. 
Luciano Spalletti’s team were on top form at the Stadio Bentegodi, with goals from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Osimhen, Piotr Zielinski, Stanislav Lobotka and Matteo Politano. 
Second-half goals by Zielinski and Lobotka helped Napoli move 4-2 ahead before Politano hammered in a fifth to deal the final blow. 
Verona battled and were level early in the second half through Kevin Lasagna and Thomas Henry, but shorn of last season’s stars Giovanni Simeone — on his way to Napoli on loan — and Gianluca Caprari, there was little Gabriele Cioffi’s side could do under a second-half onslaught.

11,Murray downs Wawrinka in Cincinnati battle of veterans,"CINCINNATI: Andy Murray won his first hardcourt match of the summer on Monday, defeating Stan Wawrinka 7-6 (7-3),...","CINCINNATI: Andy Murray won his first hardcourt match of the summer on Monday, defeating Stan Wawrinka 7-6 (7-3), 5-7, 7-5 in the opening round of the ATP/WTA Cincinnati Masters.
The 35-year-old Scot was facing his 37-year-old Swiss rival for the 22nd time with both treble Grand Slam champions still coming back to full form after long-term injuries over the past few seasons.
Murray lost in the first round at Washington and last week in Montreal while Wawrinka’s last win came on grass two months ago at Queen’s Club, London; he has not won on cement since the Australian Open last year.
Murray needed four match points to advance at a tournament he has won twice, in 2008 and 2011. The veteran was competing here for the 17th time.
“We’re not young anymore,” Murray said.  “Both of us gave our best right until the end.
“Matches like this are a lot tougher than when we were in our mid-20s.
“Both of us love this sport, we’ve had our issues with injuries the last few years.
“The sport has been a huge part of my life, I started playing when I was four.”
Compatriot Cameron Norrie joined Murray in the second round with his 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-4 defeat of Dane Holger Rune.
The Scot began to well up as he described his love for the game.
“When I was out injured and not sure if I would be able to come back, I remembered the reasons why you play the game,” Murray said.
“It’s taken a lot of effort and struggles to get back [after two hip surgeries] and play at this level again.
“I want to make the most of it while I’m still able to.”
Murray claimed the opening set in the tiebreaker as he faced his longtime rival.
The Scot went down a break in the second set but got it back before finding himself at a set apiece after being broken in the final game.
The third set featured another pair of early service breaks; but Murray brought an end to hostilities with a break for 6-5 followed by a laboured concluding hold of serve.
In the closing stages, Murray loudly chastised himself as his grip on the set threatened to slip away against the Swiss whose best showing here was a semi-final a decade ago.
The contest was punctuated repeatedly by visits from the trainer for both men.

Substitute Antoine Griezmann scored the third goal late on and Atletico had enough chances to make the result even more comprehensive under the scorching heat. 
Their inspired Portugal forward Joao Felix roamed all over the field and set up all three goals, the first of which Morata swept home from the edge of the box on 15 minutes. 
Just before the hour, Felix found Morata inside the area by the far post and the Spaniard, back at Atletico after a two-year loan spell at Juventus, fired the ball into the top corner. 
In the 75th minute Felix teed up Griezmann and the French striker drilled a fine shot into the bottom corner from the edge of the box ensure Atletico made a winning start following the departure of Luis Suarez. 
The Uruguayan rejoined his boyhood club Nacional on a short-term deal in July after his contract expired at Atletico. 
“I’m very happy to be back here and because it’s always good to start the season on the right foot with a win in a very difficult stadium to play in like Getafe,” Morata told Movistar Plus. 
“I love playing for Atletico, I’m here to leave everything on the field, to work hard and compete. I’m confident we have a very strong group that will fight for everything we play for.” 
Athletic Bilbao drew 0-0 at home to Mallorca, while Real Betis defeated 10-man Elche 3-0 to complete the opening round of fixtures in Spain.

14,FIFA suspends Indian football federation due to third-party influence,NEW DELHI: FIFA has suspended the All India Football Federation (AIFF) with immediate effect due to “undue...,"NEW DELHI: FIFA has suspended the All India Football Federation (AIFF) with immediate effect due to “undue influence from third parties”, world football’s governing body said on Monday. 
The suspension also means that the Under-17 Women’s World Cup, which was scheduled to take place in India in October, cannot be held in the country as planned. 
The AIFF is in disarray and being run by administrators after former chief and FIFA Council member Praful Patel stayed in office beyond his term without fresh elections, which courts ruled invalid. 
The elections were to be held by December 2020 but were delayed due to an impasse over amendments to its constitution. 
India’s highest court disbanded the AIFF in May and appointed a three-member Committee of Administrators to govern the sport, amend the AIFF’s constitution and conduct elections. 
In response, FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation sent a team led by AFC general secretary Windsor John to meet Indian football stakeholders and laid down a roadmap for the AIFF to amend its statutes by the end of July and subsequently conclude elections at the latest by Sept 15. 
But earlier this month, the India’s Supreme Court ordered elections to be held promptly — on Aug 28 — and said the elected committee would be an interim body for a period of three months. 
“The suspension will be lifted once an order to set up a committee of administrators to assume the powers of the AIFF Executive Committee has been repealed and the AIFF administration regains full control of the AIFF’s daily affairs,” FIFA said in Monday’s statement. 
“FIFA is in constant constructive contact with the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports in India and is hopeful that a positive outcome to the case may still be achieved,” FIFA added. 
According to FIFA statutes, member federations must be free from legal and political interference in their respective countries.  
Indian men’s and women’s national teams also cannot play junior or senior international games during the suspension. 
Former men’s captain Bhaichung Bhutia called the suspension “very harsh”. 
“At the same time I think it’s a great opportunity to get our system right,” he told Indian sports news outlet Sportstar. “And very important that all the stakeholders — the federations, state associations, sport ministry -- come together to get the system right and everybody work for the betterment of the sport.” 
India captain Sunil Chhetri had recently advised his players  “not pay too much attention” to the FIFA ban threat as the situation was out of their control. 
India’s Supreme Court, however, is expected to take up a government plea to settle issues that led to the suspension by FIFA. 
“I request that the AIFF matters pending before the court be urgently heard,” top government law officer Tushar Mehta told Supreme Court Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and A.S. Bopanna on Tuesday, according to the Press Trust of India. 
The justices agreed to take up the matter on Wednesday. 
The FIFA Under-17 Women’s World Cup is scheduled for Oct 11-30, with four games on the opening day including India against the United States and Brazil against Morocco in Group ‘A’.
