0,US commander says China missile fire over Taiwan must be ‘contested’,"“It’s irresponsible to launch missiles over Taiwan into international waters ... where free shipping operates,"" he says.","SINGAPORE: China’s recent decision to fire missiles over Taiwan is a  “gorilla in the room” that has to be contested, a top US military commander said on Tuesday.
Beijing has carried out huge air and sea drills this month around Taiwan in a furious reaction to visits by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a congressional delegation.
Those exercises included firing multiple ballistic missiles into waters off Taiwan — some of the world’s busiest shipping routes — and it was the first time China has taken such a step since the mid-1990s.
“It’s very important that we contest this type of thing. I know that the gorilla in the room is launching missiles over Taiwan,” Seventh Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Karl Thomas told reporters in Singapore. “If we just allow that to happen, and we don’t contest that, that’ll be the next norm,” he added.
“It’s irresponsible to launch missiles over Taiwan into international waters, where the shipping lanes, where free shipping operates.” 
The Seventh Fleet is based in Japan and is a core part of Washington’s navy presence in the Pacific.
During this month’s drills Chinese state media reported that some of the ballistic missiles fired by the People’s Liberation Army followed a trajectory directly over Taiwan’s capital Taipei, a new escalation that Beijing stopped short of confirming.
Thomas compared the threats against Taiwan to the South China Sea where Beijing has spent years constructing military bases and facilities on a series of contested atolls, while denying it was doing just that.
“If you don’t challenge it... all of a sudden it can become just like the islands in the South China Sea (that) have now become military outposts,” he said.
“They now are full functioning military outposts that have missiles on them, large runways, hangers, radars, listening posts.” China’s Communist Party has never run Taiwan but it regards the island as its territory and has vowed to one day seize it, by force if necessary.
Sabre rattling towards Taiwan has become more pronounced under Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The United States and Western allies have increased  “freedom of navigation” crossings by naval vessels of both the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea to reinforce the concept that those seas are international waterways, sparking anger from Beijing.
China said it conducted new military drills on Monday as a delegation of US lawmakers visited Taipei.
State media ran footage and pictures of Taiwan’s Penghu islands purportedly taken from Chinese jets flying a short distance from the archipelago. 
But Taiwan denied that Chinese jets came close to Penghu.
“The CCP used cognitive warfare and other tricks to exaggerate and show that (its jet) was close to Penghu. This is not true,” senior air force official Tung Pei-Lun told reporters on Tuesday. The Penghu islands sit in between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan. They host a major Taiwanese airbase and would be on the front line of any invasion attempt by Beijing.
With China pressing on with its drills, Taiwan’s army said it would stage an armed F-16 exercise on Wednesday evening in the coastal city of Hualien, in a rare display of its advanced military capabilities.
In another move to rachet up economic pressure on Taiwan, Beijing on Tuesday sanctioned seven senior Taiwanese officials for being  “diehard ‘independence’ separatists”, the official Xinhua news agency said.

1,Chinese military ship docks in Sri Lanka,"New Delhi lodges complaint with Colombo, Washington raises security concerns.","HAMBANTOTA: A Chinese re­­search vessel bristling with antennas and communication gear docked at Sri Lanka’s Chinese-run port of Hambantota on Tuesday despite concerns from India and the United States about its alleged spying activities.  
The Yuan Wang 5 entered the deep-sea port after securing permission to enter Sri Lankan waters on the condition it would not engage in research, port officials said. 
It was originally due to arrive last week, but Colombo asked Beijing to defer the visit following objections by India, which shares Western concerns about Chinese activities in the region.  
But on Saturday, after intense negotiations, Sri Lanka announced a U-turn, saying permission was restored to dock at the southern port and remain for six days for refuelling and taking in other supplies.  

New Delhi lodges complaint with Colombo, Washington raises security concerns

“We are granting the same facilities that we extend to all other countries,” government spokesman Bandula Gunawardana told reporters. “All these countries are important to us.”  
Chinese ambassador to Sri Lanka Qi Zhenhong said the visit of Yuan Wang 5 was part of “normal ex­­changes between the two countries”.  
“China and Sri Lanka enjoy outstanding friendship,” Qi told reporters at a ceremony to welcome the ship.  
Shipping analytics websites des­cribed the Yuan Wang 5 as a research and survey vessel, but according to Indian media it is a dual-use spy ship.  
There was no customary military band to welcome the vessel, but a small group of traditional Kandyan dancers and drummers performed on a red carpet.  
Also dockside were several lawmakers, but there were no senior politicians or other dignitaries in attendance.  
“Long live China and Sri Lanka friendship,” read a red-and-white banner on an upper deck of the vessel, which had at least four satellite dish antennas pointed skywards.  
Men in white shirts and black trousers stood on deck waving Chinese and Sri Lankan flags as the vessel was pushed alongside the main jetty.  
The Hambantota port has been run by the Chinese since 2017, when they took it on a 99-year lease for $1.12 billion, less than the $1.4bn Sri Lanka paid a Chinese firm to build it.  
New Delhi is suspicious of Beijing’s increasing presence in the Indian Ocean and influence in Sri Lanka, seeing both as firmly within its sphere of influence.  
Both India and the US have raised security concerns over the ship’s visit to Sri Lanka, with New Delhi lodging a complaint with Colombo.  
China has said it was “completely unjustified for certain countries” to cite “security concerns” to pressure Sri Lanka, especially at a time when the island is facing an unprecedented economic crisis.  
The vessel’s activities were “in line with international law and international practice, and do not affect any country’s security or economic interests,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters. “They should not be interfered with by third parties.”  
A day before the arrival of the vessel, India gifted a Dornier 228 surveillance aircraft to Sri Lanka in a bid to bolster the island’s maritime surveillance capabilities.  
The Chinese ship was allowed into port on the condition it keeps its Automatic Identification System (AIS) switched on while in Sri Lankan waters and does not carry out scientific research.

2,"Bus falls into occupied Kashmir gorge, kills six Indian policemen",Police officer says 35 people have survived the crash but some are badly injured.,"SRINAGAR: A bus carrying personnel from India’s high-altitude border police rolled off a mountainous road and fell into a gorge in held Kashmir on Tuesday, killing at least six officers, police said.
Kashmir police said on Twitter the injured were being flown to an army hospital in the Himalayan region’s main city of Srinagar, some 90 km (55 miles) from the accident site in Anantnag district.

 





 
A police officer said that 35 people survived the crash but some were badly injured.
The bus was carrying members of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force, a federal force specialising in high-altitude operations, mainly on the Indo-China border.
Pictures from the site showed mangled remains of the bus by a fast-flowing river.

3,Russia describes blasts at military site in Crimea as ‘sabotage’,KYIV: Russia said on Tuesday that massive explosions at a military facility on the Kremlin-controlled Cri­mean...,"KYIV: Russia said on Tuesday that massive explosions at a military facility on the Kremlin-controlled Cri­mean peninsula in Ukraine that also damaged electrical power infrastructure were the result of  “sabotage”.
Russian President Vladimir Putin meanwhile said the United States was trying to drag out the conflict, accusing Washington of putting Ukrainians in the firing line and supplying Kyiv with heavy weapons.
Huge fireballs erupted at the site in Crimea early on Tuesday where ammunition was temporarily being stored and clouds of black smoke billowed into the air, images posted on social media showed.
“As a result of an act of sabotage, a military storage facility near the village of Dzhankoi was damaged,” the defence ministry said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.
The blasts — caused by a fire that led ammunition to detonate — damaged civilian infrastructure,  “including power lines, a power plant, a railway track” and residential buildings, the ministry said.
The explosions come one week after at least one person was killed and several more were wounded in similar explosions at a Russian military airbase in Crimea.
Ukraine has not directly claimed responsibility for either of the incidents in Crimea, but senior officials and the military have implied Ukrainian involvement.
Presidential aide My­­khailo Podolyak said the explosions had likely damaged infrastructure supplying power generated at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to Crimea.
“What is stolen does not bring prosperity,” Podolyak said on Ukrainian television.
He earlier described the blasts as  “demilitarisation in action” — using the same term used by Russia to justify its invasion of Ukraine.
Kyiv and Moscow have traded accusations over a series of strikes this month on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine — Europe’s largest.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warn­­ed that a  “catastrophe” at the Russian-controlled facility would threaten the whole of Europe. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has used the Black Sea region as a staging ground for its invasion.
Moscow ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February, anticipating little military resistance and hoping for a lightning takeover that would topple the government in Kyiv within hours.

4,Space mission shows Earth’s water may have come from asteroids: study,"TOKYO: Water may have been brought to Earth by asteroids from the outer edges of the solar system, scientists said...","TOKYO: Water may have been brought to Earth by asteroids from the outer edges of the solar system, scientists said after analysing rare samples collected on a six-year Japanese space mission.
In a quest to shed light on the origins of life and the formation of the universe, researchers are scrutinising material brought back to earth in 2020 from the asteroid Ryugu.
The 5.4 grams (0.2 ounces) of rocks and dust were gathered by a Japanese space probe, called Hayabusa-2, that landed on the celestial body and fired an  “impactor” into its surface.
Studies on the material are beginning to be published, and in June, one group of researchers said they had found organic material which showed that some of the building blocks of life on Earth, amino acids, may have been formed in space.
In a new paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy, scientists said the Ryugu samples could give clues to the mystery of how oceans appeared on Earth billions of years ago.
“Volatile and organic-rich C-type asteroids may have been one of the main sources of Earth’s water,” said the study by scientists from Japan and other countries, published on Monday.
“The delivery of volatiles (that is, organics and water) to the Earth is still a subject of notable debate,” it said.
But the organic materials found  “in Ryugu particles, identified in this study, probably represent one important source of volatiles”.
The scientists hypothesised that such material probably has an  “outer Solar System origin”, but said it was  “unlikely to be the only source of volatiles delivered to the early Earth”.
Hayabusa-2 was launched in 2014 on its mission to Ryugu, around 300 million kilometres away, and returned to Earth’s orbit two years ago to drop off a capsule containing the sample. In the Nature Astronomy study, the researchers again hailed the findings made possible by the mission.
“Ryugu particles are undoubtedly among the most uncontaminated Solar System materials available for laboratory study and ongoing investigations of these precious samples will certainly expand our understanding of early Solar System processes,” the study said.

5,UN rights chief visits Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh,KUTUPALONG: Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh on Tuesday implored the United Nations rights chief for protection after...,"KUTUPALONG: Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh on Tuesday implored the United Nations rights chief for protection after recent murders that have again left members of the stateless minority fearful for their safety.
Michelle Bachelet spent the day meeting with residents of the sprawling and squalid relief settlements housing nearly a million ethnic Rohingya who fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.
Security in the camps came back into focus this month when two refugee community leaders were shot dead, allegedly by an insurgent group active in the camps.
“She wanted to know about murders in the camps. We discussed it and also we discussed camp security,” religious leader Maulvi Zafar said after meeting with the envoy.
“We talked about strengthening camp security. We demanded security.” Most inhabitants of the camps fled Myanmar in 2017 after an army offensive against the mostly Muslim minority.
The crackdown is now the subject of a case at the UN’s highest court, with Myanmar’s authorities accused of genocide.
Security in the camps has been a constant issue, with scores of murders, kidnappings and police dragnets targeting drug trafficking networks.
Last September saw the murder of top Rohingya leader Mohib Ullah, who had shot to prominence for organising a protest of about 100,000 refugees to mark two years since their exodus. He also met then US president Donald Trump in the White House that year and addressed a UN meeting in Geneva.
His murder was quickly followed by the killings of six Rohingya students and teachers at an Islamic religious school.
Camp residents blamed both attacks — and the two killings earlier this month — on the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, an insurgent group that has been accused of trafficking narcotics and murdering political opponents.

6,Taliban add more compulsory religion classes to Afghan universities’ schedule,"“We are adding five more religious subjects to the existing eight,” says minister for higher education.","KABUL: Afghan university students will have to attend more compulsory Islamic studies classes, education officials said on Tuesday while giving little sign that secondary schools for girls would reopen.
Many conservative Afghan clerics in the hardline Islamist Taliban, which swept back into power a year ago, are sceptical of modern education.
“We are adding five more religious subjects to the existing eight,” said Abdul Baqi Haqqani, minister for higher education, including Islamic history, politics and governance.
The number of compulsory religious classes will increase from one to three a week in government universities.
He told a news conference that the Taliban would not order any subjects to be dropped from the current curriculum.
However, some universities have altered studies on music and sculpture — highly sensitive issues under the Taliban’s harsh interpretation of sharia law — while an exodus of Afghanistan’s educated elite, including professors, has seen many subjects discontinued.
Officials have for months insisted that schools will reopen for girls, swaying between technical and financial issues as reasons for the continued closures.
Abdulkhaliq Sadiq, a senior official at the education ministry, on Tuesday said families in rural areas were still not convinced of the need to send girls to secondary school.
Under the Taliban’s last regime between 1996 and 2001, both primary and secondary schools for girls never reopened.
“We are trying to come up with a sound policy in coordination with our leaders... so that those in rural areas are also convinced,” he said.
Since seizing power on August 15 last year the Taliban have imposed harsh restrictions on girls and women to comply with their austere vision of Islam — effectively squeezing them out of public life.
Although young women are still permitted to attend university, many have dropped out because of the cost or because their families are afraid for them to be out in public in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, without a secondary school certificate, teenage girls will not be able to sit future university entrance exams.
The international community has made the right to education a key condition for formally recognising the Taliban government. Despite being in power for a year, no country has so far recognised the government.

7,Turkish strikes on Syria border post claim 11 lives,"Tuesday’s raids follow overnight clashes between Ankara’s forces and the Kurdish-led SDF, says monitoring group.","BEIRUT: Turkish air strikes on a Syria border post run by regime forces killed 11 on Tuesday, following an overnight flare-up between Ankara’s forces and Kurdish fighters that control the area, a war monitor said.
“Eleven fighters were killed in a Turkish air strike that hit a Syrian regime outpost... near the Turkish border,” the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, without specifying if the victims were affiliated with the Damascus government or Kurdish forces.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said  “Turkish military aircraft have conducted 12 air strikes against positions of the Syrian army deployed on the border strip west of Kobane,” a Kurdish-held town. The raids caused  “casualties”, SDF spokesman Farhad Shami said, without specifying how many.
Syrian regime forces have deployed in areas controlled by Kurdish fighters near the border with Turkey as part of agreements intended to stem cross-border offensives by Ankara targeting Kurdish forces it views as terrorists.
Tuesday’s raids followed overnight clashes between Ankara’s forces and the Kurdish-led SDF west of Kobane, said the Observatory, a Britain-based monitoring group that relies on a network of sources inside Syria.
As part of the escalation, Kurdish forces struck inside Turkish territory, killing one soldier, according to Turkey’s defence ministry.
“Thirteen terrorists were neutralised” in retaliatory attacks by Ankara inside Syria, the ministry said, adding operations were ongoing in the region.
Turkey has launched a series of cross-border offensives targeting Kurdish forces and the militant Islamic State group since 2016, but such operations have rarely resulted in the killing of Syrian regime fighters.
If regime forces are confirmed to be among those killed on Tuesday, the attack would mark one of the largest escalations since Ankara and Damascus traded attacks in 2020 following a Syrian regime strike that killed 33 Turkish soldiers in the northwestern province of Idlib.
Turkey has stepped up its attacks in Kurdish-controlled areas of Syria since a July 19 summit with Iran and Russia failed to green-light a fresh offensive. The SDF, the Syrian Kurds’ de facto army, has since counted at least 13 of its members killed in several Turkish attacks.
Turkey has fervently opposed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, backing rebels calling for his removal and opening its doors to refugees.
But last week, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called for reconciliation between the Syrian government and the opposition.
Cavusoglu’s comments had been seen as an apparent easing of Ankara’s long-standing hostility towards Assad’s government and enraged the Syrian opposition and rebel groups.

8,"EU, US say they are studying Iran’s response to ‘final’ nuclear text","Iran’s official news agency reports that ""agreement will be concluded if the United States reacts with realism and flexibility"".","TEHRAN: The European Union and United States said on Tuesday they were studying Iran’s response to a  “final” draft agreement on reviving a 2015 nuclear accord with major powers the EU presented at talks in Vienna.
The US had already said that it was informing EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell of its response to the text he submitted on August 8.
The possibility of a deal which might lead to the lifting of US sanctions on Iran’s oil output of 2.5 million barrels per day has already helped trigger a fall in prices on world markets, with US oil futures dropping nearly three percent to finish below $90 a barrel.
A spokesperson for Borrell — who coordinated talks to bring Iran and the United States back into the deal — said the Iranian response was received late on Monday and the EU was consulting with the United States and the other parties  “on the way ahead”.
“Everybody is studying the response and this is not the time for the moment to speculate on timing,” Borrell’s spokesperson Nabila Massrali later told a press briefing.
A spokesperson for the US State Department said:  “We have received Iran’s comments through the EU and are studying them. We are sharing our views with the EU.” Iran’s official IRNA news agency reported earlier Tuesday that  “an agreement will be concluded if the United States reacts with realism and flexibility” to Iran’s response.
Iran’s ISNA news agency cited an  “informed source” as saying that Tehran  “expects to receive the response of the other side in the next two days”.
IRNA had said that Iran might accept the  “final” text drawn up by the European Union to save the deal, which aimed to curb Iran’s nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.
The deal has been moribund since the 2018 withdrawal of the United States under then president Donald Trump whose administration reimposed crippling sanctions.
An unidentified Iranian diplomat said, according to IRNA, that  “the European Union’s proposals are acceptable provided that they provide assurances to Iran on various points, related to sanctions and safeguards” as well as pending issues with the International Atomic Energy Agency. IRNA said the remaining differences centred on three issues.
“The United States has expressed flexibility on two of them verbally but that needs to be incorporated into the text,” the news agency said without elaborating.
“The third issue has to do with a guarantee that the deal will be lasting, and that depends on realism from the United States to reassure Iran.” None of the parties have spelt out in detail the points of contention that are still blocking a deal.
Iran’s demand for an end to US blacklisting of its ideological army, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as a  “terrorist organisation” has been dropped from the discussions and will instead be handled after the deal, a senior EU official said earlier this month.
The official said progress had also been made on Tehran’s call for guarantees that there will be no repeat of Washington reneging on the deal as it did under Trump in 2018.
Tehran and Washington still have to agree on  “issues related to sanctions lifting and a couple of nuclear questions that did not exist in March as the Iranians advanced their programme”, the EU official said.
Iran also wants the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, to end its long-running investigation into traces of enriched uranium found at sites not declared as having hosted nuclear activities. Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran and Russia, as well as the United States indirectly, resumed talks on the nuclear accord earlier in August after a months-long hiatus. The EU-coordinated negotiations to revive the deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, began in April 2021 before coming to a standstill in March.
The EU said last Tuesday it expected Tehran and Washington to  “very quickly” respond to the  “final” text aimed at salvaging the deal.

9,Odinga seeks ‘legal options’ as unease mounts in Kenya,NAIROBI: Kenya’s defeated presidential candidate Raila Odinga vowed on Tuesday to pursue  “all constitutional ...,"NAIROBI: Kenya’s defeated presidential candidate Raila Odinga vowed on Tuesday to pursue  “all constitutional and legal options” after rejecting the outcome of elections that awarded victory to his rival William Ruto.
The 77-year-old veteran politician branded the result of the August 9 race a  “travesty” but stopped short of explicitly announcing that he would mount a challenge at the Supreme Court.
“What we saw yesterday (Monday) was a travesty and a blatant disregard of the consitution and the laws of Kenya,” he told a press conference in Nairobi, blaming the head of the commission that oversaw the poll.
“I do not want to fully address our strategies going forward but... we will be pursuing all constitutional and legal options available to us.” Odinga narrowly lost his fifth bid for the top job to Deputy President Ruto, who was proclaimed president-elect on Monday after a nail-biting wait for results.
His supporters had cried foul over the outcome, which also triggered divisions in the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), which issued the results.
The poll’s aftermath is being keenly watched as a test of democratic maturity in the East African powerhouse, where past elections have been tarnished by claims of rigging and bloodshed.
Odinga lost by around 230,000 votes despite the support of his old foe, the outgoing President Uhuru Kenyatta, and the weight of the ruling party machinery behind him.
No presidential poll outcome has gone uncontested in Kenya since 2002, and Odinga says he was already cheated of victory in the 2007, 2013 and 2017 elections.
In August 2017, the Supreme Court annulled the election after Odinga rejected a Kenyatta victory. Dozens of people were killed by police in post-poll protests.
Kenya’s worst electoral violence occurred after the 2007 vote, when more than 1,100 people died in bloodletting between rival tribes.

10,Israel admits to killing five children in Gaza strike,"Children were killed in attack on Falluja cemetery on Aug 7, the last day of Israel's recent bombardment of Gaza Strip.","Israeli military officials have confirmed that Israel was responsible for the deaths of five Palestinian children on the last day of the country’s recent bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip, reports the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
Quoting several defence officials the newspaper said that an army inquiry into the attack on the Falluja cemetery on August 7  had found that Israel was to blame.
At the time of the attack, the Israeli army blamed the deaths on a rogue Islamic Jihad rocket.
Cousins Jamil Nijm Jamil Nijm, four, Jamil Ihab Nijm, 13, Hamed Haidar Hamed Nijm, 16 and Muhammed Salah Nijm, 16, were killed while they sat next to their grandfather’s grave in the cemetery in the northern Gaza Strip. 
The boys’ friend Nazmi Fayez Abdulhadi Abukarsh, 16, also died.
Eyewitness Mohammad Sami said at the time the boys used to frequent the cemetery.
“I was watching the boys after they bought something from the grocery store and then went to sit by the grave,” Sami said.
“They come to sit here every day. Every day. This is a safe area, they are used to being here.”
Over the course of three days, Israeli forces unleashed a wave of air strikes on Gaza, killing 49 people, including 17 children, and wounding at least 360 others.
