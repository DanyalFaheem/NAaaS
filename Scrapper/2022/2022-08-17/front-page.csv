0,Ex-PM’s adviser Shahzad Akbar placed on no-fly list,"Federal cabinet approves inclusion of 10 persons on ECL, removal of 22 and grant of one-time permission to three persons.","ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Tuesday consented to placing the names of two of former prime minister Imran Khan’s close aides — Mirza Shahzad Akbar and Ziaul Mustafa Naseem — on the no-fly list over their alleged involvement in a financial scam, at the request of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).
According to a statement issued after the meeting, the cabinet approved the inclusion of 10 persons on the Exit Control List (ECL), removal of 22 persons from ECL and grant of one-time permission (OTP) to three persons, on the recommendations of the Ministry of Interior.
A senior government official told Dawn the names of Mr Akbar and Mr Naseem, a legal expert in the Asset Recovery Unit of the previous Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) regime, were placed on the Exit Control List on the recommendation of the NAB.
Both Akbar and Naseem are presently in the UK. As per practice, if a person whose name is placed on ECL is abroad, he is arrested on his return and handed over to the relevant law-enforcement agency.

Cabinet approves detailed plan for ‘mitigation and adaptation’ to stave off adverse impacts of climate change

The UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) had reportedly frozen the assets of Bahria Town owner Malik Riaz’s family for being “illegal”, and in December 2019 agreed to a settlement worth £190 million with the family.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah has, in the past, accused Mr Akbar and PTI chief Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi of accepting Rs5 billion and hundreds of kanals from the housing developer in return for “providing protection” to the real estate firm in the same case during their term.

The minister had said that the housing society had “illegally transferred” Rs50bn to a Pakistani national in the UK. The transfer, he said, was identified by the UK’s NCA, and claimed that Mr Khan had tasked Akbar with resolving the matter, while the Rs50bn — which belonged to the national treasury — was adjusted against Bahria Town’s liability of Rs460bn in another case in the Supreme Court.
The minister had also claimed Bahria Town then entered into an agreement and allotted 458 kanals worth Rs530 million to Al-Qadir Trust, owned by Imran and his wife.
On the other hand, Shahzad Akbar said Islamabad was bound in a validly executed legal obligation with the UK’s NCA through an undertaking ensuring data protection and confidentiality of settlement agreement between the two parties, after its due approval by the federal cabinet in December 2019.
In a letter written to the cabinet division secretary on July 30, Akbar referred to a cabinet sub-committee formed on the asset freezing orders and funds repatriation to Pakistan in the case of Bahria Town, and cautioned about breaching the agreement and its legal repercussions.
He said the government being privy to certain details of an agreement and correspondence executed between a private party and the NCA, signed a deed of confidentiality. “… if this sub-committee is in process of breach of any term of this agreement/deed, it will be a breach committed by the contractual party i.e. the government of Pakistan, having its own legal liabilities and consequences.”
He then advised the committee to first seek a legal opinion from the attorney general. He also said he was ready to reply to the NAB’s queries online from the Pakistan High Commission in the UK.
Moreover, the cabinet also approved the inclusion of 10 others on the ECL, removal of 22 and grant of one-time permission to travel abroad to three people, on the recommendations of the Interior Ministry.
Climate change programme
Later, the cabinet was given a detailed briefing on the impact of climate change in the country. It was also informed that Pakistan had been placed among the eight worst climate-affected countries during the last 10 years when it had added just one per cent of emissions as compared to the rest of the world, aggravating the global warming impacts.
It was underlined that there was a dire need for immediate implementation of the ‘Mitigation and Adaptation’ mechanism. It was also decided that the issues of climate change and global warming should be included in school and college syllabi, besides ensuring strict implementation of climate change policies.
The cabinet also stressed upon planning rain harvesting on war-footing and considered a suggestion over commencement of a pilot project in Islamabad under the project.
It also unanimously approved the constitution of a cabinet committee, headed by Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman and comprising relevant ministers who would present their recommendations over the short-, medium- and long-term projects.
The cabinet further granted approval to the Finance Ministry’s recommendation for fixing a minimum diyat amount for the year 2022-23, equal to 30,630 grammes of silver, which amounted to more than Rs430,000 approximately.

1,"Scorn from Nawaz, Zardari puts Miftah in a tight spot","• Finance minister says all commitments to IMF, including increase in PDL, to be implemented at all costs • Skips question on","• Finance minister says all commitments to IMF, including increase in PDL, to be implemented at all costs
• Skips question on Maryam’s tweet describing Nawaz’s walkout from huddle on fuel prices
• Zardari says will meet PM soon to ‘talk about economic team’
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Despite criticism from various quarters over the unexpected increase in fuel prices on Monday, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail stood by his stance that the government has not imposed any new taxes on petroleum products.
While this decision has brought to the fore differences within not just the ruling coalition, but also the PML-N, the minister categorically stated the petroleum development levy (PDL) increase on oil products, as committed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will be implemented at all costs.
The minister began his day by clarifying a journalist’s concerns that the fuel price revision did not include any new taxes, saying: “The increase or decrease in prices is according to the purchasing by Pakistan State Oil. The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority takes the average Platt prices, adds freight and the premium paid by PSO on top of these prices, and multiplies that by the exchange rate.”
Later, addressing a news conference after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, he asserted that everything committed to the IMF, including further increase in PDL on oil products on Aug 31, would be implemented at all costs, adding the PDL will keep increasing until it reaches Rs50 per litre. From now onwards, the top priority is to control inflation, he added.
He said he would add the PDL amount committed while forwarding a summary to the prime minister for oil price adjustment due on Aug 31 or afterwards because this could not be notified without the premier’s consent. “Even yesterday, the POL price adjustment was announced after the prime minister signed it,” he maintained.
The minister also confirmed he was part of a meeting wherein former prime minister Nawaz Sharif purportedly opposed the increase in oil prices and left the huddle in protest. He, however, said he would not comment further on that.
The issue came up when a journalist brought up a tweet by PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz where she claimed: “Mian Sahib strongly opposed the decision and said he could not add burden of even a penny on the people and if the government had any compulsion he was not part of the decision and left the meeting”.
A major ally of the PML-N in the ruling coalition, PPP leader Asif Zardari also voiced his opposition over the issue, and complained of not being taken on board. “The PPP is a part of the federal government and supports it. It should consult us on such important decisions,” the former president said in a statement.
He reminded the PML-N-led government that the PPP and other coalition parties had joined the government to provide relief to the people, which should be their top priority. “We are with the prime minister, and I will meet him soon and talk to him about his economic team,” Zardari said.
The two major leaders’ outright rejection to the Shehbaz government’s decision to increase petrol prices has raised many questions -- whether both the big guns, especially the PM’s brother Nawaz, were consulted or the duo is politically bound to castigate its own government to keep their respective vote banks intact.
A day earlier, another important ally of the federal government, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, had castigated the Shehbaz administration for organising a musical event on Aug 14.
A senior PML-N leader from Punjab told Dawn PM Sharif did not take any important decision without consulting his elder brother.
“Mr Zardari is also taken on board on matters, especially political, but not administrative ones like petroleum prices,” he said.
Talking about the reaction of Nawaz and his daughter over the fuel prices, the leader said: “The father and daughter’s statement should be seen in a political context. The masses resent the government’s decision, especially when in the international market the rates are dipping. So, the elder Sharif and Zardari are trying to tell people that they are with them over this issue.”
At the press conference, Minister Ismail said he respected Mr Zardari’s displeasure over the petrol price hike and would brief him about the situation while he had already had a meeting with Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
He also elaborated various components of petroleum pricing already in vogue, including calculations by the oil and gas regulator, summary prepared by the Petroleum Division and taxation proposed by the Finance Ministry for the PM’s approval. He said the latest pricing was impacted by exchange rate loss and increase in the premium paid by PSO to secure various products that had increased from $8.5 per tonne to $17.
He conceded that the exchange rate had gone out of control after July 17 and reached Rs239 per dollar, adding he and his cabinet colleagues practically engaged with foreign banks and governments to facilitate the opening and honoring of letters of credit, even for oil imports.
The minister said the IMF had provided to Pakistan a draft letter of intent (LOI) on the agreement reached over the bailout package, and minor changes pointed out by the state bank and his ministry had been made by the IMF after a series of meetings. A final LOI was received on Tuesday, to be signed and shared with the Fund the same day. The IMF executive board was expected to approve the package in the last week of the month to be immediately followed by funds disbursement.

MULTAN: Rescue 1122 officials comb through the scene of a collision between a bus and an oil tanker on the Multan-Sukkur Motorway.—PPI

 
LAHORE/SUKKUR: As many as 28 people, including women and children, were killed in two separate road accidents on Tuesday near Jalalpur Pirwala in Punjab and Rohri in Sindh.
A passenger bus collided with an oil tanker near Jalal­pur Pirwala interchange on Multan-Sukkur Motor­way (M-5) early on Tuesday, killing 20 people and leaving six with burn injuries.
The bus carrying 26 passengers was travelling from Lahore to Karachi.
According to police, the collision took place as the bus driver tried to overtake the oil tanker from the left side. The tanker, carrying thousands of litres of oil, caught fire and exploded.
Six passengers sitting in the front of the bus managed to get out, while the remaining burned to death.
Rescue 1122, the motorway police and officials of the district administration reached the spot and moved the victims to the hospital.
Four people, who were brought to Nishtar Hospital’s burn unit, were said to be in critical condition, while two women suffered minor injuries.
Nishtar Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Amjad Chandio told Dawn that the process to conduct DNA tests for identification of the deceased was underway.
He said the families of 15 victims were approached by the hospital for DNA samples and tests were conducted by Punjab Forensic Science Agency. The reports will be received in three days.
He said the bodies would be handed over to families after completing the identification process.
Multan City Police Officer (CPO) Khurram Shahzad Haider told Dawn that a case has been registered against the bus company with Jalalpur city police station.
He said that teams, with representation from rescue services and the motorway police, would conduct an investigation into the incident.
“The driver was killed while a male hostess was injured,” said CPO Haider, while adding that the police have recorded the statement of two women who suffered minor injuries.
Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Parvez Elahi, while ordering a thorough probe, has sought a report from the Multan commissioner.
He expressed grief over the accident and extended his condolences to the bereaved families.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed grief and prayed for the deceased and their families.
“I am saddened by the loss of 20 precious lives in the accident. My prayers are with the bereaved families,” he tweeted.
Eight killed near Rohri
In another tragedy, a passenger coach plunged into a ditch near Rohri on National Highway N-5, killing eight passengers including four women and two children.
According to the police, the bus was on its way from Swat to Karachi when it met with the accident in which 32 people got injured as well.
The driver lost control of an over speeding bus as he tried to take an ‘abrupt turn’, said the police.
Rescue officials moved the dead bodies and injured to Rohri Taluka Hospital and Sukkur Civil Hospital where emergency was declared, police officials said.
According to the officials, the police have, so far, identified a 12-year-old boy and a 45-year-old male, while the identity of four women and two men were not known immediately.
According to the hospital administration, arrangements were being made to move the dead bodies to their native villages in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat and Manhsera cities.

3,IHC larger bench will hear PTI challenge to ECP verdict,ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday constituted a larger bench to hear Pakistan...,"ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday constituted a larger bench to hear Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) petition challenging the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) verdict in the prohibited funding case.
However, the court declined PTI’s request to suspend the ECP decision immediately.
Acting Chief Justice Aamer Farooq took up the petition and after hearing preliminary arguments, constituted the larger bench to hear the matter. The larger bench consists of Justice Farooq, Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Babar Sattar.
Further hearing on the matter has been adjourned till August 18.
The counsel for the PTI told the court that the Supreme Court made it clear in the Hanif Abbasi case that the federal government could not take action against political parties. According to the petition, the matter related to PTI’s funding was examined by the Supreme Court. “Those legal issues were decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan and in light of the dictum (legal principles or remarks made by judges that do not affect the outcome of the case) and ratio (judge’s ruling on a point of law, and not just a statement of the law) laid down by the Supreme Court the matter was referred back to the ECP for scrutiny of the accounts of all the political parties, including the PTI. Sadly, only PTI was targeted.”
The petitioner claimed that the case against the PTI pertained to an allegation of receiving “funds from prohibited source”. The PTI in its petition argued: “Prohibited source of fund as provided under Article 6(3) of the Political Parties Order 2002 are contributions and donations received from foreign government or multinational or domestically incorporated public or private company, firm, trade or professional association…”
“The party explained and reconciled each and every account through a financial expert orally as also by submitting a written financial summary, reconciling each and every transaction and, explaining all amounts received with its reconciliation with the audited accounts,” the petition said. “However, in complete disregard to all the submissions and without giving any reasoning for such disregard, the respondent [ECP] passed the impugned fact-finding report,” it added.
The ECP was incomplete, the petition pointed out, “in the absence of the total number of members as defined in the Constitution and deficient representation from all provinces? If so, does it not disenfranchise the provincial representation on the ECP as envisaged by the Constitution of Pakistan permitting manipulation and outside political interference in the work of the ECP.”
The long-awaited decision in the funding case, which had been filed by PTI’s founding member Akbar S. Babar in November 2014, was announced on August 2.
The PTI had received millions of dollars from 351 foreign companies, 34 nationals, disowned 13 party accounts that senior PTI leaders opened and operated, the ECP declared in its ruling. The commission also issued a notice to the party for forfeiture of prohibited funds and the matter was subsequently forwarded to the federal government for action.

4,Two cops guarding polio team gunned down in Tank,Attack comes a day after 10-day vaccination drive began in six high-risk KP districts,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Two policemen guarding a polio vaccination team were shot dead by unknown assailants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tank district on the second day of the campaign on Tuesday.
“Two gunmen hiding near a small water channel opened fire on the policemen from a very close range,” Waqar Ahmad Khan, Tank’s district police officer (DPO), told the AFP news agency. He said the attackers spared the two-member polio vaccination team and fled on a motorbike.
The incident occured in Tank’s Kachra Garah village within the limits of Gomal police station.
Officials have identified the martyred police constables as Nisar, son of Sina Azam of Manzai area; and Pir Rehman, son of Ghani Khan of Khargi village.

Attack comes a day after 10-day vaccination drive began in six high-risk KP districts

The attack came a day after a 10-day anti-polio campaign began on Monday in six high-risk districts of KP.
KP Chief Minister Mahmood Khan took notice of the incident and vowed that the perpetrators would be brought to justice, according to a statement issued on Tuesday by his special assistant on information, Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif.
The chief minister said the policemen guarding the polio vaccination team to ensure a safe and healthy future for the country’s children must be praised. “The policemen sacrificed their lives for the sake of our children and their attackers won’t go unpunished,” he said.
Around 40 people, including cops and health workers, have been killed in polio-related incidents in the province since 2014, according to health officials. Perpetrators haven’t been identified in any of the cases.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries where polio remains endemic, but vaccination teams have been targeted for years in both nations.
In April, Pakistan reported its first case of polio in 15 months. Since then, 13 more polio cases have been reported. All cases have been detected in KP, including 13 in North Waziristan and one in Lakki Marwat.
After Tuesday’s incident, a team of police and security forces led by DPO Khan reached the site to collect evidence and take eyewitness accounts.
Funeral prayers of both cops were performed with official honours at the district police office and floral wreaths were placed on their coffins. A Tank police squad also paid tribute to the martyrs.
Commissioner D.I. Khan Division Amir Afaq, Regional Police Officer Shaukat Abbas, DPO Khan, Deputy Commissioner Tank Hamidullah Khattak, Duty Officer Frontier Corps Sarmast Khan, Tehsil Mayor Tank Saddam Khan Bittani attended the funeral along with other security officers, media representatives and a large number of civilians.

5,Proposal to raise drug prices rejected,"Pharma representative fears discontinuation of medicines, says people will be forced to buy ""costly alternatives"".","ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet has turned down a summary moved by the Ministry of National Health Services seeking an increase in the prices of at least 35 medicines, which may force people to “opt for costly alternatives” as the pharmaceutical industry fears the “hasty decision” will result in the discontinuation of these relatively cheaper drugs.
According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on Tuesday, the federal cabinet unanimously rejected the summary moved by the ministry and ordered that the prices of medicines should not be increased without approval from the federal government.
An official of the Ministry of NHS said that these 35 medicines included anti-cancer medication, painkillers, and some antibiotics. “It was suggested that their prices be increased as hardship cases, but the federal cabinet rejected the summary,” he said, adding that the decision will be complied with.
According to an official of the Drug Regulatory of Pakistan (Drap), the summary was moved after a detailed exercise in which all the original documents from the companies were sought to ascertain the purchase price and the production cost of the drugs.

Pharma rep fears discontinuation of medicines, says people will be forced to buy ‘costly alternatives’

It is worth noting that in November 2013, the Ministry of Health notified an increase in the prices of medicines. However, the notification was withdrawn the next day after then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif asked the ministry to retract the notification, following a backlash over the rise in prices.
Costly alternatives?
The cabinet’s refusal to bump the prices did not make the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufac­turers Association (PPMA) happy, which feared that companies would not be able to manufacture these drugs due to their increased production cost. The PPMA said such a move will result in the discontinuation of these medicines, which were registered in the 1970s and 1980s, when the Pakistani rupee was stronger against the US dollar compared to today.
PPMA Central Executive Committee member Hamid Raza claimed that, at the time, the prices of these medicines were fixed in line with the exchange rate, which was “very low” and is same rate that is being followed today.
As companies cannot sell the medicines above the maximum retail price (MRP), their cost of production has exceeded the MRP and it was not viable for the companies to continue to manufacture these medicines, he said.
Mr Raza claimed that similar drugs registered after the year 2000 were being sold at higher rates after changes in the rupee-dollar parity.
“I believe that the federal cabinet could not understand the issue, due to which those medicines will vanish from the market and their alternates will be available at much higher rates,” he warned.

6,"Shahbaz Gill moved to jail hospital, superintendent transferred",Punjab home minister says no need for medical test as 'Gill was not tortured'.,"RAWALPINDI: The Punjab government is making all-out efforts to provide relief to Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Shahbaz Gill — former prime minister Imran Khan’s chief of staff — who is in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi in a sedition case.
The authorities concerned moved Mr Gill to the jail hospital amid reports of alleged torture and reportedly further efforts were being made to transfer Mr Gill to a government medical facility in Rawalpindi.
Meanwhile, the provincial government transferred Rawal­­pindi jail superintendent Chau­dhry Asghar Ali, and also sent provincial prison minister Muhammad Hashim Dogar to meet the PTI leader to reassure him.
The transfer of Superi­ntendent Asghar Ali came after Mr Dogar tweeted that he had “recommended” the removal of the jail officials for “keeping Shahbaz Gill in a special cell (chakki)” on his first night in the prison. “Such treatment is not being meted out to any prisoner. I recommended removal of DIG and Jail Superintendent from the post to the competent authority,” he said in a tweet.

 





 

Punjab home minister says no need for medical test as ‘Gill was not tortured’

There were reports of the transfer of DIG Prison Rawalpindi region Abdul Rauf Rana as well. However, they could not be confirmed by the time this report went to press.
‘Gill not tortured’
But before he tweeted about his recommendation for the removal of the jail high-ups, the home minister ruled out any torture by the jail staff and said that he would brief the PTI chair­man about the “reality” in detail.
He told reporters that Mr Gill was not “tortured and that there was no need to conduct his medical examination”. “Shehbaz Gill is perfect and healthy inside the prisons and he would himself issue a statement about his physical fitness soon after release from the jail,” he said, adding that there was no need of producing Mr Gill before a medical board as he “was never tortured”.
“I am a responsible man and satisfying Imran Khan that [his aide] Gill was not placed under torture in jail is my responsibility,” he vowed. He said a deta­iled report would also be submitted to Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi and Imran Khan in this regard. He said that Mr Gill was the accused of the federation and the provincial prisons department had no authority to extend or reduce his punishment.
On the other hand, PTI’s seven-member parliamentary delegation expressed serious concern over the alleged police torture on the detained PTI leader.
Case sent back to sessions judge
Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) observed that the custody of Shahbaz Gill might be given to the police if required and directed the sessions court to decide the government’s plea filed against the rejection of the physical remand of Shahbaz Gill.
Subsequently, the additional district and sessions judge, Zeba Chaudhry, took up the criminal revision related to the physical remand of Mr Gill and issued notice to Mr Gill for Wednesday (today) and adjourned the hearing. The court was told under the criminal procedure code the custody of the accused could be handed over to the police for a fortnight, whereas, the court, in this case, granted physical remand for 2 days only. And in order to reach any conclusion, the investigators need to examine different aspects.
Separately, IHC Justice Farooq issued notices to the police and prosecution on the petition seeking to quash FIR against Mr Gill. Justice Farooq asked the counsel to argue the maintainability of the petition.
