0,PA passes prohibition of loan interest bill,CM promises to lift ban on recruitments and provide relief package...,"LAHORE: Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi on Tuesday promised to introduce a relief package for the people of Punjab wherein the ban on recruitments would be lifted, doctors and teachers’ salaries would be increased and special persons would be accommodated.  
Addressing the Punjab Assembly session after passing the prohibition of interest bill on private loans and the Punjab privileges (repeal and revival) bill, he said time has come when the nation, which suffered a lot at the hands of PML-N, should be given relief.
“The PML-N banned recruitments but it is the PTI government that is going to lift it in coming days. Emergency wards in hospitals would be upgraded and salaries of those doctors, who served in those emergency wards, would be increased by three per cent. The visually impaired persons, whom the PML-N treated with an iron hand, will be fully accommodated. It is regrettable that they were baton-charged by the PML-N government although they were not able to see the very baton beating them. Similarly, the salaries of the teachers would be increased and MPAs would be given funds for development projects in their respective constituencies which had been deprived in the PML-N’s regime,” he said.  

CM promises to lift ban on recruitments and provide relief package

At a point CM Elahi told the MPAs: “You people just point out things and we would respond as giving relief to the poor and needy masses is our prime priority.”
The CM also took the occasion to praise former prime minister Imran Khan, saying that history would remember him in remarkable words for his contribution to the service of Islam by making it a part of curriculum.  
The PA also passed two resolutions demanding strict action against federal ministers Rana Sanaullah and Atta Tarar who “showed cruelty on May 25 azadi march to Islamabad” and another one demanding quashing of FIR registered against Shehbaz Gill and condemning physical and mental torture inflicted on him.  
The assembly also passed “Punjab prohibition of interest on private loans bill 2022,” which states no money lender either individually or in group of persons shall lend money for any moveable or immoveable good or in kind or any other purpose or advance loan to pay person for the purpose of receiving interest thereon, nor shall carry on an interest-based transaction in the province.
Whoever contravenes the provision of the sub-section (1) shall be punished with imprisonment of either description which may extend to 10 years but shall not be less than three years and shall also be liable to fine not exceeding Rs1 million.  
Whoever intentionally and willfully abets, engages, assists or aids the money lender in lending money or in recovery of the interest or in interest-based transaction in contravention of sub section (1) of section 3 shall also be liable to the same punishment as provided in sub section (2) of the section 3 of this Act.

3,Voluntary return of dowry: LHC dislikes family court refusal to entertain man’s plea,Observes that suit for recovery of dowry articles is to be proceeded by wife.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has declared that refusal by a family court to entertain a plea of a man who voluntarily wishes to return dowry items to his former wife is bad in law.  
Uzair Azmat, the petitioner before the high court, divorced his wife and also approached her through common acquaintances for the return of dowry articles because he claimed that he did not want the dowry articles to rot and lose their actual worth. However, the petitioner did not receive any response from his former wife and approached a family court where he filed a suit for returning dowry articles.  
The respondent (wife) did not appear and was proceeded against ex parte. However, a family court, while appreciating the noble gesture of the petitioner, dismissed his suit with an observation that a suit for recovery of dowry articles was to be proceeded by the wife.  
The husband challenged the family court’s order before the LHC. His counsel argued before the court that there was no prohibition in the Family Courts Act, 1964 for a husband to file a suit for returning dowry articles and the only yardstick and condition for attracting the jurisdiction of a family court is the subject matter with respect to which a suit has been filed.  
Justice Muhammad Shan Gul, before deciding the petition, observes that the question raised in the petition is perhaps a question of first impression in which a husband has stepped forward to volunteer the return of dowry articles brought home by his wife at the time of marriage. He says this unconventional approach has been discarded by a judge of a family court upon a suit filed by the petitioner.  
During the initial hearing of the petition, the former wife of the petitioner, following a notice through local police, appeared before the LHC and stated that she was quite willing to take back dowry articles but had not filed a suit for recovery due to her financial conditions. She asked the court to help her get back her dowry articles.  
Justice Gul appointed a bailiff to collect, receive and restore the dowry articles to the respondent who also acknowledged that she received all her dowry articles and nothing remained to be returned.  
Although the judge disposed of the matter relating to the dowry items since the petition borne fruit, he sought assistance of Sabahat Rizvi, a lawyer of Supreme Court, as a friend of court on the question whether a suit such as the one in issue could be entertained by the family court at the instance of a husband?  
The lawyer said the family court wrongly rejected the suit filed by the petitioner and that the order was bad in law and deserved to be set aside. She argued that a declaration needed to be issued that the suit at the instance of a husband for return of dowry articles was maintainable in terms of the Family Courts Act, 1964.  
In his judgement, Justice Gul observes that family courts, no doubt, have jurisdiction to entertain a suit filed by a wife seeking recovery of her dowry articles but neither has any distinction about what type of suit can be brought by a husband or a wife has been drawn in the Act. He notes that the jurisdiction for entertaining any dispute regarding any matter pertaining to dowry is liberally conferred upon a family court by section 5 of the Act.  
He says section 7 of the Act relating to the institution of suits refers to the terms plaintiff without specifying the gender of the plaintiff.  
“Can the word “wife” be read into the statute instead of “plaintiff” when the matter is that of dowry? Relief sought may be returned by the husband or retrieval by the wife,” the judge explains. He maintains that the interpretation pursued by the trial court (family court) would limit the scope of jurisdiction of the family courts even when no such limitation is either prescribed nor would it sit well with the purpose of enactment of the Act.  
Whereas, he says, it is expedient to make provision for the establishment of family courts for the expeditious settlement and disposal of disputes relating to marriage and family affairs and for matters connected therewith.  
“Hence, it is declared that the refusal by a judge family court in entertaining the matter in issue is bad in law. The same is declared to be of no legal effect,” the judge concludes his recently issued judgment.

Danyal Nazir Rathore, a lawyer, filed the quo warranto writ petition through Advocate Mian Dawood.
The petitioner contends that the impugned appointment has been made without a mandatory consultation of the Council of Common Interest (CCI). He submits that the government did not invite applications for the post through newspaper advertisement.
He states the Supreme Court has already described the whole process for the appointment of the Wapda chairman in a judgment famously known as Chaudhry Asif case. However, he argues, the government, in sheer violation of the SC judgement, appointed the respondent.
The petitioner asks the court to declare the appointment of the respondent as illegal and unconstitutional and order the government to make a fresh appointment strictly in accordance with law and the Constitution.
Justice Shahid Waheed will take up the petition on Wednesday (today).

According to Rescue 1122, the water level in the Ravi was increasing rapidly and low level flood was anticipated on the night between Tuesday and Wednesday. Over a dozen villages, including Qila Take Chand, Ojla, Wasaypura, Dhingriwala, Jhugian, Natha Singh, Dalo Multani, Bongi Lalo, Alpa Kalan and Mandhali, are likely to be affected.

He issued these instructions while presiding over a meeting held here on Tuesday.  
It was the last meeting attended by Mr Ali Jan as health secretary as the Punjab government has transferred him. Special secretary Saleha Saeed, all the additional secretaries and other concerned officials were also present.
An official privy to the meeting’s proceeding said the minister sought record of hiring and procurement of medicines made largely during the tenure of Mr Ali Jan as health secretary as there were complaints of ‘mismanagement’ in the department.
He said that after assuming the charge as secretary, Jan had made a massive reshuffle in the health department. He not only transferred several experienced officers, but also replaced them with those who had served during his first tenure as health secretary.
The official said some additional secretaries posted on the recommendations of Ali Jan were facing inquiries being held on the complaints of alleged mismanagement and corruption.
During the meeting, the health minister also issued directions to introduce reforms in the system of issuing medico-legal certificates (MLCs) in the government hospitals. He directed the officials concerned to identify the network allegedly patronising the mafias behind fake MLCs and warned those playing havoc with the state-run hospitals won’t be spared.
Mr Malik issued instructions to integrate the systems of the Basic Health Units (BHUs), Rural Health Centres (RHCs) and District Headquarter Hospitals (DHQs) in order to improve the functioning of the health facilities in Punjab.
“The Punjab government has chalked out a comprehensive plan to upgrade emergency wards of all the state-run teaching hospitals to ensure standardised treatment of the patients,” he said.

9,SNGPL starts laying pipelines to tap gas reserves,"New discoveries in Lakki Marwat, Bannu will add 70MMCFD gas to system...","LAHORE: The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) has launched work to develop new infrastructure network (laying of pipelines) for extraction and distribution of the newly-discovered gas reserves in the districts of North Waziristan and Lakki Marwat, Bannu division, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  
The new discovery would initially add 70MMCFD of gas to the SNGPL’s system, improving supplies, especially in winter. 
“The blocks namely Bannu (North Waziristan) and Walli (Lakki Marwat) fields will initially provide 40 and 30 MMCFD of gas respectively, improving supplies in the service areas of the SNGPL (Punjab and KP). For this, the construction work to develop a new gas infrastructure network has been launched in the respective area,” an official source told Dawn on Tuesday.  

New discoveries in Lakki Marwat, Bannu will add 70MMCFD gas to system

It merits mentioning that the KP is currently producing nearly 375 MMCFD gas. After having first right to use and meet its demand as per the Constitution of Pakistan, it provides the remaining gas to Punjab - the country’s largest gas user. Similarly Balochistan and Sindh, falling under service jurisdiction of the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), being gas producing provinces, also meet their demand first and supply the remaining quantity to Punjab. Since the indigenous gas reserves in KP, Balochistan (Sui) and Sindh cannot fulfill demand of Punjab, especially in winter, the government is forced to import Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) that is regasified at the two private sector LNG terminals at Karachi port and injected into the SNGPL’s system. 
About new discovery in KP, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also ordered the authorities concerned last week to ensure immediate supply of gas to the people living in the districts where new reserves were discovered recently. The premier sought recommendations regarding the development of the area in terms of social welfare, education and health. The relevant authorities were asked to submit a plan for providing relief to the residents living in the areas where the new reserves had been discovered. 
“The maximum demand of KP during winter doesn’t exceed 375 MMCFD. However, in summer the demand reduces to 200 MMCFD or so, enabling it to inject the remaining 175 into Punjab. However, the province also inject some gas (20 MMCFD or so) into Punjab in peak winter after meeting its demand,” the official said. 
He said owing to fast depletion and non-exploration of new reserves, the authorities are unable to meet the demand of [particularly] the domestic consumers. The situation is even forcing them every year [especially winter] to suspend supplies to non-export industry, captive power plants and other sectors. 
“In April (summer) this year, the gas supply to non-export and CNG sector was also halted in a bid to improve supplies to the domestic consumers across the province. And it was probably the first time that the province faced such a situation in summer,” said the official.

11,PM’s aide Malik Ahmad Khan ‘justifies’ action against PTI men,Says state foiled conspiracy to dislodge constitutional government on May 25.,"LAHORE: Prime Minister’s Assistant Malik Ahmad Khan has ‘justified’ police action against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders and workers on May 25, saying the state foiled the conspiracy to dislodge the constitutional government.  
“The state rejected the mob rule on May 25. The state resisted the fascist dictatorship on that day. We have no sense of sin. Any individual, who doesn’t give respect to the constitution and the law, is not loyal to the country,” Malik Ahmad said in a series of tweets on Tuesday. 
He said the police officials who resisted the anarchist elements on May 25, the police officials who restrained the mob rule, need to be given the medals. Those police officials were national heroes, he said.  
The PML-Q-PTI coalition government in Punjab has initiated action against all those - PML-N leaders (who were part of the Hamza Shehbaz government then), police officials and bureaucrats - involved in torture of PTI activists during the party’s Azadi March on Islamabad (on May 25).  
PM’s Assistant Atta Tarar has already secured a protective bail to evade Punjab government action against him in the May 25 cases.
“We don’t fear the frivolous cases of the Punjab government. We don’t fear the Punjab government jails. Both honour and dishonour are in the hands of Allah Almighty. I can die for the survival of the state,” the PML-N leader said. 
“Chief Minister Parvez Elahi said if I didn’t settle the score of 25 May, I would remain restless. There is no reason for vengeance to establish the rule of law,” Malik Ahmad said. 
The PM’s assistant further said if the constitution reigned supreme, there was no reason for tribal animosities. “Elahi’s statement doesn’t seem to be the statement of the CM of the civilised province, but it seems to be the statement of the tribal chief.”  
He also talked about war of narratives between the two mainstream parties at the moment. “No doubt, there is war of the narratives. This is war between the ideas of the constitutional democracy and the fascist dictatorship. We would shed the last drop of our blood, but we will never surrender the principles of the supremacy of the constitution and the rule of the law. These are the ideals of which one can die for. These ideals are integral part of our political belief system,” Malik Ahmad concluded.

The rulers, he added, always made efforts to keep their masters happy. The US and international lending agencies, he added, forced decisions on Islamabad. The latest hike in the petroleum prices was the result of the conditions put by the IMF for a fresh instalment and we reject the rise.
The JI chief said the political parties who held long marches against the former PTI government on the issue of price increases of basic commodities were not even feeling any embarrassment on breaking all the records of inflation in three and half months. If the PTI created a disaster in the three-and-a-half-year, the current government of more than 13 political parties completed the agenda of the former ruling party in months.
