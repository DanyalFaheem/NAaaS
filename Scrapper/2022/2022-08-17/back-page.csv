QUETTA: Balochistan’s capital Quetta was practically cut off from the rest of the country as the city’s main railway line and the highway, which were damaged due to rain, are yet to be repaired.
The railway service was suspended after the track was submerged on Monday, while the traffic on Quetta-Karachi National Highway has been suspended for four days as flood water was still flowing over the highway.
Talking to Dawn, Sibi Deputy Commis­si­o­ner Mansoor Qazi, denied the reports that the track was washed away at several poin­­ts. He clarified that the track was submer­ged and efforts were under way to dewater the area and restore railway services betw­een Quetta and other parts of the country.
The Quetta-Sibi-Sukkur highway was closed due to overflowing flood water, said Mr Qazi.

Meanwhile, Bolan Deputy Commissioner has also urged the public to avoid the Quetta-Karachi highway as it was not open for traffic yet after being damaged due to floods.
In a tragic accident in Saranan area of Pishin district, five people, who were part of a wedding party, died after being swept away in a flash flood.
The victims, including three women and two children , were travelling along with family members in a convoy when they got stuck in gushing water.
Officials said that 11 people including women and children were rescued by male family members, travelling in other vehicles.
The dead bodies were later recovered by rescue officials.
The situation in other districts has not improved yet as Musakhail, Zhob, Pishin, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Nasirabad and Lasbela were still receiving torrential rains for the past two days.
According to officials, hundreds of mud houses were damaged in Qila Saifullah, Muslim Bagh, Musakhail, Kohlu, Dera Bugti and other areas.
In Musakhail, several people were stranded due to incessant rain which caused flash floods in seasonal streams.
Rescue teams, including the army, Frontier Constabulary, Levies and local administration were trying to rescue people from far-flung areas of the district which were cut-off due to washing away of connecting roads and of bridges.
A senior official told Dawn that three missing persons, who were swept away in Musakhail due to a dam breach, were found in injured condition and moved to a hospital.
“So far 12 people have died in Musakhail in rain-related accidents,” a senior local administration official told Dawn.
In Sibi district, the gushing Lehri River damaged mud houses in Nasirabad, leaving hundreds of people stranded. The water from Goghi Dam was also reaching the area after it was filled to maximum capacity and had started to overflow.
“The locals in Sibi were provided with relief goods including food, drinking water, tents and other items after they were rescued from flooded villages,” Sibi Deputy Commissioner Mansoor Qazi told Dawn.
Meanwhile, the train service between Pakistan and Iran was restored after 11 days. The service was suspended after the Quetta-Taftan railway line was washed away at six points.
So far, 196 people have lost their lives in the province during the current monsoon season.
More destruction in GB
The gushing flood water continued to leave behind destruction as dozens homes, bridges and and roads were swept away on Tuesday in several Gilgit Baltistan areas.
As flash floods in rivers and streams continued, several people were left homeless while crops, agricultural lands, trees, fish farms, irrigation channels, hydroelectric power stations and transmission infrastructure were destroyed.
According to police, flood from Guchi nullah blocked Hunza River in Guru Jaglot area and diverted the water towards residential areas, which damaged several residential and commercial properties along the river.
The traffic from other areas of the country to GB via Babusar Pass has been halted while the Karakoram Highway was also blocked at Uchar Nullah in Upper Kohistan area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Cloudburst in Neelum Valley
A cloudburst-induced flash flood in a water channel of Neelum Valley swept away at least three houses and some vehicles, according to initial reports.
Saeed Qureshi, a senior State Disaster Management Authority official, told Dawn that the flood had occurred in Ratti Galli nullah some six kilometres downstream Ratti Galli Lake, a popular tourist destination.

1,US won’t release frozen assets to Afghan central bank,Administration cites Al Qaeda leader Zawahiri’s discovery as reason for refusal.,"WASHINGTON: On the first anniversary of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, the Biden administration announced that it will not release $3.5 billion in frozen Afghan funds, citing the discovery of Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri in Kabul. 
“An American official said the United States could not guarantee that the money would not fall into terrorist hands, so it has ruled out releasing it anytime soon,” The New York Times reported on Tuesday.
Tom West, the State Department’s special representative for Afghanistan, told journalists in Washington that he did “not see recapitalisation of the Afghan central bank as a near-term option”.
The Taliban’s “sheltering of Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri reinforces deep concerns we have regarding diversion of funds to terrorist groups,” he added.

Administration cites Zawahiri’s discovery as reason for refusal

A National Security Council (NSC) spokesperson told CNN that “there has been no change” in efforts to get the funds to the Afghan people, but Ayman al Zawahiri’s presence in Kabul has had a direct impact on how the administration deals with the Taliban.
“The recent revelations of the Taliban’s flagrant violation of the Doha agreement illustrate the importance of remaining clear-eyed in our dealings with the Taliban. Our approach to the future of these assets will continue to reflect that reality,” the NSC spokesperson said.
The New York Times noted that the Biden administration outlined its position on the funds “on the one-year anniversary of the takeover of Afghanistan by the extremist Tali­ban militia and just over two weeks after an American drone strike killed Ayman al Zawahiri on the balcony of a house tied to a faction of the Taliban coalition in an exclusive enclave of the Afghan capital”.
Mr West pointed out that American officials had engaged for months with the central bank about how to shore up Afghanistan’s economy but had not secured persuasive guarantees that the money would not fall into terrorist hands. “We do not have confidence that that institution has the safeguards and monitoring in place to manage assets responsibly,” Mr West said in a statement reported by The Wall Street Journal. “And needless to say, the Taliban’s sheltering of Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri reinforces deep concerns we have regarding diversion of funds to terrorist groups.” 
At a State Department news briefing, spokesman Ned Price said the administration was searching for alternative ways to use the money to help Afghans at a time when millions are afflicted by a growing hunger crisis.
The Washington Post noted that a year after withdrawing US troops, “the Biden administration wields scant leverage in Afghanistan as it struggles to assist needy Afghans, evacuate US allies and protect women’s rights in a nation where it once held unparalleled sway”. 
It pointed out that US officials were now “working with Islamic organisations and nations including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as they seek to employ the few tools they have to influence the Taliban government — sanctions and travel bans, and the promise of potential diplomatic recognition — in hopes of preventing terrorist attacks, helping US-linked Afghans emigrate and recovering an American hostage”.

2,Man who held up Beirut bank released without charge,He took hostages at a bank last week in an attempt to access his savings frozen after the country’s 2019 financial implosion.,"BEIRUT: A Lebanese judge has ordered the rele­ase from detention without charge of man who last week took hostages at a Beirut bank in an attempt to access his savings frozen after the country’s 2019 financial implosion, the man’s brother and a legal group said.
Bassam al-Sheikh Huss­ein, 42, entered the Federal Bank of Lebanon branch in Beirut’s Hamra district on Thursday and threatened employees with a firearm, agreeing to leave only after the bank pledged to give him $35,000 out of a total of his more than $200,000 deposit. He said he needed the funds to pay a relative’s hospital bills.
Hussein was detained on Thursday following the rele­ase of all six hostages but released on Tuesday afternoon without any charges being brought against him, his brother Atef said and legal watchdog group Legal Agenda reported.
“He is sitting with his family now and just relaxing a bit. There is no charge against him and he is a free man,” Atef Hussein said.
According to Fouad Debs, the lawyer who represented Hussein last week, the bank pressed charges on Friday and dropped them by Tuesday. Debs said it was still possible that the public prosecution was pressing lighter charges.
“Were hoping this won’t be at expense of him getting the rest of the money in his account,” Debs said.
Hassan Halawi, the head of the branch where the incident occurred, said he had no comment as to whet­her Hussein should have faced charges but said “no one accepts what happened” at the bank.
During the hostage situation, a crowd gathered outside the bank to support Hus­sein, chanting “Down with the rule of the banks!” He has since been praised by many in the country as a hero who stood up to informal capital controls that have not been formalised by law and give banks wide discretion to decide who is allowed to access their funds and how much they can receive.

3,"Pakistan willing to bridge US-China differences, says Shehbaz",KARACHI: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said the world cannot afford to go back into another “era of Cold War ...,"KARACHI: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said the world cannot afford to go back into another “era of Cold War or bloc politics”, and Pakistan will be happy to play a positive role in bridging differences between the United States and China. He made the remarks in an interview with Newsweek magazine’s senior foreign policy writer Tom O’Connor published on Monday.
The premier touched on various subjects, including US-China strained relations, situation in Afghanistan, fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war, militancy in Pakistan and his plan to bring the nation together.
Talking about heightened friction between the United States and China, Mr Sharif said while Pakistan’s relationship with China “is very special”, it had also maintained a long-standing historic bilateral relationship with the United States covering “all issues of mutual interest”.
“The world can ill-afford [a] descent into another era of Cold War or bloc politics. I believe polarisation would have serious consequences for the global economy afflicted by the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine crisis,” the prime minister said.
Asked whether Pakistan could play a role in de-escalating tensions between the two countries, the premier said Pakistan’s foreign policy was one of “friendliness and goodwill towards all the nations of the world”. “If China and the US so desire, Pakistan would be happy to play a positive role to bridge their differences, as we had done in the past.”
About the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Mr Sharif said Pakistan had been emphasising a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict. He said Pakistan was “committed to having friendly relations with all major powers of the world, including Russia”.
Afghanistan and militancy
Talking about Afghanistan, Mr Sharif said the global community’s initial concerns, including avoiding a protracted conflict, ensuring safe evacuations, regulating the flow of migrants, and ensuring humanitarian assistance, were handled in a “relatively satisfactory manner”.
On militant attacks in Pakistan, including those targeting Chinese nationals, the premier said it was no secret that Pakistan was “one of the biggest victims of state-sponsored terrorism that is planned, supported and financed by hostile intelligence agencies”.
He went on to say that terrorist attacks against Chinese nationals were “aided and abetted by forces inimical to the Pakistan-China strategic partnership”.
Talking about his plan for bringing the nation together, Mr Sharif asserted that the government was changed through a “constitutional process”.
He said the political parties part of the coalition government represented 70 per cent of the electorate, making the current government “truly national in nature”.
For democracy to function effectively, all political parties that come to power would have to improve their delivery, he said: “Performance in the office alone can provide longevity to the public office holders.”

4,Australian PM says Scott Morrison secretly held five cabinet posts,"Terms move an ‘""unprecedented trashing of our democracy"", promises further investigation.","SYDNEY: Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday that his predecessor secretly seized control of five ministerial posts, labelling it an “unprecedented trashing of our democracy”.
Albanese said Scott Morr­ison had appointed himself to more ministries than initially thought, and promised further investigation.
From March 2020 until he was swept from power in May elections, Morrison app­o­i­nted himself to oversee the departments of hea­lth, fina­nce, home affairs, treasury and resources, Albanese said.
The prime minister said he had asked the country’s Solicitor-General to advise him on whether Morrison’s acti­ons, which he called a “shadow government”, were legal.

Terms move an ‘unprecedented trashing of our democracy’, promises further investigation

“It is completely extraordinary that these appointments were kept secret by the Morrison Government from the Australian people,” he said.
Morrison on Tuesday said his actions were necessary during the Covid-19 pandemic, adding that they were made during a “very unprecedented time”.
Some ministers of the former government have said they were not told that Morrison appointed himself to their portfolios — including then finance minister Mathias Cormann, now secretary-general of the OECD.
In the wake of the revelations, Karen Andrews, who was Home Affairs Minister in the Morrison government, called for the ex-PM to resign from parliament.
The political firestorm has drawn scrutiny of the Morrison government’s handling of the pandemic, and his decision to block a controversial offshore gas project after making himself resources minister.
Morrison’s conservative coalition lost power in May’s election, ending nearly a decade of centre-right rule.
In Australia, elected politicians are selected by the prime minister before being sworn in by the governor-general.

5,"Bionic hand can be updated remotely anywhere, any time",Bionic hands convert electrical impulses from muscles in the upper arm into movement powered by motors in the hand.,"

Jessica Smith, a former Australian Paralympic Swimmer, applies make-up with her new bionic hand.—Reuters

 
LEEDS: Australian swi­m­mer Jessica Smith has had an uneasy relationship with prosthetics since a childhood accident, but her convictions are being challenged by a British bionic hand that can be updated remotely anywhere in the world.
The 2004 Athens Paraly­m­­pian was born without a left hand. Her parents were advised to fit a prosthesis to help with her development, but the device caused her to upset a boiling kettle when she was a toddler, causing burns to 15 per cent of her body.
“There’s always been an association between the fact this prosthetic aid didn’t actually help, it created the most traumatic event in my life,” she said.
But her curiosity was sparked when she was approached by Covvi, based in Leeds, northern England, to try its Nexus hand.
Knowing it would be an emotional challenge, Smith was fitted with the device in April at the age of 37. “I think that I was ready to try something like this,” she said.
Bionic hands convert electrical impulses from the muscles in the upper arm into movement powered by motors in the hand, enabling a user to hold a glass, open a door or pick up an egg.



 
Simon Pollard, who founded Covvi five years ago, said he wanted to add bluetooth to the device to allow the company’s specialists to update it via an app.
“The fact we can change some of the things that the customer wants remotely is a really powerful thing and a first to market,” the chief executive said.
Some rival bionic hands can be app-controlled, but Pollard said the ability to talk to a single device set the Nexus apart.
To do that anonymised data is collected for every user, a task managed by partner NetApp.
Pollard said Covvi had signed up 27 distributors glo­­b­­ally, including in Aust­ralia, China and the United States, and he aimed to increase monthly production to 100.
Smith, who is a speaker and children’s author, said Covvi was already creating new movements for her.
“I’ve had a few kids ask if I can do different hand gestures, some polite some not so polite,” she said. “I asked Covvi this morning, and I know that will be done in the next couple of hours.” She said the tech was not just changing her life, it was changing the lives of her three children.
“They think it’s amazing and I’m like half human-half robot,” she said.
She said the “bionic” appea­rance of the hand was an attraction, given her pride in difference.
“I’m not trying to hide who I am,” she said. “I’m adding and expanding on who I am by being able to access technology that’s never been available before.”
