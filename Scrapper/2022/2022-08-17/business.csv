0,Trend of rising remittances reverses in July,"Decline of 7.8pc recorded in July this year compared to the same month of the previous fiscal year, SBP data show.","KARACHI: The rising trend of remittances reversed in July when a decline of 7.8 per cent was recorded compared to the same month of the previous fiscal year, according to the data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Tuesday. 
The country received $2.523 billion in July FY23 compared to $2.736bn in July FY22, the SBP reported. The country received over $31bn in remittances in the previous fiscal year, a record high. Remittances increased by 18.4pc in June when compared to May.
The SBP said that the workers’ remittances recorded an inflow of $2.5bn during July 22, continuing their record streak of above $2bn for 26 consecutive months.
The increasing trend of remittances continued in FY22 while the new fiscal year started with a decline in remittances. Many reasons are available for this decline. 
The SBP’s data shows that remittances from almost all important destinations, with the exception of the United Kingdom (UK), declined.
In terms of growth, during July 2022, remittances decreased by 8.6pc on a month-on-month and by 7.8pc on a year-on-year basis. “This decrease largely reflected the lower number of working days in July as a result of Eid, at 17 working days compared to 22 last month and 18 in July 2021,” the SBP said.
Pakistan’s reliance on remittances for its foreign exchange has been increasing each year, despite record inflows and record exports in FY22. The import bill for FY22 for goods and services was about $84bn, which created a large trade gap and a current account deficit of $17.4bn.
This large amount of remittances, about $31bn in FY22, could not bridge the trade gap, resulting in the huge current account deficit. The policymakers slashed imports to bring a balance in trade and control the damage on the external front of the economy by minimising the current account deficit.
The massive drop of about 48pc in imports in July was not welcomed by the industry and the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association representative announced an expected decline of about $3bn in textile exports in FY23.
As a damage control measure, the government has been struggling hard for the last four months to get the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan resumed. The finance minister announced that about $4bn has been arranged, a precondition for the IMF to get approval at the board meeting scheduled to be held in the last week of August.
The SBP data shows that the highest amount was remitted from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia but was still 12pc less than in the same month of FY22. The remittances from the Kingdom were $580.6 million for July. Media reports suggest that Saudi Arabia is ready to keep $3bn in the SBP’s account to support the dwindling foreign exchange reserves of the central bank. In the past, Saudi Arabia supported Pakistan in the same way.
The second highest inflow of remittances was from the United Arab Emirates, which was about $456m, but it also fell by 16.7pc compared to the same month of last fiscal year.
The remittances from the UK, which is the only important destination for remittances, noted an increase of 3.4pc as the inflows rose to $411.7m.
The European Union countries were the fourth important destination for remittances, as they remitted $294m in July despite a decline of 2.2pc compared to the last year.
Other important sources of remittances were $254m from the United States of America and $280.6m from other Gulf Cooperation Council countries.

1,Big industry output expands 11.7pc in FY22,"Main contributors towards growth of 11.7pc are garments (3.8pc), liquids/syrups  (1.9pc) and sugar (1.7pc).","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s large-scale  manufacturing (LSM) grew 11.7 per cent year-on-year in 2021-22, the Pakistan  Bureau of Statistics reported on Tuesday.
The big industry posted  robust growth in the outgoing fiscal year mainly because of food,  textile, apparel, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, iron & steel  products, automobiles, and furniture.
The main contributors  towards overall growth of 11.7pc are garments 3.8pc, liquids/syrups  1.9pc, sugar 1.7pc, jeeps & cars 1.3pc, furniture 1.1pc, woolen  blankets 0.6pc, chemical products 0.6pc, billets/ingots 0.5pc, and  cigarettes 0.4pc.
However, on a month-on-month basis, the LSM increased by 0.2pc in June.
The  production estimation for LSM industries was made using the new base year  of 2015-16. However, as per the old base 2005-06, the LSM grew 7.7pc  year-on-year in FY22 and 14.2pc month-on-month in June. 
Since  September 2020, the LSM has rebounded after months of a downturn.  Initially, the pace was slow till December 2021 but rebounded from  January onwards.
The expansion of LSM also appeared to be broad-based, with 19 out of 22 sectors of LSM witnessing positive growth in  FY22. It is feared that high-interest rates and the depreciation of the  rupee have increased the cost of raw materials further, and economic  activity is expected to slightly slow down during the current financial  year.
During  FY22,  LSM  with  9.2pc  of  GDP  dominates  the   overall  manufacturing sector,  accounting  for  74.3pc  of  the   sectoral share  followed  by  small-scale manufacturing,  which   accounts  for  2pc of total GDP and 15.9pc sectoral share.
Textile  sector weight has the highest among all sectors of LSM.  The sector  grew by 3.5pc YoY in FY22.  Major growth originated from woollen   segment  production  with the highest  surge  of 46.3pc in   woollen  &  carpet  yarn, 38.7pc  in blankets,  and  28.5pc  in   woollen  & worsted  cloth.  Production  of  yarn  and  cloth  showed   marginal  growth  of  0.5pc  and  0.2pc,  respectively. Wearing   apparel  has  been  separated  from the textile  sector  with  6.08pc   weight showing a growth of 49.4pc. The sector has gained traction  local as well as in the international market as garments production grew at  49.4pc.
The food group having the second highest weight witnessed a  growth of 8.4pc. Sugar, bakery and chocolate & sugar confectionery,  tea blended, and starch came up with significant growth of 39.1pc, 2.5pc  and 10.8pc, respectively.
Production  of  cooking  oil  increased   by  10.9pc,  while  vegetable  ghee down  by  4.3pc.  Surging palm  oil  and  soyabean prices on the international  market coupled with the depreciating rupee were the  major factors  responsible  for a lower  level  of  production.   Wheat and milling rice output shrank 4pc during the  period under review.
Coke and petroleum products marginally grew  by 0.7pc in FY22. High global energy prices depressed the overall    growth   momentum. Besides, production of jute batching oil, jet fuel  oil, kerosene, diesel and solvent naphtha remained encouraging as demand  spurred from transportation.
The automobile sector marked a vigorous  growth of 49.4pc in FY22 while car production increased by 50.5pc, jeeps by 51pc, trucks by 52.6pc, buses by 18.8pc, and tractors by 16.2pc, respectively.
The  iron & steel production jumped by 16.3pc during the period under  review. Billets/ingots, mainly used in the construction industry, grew by  33.1pc and H/CR Sheets/Strips/Coils/plates increased by 7.4pc. Both  reflect the growth momentum in automobile and construction-allied  sectors.
Production of non-metallic mineral products rose 1pc.  The chemical products showed growth of 19.4pc.   Sulphuric  acid,  hydrochloric  acid, soda  ash,  and  toilet  soaps   remained  the  major  contributors  to the overall  growth  in  FY22.

3,"MOL finds oil, gas in KP","Encounters hydrocarbons in development well of Tolanj West-02, which has been drilled and is currently under testing phase.","KARACHI: Pakistan Oilfields Ltd (POL) told its shareholders on Tuesday that MOL Pakistan, which operates the Tal Block in Kohat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has encountered hydrocarbons in the development well of Tolanj West-02, which has been drilled and is currently under the testing phase.
In a regulatory filing, the oil and gas explorer that’s part of the consortium extracting energy from Tal Block said the operator has conducted a drill stem test (DST) at the well for isolating and testing the surrounding geological formations.
“As a result of DST… the well has tested 12.7 million standard cubic feet of gas per day, 11.3 barrels per day of condensate and 9.2 barrels per day of water,” it said, adding that the production from the well is expected to start in December. The working interest of POL is 25 per cent.
The share price of POL rose 0.33pc to Rs421.79 apiece on Tuesday.
Oil production declined 3pc year-on-year in 2021-22 to 73,420 barrels per day. Lower production from Nashpa, Adhi and Makori East oil fields besides no addition of any sizable oil field led to the annual decline in oil production, according to data compiled by Topline Securities.
Similarly, gas production went down 2pc year-on-year to 3.38 billion cubic feet per day, which was largely in line with the five-year average production decline.
Despite a flurry of discoveries in recent months, the country’s oil and gas production has been in consistent decline for many years. Crude production went down 4pc annually between 2014-15 and 2019-20. The average annual decline in gas production was 2.2pc over the same period, the latest Energy Year Book published by the Ministry of Energy shows.

4,"Imports of oil, food surge","Import bill posts double-digit growth in first month of FY23 owing to higher international prices, rupee depreciation.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s oil and eatable import bill posted a double-digit growth in the first month of the current fiscal year owing to higher international prices and massive depreciation of the rupee.
While the textile and clothing exports also grew marginally by 0.67 per cent year-on-year, showed data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday.

5,Pak Suzuki cuts prices,"Prices of various models have been reduced by Rs75,000-199,000 effective August 16.","KARACHI: Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited (PSMCL) announced on Tuesday that the prices of various models have been reduced by Rs75,000-199,000 effective August 16, citing rupee appreciation against the dollar.
The company has closed advance bookings of vehicles since July 1. The Alto VX, VXR, and AGS models now cost Rs1.699 million, Rs1.976m, and Rs2.223m, respectively.
Wagon VXR, VXL and AGS models will now cost Rs2.421m, Rs2.564m and Rs2.802m, while Cultus VXR, VXL and AGS models are now available at Rs2.754m, 3.024m and Rs3.234m.

The fall in price appears surprising as the company had raised the rates by Rs314,000-661,000 in the first week of August, linking it to the rupee devaluation against the dollar.
Pak Suzuki has also decided to temporarily shut down its car production plant from August 18-19, due to a parts shortage. In a stock filing on Tuesday, the company said the motorcycle plant would remain operational.

Major stock markets mostly rose on bets that the Federal Reserve would not lift borrowing costs by 75 basis points for a third straight time next month after decades-high inflation eased in the United States.
However,  “a slick of worry is growing about the darkening prospects for global growth as economies slow around the world, pushing down oil prices in expectation of lower demand”, noted Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst Hargreaves Lansdown.
Both main crude contracts dropped, having lost about three percent Monday, as demand expectations decline in light of a string of soft economic indicators in major economies, notably China.

7,ADB to promote transparency in borrowing practices,ADB’s support for debt sustainability will be strengthened by aligning with Sustainable Development Finance Policy principles.,"ISLAMABAD:  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved technical assistance to help promote increased sustainability and transparency in  Pakistan’s borrowing practices.
To support this overarching  objective, the assistance on a grant basis will focus on the implementation  of the Sustainable Development Finance Policy (SDFP), strengthening  fiscal risk management practices, and public debt recording, management,  and reporting.
In a report associated with the technical  assistance, the ADB said that while Pakistan’s public debt is assessed  as sustainable, macro-fiscal shocks, including changes in primary and  fiscal deficits, real interest rate movements, and exchange rate  depreciation, continue to pose a risk to debt sustainability in  Pakistan.
ADB’s support for debt sustainability will be  strengthened by aligning with the SDFP principles of the International  Development Association (IDA). One of the pillars of SDFP is a debt  sustainability enhancement programme, which creates additional  incentives for countries to move toward sustainable development  financing, the report said.

Arif Habib Ltd said investors opted to book profits, which led the index to close in the negative territory. The refining and exploration and production sectors remained in the limelight owing to the announcements of corporate results.
A key dampener was the hike in the local price of petrol along with an increase in the electricity tariffs, according to analyst Ahsan Mehanti. Dismal data of remittances, which fell 7.8 per cent in July, and public debt, which rose 23.5pc in 2021-22, also played a role in suppressing share prices.
Investors’ participation remained healthy whereas hefty volumes were observed in third-tier stocks, the brokerage added.
As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 43,436.48 points, down 185.34 points or 0.42pc from a day ago.
