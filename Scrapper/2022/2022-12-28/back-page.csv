0,Russian ultimatum to Kyiv: concede or face ‘military wrath’,"Moscow continues to bomb ""strategic"" cities; Lavrov says ""normal ties"" with US not possible.","KYIV: The Russian foreign minister has given an ultimatum to Kyiv to accept Moscow’s demands for ending the war or else suffer defeat on the battlefield.
Those demands include Ukraine recognising Russia’s conquest of a fifth of its territory. Kyiv, armed and supported by the United States and its NATO allies, has vowed to recover all occupied territory and to drive out all Russian soldiers.
“Our proposals for the demilitarisation and denazification of the territories controlled by the regime, the elimination of threats to Russia’s security emanating from there, including our new lands, are well known to the enemy,” TASS news agency quoted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying late on Monday.
“The point is simple: Fulfil them for your own good. Otherwise, the issue will be decided by the Russian army.”

Moscow continues to bomb ‘strategic’ cities; Lavrov says ‘normal ties’ with US not possible

Mr Lavrov said the US and its Nato allies together with Ukraine want to defeat Russia “on the battlefield” in order to destroy it.
“The actions of the countries of the collective West and (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky under their control confirm the global nature of the Ukrainian crisis,” Lavrov said.
“It is no secret to anyone that the strategic goal of the United States and its NATO allies is to defeat Russia on the battlefield as a mechanism for significantly weakening or even destroying our country.”
President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24, calling it a “special operation” to “denazify” and demilitarise Ukraine, which he said was a threat to Russia.
Kyiv and its Western allies say Moscow’s invasion was merely an imperialist land grab.
Mr Lavrov reiterated that Russia and the US cannot maintain a normal connection, blaming the administration of US President Joe Biden.
“It is objectively impossible to maintain normal communication with the Biden administration, which declares the infliction of a strategic defeat on our country as a goal,” he said.
He added that Washington’s “confrontational anti-Russian course is becoming more and more acute and comprehensive”.
US-Russia ties have fallen to their lowest point in decades amid the fallout from Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, and the consequent imposition of Western sanctions.
The United States has provided billions of dollars in support to Ukraine, with the latest $1.85 billion aid package announced last week, further angering Moscow.
Russian shelling
Russian forces shelled and bombed towns and cities in eastern and southern Ukraine on Tuesday. 
Reuters footage showed fires burning in a large residential building in Bakhmut, while debris littered the streets and most buildings had had their windows blown out.
Over the past 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have repelled Russian attacks in the areas of two settlements in Luhansk province and six in Donetsk, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said on Tuesday.
In his nightly video message on Monday, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky called the situation along the frontline in Donbas “difficult and painful”.
Gaining control of Bakhmut could give Russia a stepping stone to advance on two bigger cities, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.
Mr Zelensky said as a result of attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure nearly nine million people were currently without power.
Drone attack
In the latest setback that exposed gaps in Russia’s air defences, a drone believed to be Ukrainian penetrated hundreds of kilometres through Russian airspace on Monday, causing a deadly explosion at the main base for its strategic bombers.
Moscow said it had shot down the drone at its Engels air base, where three service members were killed. Ukraine did not comment, under its usual policy on incidents inside Russia. A suspected drone struck the same base on Dec. 5.

1,UN asks Taliban to revoke policies against women,"Lone protester outside Kabul varsity seeks to show ""power of a single Afghan girl"".","GENEVA: The Taliban must immediately revoke their policies targeting women and girls in Afghanistan, the UN rights chief insisted on Tuesday, condemning their ‘terrible’ consequences.
“No country can develop — indeed survive — socially and economically with half its population excluded,” Volker Turk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement.
“These unfathomable restrictions placed on women and girls will not only increase the suffering of all Afghans but, I fear, pose a risk beyond Afghanistan’s borders.” He said the policies risked destabilising Afghan society.
“I urge the de facto authorities to ensure the respect and protection of the rights of all women and girls — to be seen, to be heard and to participate in and contribute to all aspects of the social, political and economic life of the country,” said Turk.
On Saturday, the Afghan rulers banned women from working in non-governmental organisations. The Taliban have already suspended university education for women and secondary schooling for girls.

Lone protester outside Kabul varsity seeks to show ‘power of a single Afghan girl’

“This latest decree by the de facto authorities will have terrible consequences for women and for all Afghan people,” Turk said.
“Banning women from working in NGOs will deprive them and their families of their incomes, and of their right to contribute positively to the development of their country and to the well-being of their fellow citizens.” 
The move is the latest blow against women’s rights in Afghanistan since the Taliban reclaimed power last year.
“The ban will significantly impair, if not destroy” those NGOs’ capacity to deliver essential services, Turk said, calling it more distressing with Afghanistan in the grip of winter, when humanitarian needs are at their highest.
Aid work suspended Several foreign aid groups announced they were suspending their operations in Afg­h­­anistan. The international community has made respecting women’s rights a sticking point in negotiations with the Taliban government for its recognition and the restoration of aid.
“Women and girls cannot be denied their inherent rights,” said Turk. “Attempts by the de facto authorities to relegate them to silence and invisibility will not succeed.” 
Protest in Kabul 
Risking arrest, violence and social stigma, an 18-year-old Afghan student endured Taliban taunts and insults as she staged a solo protest against the ban on women attending university.
“For the first time in my life, I felt so proud, strong and powerful because I was standing against them and demanding a right that God has given us,” Marwa said while requesting anonymity.
Her sister shot a video of the silent protest with a phone from a car as Marwa held up a a placard that read “Iqra”, the Arabic word for “read”, just metres from the entrance to the Kabul University campus.
“They said really bad things to me, but I stayed calm,” she said. “I wanted to show the power of a single Afghan girl, and that even one person can stand against oppression.”

2,US blizzard causes travel chaos as death toll rises,"New York governor calls it ""blizzard of the century""; Buffalo city is the epicentre of the crisis.","BUFFALO: Temperatures were expected to moderate across the eastern and midwest United States on Tuesday, after days of freezing weather from “the Blizzard of the Century” left at least 50 dead and caused Christmas travel chaos.
However, according to a BBC report, the death toll has risen to 62.
Blizzard conditions persisted in parts of the northeastern US, the stubborn remnants of a sprawl of extreme weather that gripped the country over several days, causing widespread power outages, travel delays and deaths in nine states, according to official figures.

 





 
In New York state, authorities described ferocious conditions, particularly in Buff­alo, with hours-long whiteouts, bodies being discovered in vehicles and under snow banks, and emergency personnel going “car to car” searching for survivors.

NY governor calls it ‘Blizzard of the Century’

The perfect storm of fierce snow squalls, howling wind and sub-zero temperatures forced the cancelation of more than 15,000 US flights in recent days, including nearly 4,000 on Monday, according to tracking site Flightaware.com.
Buffalo — a city in Erie County that is no stranger to foul winter weather — is the epicentre of the crisis, buried under staggering amounts of snow.
“Certainly it is the blizzard of the century,” New York Governor Kathy Hochul told reporters, adding it was “way too early to say this is at its completion.” Hochul said some western New York towns got walloped with “30 to 40 inches (0.75 to one meter) of snow overnight.” Later on Monday, Hochul spoke with President Joe Biden, who offered “the full force of the federal government” to support New York state, and said he and First Lady Jill Biden were praying for those who lost loved ones in the storm, according to a White House statement.
Biden also approved an emergency declaration for the state, the White House said.
“Temperatures are expe­cted to moderate across the Midwest and the East over the next few days ahead of this system,” the National Weather Service said in its latest advisory early on Tuesday, but warned that “locally hazardous travel conditions” would persist.
Zero visibility
National Guard members and other teams have rescued hundreds of people from snow-covered cars and homes without electricity, but authorities have said more people remain trapped.
Drivers were being warned not to take to the roads — even as the nation reached what is usually its busiest time of year for travel.

3,Raisi vows ‘no mercy’ for ‘hostile’ opponents,"""The embrace of the nation is open to everyone, but we will show no mercy to those who are hostile,"" he says.","TEHRAN: President Ebrahim Raisi said on Tuesday Iran would show ‘no mercy’ towards ‘hostile’ opponents of the Islamic republic, gripped by more than 100 days of protests sparked by Mahsa Amini’s death.
“The embrace of the nation is open to everyone, but we will show no mercy to those who are hostile,” said President Raisi at a funeral for unidentified soldiers who perished during its eight-year war with Saddam-led Iraq in the 1980s.
“The embrace of the nation is open to all those who were lured,” he said while addressing a crowd in Tehran, accusing others of being “hypocrites, monarchists and all anti-revolutionary currents”.
Officials say hundreds of people have been killed, including members of the security forces, and thousands have been arrested nationwide in recent months. The ‘riots’, as Tehran generally refers to them, were triggered by the September 16 death in custody of Iranian-Kurdish Amini, 22, after her arrest for an alleged breach of the strict dress code for women.
Iranian officials have accused hostile foreign powers, including the United States and some European countries, of stoking the unrest. They aim “to derail the Islamic society from its high goals” by “spreading rumours and fracturing society”, said Raisi. But foreign countries are ‘wrong’ to think that would achieve their goals, Raisi argued, calling their moves ‘miscalculated’.

4,Mystery surrounds death of Russian legislator in India,"The body of Pavel Antov, 65, was found in a pool of blood outside his lodgings in eastern Odisha state.","NEW DELHI: Indian police are investigating the sudden deaths of a wealthy Russian politician who reportedly criticised the Ukraine war and his travelling companion at a luxury hotel, authorities said on Tuesday.
The body of Pavel Antov, 65, was found in a pool of blood outside his lodgings in eastern Odisha state, where he was on holiday with three other Russian nationals. His death came two days after another member of the travel party, Vladimir Bidenov, was found unconscious after suffering an apparent heart attack at the same hotel and could not be revived.
Police said they were reviewing CCTV footage, questioning hotel staff and were waiting on detailed autopsy reports, but so far there was no sign of foul play.
“All possible angles as regards to the deaths of two Russian nationals are being verified,” regional police chief Rajesh Pandit said.
Bidenov’s heart attack had likely been caused by binge drinking and a possible drug overdose, he said.
“So far it seems that Antov accidentally fell from the hotel terrace,” the police officer added.
“He was probably disturbed by the death of his friend and went to the hotel terrace and likely fell to his death from there.” 
The officer said Antov and his friends had arrived in the state in mid-December and visited several areas before arriving at their hotel in Rayagada at the start of last week.
Two local travel agents accompanying the party had also been questioned, along with the other two Russian members of the holiday group.
Antov was since 2018 a member of a regional parliament, 150 kilometres (90 miles) east of Moscow, representing President Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party.
Before entering politics, he founded the food processing enterprise Vladimirsky Standart and in 2019 he was ranked the richest among all parliamentarians and senior officials in the country by the Russian edition of Forbes magazine.
In June, Russian media published a WhatsApp message attributed to Antov that said a Kremlin missile bombardment on Ukraine was “terrorism”.
Antov took to the Russian social media network VK to deny writing the message.

5,Chinese plan trips as harsh Covid policy eases,Experts say tourism rebound in China will take time.,"BEIJING: People in China reacted with joy and rushed to plan trips abroad on Tuesday after Beijing said it would scrap mandatory Covid quarantine for overseas arrivals, ending almost three years of self-imposed isolation.
In a snap move late on Monday, China said that from January 8 inbound travellers would no longer need to quarantine, as it further unwinds hardline virus controls that had torpedoed the economy and sparked nationwide protests.
A Shanghai resident surnamed Chen said it “felt like someone has pressed the button to end the movie”, adding that her parents in Britain would be able to visit more easily. “Finally, China’s going back to normal,” she said.
Online searches for flights abroad surged on the news, with travel platform Tongcheng seeing an 850 per cent jump in searches and a 10-fold spike in enquiries about visas, according to state media reports.

Experts say tourism rebound in China will take time

On Tuesday, Chinese immigration authorities announced the gradual resumption starting January 8 of passport issuance for “tourism” or “overseas visits of friends” — suspended due to the pandemic.
And foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China would “optimise” arrangements for foreign nationals seeking to return to work, conduct business, study abroad or visit relatives.
Some entry restrictions will remain, however, with China still largely suspending the issuance of visas for overseas tourists and students.
Beijing said on Tuesday it would “continue to adjust its visa policy for foreigners visiting China in a scientific and dynamic manner in accordance with... the epidemic situation”.
But some may also face hurdles going abroad, with Japan saying it would require Covid tests on arrival for travellers from mainland China from Friday.
Tourism uptick to take time
The relaxation of rules has also raised hopes that the country’s multi-billion dollar travel business will soon flourish again, but countries longing for the return of Chinese tourists will likely face more of a wait.
China was the world’s largest outbound tourism market before COVID shut down global travel, with its overseas visitors spending $127.5 billion on travel in 2019.
Airlines are drawing up plans to expand their services, but ordinary Chinese and travel agencies suggest that a return to anything like normal will take some time.
“It’s great they announced it so I can seriously make my plans,” said Beijing exporter Tom Guo, 43. But he said he would likely wait until the late spring or even the summer before venturing abroad again.
Data from travel platform Ctrip showed that searches for popular cross-border destinations had increased 10-fold. Japan, Thailand and South Korea were among the top destinations searched on both platforms.

6,100m people forced to leave home in 2022: UN report,Russian invasion of Ukraine forced more than 7.8m Ukrainians to seek refuge across Europe.,"UNITED NATIONS: At least one hundred million people — up from some 90 million in 2021 — were forced to leave their homes in 2022, says a UN end-of-the-year report with a warning that this “record should never have been set”.
Outbreaks of violence, or protracted conflicts, were key migration factors in many parts of the world, including Ukraine, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Syria, and Myanmar, the report adds.
The statistics do not include internal displacements caused by natural disasters. At least 30 million people were displaced in Pakistan alone when unprecedented rains led to a flood of biblical proportions in the summer of 2022. People who lose their homes in these disasters are not considered “refugees” and thus are not mentioned in such reports.
The report quoted UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi as reminding the international community that “one hundred million is a stark figure — sobering and alarming in equal measure. It’s a record that should never have been set.”

Russian invasion of Ukraine forced more than 7.8m Ukrainians to seek refuge across Europe

Mr Grandi said that this dismal figure “must serve as a wake-up call to resolve and prevent destructive conflicts, end persecution, and address the underlying causes that force innocent people to flee their homes”.
The report points out that thousands of desperate migrants looked to Europe as a preferred destination, putting their lives in the hands of human traffickers, and setting off on perilous journeys across the Mediterranean. “All too often these journeys ended in tragedy,” the report warns.
According to an earlier UN report, over 3,000 people died or went missing while attempting to cross the Mediterranean and the Atlantic in 2021. Many of them were from Afghanistan and Pakistan.
An international charity group — SOS Children Villages — warned in a recent report that Children account for more than half of these refugees and they “face incredible risks and dangers including disease, malnutrition, violence, labor exploitation and trafficking”.  It points out, “While the arrival of refugees and asylum seekers in Europe and the United States has dominated the headlines and sparked heated political discussion, less developed regions host more than 85 per cent of the world’s displaced people.”
The UN report also identified the conflict zones that contributed to this unprecedented increase in forced migrations, such as Yemen, Syria, Myanmar and Ukraine.
In Yemen, a war between a Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels precipitated a humanitarian catastrophe and has forced more than 4.3 million people to leave their homes. Nearly five million children born in Syria have never known the country at peace. More than 80,000 Syrians call the huge Za’atari camp, in Jordan, home.  More than five years ago, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled their homes in Myanmar after a military campaign of persecution. Almost a million live in the vast Cox’s Bazar camp across the border in neighbouring Bangladesh.
In Ethiopia, millions remain displaced due to the armed conflict in the Tigray region, which began on Nov 3, 2020.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 forced more than 7.8m Ukrainians to seek refuge across Europe.
Mr Grandi praised European countries for their willingness to take in Ukrainians, but also pointed to “the ugly reality, that often Black and Brown people from … wars and conflicts around the world — have not received the same treatment as Ukrainian refugees”.
The UN report, however, identified at least one ray of hope in this gloomy situation: governments around the world appear willing to help. In 2022, they pledged some $1.13 billion, a record amount, to provide a lifeline to people displaced by war, violence, and human rights violations. “As a result of conflict, the climate emergency, and other crises, displaced people around the world face unprecedented needs,” said Mr Grandi. “Fortunately, generous donors continue to support them during these dire days, creating hope for a brighter future.”
