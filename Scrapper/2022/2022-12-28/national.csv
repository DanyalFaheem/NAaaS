1,Petition to stop Elahi from funding 2 Punjab districts returned,"SC says ""misconceiving, multifarious"" requests made in one petition.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has returned a petition seeking a restraining order against Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi from allocating public development funds to districts belonging to his family members, insisting that the petitioner could not identify which questions of public importance were involved in seeking the restraining order.
In the petition filed last week, Advocate Mian Dawood also requested the top court to prevent different government agencies from releasing payments to contractors or placing the public revenue at the indirect disposal of Punjab Assembly members from the constituencies belonging to the family members of the chief minister.
He highlighted that the Punjab chief minister granted his home district the status of division and then allocated over Rs100 billion for the development scheme, apparently for the two districts, i.e. Gujrat and Mandi Bahauddin.
However, a note issued by the Supreme Court’s Registrar Office on Tuesday returned the petition along with paper books for not being entertainable.

SC says ‘misconceiving, multifarious’ requests made in one petition

“That the petitioner has not pointed out as to what questions of public importance in the instant case are involved with reference to enforcement of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, so as to directly invoke jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution,” it said.
One reason in the note while returning the petition is that the petitioner had made misconceiving, multifarious prayers in one petition.
Likewise, the ingredients for invoking extraordinary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution had not been satisfied, the note said.
Besides, the notice issued to the respondents was not properly drawn as it didn’t mention what purpose this constitution petition was being filed before the apex court, and a copy of the petition was also not provided to the respondent, it said.
Moreover, the petitioner has not approached any other appropriate forum available under the law for the same relief and has also not provided any justification for not doing so.
It said the petition contained several overwriting, additions and cuttings which were not permissible.
In the petition, Mr Dawood asked the apex court to order preventing different government agencies from releasing payments to contractors or placing the public revenue at the indirect disposal of Punjab Assembly members from the constituencies belonging to the family members of the chief minister.
The petitioner argued that it was “an admitted fact” that the Punjab chief minister granted his home district the status of division and then allocated over Rs100bn for development schemes, apparently for Gujrat and Mandi Bahauddin districts.
He alleged that the chief minister had released funds to the constituencies of Chaudhry Hussain (NA-68, Gujrat-I), Moonis Elahi (NA-69, Gujrat-II), Sajid Ahmed Bhatti (PP-67, Mandi Bahauddin-III) and his own PP-430 constituency (Gujrat-III).
Mr Dawood had also requested the court to declare as unconstitutional the allocation of disproportionate funds to the constituencies of the chief minister and his family members, besides ruling that the allocation or reappropriation through supplementary or excess grants of funds in the constituencies and the projects have been initiated in violation of the principle of transparency, good governance and procurement laws.
He had also sought a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) investigation into the alleged violation of constitutional provisions and procurement laws.
The petitioner also requested the apex court to direct NAB or any other agency to launch an investigation against those responsible for violation of constitutional provisions and principles of transparency and procurement laws and causing loss or damage to the public exchequer.
“It turns out that 70 per cent of the funds are for the constituencies belonging to the family of the incumbent chief minister,” the petition contended, adding that the allocation of funds by masquerading them as supplement grants was in addition to the non-developmental expenditures to be incurred on building paraphernalia for all divisional offices in Gujrat.
The petition said it had been reported that Punjab’s total development budget for the 2022-23 fiscal year stood at around Rs700bn, of which a sizeable portion went to Gujrat division comprising four small districts of Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad and Hafizabad and the lion’s share was kept within the two families.
The major beneficiaries from Gujrat are the constituencies of Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, his son Moonis, and Hussain, the son of Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain.
The petitioner cited the Punjab chief secretary, secretaries of finance and planning and development departments, the Planning and Development Board chairman, Accountant General Office and NAB as respondents.

2,Reporters win UK defamation case,"The court has awarded legal costs and damages of around GBP 75,000 to the two London-based journalists.","LONDON: A UK high court has awarded legal costs and damages of around GBP 75,000 to two London-based journalists after settling a defamation case in their favour.
The claimants had filed the lawsuit against two individuals and a law firm after they were accused of corruption, violence and hooliganism in a press release circulated via social media.
The defamation suit was initiated in 2019 after solicitor Ajaz Ahmed, his firm Pure Legal Solicitors, and Raja Usman Arshad held a press conference in London relating to the murder of British national Barrister Fahad Malik, who was gunned down in Islamabad in 2016. 
Mr Arshad is the son of Raja Arshad, the main accused in the murder case.
At the start of the press conference, a group of protesters disrupted the event and accused Mr Arshad and the firm of covering up the murder. 
In the aftermath of the press conference, Mr Ahmed and Mr Arshad circulated a press release via Whatsapp and other social media platforms in which they accused the journalists of orchestrating the protest on behalf of the slain barrister’s brother.
The UK High Court’s Mrs Justice Collins Rice ruled that Murtaza Ali Shah, the UK correspondent of Geo News and The News International, and his brother Mujtaba Ali Shah, a Hum News reporter in London, were defamed by the defendants.
In their statement after the verdict, the two journalists said the case highlighted the harassment, false allegations and threats that journalists face on a daily basis for merely doing their jobs.

6,"‘Benazir stood for democracy, economic justice’",Bilawal terms terrorism and dictatorship ‘two sides of same coin’,"LARKANA: PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Tuesday said his mother and former prime minister Benazir Bhutto stood for democracy and economic justice in the country and fearlessly fought against terrorists.
Speaking at a massive public meeting at Garhi Khuda Bukhsh in connection with the 15th anniversary of her passing, the PPP chairman challenged those who killed his mother to come and see the mammoth crowd that had gathered for her, to see that their designs to stop her mission had failed.. 
He eulogised the unmatched services of late PPP founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, saying he gave the country the Constitution of 1973 while his mother Benazir Bhutto continued struggle for 30 years for restoration of democracy in the country.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said this massive gathering had proved that Ms Bhutto’s political workers, brothers and sisters still remember and loved her, adding that they still followed the guidelines Ms Bhutto had outlined. 

Bilawal terms terrorism and dictatorship ‘two sides of same coin’

He said Ms Bhutto was world class leader, the first lady prime minister of the Muslim world and the voice of the masses. 
The PPP leader said the slain prime minister used to be respected wherever she went in the world and was keenly heard by parliamentarians whenever she visited the United States.
The foreign minister said that Ms Bhutto believed that terrorism and dictatorship were two sides of the same coin and that was the reason she fought against terrorism and extremism. 
‘Bury politics of hatred’
“She believed in the politics of hope and not hatred,” he said, adding that it was our responsibility to follow her philosophy of politics of tolerance. 
He expressed the hope that the people would help bury the politics of hatred and lie. “We have to bury the politics of lies. With the arm of truth, we will reject the politics of puppets,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari said.
On this occasion, the PPP leader also criticised PTI chairman Imran Khan and said that like retired Gen Pervez Mushrraf, the PTI leader had now become history and he had no future. 
He also paid tribute to military’s personnel who were embracing martyrdom in the fight against terrorism, adding that due to their sacrifices peace and order had been established in the country.
Referring to the flood devastation in Sindh and other parts of the country, the PPP chairman said that it was the worst catastrophe the country had witnessed.  
He deplored at a time when one-third of the country was submerged by floodwaters, a fight was going on for the Takht-i-Lahore and the drama of long march to Islamabad was being staged on GT Road.
He said the floods had caused $30 billion losses, 10 per cent of the GDP was lost in floodwaters, and more than 30 million flood victims, including 16 million children and 6 million pregnant women, were still waiting for aid. The infrastructure of 50 per cent educational institutions in Sindh has been affected, he said. 
The foreign minister said that the World Bank had decided to give a loan of $2 billion for rehabilitation of flood-hit people in Sindh.
He said land reforms would soon be introduced in the province, as he had discussed it with the Sindh chief minister. Besides, he said interest-free loans would be provided to flood victims in Sindh for the reconstruction of their houses and those without homes would be given home ownership rights.
Sanam Bhutto, Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari and senior PPP leaders from the four provinces, AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan also attended the public meeting.

7,PAC orders recovery of Rs45.7m from ‘absconding’ HEC scholars,Six PhD scholars went abroad on the government-funded Faculty Development Programme but never returned.,"ISLAMABAD: The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Tuesday directed the Higher Education Commission (HEC) to recover Rs45.7 million from six absconding PhD scholars.  
The Auditor General of Pakistan has pointed out in an audit report on the HEC that six PhD scholars — Khurram Nadeem, Amna Shehzad, Noshaba Batool, Saima Ashfaq Khan, Saleem Jehangir and Qamar Sultan Gohar — went abroad on the government-funded Faculty Development Programme (FDP) but never returned.  
The FDP had been designed for capacity enhancement of universities selected by the HEC to encourage and reward the existing faculty for developing their teaching skills in key areas of their expertise. They were given scholarship in the disciplines of physics, applied physics, business administration, mathematics and statistics at educational institutions in Canada and the United Kingdom.  
The audit report states: “During the scrutiny of records, it was observed that professors were sent abroad for PhD and fee/stipend was paid from FDP programme. The management of the university explained that the matter was referred to the National Accountability Bureau for investigation.”  
HEC Executive Director Shaista Sohail informed the PAC that NAB had suggested filing legal suit against these professors in a court of law.  
She said the HEC had filed a case for the recovery of the said amount from these absconding scholars and the matter was sub judice.  
PAC Chairman Noor Alam Khan asked the HEC to expedite the process for the recovery of the amount from these scholars.  
PAC member Barjis Tahir suggested that the Federal Investigation Agency should issue their red warrants and initiate the proceedings for bringing the absconding scholars back to Pakistan.

8,Federal govt buildings to shift to solar power by April: PM,"• Shehbaz says conversion a first step towards generating 10,000MW of solar power  • Blames PTI govt for creating bureaucratic","

PM Shehbaz Sharif addresses the conference on Tuesday.—PPI

 
• Shehbaz says conversion a first step towards generating 10,000MW of solar power
• Blames PTI govt for creating bureaucratic inertia ‘through NAB witch-hunt’
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday vowed to convert all government buildings in the country to solar power, starting from those belonging to federal government entities by April to save 300 to 500 megawatts per month and slash the import bill hovering around $27 billion a year.
Speaking at a solarisation conference in Islamabad, the premier also blamed all previous governments in the last 30 years — that include at least two terms of his brother and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif — for “unbridled circular debts” in the power sector that have escalated to Rs2.5 trillion.
He said that in view of the prevailing economic crisis in the country, the time had come to make long overdue reforms, for which he said bureaucrats had to rejuvenate themselves to serve the nation and clear official files without any fear of NAB.
“Due to lack of responsibility and reforms, the circular debt in the power sector has become a monster and all previous governments of the last 30 years are responsible for it,” the prime minister told the participants. “The circular debt has become four times bigger than our development funds of Rs700 billion.”
The prime minister said that under the energy-saving plan, all the federal government ministries, departments, authorities and their offshoots in the provinces would immediately shift to solar energy in the next four months.
He said it would be a model for provincial governments as the federal government would not make additional expenditures over the solarisation process.
He said the entire process would be conducted through a transparent bidding via a third party. He urged chief ministers to emulate the centre’s pattern and introduce solar systems in their provinces and assured the federal government’s complete assistance in this regard.
The prime minister said that the process for generating 10,000MW solar power in the country had already started and such a conversion by the federal government buildings would be the first phase.
Criticising PTI Chairman Imran Khan for keeping bureaucracy under “threat” through what he called a “NAB-Niazi (Imran Khan) nexus”, the premier said government officers had faced undue NAB action and humiliation for committing corruption that the anti-graft watchdog “could not prove”.
He said NAB had made a “baseless case” against 56 companies he formed in Punjab for development projects but failed to prove corruption even after a lapse of five years.
he agreed that the nation was suffering from unprecedented inflation and admiring citizens for bearing the hard times, but added the government had no other option but to go to the IMF.
“The PTI government had backed out of the IMF programme and brought the country to the verge of economic destruction and that is why the IMF does not trust us,” he said.
The prime minister said that during the Covid pandemic, gas prices crashed to a record low of $2 per unit, but the then government “committed criminal negligence” by not securing its import and due to which the whole nation was suffering now.
He said that during former PM Nawaz Sharif’s last tenure, a 15-year agreement for buying LNG at 13.2 per cent of Brent crude oil was reached with Qatar, but unfortunately, it was politicised by the subsequent government.
Currently due to the global situation, gas was not available while the fuel was being sold at an exorbitant price in the global market, he said, adding that they would have to convert to solar and renewable energy with lightning speed.
The PM said that during the previous PML-N government, efforts were made to generate cheap hydroelectricity, and land worth Rs100 billion was acquired to build the Bhasha dam, but those were long-term measures to generate affordable power in the country. He said that under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, power projects were completed by the PML-N government in 2015 to overcome crippling power outages.
