Ghulam Haider, a resident of Naya Adalat Garha in Sialkot, had submitted an application to the police on Nov 5, 2008, that unidentified armed men had shot and killed his transgender son, Mazhar Hussain alias Jura, along with two friends, identified as Aamir Shahzad and Abdul Jabbar alias Jhara.  
The Ugoki police had registered a first information report of the murder against unidentified persons.  
The police investigated the blind murder and found Ahmed Bilal Cheema responsible for shooting dead the three transgender persons over an argument. However, the suspect fled to the US in January 2009.  
According to police sources, Cheema is the son of former provincial minister Ajmal Cheema and nephew of former Sialkot district nazim Muhammad Akmal Cheema. When the suspect voluntarily returned to Pakistan in July this year, the Sialkot police arrested him at the airport. They completed the investigation report and submitted it in court along with the evidence.  
On Dec 24, Sialkot District and Sessions Judge Jazila Aslam sentenced Cheema to death on three counts and ordered payment of compensation worth Rs500,000 to the relatives of each of the victims.

1,Most tall buildings in Lahore unsafe,"Survey finds 495 of 605 high-rises without firefighting, safety arrangements.","LAHORE: Most of the high-rises in Lahore are not safe to live in or work as a recent survey of the city district found that 495 of the 605 high-rises (having 50 feet and above height) don’t have adequate firefighting and safety arrangements. 
This was found out when a joint team of the city’s civic agencies surveyed 605 buildings and reported the issue to the deputy commissioner in a meeting here on Tuesday. 
The participants in the meeting expressed concerns at the situation and sought provision of the firefighting and safety arrangements in 495 buildings. They also asked the departments concerned, especially the Punjab Emergency Department (Rescue 1122) and other civic agencies to carry out a survey of the all marriage halls and marquees in the city and ensure arrangements for safety of the public. 
“We need to carry out a comprehensive survey of all marriage halls, marquees etc too since many people visit there to attend events. Therefore, the emergency department’s Lahore team, respective assistant commissioners and marriage halls association representatives must start surveys of such premises with immediate effect,” Lahore DC Muhammad Ali said while addressing the meeting. 

Survey finds 495 of 605 high-rises without firefighting, safety arrangements

He directed the authorities concerned to also ensure safety arrangements in all teaching hospitals of Lahore in line with the safety standards and relevant regulations. He was also of the view that the survey of all city markets should also be conducted after completion of the marriage halls. 
“The staff deputed at marriage halls, markets, high-rises and other business premises must be imparted training in the first aid and helping the authorities in rescue and evacuation operations ,” Mr Ali said, adding that the public at large should also be given awareness on plugging gas leakage and other measures to minimize the possibility of fire eruption. 
“All buildings falling in category (D) — which means most dangerous — must be brought in category (A) — safe premises,” the DC said. 
The meeting was attended by the representatives of Rescue 1122, Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), Traffic Engineering Planning Authority (Tepa), Lahore Development Authority (LDA) and others concerned. 
On the other hand, District Emergency Officer Shahid Waheed says that the meeting was held to sensitise the participants of the Punjab Emergency Community Safety Act-2022 approved by the Punjab Assembly recently. 
“This act provides a series of safety standards that must be followed in all buildings, especially where the people are living in apartments and the areas where vertical building growth is being promoted,” he explained while talking to Dawn on Tuesday. 
He said the participants decided to take strict action by ensuring safety arrangements in all buildings under the new act. He said it was time to implement the new act in letter and spirit in a bid to avert the fire incidents in the city buildings since many people had lost their lives due to such tragic incidents in the past. 
Mr Waheed said that under the act, all buildings were now required to get safety certificates from the emergency department.  
“If anyone (owner of the building) avoids getting this certificate by not ensuring provision of safety arrangements, he/she would be penalised under the law,” he warned. 
SQUAD: Lahore Waste Management Company chief executive officer Ali Anan Qamar inaugurated the anti-littering squad to further improve the beauty of the provincial capital and ensure cleanliness.  
“The squad would be responsible to make GPO Chowk, Naqi Market, Dulha Market, Panorama Centre and the Electronics Market as litter-free,” he said while speaking on the occasion. He said in the first phase, the anti-littering squad would work on the Mall Road and Canal Road. The anti-littering squad would collect shopping bags and wrappers from the greenbelts and roadside.  
“It would also collect the garbage picked up from the roadside in separate bins,” Mr Qamar added. The squad, he said, would spread awareness among people about littering.  
“Those who throw garbage and wrappers on the road will also be fined by this squad with the help of the cameras of the safe city authority,” he added.  
Moreover, a three-bin system has been installed at 39 points in the city for waste segregation. Initially, it had been made operational at the Liberty Market, Barkat Market, Main Market, G-1 Market, Samanabad Moon Market, Karim Block Market, Shalimar Link Road and GT Road. Tri-color bins have also been installed at Chauburji Chowk, Daroghawala Chowk and Shouk Chowk.  
“Garbage segregation will help us in recycling,” he added.

3,High court moved for removal of governor,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) has been asked to order the president and the prime minister to remove Punjab...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) has been asked to order the president and the prime minister to remove Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman for ‘unconstitutionally’ directing Chief Minister Parvez Elahi to seek a vote of trust from the house.
Mian Shabbir Ismail, a lawyer by profession, stated in a writ petition that the governor violated the Constitution by asking the chief minister for a vote of confidence and that too without any reasonable justification.
The petition filed through Advocate Azhar Siddique further contended that the order passed by the governor was not only against the mandate of the Constitution but also against the principles of democracy and the fundamental rights of the assembly members.
It pointed out that the relevant provision of the Constitution and the rules of the Punjab Assembly did not provide a reasonable time to the chief minister in case the governor instructed him to seek the vote of confidence. 
It argued that Article 136 of the Constitution and the rule 22 of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of Punjab, 1997 needed to be interpreted by applying the principle of reading down by allowing a minimum time for taking a vote of confidence.  
The petition asked the court to declare the orders passed by the governor for summoning of the session of the assembly during an ongoing session and requiring the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence unconstitutional and void.
It further asked the court to order the president and the prime minister to remove the governor for not only transgressing his powers and authority but also violating various constitutional provisions and the rules of the assembly.
The petitioner asked the court to take up the petition during the winter vacation as there was urgency in the matter.

4,Damages case: SC hears Imran’s counsel against plea dismissal,LAHORE: The Supreme Court on Tuesday heard initial arguments of former prime minister Imran Khan’s counsel against...,"LAHORE: The Supreme Court on Tuesday heard initial arguments of former prime minister Imran Khan’s counsel against a dismissal of his petition by the Lahore High Court challenging seizure of his right to file objections to the interrogatories of PM Shehbaz Sharif in a defamation suit against the former.
Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, the counsel for Khan, argued that the trial court unlawfully struck the right of the petitioner to answer the interrogatories of the respondent (Shehbaz). He said the trial court exercised its suo motu powers to seize the right of the petitioner to file objections.
Advocate Mustafa Ramday appeared on behalf of the prime minister and argued that the trial court passed the decision after the petitioner failed to file his reply despite repeated opportunities.
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, who was heading a three-member bench, asked the petitioner’s counsel why did he not file the reply on four hearings before the trial court.
The judge observed that the trial court might have got an impression that the petitioner was using delaying tactics.  
Barrister Zafar said the trial court was asked for a time after Khan sustained injuries in the Wazirabad attack.
The SC will resume hearing on Wednesday (today).
PM Shehbaz filed a suit for recovery of Rs10bn as damages for defamation from Khan in 2017 for accusing the former of offering him Rs10bn through a common friend in exchange for withdrawing the case of Panama Papers pending before the Supreme Court.
Khan filed a contesting statement before the trial court and Shehbaz filed his interrogatories, a copy of which was handed over to the petitioner’s (Khan) counsel for filing answer to the same. The petitioner instead of filing answers to the interrogatories, filed objections to the interrogatories. 
The trial court overruled the objections being filed beyond the stipulated period.
The trial court overruling the objections of Khan directed him to file answers to the interrogatories of the respondent. However, the petitioner did not file the answers. Resultantly, his right of defence was struck by the trial court. 
The LHC on Dec 7 dismissed a petition of Khan against the decision of the trial court.

5,Wedding photo shoot at King Edward Medical University draws outrage,"University spokesperson says couple did not seek prior permission, enter premises after it was closed.","LAHORE: A newlywed couple had their wedding photo shoot on the premises of the King Edward Medical University (KEMU), drawing criticism of the university management for allowing the activity in an educational institute. 
The issue surfaced when the wedding pictures and footage were uploaded on social media, showing the over 150-year-old building of the KEMU in the background. The clips and photos showed the couple visiting the corridors and other parts of the historical building to film the ‘wedding activities’. 

 





 
People trolled the university management on social media, saying the KEMU was not a ‘tourist attraction’ or a place for the wedding photo shoot. They also criticised it for poor security arrangements as some of them commented if a newlywed couple could breach the security of the public sector medical university what would happen in case of the entry of the ‘suspects’. The KEMU administration took notice of the photo shoot. 
A spokesperson for the university said no permission was sought from the regulator for the shoot and claimed the couple and photographers had entered the university after it was closed.
“The guards have been found involved in letting them in,” the spokesperson said, adding the administration was also probing CCTV footage for further action.

6,Patients suffer in Jinnah management-medics tussle,LAHORE: The Jinnah Hospital is struggling to overcome the tension in its air for two weeks reportedly due to the...,"LAHORE: The Jinnah Hospital is struggling to overcome the tension in its air for two weeks reportedly due to the undue interference of the Punjab health secretary following re-allocation of a highly-equipped orthopaedic unit to a senior doctor allegedly in violation of the policy.  
Disputes surfaced after some ‘controversial’ decisions were taken after the retirement of professor of orthopaedics, Dr Tehseen Riaz, on Sept 11, who was heading Orthopaedic Unit-I of the hospital. The unit was said to be the first such facility in any public sector hospital of the province that also offered sports-related surgery, as well as knee and hip joint replacements for free.  
The institute’s Orthopaedic Unit-II was headed by Prof Dr Sajjad Ahmad Goraya and lacked proper equipment and facilities.  
Around two weeks after the retirement of Prof Riaz, the management had issued a notification on Sept 23 to declare the 50-bed unit-I as unit-II, and vice versa. However, as per the arrangement, the respective premises of both facilities, including faculty members, staff, equipment and other assets, would remain intact.  
According to the notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Dr Goraya was announced head of the newly declared unit-I (previously unit-II) and associate professor Dr Javed Hassan Raza Khan head of the ‘renamed’ unit-II. The notification was issued by the Allama Iqbal Medical College (AIMC) principal following approval of the institute’s Board of Management.  
An official said all was well until a few months later, the management, going against its own arrangement, displaced the entire faculty of unit-II (previously unit-I) along with the patients under treatment there. Not only were the premises switched, but a new notification was issued on Dec 23, making Prof Goraya head of both the units, a move that further mounted the agitation.  
The official said the institute took these decisions after Punjab Health Secretary Dr Ahmed Javed Qazi visited the hospital twice and directed the AIMC principal to facilitate Prof Dr Goraya, who was his class-fellow at King Edward Medical University (KEMU).  
Not only this, the hospital also shifted the postgraduate students inducted for training at the previous Orthopaedic Unit-I to unit-II. It unlocked the classrooms, and issued an order to hand over the large stock of artificial joints -- allocated to what was now unit-II -- to the staff of the other ward.  
This interference of the health secretary sparked off protests among the staff of unit-II. They called out the hospital management over the “violation” of laid down policy and refused to work at the newly assigned unit. They also reached the health secretariat two days ago and lodged a protest. 
The official said the health secretary called an emergency meeting of the senior medics and formed a committee to resolve the dispute. The protesters however said they were ready to be terminated or dismissed, but not work under the current circumstances.  
Talking to Dawn, Health Secretary Dr Javed Ahmad Qazi said on Tuesday he had visited the hospital twice at the request of Prof Goraya, who wanted to head the unit previously held by Prof Riaz. 
“It was a fundamental right of the senior doctor to work in a better environment and there was no harm in letting him do so,” he claimed, adding he did so to resolve the matter to ensure uninterrupted healthcare to the patients of both orthopaedic units. 
“The medics from Prof Riaz’s unit visited my office to express their grievance and I suggested they focus on healthcare instead of being involved in politics,” Dr Qazi stated.  
In an attempt to resolve the matter, he had visited the hospital again on Tuesday and directed the AIMC principal to rotate the medics of both units to allow them all equal opportunity of working in a better environment.  
AIMC Principal Prof Dr Nadeem Hafeez Butt claimed the institute had combined both units under the command of Prof Goraya until the appointment of a new head of the previously unit I, and owing to a shortage of orthopaedic medics in the province.

7,Call for workers to launch political movement to protect rights,LAHORE: The participants in a national convention on Tuesday urged the workers to forge unity among their ranks to...,"LAHORE: The participants in a national convention on Tuesday urged the workers to forge unity among their ranks to win and protect their rights. They also called for launching a political movement with cooperation of trade unions to safeguard the downtrodden of the society from exploitation by the ruling elite and capitalists.
The convention on labour rights was held under the aegis of the Labour Education Foundation.
The Pakistan Kissan Rabita Committee’s Farooq Tariq, All Pakistan Labour Federation, Balochistan’s Sultan Khan, South Asia Partnership’s Irfan Mufti, Labour Education Foundation Director Khalid Malik, textile workers’ leader Niaz Khan, home-based workers’ representatives Shazia Tariq from Lahore and Tahmina from Charsadda participated in the convention.
Farooq Tariq criticised the mainstream political parties for damaging the national economy and ignoring the plight of workers during their tenures in power. He added that the workers must start their political struggle.
Sultan Khan said blaming others for miseries of workers would do no good to them and they would have to see their own faults behind their predicament.
Niaz Khan lamented out of 70m workers only 2.7m were registered with the Social Security and other state institutions and of them only 0.6m had social security cards.
Irfan Mufti said out of Rs6,500bn national budget, the workers would get only Rs40bn while their hard work was contributing around Rs5,000bn to the economy in the form of taxes.
Khalid Mahmood acknowledged there was need for forging unity among various trade unions but added that the workers needed to be organised first of all before putting pressure on trade union leaders to get united on a single platform.
Haneef Ramay, a senior trade union leader, demanded that all workers should be paid wages through the bank accounts as an evidence of employment and that they were paid at officially notified rates/wages.
Progressive Labour Federation president Rana Hassan lamented that the Balochistan High Court had disallowed trade unions in government departments. He feared that if upheld by the Supreme Court, the verdict would annihilate trade unions from the country. 
Azam Khan Zarqoon, a lawyer from Balochistan, said the judges always served the ruling class as there was no independent judiciary anywhere in the world.
Aslam Maraj, Power Loom and Textile Workers leader from Faisalabad, said weak trade unions were a major reason for the predicament of workers as only a few people had been left to raise voice for their cause.
Ayesha Ahmed announced that the Haqooq Khalq Party would soon prepare a charter of demands for trade unions.
HRCP co-director Tahira Habib said the HRCP was ready to hold a consultation for developing a joint charter of demands.
Shazia Tariq said women workers were safe nowhere and those who raised voice against it were sacked from their jobs.
Urging the government to make a policy followed by a law to recognise HBWs as industrial workers, she threatened to come out on roads if the HBWs demands were not met.
Abrarullah, the president of Mehnatkash Labour Federation, KP, lamented that lack of leadership was failing workers and trade unions. 
He said capitalists had made their federations but the workers were unorganised and if there was any trade union then it was not functional.
Muhammad Shabbir, general secretary of Pakistan Bhatta Mazdoor Union, said that years were consumed in making pro-worker laws but rules under the relevant laws were not framed for decades, depriving the workers of benefits of these pieces of legislat

According to officials, three passengers were to board a Saudi Arabia-bound flight when during checking an amount of $60,000 was recovered from their luggage. 
A case has been registered against them.
Meanwhile, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) arrested a man for his alleged involvement in illegal currency business in Dera Ghazi Khan.
According to a spokesperson, suspect Abdul Sattar was running a business of hawala and hundi.  
The FIA recovered Rs5.7m and 2,900 Saudi riyals from his possession.
A case has been registered against him under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1947.
The FIA recently launched a campaign against those involved in illegal currency business and its smuggling.
The Lahore division FIA launched a crackdown on the persons involved in illegal currency business and arrested 50 suspects during this month. It nabbed the suspects from different parts of Lahore, Gujranwala and Gujrat and recovered a huge amount of foreign and local currency from them.
“The action against those involved in illegal currency business – hawala and hundi – has served as deterrence to the practice. It will also encourage the people to send remittances through a legal channel – banking,” FIA Lahore Director Sarfraz Virk had told Dawn.

10,Reforms suggested to outlaw domestic child labour,LAHORE: The government and civil society agreed to jointly push for legislative reform to outlaw child domestic...,"LAHORE: The government and civil society agreed to jointly push for legislative reform to outlaw child domestic labour in Punjab by amending the child protection law.  
This was finalised in the first meeting of the Provincial Coordination Forum, jointly established by Search for Justice and National Commission for Human Rights, Punjab. The forum was established to review the current legal and administrative framework for dealing with the issues of child domestic labour in Punjab and to recommend legislative and administrative measures to the provincial government to effectively prohibit the practice.  
The speakers were of the view that since the enactment of The Punjab Domestic Workers Act in 2019, not even a single case has been registered against anyone over the contravention of Section 3 of the law. From 2019-22, the government has been unable to establish clear mechanisms to receive complaints if someone employed a child under 15 years of age in accordance with the domestic workers law. This was evident to establish that there was a dire need to review the legal instruments with primary consideration to secure best interest of the child.  
Syed Miqdad Mehdi, a legal expert on child rights, shared that the legislatures and executives must see the issue through the lense of child protection and not labour. In the current legal environment, the police registered a first information report under Section 328-A of the Pakistan Penal Code where a child domestic labourer faced physical violence by their employers.  
In that case, despite all the efforts by the police, Child Protection and Welfare Bureau and civil society organisations, a culprit immediately got relief as the offence “cruelty to child” was bailable and compoundable. Such an offence must be non-bailable and non-compoundable for setting deterrence through the law.  
Nadeem Ashraf, a member/commissioner of the National Commission for Human Rights (Punjab), highlighted the need to strengthen interdepartmental coordination among relevant government departments and civil society organisations for a robust and efficient response to rescue and recover child domestic labourers, victims of violence and abuse.  
Child Protection and Welfare Bureau Chairperson Sarah Ahmad endorsed the suggestion to bring the issue of child domestic labour under the purview of ‘The Punjab Destitute and Neglected Children Act’. She mentioned that the bureau would initiate drafting of an amendment that would be introduced in the assembly after consultations with relevant stakeholders, including government, domestic workers union, civil society organisation and parliamentarians.
