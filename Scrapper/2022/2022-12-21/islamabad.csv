0,ECP refuses to postpone local govt polls in Islamabad,Insists elections to be held as per schedule; PML-N leader says govt bound to follow order.,"ISLAMABAD: A day after the federal government moved to delay local bodies elections in the capital on the pretext of an increase in the number of union councils, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) said the elections would be held as per schedule on Dec 31.
A day earlier, following the decision of the federal government, the interior ministry immediately issued a letter increasing number of seats from 101 to 125. This increase in the UCs required new delimitations – a process that could take several months to complete. However, the election watchdog termed the said letter against the election law and rejected it.
“The Election Commission in exercise of its power under Articles 140-A (2), Article 218, (3) Article 219(d) and Article 222 of the Constitution read with Section 219 of Elections Act, 2017 and all other enabling provisions of law hereby decides to continue elections process notwithstanding the notification dated 19-12-2022 issued by the federal government as the said notification is in violation of Section 4 (4) of the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government Act, 2015,” read the ECP’s order.
The said order was signed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja and ECP members Shah Mohammad Jatoi, Nisar Ahmed Durrani and retired Justice Ikramullah Khan.

Insists elections to be held as per schedule; PML-N leader says govt bound to follow order

The order further said: “All the steps comprising filling of nomination papers, scrutiny of nomination papers, decision by appellate tribunals, finalisation of candidates, allotment of symbols, completion of polling scheme, appointment and training of polling staff and printing of ballot papers have been completed and stage is now set for poll on 31-12-2022,” it read.
A day earlier, PTI leaders Asad Umar, Fawad Chaudhry, Ali Nawaz Awan and Raja Khurram Nawaz lashed out at the PML-N government for attempting to delay elections and said the government after sensing defeat at the hands of PTI candidates in Islamabad was trying to get the elections postponed.
Decision welcomed
After the ECP decision, PTI leader Ali Nawaz Awan tweeted that PML-N’s attempt of escaping from the election process has been thwarted and now the PTI will force them to run on Dec 31, he said, adding that all candidates of PTI should continue their campaign with fervour.
Speaking to Dawn, he said the PTI would win the majority of seats and its candidate would become the mayor since the former ruling party had launched major development works in Islamabad, from the construction of interchanges to streets.
On the other hand, PML-N’s former federal minister and MNA from Islamabad Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry told Dawn that the government was bound to follow the ECP order.
“We will participate in elections in a befitting manner and we will win a majority of seats to elect our mayor as we did in the 2015 elections,” he said.
Asked why the government tried to get the elections postponed, he said: “We actually wanted that election should be held on the basis of new delimitations and the new act to have a vibrant and modern local government system.”
Dr Chaudhry said the PTI during its tenure could not complete any development work in Islamabad and it was the PML-N that executed major development work in the federal capital and many of the schemes were in progress.
“So based on our development works and performance, we will comfortably win these elections,” he said.
Former PML-N deputy mayor Syed Zeeshan Naqvi also expressed similar views. He said there would be no setback for his party after the ECP decision. “Our campaign is in full swing,” he added.
Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) Information Secretary Islamabad Sajjad Abbasi said his party welcomed ECP’s decision and termed the government’s decision to delay elections ‘mala fide’.
It is relevant to note here that the local government completed its tenure in February last year. As per rules, new elections should have been held within 120 days after expiry of tenure. The ECP earlier this year had decided to hold elections earlier and schedule was also issued, fixing July 31 as polling day.
However, the PML-N and other parties filed a petition in Islamabad High Court (IHC), pleading that instead of holding elections on 50 union councils (UCs), the number of UCs should be increased up to 101. To this, the IHC ordered for holding elections on 101 UCs and the ECP conducted new delimitation before issuing a new schedule, under which elections are to be held on Dec 31.

IHC’s two member bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan will hear his petition on Wednesday (today).

The maximum numbers of fake transactions to the Shehbaz family had been made through Al-Zarooni Exchange of Dubai. 
Earlier, last week, IHC granted protective bail to PM’s son Salman Shehbaz.

2,Protesting BISP employees want demands fulfilled by today,ISLAMABAD: Employees of Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) continued their protest for the second day on...,"ISLAMABAD: Employees of Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) continued their protest for the second day on Tuesday, blocking the entrance to their head office and demanding job security.
The protesters gathered in the federal capital from all over the country to highlight their issues. They marched from the BISP Head Office to the Parliament house.
Leaders of BISP Employees Coordination Committee Syed Fida Abbas, Sardar Azmat and Sardar Shiraz addressed the employees in front of the Parliament house and said the employees had been protesting for 19 days and the BISP head office was locked, but none of the senior management including its chairperson Shazia Atta Marri, paid any heed to their issues.
The employees criticised the top management of the programme claiming that show-cause notices had been issued against the protesting employees who were only demanding their legal rights.
Fida Abbas said the BISP was the only institution in the country on the basis of whose performance, every member of the National Assembly (MNA) and senator got votes from their constituencies.
He said while the government talked about success of the BISP and lauded the head of this institution, Ms Marri, the fact was that every institution was a success because of its employees.
The key demands of the protesting employees was promotion from scales 1 to 19, permanence of contingent employees, repatriation of four designated deputation officers to their institutions and immediate withdrawal of all retaliatory actions made by the top management against protesting employees.
The employees announced that if their demands were not met by Wednesday (today) they would hold a protest outside Zardari House in F-8.

4,Elections to be held in Oct 2023 on basis of digital census: minister,"""Government will not take any step which makes the whole election process controversial,"" says Ahsan Iqbal.","ISLAMABAD: Minister for Planning Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal on Tuesday reiterated that the next general elections would be held in Oct 2023 based on the 7th digital population and housing census 2022.
Addressing digital media influencers, the minister said the last general elections were held on the basis of an old census and the province of Sindh had conditionally agreed to hold the elections in 2023 based on fresh digital census.
“Therefore, the government will not take any step which makes the whole election process controversial,” Mr Iqbal said, adding that in April 2023, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) would formally hand over the digital census results to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and subsequently the commission would take four months for delimitation.
The minister recalled that former prime minister Imran Khan had endorsed the Council of Common Interest’s (CII) decision to hold the next elections based on fresh digital census.
He also added that due to recent floods, which had badly affected two provinces, the elections were not possible before Oct 2023.
“What message will go to the flood-affected people if elections are announced before the completion of the incumbent government’s term,” said the minister while referring to Imran Khan’s demand to hold early polls.
“He has been demanding immediate elections ever since his government was removed through a vote of no-confidence in March this year, but this is an unfair demand,” he said.
Referring to a fabricated story published in Daily Mail against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the minister said the premier immediately took action against the newspaper as a result they tendered an apology.
He said since the government came into power, several projects had been started which were stopped by the previous government as during the last four years no progress was made on CPEC projects.
“The incumbent government has restarted work on Gwadar International Airport, which was stopped by the previous government. Similarly, two transmission lines for Gwadar have resumed and will be functional in Jan 2023,” he added.
Regarding Islamabad Metro Bus Project, the minister said the previous government had deliberately delayed the project though it was close to completion.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif soon after taking charge released the funds and as a result it was made functional and now accommodates millions of commuters in the twin cities, he added.
Blue economy
Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal, while speaking at a maritime symposium, said there was a potential of over $100 billion in Pakistan’s blue economy.
“To tap the potential, the government is launching new projects for the development of coastal areas,” he said  while speaking at the third international maritime symposium on ‘Geo-economic dimensions of Indian Ocean region - opportunities for the region and beyond’ organised by National Institute of Maritime Affairs (NIMA).
The minister said immense resources were available in the huge sea area at disposal and along the 1,000 kilometres Pakistani coast. However, he said political stability was mandatory for economic growth.
Speaking on the occasion, retired vice admiral Ahmed Saeed, the director general NIMA, highlighted the objectives and importance of the symposium.
The chief of naval staff’s message read to the audience underscored the importance of Indian Ocean region (IOR) that provided major connectivity routes for global trade and contained vast natural resources such as oil, gas, minerals and seafood. 
Former chief of naval staff and and NIMA Board of Advisers President retired Admiral Asif Sandila said it was hub of major sea routes which connected oil rich Middle East with rest of the world through points like Strait of Hormuz, Babel Mandeb and Malacca straits.
“The smooth flow of trade is important not only for the IOR but also for global economy,” he said.
In the second session, the speakers deliberated on the geo-strategic environment of IOR, especially interest of major powers like the US, its allies and China.
Former naval chief retired Admiral Mohammad Zakaullah said China had gained extended economic reach in IOR. “USA, its allies and India are trying to contain China. How far they would be successful is yet to be seen,” he said.
Prof Dr Mehmet Seyfettin Erol, CEO of Ankara Centre for Crisis and Policy Studies, was of the opinion that regional connectivity facilitated trade, which was one of the major instruments for improvement of the economy.
Dr Petr Topychkanov, associate senior researcher from SIPRI, said technological development in maritime sectors demanded cooperation.
Dr Sameer Iqbal from Texas University dilated upon the importance of maritime-based renewable energy.
Retired Admiral Afzal Tahir, former CNS, said transit trade to China from Pakistani ports would not take off till China decided to develop their western province.

5,Conference on philosophy of social sciences begins,RAWALPINDI: The first two-day international conference on “Philosophy of social sciences” commenced at Pir Mehr...,"RAWALPINDI: The first two-day international conference on “Philosophy of social sciences” commenced at Pir Mehr Ali Shah Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi on Tuesday.
The conference has been organised by the Faculty of Social Sciences of the university with the objectives to bring basic ideas, philosophy and theory back to practical lives.
The conference will not only be helpful in promoting research and developmental activities in social science and humanities but will also promote scientific information interchange between researchers, developers, engineers, students and practitioners.
About 100 research papers related to social sciences will be presented in the conference while senior academicians from famous universities of Pakistan, USA, Canada and UAE will address various sessions of the conference.
At the inaugural session of the conference, chief guest was the university’s Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Qamaruz Zaman while education expert Prof Dr Shahid Siddiqui, former vice chancellor Allama Iqbal Open University and  acting president of International Islamic University Islamabad Dr Nabi Bakhsh Jamani were guests of honour.
Prof Siddiqui pointed out discontinuation in education policies and lack of their implementation. He was of the view that it is the responsibility of educational institutes to create critical perspective in the minds of students.
He said that teachers must have diversity and knowledge of different subjects. He asked them to revisit the research policy of social sciences and the provision of more necessary financial support to enhance research productivity.
Dr Jamani said that academia and philosophy are closely connected to each other and it is the job of intellectuals, thinkers to seek the methods to implement philosophies to spread awareness about the nature, sources and social values of knowledge. He stressed on adoption of philosophy in our education to bring philosophy back to the academic track.
Prof Zaman appreciated the efforts of the organisers and hoped that the conference will be helpful to bring tighter speakers in the discipline of economics, education, sociology, anthropology and humanities.
Earlier, Dr Abdul Saboor, Dean Faculty of Social Sciences, welcomed the participants and explained the aims and objectives of the conference. 
He said without using philosophical parameters, the field of social sciences would go away from the spirit and foundations of the underlying principles.

6,Health activists reiterate demand to ban online sale of novel tobacco products,ISLAMABAD: Health activists have urged the government to ban online sale and advertisements of novel tobacco...,"ISLAMABAD: Health activists have urged the government to ban online sale and advertisements of novel tobacco products.
The demand came during an event organised by Society for the Protection of the Rights of Child (Sparc) with social media influencers coming forward to address the need to ban the online sale and advertisement of emerging tobacco products.
The speakers emphasised that the tobacco industry has been manipulating children and youth into buying novel tobacco products such as e-cigarettes, nicotine pouches and heated tobacco products, through various marketing tactics on social media.
Country head of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids Malik Imran Ahmed shared his concerns about the tobacco industry, adding that it was using advanced strategies to introduce markets with emerging nicotine and tobacco products.
“By presenting concepts of healthier alternatives to smoking, the tobacco industry has entered local markets alongside online sale and promotion. The tobacco industry is misleading everyone by claiming that novel tobacco products are less harmful and only for smokers who want to quit.
“However, these products are openly promoted online and sold to young and new consumers. This shows that these products are not a healthier alternative but a tool to bring in new consumers without any regard for the damage they can cause to the health of children and adolescents,” he said.
Country lead, Vital Strategies Dr Ziauddin Islam said that the tobacco industry was polluting the country with the online sale and advertisement of emerging products, which showed that there was need to ban their online sale and advertisement of emerging tobacco products in Pakistan.
“Around 31 million Pakistanis consume tobacco and introducing new products will further increase this number. Social media is also being used to increase the number of tobacco users as an online platform is open for the tobacco industry to promote sale and advertisement of harmful emerging products,” he said.
Sparc Programme manager Khalil Ahmed Dogar said that novel tobacco products such as nicotine pouches, e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products were all readily available for online purchase due to weaker policies regarding online advertisement and sale.
He urged the government to recognise the situation as a child rights emergency as it will directly hurt their health, education and future development.
“It is the responsibility of policymakers to ensure that no anti-child policy is implemented in the country. The government must ban all kinds of advertisements and sale of such harmful products especially online presence of these products because social media is a huge platform of influence for younger Pakistanis,” he said.

8,PPP lawmaker Qadir Mandokhel threatens to give devolved PTDC back to centre,Criticises provincial govts for not accommodating employees of devolved PTDC despite taking over its assets.,"ISLAMABAD: Chairman Special Committee on Affected Employees of federal government PPP lawmaker Qadir Mandokhel on Tuesday suggested introducing legislation aimed at bringing the devolved Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) back under the federal government control.
Addressing the committee meeting here, Mr Mandokhel reiterated the need for resolving the issues faced by the employees of the corporation who have been placed in the surplus pool.
He criticised the provincial governments for not accommodating the employees of the devolved PTDC despite taking over its assets worth billions of rupees.
He even talked about giving PTDC back under the federal government control through legislation, if the provinces did not take the responsibility of its employees.
The PTDC was devolved to the provinces in the wake of 18th Amendment in the Constitution, and all the scenic spots all over the country were transferred to the respective province by the federal government.
However, the provinces have declined to accommodate the employees, and the bulk of them have been placed in the surplus pool.
The committee has issued notices to different ministries and departments in this regard, while the special assistant to the Prime Minister Aoun Chuadhry has been requested to attend the Special Committee on Affected Employees to help resolve issues being faced by the former employees of PTDC.
Responding to the concerns of one of the members of the committee Aliya Kamran, he said the 15th meeting had already issued directives to different departments related to service matters and if needed they would be protected by legislation.
Mr Mandokhel said that a committee known as “Khursheed Shah Committee” was constituted in 2012 by the federal cabinet to look into the service matters of sacked employees while the Special Committee on Affected Employees has been constituted by the speaker National Assembly which had more powers then the previous one.
The committee issued notices to all ministries asking them to apprise the committee about the issues faced by them to settle the issue of regularisation of contractual and daily wage employees.

Titled Panorama Pakistan, the exhibition was inaugurated by Fareena Mazhar, who is secretary of Ministry of National Heritage and Culture Division (NHCD). The art fundraiser had been a collaborative effort of the PNCA, Syed Abu Akif, former federal secretary and Rabia and Tahira Families Trust to support people affected by the floods.
The organisers said that unpredicted rains this year had caused destruction across most of the country, resulting in loss of precious lives and livelihoods. Dealing with such an immense magnitude of destruction, through emergency relief operations was a challenge difficult to imagine, the organisers said, adding that attending to post-flooding damages, innumerable displaced families, prevention of related diseases and so on are some of the problems faced by those affected by the floods.
Fareena Mazhar said: “We would request everyone to visit the exhibition, with exquisite photography, and to invest generously in acquiring works of their choice, be it for homes or offices. This is an investment in humanity, as well, and it is our sincere prayer that whatever we collect can be of help to alleviate the miseries faced by the victims of this huge catastrophe.”
The display includes impressions of landscapes, architecture, portraits, and some still life. The PNCA was set up to spearhead the development of arts in Pakistan. The council aimed to build an environment conducive to the flourishing of the arts, where the arts were accessible to everyone and artists and art groups had the commitment, financial support and resources to excel at home, as well as on the world stage.

10,Pims employees upbeat after MTI repeal bill passed by parliament,BoG and management committee will be abolished; hospital to function as it was prior to 2018...,"ISLAMABAD: Employees of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) have appreciated the efforts of legislators, especially Health Minister Abdul Qadir Patel, after the Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) repeal bill was passed in the joint sitting of parliament on Tuesday.
The employees, who staged protests that ended after a fortnight this month, claimed that the board of governors (BoG) will finally be abolished and they will get the status of civil servants again.
In November 2020, President Dr Alvi had promulgated the MTI ordinance under which the hospital was to be run through a board of governors (BoG).
The BoG members were later appointed and notified by the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) on the recommendation of a search and nomination council. Even though the employees protested against the ordinance, it sailed through the parliament. Later, some appointments were made under the MTI Act.

BoG and management committee will be abolished; hospital to function as it was prior to 2018

The current government passed the MTI repeal bill and sent it to the president to get his nod but he returned the bill with a suggestion to reconsider it. Therefore, the government was left with no choice but to pass the bill again in a joint session.
Federal Health Alliance (FHA) spokesperson Dr Asfandyar Khan, while talking toDawn, said the employees were happy that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government fulfilled its promise.
“Now President Alvi has no option but to sign the legislation because otherwise it will be considered approved even without his consent. Moreover, the BoG and the management committee of the hospital will be abolished and Pims will start functioning as it was prior to 2018,” he said.
“The hospital will now be run by the executive director and the NHS ministry will supervise it,” he said.
When asked about the status of employees appointed by the BoG, Dr Asfandyar said a commission would be established by the health ministry to see if their services were required or not.
“We congratulate the legislators who acted in favour of the employees and patients as the bill was also beneficial for the patients,” he said.
FHA Chairman Chaudhry Qamar Gujjar said the employees were thankful to the leadership of Pakistan People’s Party.
“Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Faisal Karim Kundi and Syed Sibtul Hassan Shah Bukhari had visited Pims and assured us that they will make sure that the bill would be passed,” he said.
FHA President Dr Haider Abbasi said: “We are thankful to the government and the health minister for keeping the MTI repeal bill on the agenda of the joint session. The fact is that the PPP has always taken steps in favour of the employees. ”
“We are also thankful to the special secretary health who assured us that there will be no further recruitment till the MTI is repealed,” he said.
Another employee of Pims, Tanveer Noshahi, said that the employees of the hospital struggled for years to get the original status of Pims and remain civil servants.
“Unfortunately, MTI was introduced with an idea that the hospital would generate its own resources by charging fee from the patients. It was against the concept of welfare state and that is why we started struggle against it and finally it seems we are going to get success,” he said.
Health Secretary Mirza Nasiruddin Mashhood on Dec 6 had persuaded the employees of Pims to call off their strike against the MTI law.
Pims is the largest hospital in the federal capital and on an average 10,000 patients visit its outpatient departments (OPDs) and 300 elective surgeries are performed in the hospital daily.
