0,25 militants killed as forces secure CTD compound in Bannu,"DG ISPR says 3 security officials martyred, 10 injured; minister causes confusion with statement during joint session, quickly backtracks in subsequent NA sitting.","• DG ISPR says three security officials martyred, 10 injured in ‘intense shootout’ with terrorists
• Minister causes confusion with statement during joint session, quickly backtracks in subsequent NA sitting
LAKKI MARWAT/ISLAMABAD: At least three security officials, including a subedar major who was taken hostage by militants holed up inside the Counter-Terrorism Depart­­ment (CTD) building in Bannu, were martyred as security forces secured the facility seized by Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) men over the weekend.
Speaking to Geo News late on Tuesday night, Inter-Services Public Rela­tions Director General Maj-Gen Ahmed Sharif said that 33 terrorists were under investigation in the CTD compound on Dec 18.  “One of them snatched a weapon from a CTD officer and got his allies freed. They took hold of the weapons from the armoury and started firing, martyring a CTD officer while one was injured who later passed away.”
He said one officer of the security forces present inside the complex was taken hostage and other security personnel reached the site and surrounded the complex as soon as they heard the sound of firing. Gen Sharif said two terrorists were killed in the ensuing exchange of fire while three who tried to escape were arrested and two security personnel were injured as well.
“Our forces surrounded the entire area and thwarted any attempt by the terrorists to escape. In the last 48 hours, there were all-out attempts for an unconditional surrender from the terrorists who were de­­manding safe passage to go to Afghanistan.”
 
 

He said this demand was “completely rejected”. Gen Sharif added that because the terrorists were not ready to surrender their weapons, “forces started an operation on the CTD complex [on Tuesday] during which there was heavy exchange of fire and rooms were cleared out.”
The DG said security personnel fought bravely and 25 terrorists were killed in the clash, three were arrested and seven surrendered to the forces. He said three security officers were martyred in the operation while 10, including three officers, were injured. “This operation is a testimony to the Pakistan Army’s bravery and mission against terrorism,” Gen Sharif added.
‘Explosions and gunshots’
Residents said that they heard explosions and gunshots in the cantonment area as the operation began in earnest around noon. They said black smoke billowed above buildings in Cantt where the CTD facility was located. “The operation did not hamper the normal life in the city as people carried out routine work,” a resident added.
Another resident said that shops and business centres in the city remained open throughout the day and people thronged bazaars for shopping. “Though the government-run and private educational institutions remained closed, government employees attended their offices located in the city.”
Separately, an emergency was imposed in local hospitals by the administration which put doctors on red alert. “In the wake of the prevailing law and order situation in the district and to ensure instant medical cover in case of any untoward incident, medical emergency is hereby declared in the Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital (KGN) and District Headquarters Hospital,” said a notification issued by the deputy commissioner
The mobile phone service also remained suspended in the cantonment, city, and surrounding areas while roads leading to the cantonment area and Miramshah Road had been closed for the last three days.
Asif’s ‘faux pas’
Earlier in the day, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif made a faux pas when he flip-flopped over his remarks made in parliament regarding the Bannu operation. Mr Asif, during a joint session of parliament, claimed that all militants had been eliminated and the operation was successfully concluded. However, minutes after the joint session, Mr Asif backtracked on his remarks during the subsequent National Assembly session. According to him, the Pakistan Army’s media wing would share details about the operation and subsequent causalities.
Speaking at parliament’s joint session, Mr Asif claimed that all “33 militants” had been killed while at least two commandoes embraced martyrdom. Khawaja Asif said that all ‘detained terrorists’ were killed in the “successful operation”. He said security forces secured the release of all CTD officials and killed militants present inside the compound. “These 33 [militants] were under arrest and had a link with multiple [banned] groups,” he added.
According to the minister, at least 33 terrorists were under arrest at the CTD compound and one of them managed to snatch a gun from an official after hitting him in the head with a brick. Mr Asif credited the military for the operation saying that the provincial government had “no role” in it. He added that a unit of SSG carried out the operation, in which 10-15 of its commandos were injured while two were martyred. He said the operation started at 12:30pm and the compound was cleared by 2:30pm.
Mr Asif, pointing towards a rise in terror incidents in KP and Balochistan, said terrorist incidents have taken place in other provinces as well but there is clear evidence that terrorists from across the border or local outfits were more active in the above-mentioned provinces.
North Waziristan lawmaker Mohsin Dawar also expressed concern over the law and order situation in KP and demanded the government revisit its Afghanistan policy.

1,Punjab on the brink of another constitutional crisis,"PA speaker terms governor’s order to CM for confidence vote ""illegal""; experts say Parvez Elahi will lose CM seat if order ignored.","• PA speaker terms governor’s order to CM for confidence vote ‘illegal’
• Experts say Elahi will lose CM seat if order on vote of confidence ignored
LAHORE: Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan on Tuesday termed “illegal, against the provisions of the Constitution and thus stand disposed of” the Punjab governor’s orders directing Chief Minister Parvez Elahi to seek a vote of confidence in a special assembly session to show he still commands a majority.
In his two-page ruling, the speaker maintained that the governor’s orders were not in accordance with Article 54(3) and Article 127. “The house is in session since Oct 23, 2022, and under Article 54(3) and 127. No fresh session can be convened unless and until the current one ends,” the order read.
Referring to the Mian Manzoor Ahmad Wattoo vs Federation of Pakistan case, Mr Khan said that the CM has to be given 10 clear days to win the vote of confidence. He added this “time span was mandatory”, which is missing in the governor’s order.
Subsequently, the PA speaker summoned the house on Friday afternoon, virtually killing the proceedings of the vote of confidence and the governor’s orders.
‘Constitutional battle’
With both sides sticking to their respective positions at the time of going to print, an acrimonious constitutional battle is undoubtedly going to ensue, adding further fuel to the already volatile political situation.
Legal experts, however, believe if the chief minister fails to win vote of confidence in the timeframe set by Governor Balighur Rehman, i.e. 4pm today (Wednesday), the office of Chief Minister would fall vacant — plunging the province into a deep constitutional crisis.
They said this would also expose the practitioner to legal consequences over the purported obstruction. “Those facilitating such constitutional misadventure can be proceeded against as such,” cautioned Advocate Usama Khawar. It would exactly be the same position when during the no-confidence motion against then-prime minister Imran Khan in April [this year], the court later held few individuals guilty of violating the Constitution. “They were not proceeded against, but it cannot be held as precedent or guarantee that it would not happen next time,” he warned.
“Otherwise a figurehead of the province, especially after the 18th Amendment, Article 130 and its sub-clause 7 give discretionary powers to the governor – and do so for a reason. Like the president at the centre, it is the governor who initiates and sets the course of vote of confidence in the province. The chief minister holds office at his pleasure. This is constitution, not interpretation of it,” Mr Usama maintained.
Advocate Supreme Court Malik Awais Khalid agreed. “Article 130 and its sub-clause 7 that deal with the subject clearly state that the governor in his own satisfaction (read discretion) decides when, in his opinion, the chief minister requires a fresh mandate from the house.”
 
 

“This is an independent provision, which does not require contingent conditions…The only requirement is that he would fix the time for the chief minister to go through the process and that procedure is also final. If it is not completed within the fixed timeframe, the chief minister is considered to have lost the confidence of the house and his seat,” Mr Malik asserted.
Meanwhile, the experts were also clear about the consequences. “If the vote of confidence process is not completed by today afternoon, the incumbent chief minister would not only lose his office, but he cannot continue even as caretaker — a normal practice of keeping the seat warm till the next one is appointed,” they added.

2,Officials agree on talks with Kabul over border issues,"“It was decided that civil and military officials concerned would hold negotiations by visiting both countries in future,"" says official.","QUETTA: With the efforts of a 16-member jirga that visited Kandahar to meet the Taliban officials amid tense situation at Chaman border, a flag meeting held between Pakistan and Afghan authorities at Friendship Gate on Tuesday agreed to resolve all border issues through talks.
At the flag meeting, which was postponed earlier on Saturday reportedly due to grouping among the Afghan officials on use of authority and taking decisions, it was also decided that civil and military officials of both sides would visit the other country for negotiations on all issues in future.
Both sides agreed that fighting was not a solution to any problem and negotiation was the right way to resolve all issues between the neighbouring countries. The meeting was held in a very cordial atmosphere as two sides discussed the border issues in detail and appreciated the role of religious and tribal elders in breaking the deadlock through their efforts and suggested that their role should be continued in future for increasing trust and confidence between Pakistan and Afghanistan,“ official sources told Dawn.
“It was decided the civil and military officials concerned would hold negotiations by visiting both countries in future and will remain in contact,” a senior official present at the meeting disclosed.
The Pakistani civil and military officials also put traditional turbans on the heads of Afghan officials.
While the situation has been tense at Chaman border since the mid of November when a Pakistani soldier was martyred by firing from across the border, Afghan border forces’ shelling on officials as well as on civilian settlements in recent weeks aggravated it.
In an ice-breaking visit to Afghanistan after the postponement of Saturday flag meeting, a delegation comprising leading religious scholars and tribal elders from Chaman held talks with senior Afghan Taliban leaders and officials in Spin Boldak and Kandahar and took up the issue of shelling by Afghan forces on the civilian settlement that claimed at least nine lives and left 45 others injured.
At those meetings, the Pakistani delegates and Afghan officials agreed to facilitate the conduct of flag meeting before the jirga returned to Chaman and briefed the civil and military authorities about their decisions, sources said.
Subsequently, the flag meeting was held at Friendship Gate on Tuesday afternoon. Civil and military officials, including deputy commissioner Chaman, tribal and religious leaders, while from the other side, senior border security and deputy commissioner of Spin Boldak attended the meeting.
The Afghan officials expressed their grief and sorrow over the human loss during the recent shelling from the Afghan forces and fateha was offered for the departed souls of the Pakistani civilians who lost their lives. “We have a lot of respect for the sacrifices rendered by the people of Pakistan for Afghanistan and we cannot forget these sacrifices forever,” they said.

• Wants to phase out petrol bikes, introduce efficient bulbs, fans
• Cabinet okays policy, seeks provinces’ support before implementation
• Govt to refer Toshakhana case to FIA 
ISLAMABAD: As the circular debt in the energy sector goes up, the government is back to square one: it wants to inculcate the principle of “early to bed, early to rise” into a nocturnal nation, save daylight hours and expect billions in savings. 
The national energy conservation plan, approved by the federal cabinet in its meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday, envisages drastic measures like the closure of markets and restaurants by 8pm, the work-from-home facility to 20 per cent of government employees, the introduction of electric motorbikes, efficient light bulbs and fans, the solarisation of government buildings, water conversation, rain harvesting, use of “conical baffle” devices in gas geysers, etc.
The cabinet decided that the emergency plan would be discussed with the provinces for two days — on Tuesday and Wednesday — and would be finalised on Thursday for implementation, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told a presser after the meeting. 
“The plan will change the overall lifestyle and habit pattern of the nation that will enrich family life. It will also bring back our tradition and family values,” he said of the plan, similar to ones many governments have announced but failed to implement in the past. 
“Our previous generations used to suspend all activities after sunset and shops used to be closed at 6pm. I don’t know when the new trend [the habit of staying awake until late at night] emerged in our society. If we want live within our means, we have to mend our ways,” he said.
Giving details of the emergency plan, the defence minister said estimates had shown that if 
20 per cent of the government employees worked from home on a rotation basis, Rs56 billion could be saved. “It is mainly about the nation limiting its lifestyle,” he said.
The timing of wedding halls, he said, would be limited to 10pm while restaurants, hotels and markets would close down by 8pm. He, however, said that there might be some room for the closing time for restaurants to be extended by an hour. “By doing this, we can save Rs62 billion annually,” he added.
He said energy-efficient fans and bulbs would soon be introduced in the market, which would further help save Rs38bn. “Similarly, if streetlights are used alternatively, we would be able to save Rs4bn.”
The minister also revealed that the government was in talks with motorcycle companies for electric bikes to phase out petrol-run bikes, a move he hoped would save around Rs8bn.   
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Kaira said that no nation could prosper without following the principle of “early to bed, early to rise”.
“The government is taking all the measures it should, but we also need a response from the public,” he stressed. “If we say that we won’t change our habits […] won’t give any sacrifices and expect the government to do everything […] this is not possible,” he said. 
Toshakhana scam
Khawaja Asif also revealed in the press conference that the government had decided to refer the Toshakhana case against PTI Chairman Imran Khan to the Federal Investigation Agency.
He said a committee formed by the prime minister has revised the procedure of obtaining foreign gifts, which were kept in Toshakhana. “Under the revised procedure, the doors of ‘bad intention’ have closed and no one can misuse these gifts in the name of ‘good intention’,” he added.
Gas schemes
Later, Prime Minister Sharif chaired a meeting of the cabinet committee on energy and approved the completion of construction work of the gas development schemes started during 2013-18. 
Meanwhile, the president of the Tanzeem-i-Tajiran Pakistan, Mohammad Kashif Chaudhry, rejected the proposal for the closure of markets, restaurants and hotels by 8pm and marriage halls by 10pm, saying the government had taken the decision without consulting the stakeholders.
Suleman Chawla of the All Pakistan Restaurant Association asked the government to allow restaurants to operate dine-in until at least 1am and take away timing should continue 24/7.

4,Fawad lobs ball in Punjab Assembly speaker’s court ahead of trust vote,"Berates federal govt ""for financially crippling KP""; party meeting today to ensure numbers in Punjab Assembly.","LAHORE: Throwing the ball in the Punjab Assembly speaker’s court, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry on Tuesday said it was up to the speaker to decide whether he wanted to take up the vote of confidence proceedings first, as directed by the governor, or that of the no-confidence vote, as moved by the opposition.
“Only the speaker, as the regulator of the house, can decide these matters,” Mr Chaudhry insisted while talking to the media outside the residence of PTI chief Imran Khan at Zaman Park. “We are ready for both,” he said.
When reminded that both the speaker and his deputy have also been served with no-confidence motions, he readily agreed that a panel of chairmen could be asked to do the job.
A PTI official, however, revealed that the presiding officer — whether the speaker or the panel of chairmen — was expected, or directed, to drop the vote of confidence move because the ruling coalition had to show the required number of votes in this case, which they feared might be hard to come by, especially if, as they suspected, around two dozens of MPAs of the Jahangir Khan Tareen group decided to abstain at the last moment. 

Berates federal govt ‘for financially crippling KP’; party meeting today to ensure numbers in PA

Instead, the PTI plans to start proceedings on the no-confidence vote as moved by the opposition, which it is confident of defeating and then, armed with a moral ground of enjoying the confidence of the house, move the dissolution summary.
“That is what the plan is so far. The party also knows that its act (of choosing one option and dropping the other) would go to the court but that hardly matters in the overheated political wrangling,” he explained, adding that was what Fawad Chaudhry meant when he said that the speaker could decide which of the two proceedings he would like to take up first.
To ensure numbers, the PTI has convened a parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday morning (today) to assess where it stands and decide how to proceed.
Mr Chaudhry also hinted to that effect when he told the media that Punjab Chief Minister Parvez Elahi “will win the vote of confidence and move the dissolution summary. Dissolution would take place come what may and so would be elections”.
He also berated the federal government “for financially crippling Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and compromising its ability to fight terrorism”.
“The federal government owes Rs120 billion to the province, which might have boosted its capacity to fight terrorism. It neither provided money to the provincial government nor did anything to pre-empt terrorism despite ample warning. We have been warning against increasing terrorism for the last six months but to no avail,” he said.
Meanwhile, PML-Q leader Moonis Elahi — who has been shuttling between his father and Imran Khan ever since Chaudhry Parvez Elahi delivered his blitzkrieg on the PTI dissolution politics — tweeted to claim after meeting Imran Khan on Tuesday that a “strategy to dissolve the Punjab Assembly has been finalised. The PDM can do whatever it can, it cannot escape elections that it is destined to lose. Victory belongs to Imran Khan”.

5,LHC allows PML-N MPAs to attend Punjab Assembly session today,18 lawmakers were barred by PA speaker from attending 15 assembly sittings.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday suspended an order of the Punjab Assembly speaker and allowed 18 MPAs of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) to attend the Dec 21 session summoned by the governor requiring Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi to obtain a vote of confidence.
Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan, Saba Sadiq and other MPAs were barred by speaker Sibtain Khan from attending 15 sittings of the assembly through two different orders issued on July 7 and Oct 23.
The MPAs were represented by advocates Rana Asadullah Khan, Mansoor Usman Awan, Hamza Shehram Sarwar and others.
The lawyers argued before the court that the petitioners being elected members of the assembly had an inalienable right to participate in the session being held on Wednesday. 
They argued that the law provided a ban for 15 days only but the speaker unlawfully imposed a ban on the petitioners for attending 15 sittings of the assembly.
They asked the court to suspend the decisions of the speaker regarding the ban on the participation of the MPAs in the assembly sessions for being unconstitutional.
Opposing the petitions, speaker’s counsel Imtiaz Rashid Siddiqui argued that the interim relief sought by the petitioners tantamount to final relief, which could not be granted at this stage. He urged the court to dismiss the civil miscellaneous application filed by the petitioners.
Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, in his written order, reproduced rule 210 of the Rules of Procedure of the Punjab Assembly of the Punjab 1997 and observed that sub-rule 3 of the rule 210 was very much clear on the subject that period of absence after order to withdraw would be for 15 days and not for 15 consecutive sittings of the assembly.
The judge suspended the impugned decisions of the speaker and allowed the petitioners to participate and vote, if needed, in the session of the assembly summoned by the governor requiring the chief minister to secure a vote of confidence.
The judge adjourned the hearing of the case till Jan 19, 2023.

6,PTI lobbyist ‘engaged Hussain Haqqani at someone else’s behest’,"FARA documents show former CIA Islamabad station chief, hired by SAPM, made payments to former ambassador to US.","WASHINGTON: Documents showing that a former CIA station manager in Islamabad and Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US were hired to lobby for the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in Washington may not exactly be breaking news.
But based on fresh information that has come to light recently, PTI insiders are now claiming that these men were lobbying against their own government and played a key role in bringing it down.
PTI officials in the US also claim that both men — Robert Grenier and Hussain Haqqani — were working for a senior figure in the military establishment, a claim Mr Haqqani rejects as incorrect.
The documents on the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) site showed that on July 16, 2021, someone in Pakistan hired Mr Grenier to lobby on their behalf in Washington. Mr Grenier revealed this in his FARA declaration on July 17, 2021.
The documents identified Iftikhar Rehman Durrani of PTI as the person who hired Mr Grenier, but it was the Govern­ment of Pakistan that was paying him.

FARA documents show former CIA Islamabad station chief, hired by SAPM, made payments to former ambassador to US

In Aug 2022, the Pakistani media also reported that the PTI had hired a CIA veteran to advise them on US ties.
According to the documents, the relationship between Mr. Grenier and the government of Pakistan ended in Oct, 2021 but a FARA supplement — covering the 6-month period ending January 2022 — disclosed details of the payments sent by the government of Pakistan to Mr Grenier.
Within this period, Mr Grenier gets $150,000 for “media research”. The supplement clarifies that no attempt was made to influence US foreign policy in anyway.
In November 2022, Mr Grenier filed an amendment to the supplemental, giving details about the disbursement of funds. It showed that the ex-CIA chief made two payments Mr Husain Haqqani, of $20,000 and $10,000 each.
In a recent Twitter thread, journalist Waqas Ahmed claimed that Mr Haqqani met a top Pakistani official in Dubai months before the PTI government was toppled, but the former ambassador denied this claim as well.
 






The claims — and counter-claims — have become the top trend on social media as thousands of people have gone through the documents on the US Justice Department’s FARA site and watched talk shows highlighting the issue.
Dawn verified documents that showed that the two men were hired to lobby by a Pakistani government official, Iftikhar Durrani, who had served as a special assistant to then-prime minister Imran Khan.
But PTI officials said that Mr Durrani had already resigned from his post when he signed the document. One party official Dawn spoke to said Mr Durrani told him he did so “under coercion”.
Haqqani’s defence
Mr Haqqani, the former ambassador who is also mentioned in the latest FARA documents, was the central character in the Memogate controversy. Delivered in May 2011, it was claimed that the alleged memo was a message from the PPP government which was seeking the Obama administration’s support to reign in the Pakistan military after the Osama bin Laden raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The controversy eventually led to the resignation of Mr Haqqani as ambassador and significantly weakened the PPP government.
However, the former envoy to Washington told Dawn on Tuesday that the claims were exaggerated. “Someone  has added 2 plus 2 to get 9.
I have never interacted with Mr Durrani, have never had an interest in working with PTI, and my stance against  the military’s role in Pakistan’s politics is well known and unchanged,“ he said.
“I am currently only engaged in research and consulting work and have not had anything to do with Pakistan’s domestic politics for many years.”
He said it was “unfortunate that my name is being unfairly invoked in matters with which I have nothing to do.”
Mr Haqqani said he had no relations with the Pakistan military except with friends and family members who served in it.
“Given that I was vilified for being anti-Pakistan and anti-military for years, questions about whether the then army chief met me should be directed at the military,” he added.
“I did not meet Gen. Bajwa as alleged though I see no reason why a former Pakistani ambassador and the army chief should not meet to exchange views,” he said.
‘Genesis of regime change’
In Islamabad, PTI’s Senior Vice President Shireen Marzari said that the Haqqani-Bajwa files, now in public, clearly indicated that the whole project of regime change conspiracy was done covertly, and that “[Mr] Haqqani was hired to undermine the PTI government.”
“One of the first indicators was how Mr Haqqani endorsed Mr Bajwa’s statement at Islamabad Security Dialogue, countering Imran Khan’s government foreign policy.”
She said that some points were still missing. “First, the whole project was done covertly with no cabinet approval and bypassing procurement procedures.”
She claimed that Donald Lu, the US diplomat who allegedly threatened the PTI government at a lunch at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, had a close relationship with Mr. Haqqani. People Dawn spoke to in Washington backed this claim, but did not give details.
