1,ECP reserves verdict on PTI plea in funding case,IHC asks the party to prove its petition is not premature.,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday reserved its judgement on a PTI application seeking cross-examination of witnesses in the prohibited funding case. 
The plea was filed during the hearing of a show-cause notice issued to the PTI after the ECP order of Aug 2. 
PTI lawyer Anwar Mansoor Khan urged the ECP to allow him to cross-examine witnesses, including the bank managers who furnished PTI’s bank statements on the instructions of the State Bank of Pakistan. 

IHC asks the party to prove its petition is not premature

“The bank managers should be asked how they prepared the PTI bank statements, and how these bank statements were received from the State Bank of Pakistan,” the PTI lawyer contended. 
“The ECP has the power to requisition any individual,” he said. 
The PTI lawyer had challenged the show-cause notice and termed it illegal. 
The ECP’s legal representative stated that the process of investigations had been completed and the PTI was part of it before the scrutiny committee for four years and before the ECP for eight years and not once it had demanded cross-examination of the witnesses. 
After hearing the two sides, the ECP reserved the judgement on the petition that will be announced later.  
IHC hearing 
The Islamabad High Court on Tuesday asked the counsel for the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf to prove that the petition, requesting the IHC to set aside the ECP’s report on prohibited funding and to restrain the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) from conducting inquiries into the case, is not premature. 
An IHC larger bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Babar Sattar was hearing the PTI’s petition filed against the ECP report on the prohibited funding case. 
Anwar Mansoor Khan, the counsel for PTI, argued before the court that the federal government, while acting on the ECP’s report, issued direction to the FIA to conduct inquiries into alleged prohibi-ted funding. 
He said the FIA had initiated 185 inquiries across the country against the PTI leadership in connection with prohibited funding. 
Justice Farooq asked the PTI counsel to conclude the arguments as early as possible, observing that the lawyer had taken too much time to come to the point and with such slow pace the hearing would likely to conclude by June next year.
The bench advised the counsel to take a couple of hours to conclude the arguments and adjourned the hearing till Jan 10, 2023.

2,Are law enforcers ready for resurgent militant threats in KP?,"In the past year alone, terrorists belonging to TTP, IS-K and others groups have perpetrated at least 165 terrorist attacks in KP.","“WHAT can Khyber Pakhtunkhwa learn from Pun­jab to effectively counter the threat of terrorism?”
A Peshawar University student asked this question during a recently-held seminar in the presence of lawmakers, academia, and security experts. At the time, none of the speakers took the question as seriously as they should have, given the worsening security situation in KP. 
In the past year alone, terrorists belonging to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Gul Bahadur group, the Islamic State-Khurasan (IS-K), and others with similar objectives have perpetrated at least 165 terrorist attacks in the province, which is an increase of 48 per cent from the preceding year. The TTP, along with its local Taliban affiliates alone, perpetrated 115 of these. 
A report, presented in a recently held National Security Committee meeting, has served to showcase the weaknesses and capacity gaps in the provincial counterterrorism department (CTD).
The standoff between security forces and TTP detainees at a Bannu CTD centre, which finally ended late on Tuesday night, has fully exposed the potential of the terrorist groups and the lack of preparedness of law enforcers. These militants gained strength during the ceasefire between the government and the TTP, formally ending last month.
It may look embarrassing for counterterrorism authorities in KP that the detained terrorists snatched weapons from their investigators, took them hostage, and also took control of the CTD building. 
But how can one particular department be held solely responsible for a prolonged siege of any office building by terrorists, when multiple mechanisms do exist to counter the terrorism threat?
Political expediency
The report cited earlier was leaked during the Bannu siege and highlights all the capacity issues which could cause a security department to malfunction. It says that the quality of human resource is very poor, drawn mainly from the existing Levies. 
They are not well-trained and unable to use any modern techniques to counter terrorism. The report also criticises the provincial government, which is not taking counterterrorism tasks seriously. But then again, one can ask which provincial government is taking the task seriously?
The report’s benchmark is a comparison of the CTD KP with the force in Punjab, and it speaks glowingly of the latter, terming it the most effective counterterrorism body in the country. 
The report may have answered the question raised by the student at Peshawar University, but it may not satisfy all because counterterror actions are not merely a professional duty in Pakistan, but a highly politicised issue for several reasons. 
The federal government has praised the report as it criticises the provincial Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government. 
At the same time, PTI is criticising the federal government for its Afghan policy and the subsequent impact on the security landscape of KP. When CTD and police officials in KP province question the peace process with the terrorists, they mainly indicate a strategic border aspect, which creates doubts in the minds of the counterterrorism officials.
Whenever the security situation worsens, people start questioning the National Action Plan (NAP), which is now almost a ‘dead initiative’, even after its revision last year.
‘Unfair’ comparison
The police in the country and KP, in particular, remain on the frontline of the fight against terrorism and have have borne the brunt of that. According to data from the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, police have faced 1,116 terrorist attacks since 2006, and KP police alone have faced 650 attacks that have claimed the lives of 538 personnel, including officers.
After the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, TTP has perpetrated 83 terrorist attacks against police in KP, which reflects that police are among their top targets. 
The CTD departments remain high-value targets for the militants because they are mainly responsible for tracking their movements, launching raids and conducting interrogations. In fact, terrorists have targeted CTD premises 17 times in the last seven years.
The CTD in Punjab is doing a good job for all the right reasons, from managing resources to better training facilities, and is fully equipped with modern tools. Nevertheless, security of life, tenure protection, and other incentives could make the CTD a more effective force. CTDs all over the country face the same challenges in this regard as they function under the most intense of circumstances. What they fear the most is that after their tenure in CTD, officials are usually transferred to remote areas, where they become easy targets for terrorists. Such target killings are now increasing, particularly in KP, and the provincial government has to take their counterterrorism responsibilities more seriously now. 
However, the comparison between Punjab and KP province is not justified, as both provinces face terrorism threats on different scales, and in most cases the nature of the threat can vary. 
KP is more affected by the spillover of the situation in Afghanistan, and it is mainly the military that looks after everything, from border security to dealing with the terrorists coming from the other side of the border. 
There, the CTDs have never been involved in the decision-making process and always look towards the superior security institutions — who call the shots — either to engage the militants or take coercive measures against them. This creates ambiguity among officials who came from the paramilitary forces.
The revamping of the CTD in KP province is essential, but most important is that they must also perform their duties without unnecessary interference. The civilian government must debate the issues in parliament and at public forums, which will help remove ambiguities and enhance the morale of the personnel dealing with these threats, day in and day out.

3,"Blinken calls Bilawal, offers continued help for flood victims","Offers condolences for lives lost in recent terror attacks, underscored America's resolute support as Pakistan combats terrorism.","WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke with Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and assured him of his continued support for the people of Pakistan as they recover from the recent devastating floods, said a statement issued in Washington on Tuesday.
US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Secretary Blinken and FM Bhutto-Zardari “shared their mutual hope for a productive International Conference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in January and discussed the need for close coordination”. 
The secretary offered condolences for lives lost in recent terrorist attacks and underscored the US resolute support for Pakistan as it combats terrorism, the statement added.
The foreign minister is currently visiting Washington on the second leg of his weeklong visit to the US. He arrived in New York on Dec 13 and reached Washington on Monday after attending a special UN session of G77 countries and holding bilateral meetings with the UN chief and other dignitaries. The US State Department offered unconditional support to Pakistan in its battle against the TTP and similar groups, saying that defeating terrorism was a shared goal of both countries.

UN chief slams TTP, calls on Kabul to take action against militant group

It also offered to assist India and Pakistan in resolving their differences, reminding them that they were key global partners and that America would like to continue ‘valuable partnerships’ with both.
But when asked if the US could also help resolve the Kashmir dispute, Mr Price said: “Our policy is that this is an issue that needs to be addressed by India and Pakistan. We are prepared to support if the parties want that, but this is a question for India and Pakistan to adjudicate.”
The foreign minister began his official engagements in Washington on Monday with an address to a conservative think-tank, the Heritage Foundation. He attended a community dinner at the Pakistani ambassador’s residence in the evening and addressed another think-tank, the Atlantic Council, on Tuesday.
He also met a number of US lawmakers during the last two days.
In an interview with Bloomberg published on Tuesday, Mr Bhutto-Zardari defended his recent remarks describing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as ‘the butcher of Gujarat’, saying he was referring to ‘a historical fact’, Dawn.com reported.
“I was referring to a historical reality. The remarks I used were not my own. I did not call […] I did not invent the term ‘Butcher of Gujarat’ for Mr Modi. The Muslims in India following the Gujarat riots used that term for Mr Modi.”
“It’s been two days since my remark — a member of Mr Modi’s party has announced a 20 million rupee bounty on my head. So, I don’t think the best way to disprove the fact that Mr Modi is the ‘Butcher of Gujarat’ is to adopt such extreme steps,” he said.
“It is an extreme reaction and underlines and reinforces the points I made at the UN,” he said.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s remarks evoked strong reaction from India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who staged protests across the country, including outside the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi. 
UN chief seeks action against TTP
Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on the Taliban administration in Kabul to ensure an end to “all forms of terrorism activities” that posed a threat to Pakistan and other neighbouring countries from Afghan soil, Dawn.com reported.
“There is […] a clear ask from the international community, which is for Afghanistan to stop all forms of activity of terrorist organisations that from Afghanistan represent a threat to neighbouring countries, including Pakistan,” he said while speaking at a press briefing at the UN headquarters in New York on Monday.
The UN was actively engaged in discussions with the Taliban de facto authorities on this issue, he added.
“We consider that it is absolutely essential for the Taliban not to allow any form of terrorist activity that might have an impact in relation to Pakistan, as in relation to any other country of the region,” he added.

5,"‘I have the courage to face hostility,’ says acid attack survivor","""Those who love you, will continue to love you for who you are,"" she says.","

Nafiah Ikram

 
WASHINGTON: “I am not a victim, I am a survivor. I have the courage to face hostility,” says Nafiah Ikram, a brutality survivor from New York.  
She came on the stage at the Miss and Mrs Pakistan, USA contest in Virginia on Sunday evening after Meera,  renowned Pakistani TV and film artist, and inspired all, even Meera who clapped vigorously as Nafiah spoke.  
Nafiah, now 23, was returning home from a CVS store in Long Island, New York, on March 17 last year when an unidentified man ran up to her and threw acid in her face before running off. He is still at large.  
The attack left the Hofstra University student unable to see in one eye and facing an unknown number of surgeries to rebuild burned parts of her face. 
The trauma, at times, brought on suicidal thoughts, she once said.  
For the last 20 months, Nafiah has been on a “journey she never wanted — of learning to cope with constant pain while undergoing one medical surgery and procedure after another,” commented New York’s Newsday newspaper in a recent report on her.
“For three months, I could not eat. I still cannot turn my neck,” said Nafiah at the beauty pageant.  
The dictionary defines pageant as a procession of people in elaborate, colorful costumes at an outdoor performance. And there’s was no dearth of colours at the Sunday night event. But none as bold as that of Nafiah’s courage.  
“I was a pharmacy assistant at the CVS store, now I want to be a doctor,” she said. She is studying medicine at a college in New York.  
Thanking her family for their love and support during this difficult phase of her life, Nafiah said: “Those who love you, will continue to love you for who you are.”  
Apparently, her definition of love did not satisfy Meera. “What’s love (Mohabbat kia hai)?” she asked a contestant, Alina.
“It’s the love and support I get from my parents and from the community and my desire to return their favour,” Alina replied.  
Although it has been more than a year since Nafiah had acid hurled in her face in her own driveway, her attacker remains on the loose  — and her family says the police should do more to catch the culprit.  
“The police department, they never took this case seriously,” said the victim’s father, Sheikh Ikram, 51. 
“So, please, help us find that animal.” 
“My daughter, she is suffering every single day and we are going through a very tough time,” said her mother Sherina Ikram while urging the police to catch the perpetrator.  
Her father thinks the offender must have known her well and knew “when she leaves work for home. It was all pre-planned.”  
In an interview to the New York Post, Ms Ikram also blamed the police for not doing enough to catch her attacker.
She said the police even accused her of lying and withholding information.
In a statement one year after the attack, the Nassau County Police said an “intense and comprehensive investigation” into the attack was underway.
“Numerous inter-agency resources have been assigned and continue to collaborate to bring the person responsible to justice,” the statement added.
Nafiah said the incident has changed her perspective on life. “It has strengthened my faith in God. I do not get depressed anymore. I want to be a physician and help others.”  
She said she knew there were acid victims in Pakistan too and wants to get in touch with them. “Connecting with other victims will help. We can learn from each other and give hope and courage to all victims.” 
The local police and the FBI continue to offer a $40,000 reward for information.
