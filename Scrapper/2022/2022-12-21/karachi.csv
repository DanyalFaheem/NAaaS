The NCHR in collaboration with the Legal Aid Office conducted an on-site visit to Karachi central prison and prepared a report detailing the situation.
The NCHR’s team comprising Rabiya Javeri Agha and Haya Zahid met with Afghan women and children being held and heard their ordeals.
Of the total 143 interviews conducted, Women’s Prison and Central Prison in Karachi, 44 per cent were juveniles, 39.8pc women and 16pc men. Of these an overwhelming majority, 75.5pc had arrived in Pakistan in 2022. 
Most commonly cited reason for arrival in Pakistan for Afghan women was access to better medical facilities whereas adult males and juveniles stated that the availability of better work opportunities was their primary reason for coming to Pakistan.
The on-site visit also found that the high number of Afghan women and children being held was overwhelming, forcing the prison to function beyond its capacity of 300. 
The NCHR said that a significant majority of Afghans interviewed wished to return home. The report put forth a number of policy recommendations to help the foreign nationals being detained and limit prisons from operating above capacity.
On the basis of the report, the NCHR recommended a strong liaison must be established between the prison administration and the Afghan mission in Pakistan in order to ensure safe and immediate return of these people.
Secondly, greater sensitivity needed to be shown by the government authorities, it said.

2,"Karachiites left at mercy of robbers — MQM-P, PTI and JI agree","Another young student wounded by robbers in Gulistan-i-Jauhar; PPP govt, police chief blasted for rising street crimes.","• Another young student wounded by robbers in Gulistan-i-Jauhar
• PPP govt, police chief blasted for rising street crimes
KARACHI: As armed robbers shot at and wounded another young student in the city for putting up resistance to a robbery on Tuesday, the Pakistan Peoples Party-led Sindh government and police were blasted by all major opposition parties for their ‘failure’ to curb the fast spiralling street crimes.  
Within a week two young boys studying engineering and law were killed and many other people were wounded in incidents of street crimes in different parts of the metropolis.  
Instead of taking any concrete action to control the breakdown of law and order, Karachi police chief Javed Odho had asked Karachiites not to offer any resistance to armed muggers and hand over their mobile phones to them quietly.  
On Tuesday morning, a teenage student was shot at and wounded by armed robbers in Gulistan-i-Jauhar.  
Sharea Faisal police SHO Haji Mohammed Ishaq said that Faizan Afzal, 18, was standing along with his friend in Block-13 when armed men riding a motorbike came and held them at gunpoint and demanded cash and other valuables.  
However, Faizan put up resistance upon which the robbers opened fire on him and fled along with a few hundred rupees.  
The young boy suffered a single bullet wound in the leg and was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for treatment.  
Sindh govt lambasted 
Calling it a ‘failure’ of the Sindh government and the Karachi police, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Tuesday questioned the performance of the law-enforcement agencies in Karachi where street crimes had claimed over a dozen lives in a few past weeks.  
Addressing a press conference, former Karachi mayor Wasim Akhtar said that the provincial government had failed to come up with any strategy to control crime in the city. 
He condemned the statement of the Karachi police chief in which the officer had asked citizens to ‘surrender’ to robbers and don’t resist against robberies.  
“This city has over 65,000 policemen and some 13,000 Rangers personnel,” he said. “The people, who are losing their lives and valuables, but not seeing any credible action against criminals, are justified to question the performance of government.”  
He expressed serious concerns over the lethargic approach of police authorities and toeing an apologetic policy against criminals. “With this advice, you have given a clean chit to all criminals in Karachi. This reflects the level of weakness and lack of political will to control street crimes. The people of Karachi are left at the mercy of criminals after the chief of law enforcement agency is found in a state of denial,” he said. 
JI slams city police chief statement
Earlier, Jamaat-i-Islami chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman came down heavily on the  PPP government and accused the ruling party of putting Karachiites at  the mercy of street criminals.  
He said the Karachi police chief  statement was an attempt to practically encourage robbers to continue  looting and killing citizens.  
“Karachiites are now under  constant threat of mugging and killing as the police, Rangers and other  law enforcement agencies have badly failed in the city,” he said.  
“Within  a week an engineering student was killed outside the NED University and  then a law student outside his home. We warn the government and the  administration that the mugging and killing spree in Karachi will not be  tolerated and the Jamaat will announce its next course of action if the  lawlessness in the city continues.” 
Street crime exposes inept govt, says PTI
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) legislators also criticised the police performance and called it a total failure of the Sindh government and its chief Syed Murad Ali Shah that had given a rise to street crimes in Karachi since the start of this year.  
Talking to reporters outside a private hospital, where they had gone to inquire after the health of young robbery victim Faizan Ahmed, PTI MNA Faheem Khan and MPA Raja Azhar claimed that police had become politicised and one should not expect any true policing from the law-enforcement agency.  
MPA Azhar claimed that by November, 81,000 incidents of street crimes had been reported in Karachi since January in which a total of 518 people had been killed or injured during the armed mugging attempts.  
“These incidents in fact expose the ineffectiveness of the chief minister, inspector general of police and Karachi police chief,” he said.

6,"Not a single school built in British era damaged in floods, PA told","Over 4.2m children are out of schools in Sindh, says minister; PTI lawmakers stage walkout...","KARACHI: Education Minister Syed Sardar Shah on Tuesday informed the Sindh Assembly that not a single school out of the 1,339 built during British era had been damaged in the unprecedented monsoon rains and floods that devastated over 20,000 schools across the province, leaving over 2.3 million children out of schools.
Giving presentation and speaking on an adjournment motion regarding measures required to improve literacy rate in the country, he said that7,530 schools had been partially damaged. “Over 7,000 out of 20,000 flood affected schools are being repaired immediately,” he added.
The minister said there were nominal secondary schools in the province as 35,883 out of 40,253 primary schools, adding that the four million students were enrolled in the government schools, while over 3.1m in private institution and one million in madressahs (religious institutions).
He said that over 11m children were in school, while the number of out of school children was not more than 4.2m.

Over 4.2m children are out of schools in Sindh, says minister; PTI lawmakers stage walkout

Speaking on the adjournment motion, moved by Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Sharmila Faruqui, Leader of the Opposition Haleem Adil Shaikh said that Rs1,700 billion was allocated in the education sector during the past 14 years and still schools were in very poor conditions with no facilities for the students.
He said that there was no water drinking facility in 26,000 schools and over 19,000 were without toilets, adding that 31,000 schools were without electricity, while there was no boundary walls around 21,000 schools.
Rabia Azfar Nizami of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf said there was a huge disparity in primary and secondary schools due to which 60 per cent of students dropped out every year.
She said that over 100,000 children were engaged in begging while over 1.7m were forced into bonded labour, 70pc of them in the agriculture sector.
She said there were only 3,300 secondary schools in the province and over 60 per cent children dropped out of the education system after primary education.
The PTI MPA asked the minister to tell the house as to how many temporary learning centres had so far been established for the students of the destroyed schools.
She said that a large number of children, particularly girls was unable to go to school as they got married in early age. “The Sindh Assembly had passed a bill to refrain child marriages but the same was not implemented even after a lapse of eight years,” she lamented. Ms Nizami said that many government schools in Karachi were in dilapidated condition yet the students were compelled to sit in the dangerous buildings.
Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) lawmaker Ali Khurshidi demanded an increase in the education budget, saying that “our future is linked with it”. 
He said that education ministers were changed in the recent times, adding that policy too was changed after a new minister took charge of the department. “There is need to enforce law and policies in letter and spirit,” he added.

The PTI also boycotted the proceedings in the end when Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani did not allow Khurram Sher Zaman to make a political speech on the issue of education, switching off his microphone. The speaker also expunged the utterances of the PTI MPA and prorogued the house.

8,Most people in Sindh don’t have enough gas to make a cup of tea: SHC,Seeks report from provincial govt about efforts to resolve gas crisis.,"• Seeks report from provincial govt about efforts to resolve gas crisis
• Discharges show-cause notice issued earlier to finance secretary
KARACHI: While observing that the people of the province were facing great hardship due to a severe shortage of natural gas, the Sindh High Court on Tuesday directed the provincial authorities to inform it about the efforts being made by them to address the crisis.
The court, while noting that the apex court had referred the issue of gas disbursement to the Council of Common Interest (CCI) for an amicable solution in 2018, asked a provincial law officer to produce written discussions, recommendations and orders made by the CCI in this regard on the next date.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha said that as per Article 158 of the Constitution a province producing natural gas has the first right over it, but most of the people in the province do not have enough gas to make a single cup of tea in the morning.
The SHC also directed the Sindh government to file some reasonable comments with time frame and schedule regarding measures being taken to resolve the gas crisis in the province as well as implementation of Article 158 or an amicable solution at CCI which benefit the people of Sindh.
The bench was informed that senior lawyer Makhdoom Ali Khan was unwell. He was appointed as amicus curie on issues concerning Article 158 including whether authority of the federal government taking gas from Sindh without permission of the provincial government, was unwell.
In the light of an earlier order of the bench, Additional Advocate General Zeeshan Adhi produced a letter written to the chief secretary seeking instructions as to how the Sindh government intends to proceed with respect to Article 158 due to a severe gas shortage in the province.
“The article makes it clear that a province in which a wellhead of natural gas is situated shall be given preference over other parts of Pakistan subject to the commitments and obligations as on the commencing date. We have not been informed about any commitments and obligations as on the commencing day,” the bench in its order said.
It observed that the matter pertaining to distribution of gas under Article 158 was referred to the CCI over four years ago, but it had not seen any recommendation, discussion or decision of the council.
AAG Adhi informed the judges that under Article 185, people of Sindh should have been given preference over the natural gas, but they were suffering prima facie due to non-implementation of the said article.
The bench directed the counsel to file a statement along with time frame as to what the Sindh government was intending to do in order to enforce the article in question or some amicable solution at CCI.
The bench noted that prime facie, any decision made by the CCI might not override the provision of Article 158 in any event as such the court would like to ask the amicus curie to address it on the next hearing on the subject issue.
The bench issued such directives while hearing around 10 identical petitions regarding non-provision of gasification and welfare funds for the villagers located within five kilometres of each exploration and production site in Sindh despite the apex court’s directives issued in December 2013.
Meanwhile, the bench discharged a show-cause notice earlier issued to the federal finance secretary as the Sui Southern Gas Company confirmed that an amount of Rs660 million had been released for gasification of villages in Sindh.
Secretary Hamad Yaqoob Sheikh appeared before bench and filed a reply to the show-cause notice and also assured the bench that he would make a mechanism so further payments can be made expeditiously as per agreed schedule.

9,Call to take effective measures to deal with looming water crisis,"Poor agricultural practices, mismanagement causing major water losses...","KARACHI: Scientists and policy makers have warned that Pakistan may face an alarming water scarcity in the next two to three years if effective measures are not taken now to tackle depleting resources.
Addressing a conference held on Tuesday, they said the situation posed a serious threat to the country’s development and economic growth. There was an urgent need to put systems in place to curb water mismanagement, contamination and poor agricultural practices as agriculture consumed more than 96 per cent of freshwater resources, they added.
The event titled “Climate Change and Water-related Challenges in Pakistan: Tangible Solutions” was organised by the Aga Khan University’s Institute for Global Health and Development (IGHD) and United Nations’ Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN).
The two-day conference brought together national and global experts and climate change officials from the provincial and federal government to share their evidence-based views on ways to achieve water safety and security, and population health.

Poor agricultural practices, mismanagement causing major water losses

In his keynote address, Dr James Wescoat, professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, spoke about climate change and critical water problems in the Indus Basin of Pakistan.
He feared that flooding and drainage problems would get worse by 2050, especially in the lower Indus basin.
“We must support bold and pragmatic approaches to reconstruction, including water and climate research networks and Indus basin models with health and well-being at the core,” he stated.
In her speech, Prof Dr Nausheen H Anwar, director at the Karachi Urban Lab, said Pakistan’s water crisis was primarily caused by rapid population growth, climate change, poor agricultural sector practices, mismanagement, inefficient infrastructure and pollution.
“Water plays a critical role in thermoregulation. Open water can decrease the air temperature by evaporation, absorption of heat, and transport of heat. Pakistan needs resilient cooling pathways along with sustainable energy initiatives in the face of rising temperature and extreme heat waves.”
The speakers also cited the World Resources Institute’ stats according to which Pakistan ranked 14th among the 17 ‘extremely high baseline water stress’ countries of the world.
However, they pointed out, water stress was just one dimension of water security. Like any challenge, its outlook depended on management. Some of the most arid and water-stressed countries, including Saudi Arabia and Namibia, had effectively secured their water supplies through proper management, they said.
In his introductory remarks, Dr Zulfiqar A. Bhutta, distinguished university professor and founding director of the IGHD at the AKU, explained the nexus of water security and nutrition in Pakistan and that one could not be managed without sustaining the other.
“Water is an equal threat as nutrition to the development of the country. By 2016, there were only 1,000 cubic metres of water left for each person in Pakistan – which is the borderline requirement,” Prof Bhutta noted.
The health and nutrition consequences of the large-scale devastation caused by a recent episode of floods were unfortunate examples and call for urgent and collaborative action at all governance and policy levels, he noted.
The speakers shared that more than 96 per cent of the country’s freshwater was used for agriculture, a sector which constituted nearly 23 per cent of its GDP in 2021. Nevertheless, Pakistan continued to depend on a single river system and unreliable water infrastructure, they added.

MPA Awais along with his six guards/servants has already been indicted for torturing 26-year-old Jokhio to death at his farmhouse and concealing evidence in November last year. 
On Tuesday, the state prosecutor moved an application, stating that the interned lawmaker and servants – Niaz Salar, Ahmed Shoro, Haider Ali, Meer Ali, Muhammad Soomar Salar and Doda Khan alias Dada - had already been charged with murder. 
However, the charge of kidnapping the victim before his murder was yet to be framed against three suspects, Saleem Soomar, Dodar Khan and absconder Niaz Salari, he added. 
“The remaining accused will remain in same charge already framed against them”, he clarified, pleading to charge the trio with kidnapping the victim before killing him. 
Additional District and Sessions Judge (Malir) Faraz Ahmed Chandio after hearing arguments allowed the prosecutor’s plea. 
MPA Awais was not produced before the court for the third consecutive time, therefore, the judge ordered the prison chief to produce him on Dec 23 and adjourned the hearing. The judge also fixed compromise applications filed by the victim’s legal heirs and accused persons on the next date. 
Policemen among 11 acquitted in foreigners kidnap case
An antiterrorism court on Tuesday exonerated 11 accused, including  three police inspectors, in a case pertaining to kidnapping of three  Nigerians “drug traffickers”. 
Three inspectors – Waseem Abro, Nisar Ahmed and former  Defence SHO Muhammad Ali Niazi – along with seven others – Adeeb Shah,  Haji Muhammad Saleem, Ali Hassan Brohi, Ali Nawaz Zahri, Dilbar Khan  Malano, Jan Muhammad and Qambar – were acquitted of the charges of  kidnapping foreigners in Karachi in 2020. 
On Tuesday, the ATC-XV judge, who conducted the trial in  the judicial complex inside the central prison, pronounced his verdict  reserved after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides. 
The judge noted that the prosecution failed to prove the  charges against the accused persons. The court kept the case against  absconding suspects on dormant till their arrest or surrender.

• QAT president says women facing injustices
• JSM-R leader complains of bids on life, false cases against workers    
HYDERABAD: Jacey Jetton, who represents the people of Fort Bend County in the Texas House of Representatives, on Tuesday called on leaders of several Sindhi nationalist parties during his visit to Hyderabad.  
He called on Sindh Taraqqi-Pasand Party (STP) chairman Dr Qadir Magsi, Jeay Sindh Mahaz-Riaz (JSM-R) leader Riaz Chandio and Qaumi Awami Tehreek (QAT) president Ayaz Palijo at their residences.    
He was apprised of political situation obtaining in Sindh and issues like massive devastation caused by recent unprecedented rains and floods, human rights violations, natural resources of the province etc.   
Dr Magsi received the guest at his residence and shared with him his views on overall political situation in Sindh and the country. He stressed that all international democratic forces must play their role for democracy in Pakistan. 
The STP leader said that the United States should also look into human rights violation in Sindh and the rest of the country. He said that Sindh had been a separate homeland in the past and has a rich centuries-old civilisation.  
“Pakistan is a multination state; equal rights for all federating units must be ensured,” he said.  
He appreciated the works executed in Sindh through USAID in the larger interest of communities. He said that recent floods and inundation had caused massive destruction in the province, and added that survivors were left high and dry. They were not provided any relief whereas no rehabilitation work had been started, he added. He said Sindh was facing destruction, hunger, poverty and unemployment. People were passing a miserable life due to these factors, he said. 
Mr Jetton was told that the last 15 years of rule by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) over Sindh had been plagued by record corruption. All international aid and donations must be subjected to audit, stressed Dr Magsi. 
Riaz Chandio welcomed Mr Jetton to his residence and shared with him grievances of the people of Sindh. 
He recalled that G.M. Syed had founded Jeay Sindh Mahaz (JSM) in 1972 to advocate rights of Sindh. He said that East Pakistan was forcibly separated from Pakistan and that’s why Syed propounded the idea of an independent country to restore the historical status of Sindh. 
He said his party was fighting peacefully for prosperity of Sindh.  
Discussing security and human rights issues, Mr Chandio said he was facing murderous attacks, and added that 63 false cases had been instituted against him and his party workers till date. He said that he was continuing with his democratic struggle and hoped that the visiting representative would pay attention to Sindh. 
He said that the 1991 Water Accord was being violated and lands in Sindh had been degraded while its ecosystem stood destroyed. People of Sindh were being converted to a minority within their province and they were being killed extra-judicially. Recent floods had destroyed the entire infrastructure in Sindh displacing over two million people, he said. 
Ayaz Latif Palijo told Mr Jetton that women had been playing an important role in the development of US and Europe whereas successive governments in Pakistan had failed to ensure women empowerment. He said that it was imperative that women here were given equal opportunities in health, education and employment, adding that this segment was facing injustices in Sindh and Pakistan. 
He urged democratic forces to play their role for real democracy in Pakistan besides ensuring protection of fundamental rights. He said Pakistan had rendered tremendous sacrifices in the war against terrorism and this must be acknowledged. He said that Pakistan’s autonomy should be respected.  
Despite having vital natural resources, Pakistan and Sindh were facing unemployment, hunger and starvation, he wondered. 
“Artificial floods had caused widespread destructions in Sindh this year,” said Mr Palijo, and appreciated assistance from USAID in this regard. He also called for audit of the assistance provided by foreign donors for victims of floods.
