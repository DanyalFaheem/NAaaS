0,Turkiye fumes at Sweden in Nato membership dispute,ISTANBUL: Turkiye on Tuesday lashed out at Sweden’s refusal to extradite a top reporter that Ankara has demanded ...,"ISTANBUL: Turkiye on Tuesday lashed out at Sweden’s refusal to extradite a top reporter that Ankara has demanded in exchange for its ratification of Stockholm’s Nato membership bid.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Sweden to return dozens of people that he suspects either of involvement in a failed 2016 coup or of membership of a banned Kurdish militia that Washington and the European Union designate as  “terrorists”.
But the now-closed Today’s Zaman newspaper’s editor-in-chief Bulent Kenes was the only person Erdogan has singled out by name.
Sweden’s Supreme Court cited the risk of Turkiye’s  “persecution based on this person’s political beliefs” when it blocked the request on Monday.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the ruling threatened to derail hard-fought progress that the sides have made through months of delicate talks.
“The rejection of our request for the extradition of Bulent Kenes is a very negative development,” Cavusoglu told reporters.
Cavusoglu stressed that Sweden’s extradition earlier this month of one man suspected of membership of a banned Kurdish insurgency group was insufficient to win Turkiye’s approval.
“If they expect that they can return one person and then close this affair, this is not realistic,” Cavusoglu said.
“We no longer want to hear good words from Sweden and Finland, we want to see concrete steps.” Sweden and Finland broke with decades of military non-alignment and decided to apply for Nato membership in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Turkiye and Hungary remain the only Nato member states to have failed to ratify the Nordic neighbours’ applications.
Cavusoglu said he would have more discussions about the dispute during a visit to Ankara on Thursday by Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom.
Most of Turkiye’s demands have involved Sweden because of its more robust ties with the Kurdish diaspora.
Sweden keeps no official ethnicity statistics but is believed to have 100,000 Kurds living in the nation of 10 million people.
Some analysts believe Erdogan is holding up the ratification as a bargaining chip in a broader diplomatic standoff with the United States.

1,Gambian body blames Indian firm for 70 child deaths,Gambian lawmakers say India-based drug maker is responsible for the deaths of at least 70 children from acute kidney injury.,"DAKAR: A parliamentary committee in Gambia said on Tuesday that India-based drug maker Maiden Phar­maceuticals was responsible for the deaths of at least 70 children from acute kidney injury and called on the government to pursue legal action.
The World Health Organisation said in October four medicinal syrups made by Maiden and imported by a local wholesaler were likely linked to the deaths, which have shocked the West African country since July. The drugs were pulled from the shelves and Maiden’s production licence in India was suspended.
According to the WHO, lab analysis confirmed  “unacceptable” amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol in the medicines made by Maiden.
After its investigation, Gambia’s select committee on health reached a similar conclusion. “All the cases of AKI are linked to the consumption of contaminated medical products...manufactured by Maiden Pharm­aceuticals,” the committee’s chairperson Amadou Camara said in a statement to parliament.

Cases are soaring across China, with hospitals struggling and pharmacy shelves stripped bare in the wake of the government’s sudden decision to lift years of lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing.
The United States has warned the outbreak is now of concern to the rest of the world, given the potential for further mutations and the size of China’s economy. From the country’s northeast to its southwest, crematorium workers said they are struggling to keep up with a surge in deaths.
In Chongqing — a city of 30 million where authorities this week urged people with mild Covid symptoms to go to work — one worker said their crematorium had run out of space to keep bodies. “The number of bodies picked up in recent days is many times more than previously,” a staffer who did not give their name said.
“We are very busy, there is no more cold storage space for bodies,” they added. “We are not sure (if it’s related to Covid), you need to ask the leaders in charge.” 
In the southern megapolis of Guangzhou, an employee at one crematorium in Zengcheng district said they were cremating more than 30 bodies a day.
“We have bodies assigned to us from other districts. There’s no other option,” the employee said. Another crematorium in the city said they were also  “extremely busy”.
“It’s three or four times busier than in previous years, we are cremating over 40 bodies per day when before it was only a dozen or so,” a staffer said.

3,23 still missing after sinking of Thai ship,"“We will keep going until the mission is complete and we bring our people back,” says naval official.","PRACHUAP KHAN: Six bodies have been found and one survivor was rescued on Tuesday, after the sinking of a naval vessel two days ago in the Gulf of Thailand, the Thai navy said.
Seventy-six sailors from the HTMS Sukhothai have been hauled from the sea after the vessel went down late on Sunday roughly 37 kilometres off the country’s southeastern coast. There were 23 personnel still missing, a navy spokesperson said.
Helicopters, two planes, and four ships — the HTMS Kraburi, HTMS Angthong, HTMS Naresuan and HTMS Bhumibol Adulyadej — continued searching for survivors on Tuesday.
The bodies of four men were recovered, comman­der-in-chief of the Royal Thai Navy Choe­ngchai Cho­mch­oengpaet told a press conference in Bangkok. The navy later revised the toll upwards to six dead.
“We will keep going until the mission is complete and we bring our people back,” Choengchai said.
A helicopter transported the deceased to a naval pier late on Tuesday night, where a fleet of ambulances waited to take them to a local hospital for autopsies. The Sukhothai was carrying extra personnel as it was joining an anniversary celebration of the navy’s founder, said Choengchai, admitting that there were insufficient life jackets onboard. “Having a life vest doesn’t mean you won’t die,” he said.
Admiral Chonlathis Navanugraha called the incident  “one of the most severe tragedies” in the navy’s history.
The vessel — a corvette, the smallest type of military warship — ran into trouble after its electronics system was damaged. 
“Crews pumped out the water, but it flowed in quickly, leaving the  ship heeling at a 60-degree angle,” commander-in-chief Choengchai said  at a Bangkok press conference.

4,Putin admits situation extremely difficult in Russia-annexed Ukraine,Putin orders forces to step up surveillance of the country’s borders to combat the “emergence of new threats” from abroad.,"KYIV: Russian President Vladimir Putin said the situation in four areas of Ukraine that Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia was proving  “extremely difficult”, one of his clearest public admissions yet that his invasion is not going to plan.
He also called for an increase in surveillance in his comments to mark Security Services Day in Russia on Tuesday. They followed a visit to close ally Belarus that fuelled fears, dismissed by the Kremlin, that the country could help Russia open a new invasion front against Ukraine.
Kyiv renewed calls for more weapons after Russian drones hit energy targets in a third air strike on power facilities in six days.
Putin ordered the Federal Security Services (FSB) to step up surveillance of Russian society and the country’s borders to combat the  “emergence of new threats” from abroad and traitors at home.
Western countries have imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia and the rouble slumped to an over seven-month low against the dollar on Tuesday after the European Union agreed to cap prices of gas, a major Russian export.
In a rare admission of the invasion of Ukraine not going smoothly, Putin cautioned about the difficult situation in regions of Ukraine that Moscow moved to annex in September and ordered the FSB to ensure the  “safety” of people living there.
“The situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions is extremely difficult,” Putin said in a video address to security workers.
There are conflicting views in Russia on whether or not to launch a renewed  offensive in Ukraine, a senior US State Department official said on  Tuesday, reiterating that Washington would keep backing Kyiv regardless  of which scenario plays out.
US sees ‘conflicting’ views
The 10-month-old conflict prompted by  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has spiraled into the largest in Europe  since World War Two, and has killed tens of thousands of people, driven  millions from their homes and reduced cities to ruins.
But  Russia’s invasion has faltered badly since the summer with a string of  losses to a Ukrainian counteroffensive that retook swaths of occupied  territory and forced Moscow into a partial mobilisation of 300,000 more  troops.
“Certainly, there are some (within Russia) who I think  would want to pursue (new) offensives in Ukraine. There are others who  have real questions about the capacity for Russia to actually do that,”  the State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,  told reporters in Washington.
Russia is suffering  “significant”  shortages of ammunition, posing a serious problem along the war’s front  lines, the official said, and those that Moscow has called up to join  its combat forces were often not  “cohesive” units.
“There are all  sorts of things that the Russians are dealing with in terms of having  the necessary equipment, having the necessary ammunition that put some  constraints on what they may want to do,” the official said.
President  Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday visited the eastern frontline city of  Bakhmut, now the epicentre of fighting in Russia’s nearly 10-month  invasion of Ukraine.
Zelensky visits frontline city
Zelensky met military officials and handed  out awards to Ukrainian servicemen, who have been holding back a fierce  and months-long Russian campaign for the city.
To gain control of  the city, Russia is believed to have relied on mercenaries, prison  conscripts and newly mobilised soldiers to send waves of attacks against  Ukrainian positions.
The brutal trench warfare and artillery  battles around Bakhmut — once known for its vineyards and cavernous  salt mines — have flattened large portions of the city and its  surroundings.

The Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA), a power-broker holding three seats in the hung parliament, announced on Tuesday it had decided to form a coalition with Sitiveni Rabuka’s People’s Alliance and the National Federation Party.
The decision came after two days of deliberations and rival presentations by former Prime Minister Bainimarama and the People’s Alliance party, after a national election last week resulted in a deadlock. At a livestreamed news conference, Rabuka thanked the people of Fiji. “They have voted for change and we have given them that,” he said.
National Federation Party leader Biman Prasad told reporters:  “Today the leaders of the People’s Alliance party, the National Federation Party and the Social Democratic Liberal Party agreed to form a new government.”  He said Rabuka would become the new prime minister of Fiji under the deal, and a  “strong and united coalition government” was a Christmas present to the people of Fiji.

6,Jury finds Harvey Weinstein guilty of Hollywood rape,LOS ANGELES: Disgraced US movie titan Harvey Weinstein was convicted on Monday of the rape and sexual assault of a...,"LOS ANGELES: Disgraced US movie titan Harvey Weinstein was convicted on Monday of the rape and sexual assault of a woman a decade ago, in what prosecutors said was part of his  “reign of terror” over aspiring young actresses in Hollywood.
The 70-year-old  “Pulp Fiction” producer, who was once one of the most powerful men in the film industry, faces up to 24 years in jail, in addition to a sentence he is already serving for sex crimes in New York.
His victim in the Los Angeles case said she hopes he  “never sees the outside of a prison cell during his lifetime.”  “Harvey Weinstein forever destroyed a part of me that night in 2013 and I will never get that back,” the woman, identified during the trial as Jane Doe #1, said in a statement.
A weeks-long trial heard graphic descriptions of encounters between the once-powerful producer and women who were trying to make their way in the world of movies.
Prosecutors painted a picture of a predatory ogre, who for years used his physical size and his professional prowess to rape and abuse women with impunity. His victims were left terrorised and afraid for their careers if they spoke out against a man who dominated Tinseltown, prosecutors said.
Rumors of Weinstein’s impropriety had circulated in Hollywood for years, but his position at the apex of the industry meant few were prepared to challenge him.
That all changed in 2017 with the publication of bombshell allegations against him, ushering in the #MeToo movement and opening the floodgates for women to speak out against sexual violence in the workplace. Dozens of women have since alleged they were victims of Weinstein.
His convictions in New York, which landed him with a 23-year jail term, were followed by charges in Los Angeles, ultimately relating to four women.
On Monday after two weeks of deliberation, a jury convicted him of three of the seven counts he faced — all relating to Jane Doe #1 in a Beverly Hills hotel room in February 2013. The eight men and four women on the panel acquitted him of one charge of sexual battery by restraint involving another woman.
They did not reach a verdict on charges relating to the alleged assaults of two other women, one of whom was identified by her lawyers as Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the wife of California Governor Gavin Newsom. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lisa Lench declared a mistrial on those counts.
Weinstein faces up to 18 years in prison for the counts on which he was convicted, but aggravating factors could increase that to 24 years. Attorneys will be back in court on Tuesday for arguments as to sentencing.
‘Despicable behavior’ 
Siebel Newsom welcomed the verdicts. “Harvey Weinstein will never be able to rape another woman,” she said.
“He will spend the rest of his life behind bars where he belongs. Harvey Weinstein is a serial predator and what he did was rape.” Siebel Newsom said that  “throughout the trial, Weinstein’s lawyers used sexism, misogyny and bullying tactics to intimidate, demean and ridicule us survivors. This trial was a stark reminder that we as a society have work to do.” 
The Oscar-winning producer had denied all the charges, with his attorney seeking to portray accusers either as liars who never had sex with his client, or as women who willingly lay on the casting couch, swapping sex for a leg up in the competitive world of filmmaking.

7,London’s Arabic bookshop to shut after 45 years,Al Saqi Books is another victim of the pandemic and the economic upheaval in the UK.,"LONDON: Salwa Gaspard gazes fondly at the hundreds of Arabic-language books displayed on dark wooden shelves, putting some back in place while exchanging a few words with customers.
In just a few days’ time, her London bookshop, known to literary enthusiasts throughout the Middle East, will close for good.
Al Saqi Books is another victim of the pandemic, and the economic upheaval in the UK and Lebanon, from where Gaspard and her husband Andre’s publishing house prints and ships most of its books.
Since they opened the bookshop in a white colonnaded building not far from Paddington railway station in west London in 1978, it has become a must-see for visitors from the Middle East.


A photograph taken on December 14, 2022 shows a general view of the Middle Eastern specialist bookshop, Al Saqi Books, in Bayswater, west London, on December 14, 2022. — AFP

 
“They would go to Oxford Street (the main shopping street), to Knightsbridge (the area around the famous Harrods shop) and to Al Saqi,” she said. In Arabic, Al Saqi means a water carrier in the desert, the 74-year-old bookseller said, describing it as a  “perfect name”.
“We thought it was a very nice name for a bookshop, because we were carrying Arabic culture,” she added.
The bookshop also sells English-language publications on the Arab world  “to give them a different idea of the Middle East, which is not about the violent images they see on TV, or they read in the newspaper”, she said.
The bookshop’s success helped the couple to set up a publishing company, initially translating Arab works into English, such as  “The Crusades Through Arab Eyes” by French-Lebanese author Amin Maalouf.
For more than 40 years, many writers have come to the London bookshop to present their works, including Syrian poet Adonis.
It also became a meeting place, even a  “refuge”, for those uprooted by conflict and turmoil in the Middle East.

RAMALLAH: A senior Palestinian militant jailed for life by Israel, and who was cited by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in a speech to the United Nations, died of cancer on Tuesday, authorities said.
Nasser Abu Hmaid, co-founder of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an armed wing of Abbas’s Fatah movement, had been convicted of killing seven Israelis and planning other attacks. The Brigades is deemed a terrorist group in Israel and the West.
He was serving multiple life sentences and had been in prison since 2002.
In Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, armed members of Abbas’s Fatah faction rallied in the streets, some firing rifles into the air before they announced the formation of a new armed group called  “The Masked Lion”, a nom de guerre of Hmaid.
Abbas accused Israel of neglecting Abu Hmaid’s medical needs and held it responsible for his death, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA said. Israel’s Prisons Service said Abu Hmaid, 50, had received  “close and continuous treatment” for his lung cancer.
After Abu Hamid fell into a coma, the Prisons Service let his family visit him briefly on Monday, in the presence of guards, his mother told Voice of Palestine radio.
“Thank God, I and his brothers were able to see him and pay him farewell,” she said, adding that she hoped his body would be released for burial.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly in September, Abbas said Palestinians were telling  “the heroic prisoner Nasser Abu Hmaid and his companions that dawn is coming, and it is time for their chains to be broken”.
Ismail Haniyeh, the political chief of the rival Islamist Hamas group, mourned Hmaid’s death in a statement as  “a crime that will not go unpunished.”

9,Thousands without power after quake rattles California,"Earthquake causes numerous gas leaks, downed powerlines and at least one structure fire in Ferndale, local media report.","SAN FRANCISCO: A strong 6.4-magnitude earthquake that struck off the coast of northern California on Tuesday injured two people, damaged a bridge and several roads and left thousands of homes and businesses without power.
The earthquake struck at 2:34am local time and was about 10 miles (16.1 km) deep, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. It struck about 7.4 miles (12 km) west-southwest of Ferndale, California, a Humboldt County town home to about 1,400 people and located 261 miles (420 km) north of San Francisco and just south of Eureka.
The earthquake caused numerous gas leaks, downed powerlines and at least one structure fire in Ferndale, local media reported.
Two people were injured in Humboldt County, where widespread damage to roads and homes was reported, the sheriff’s office said on its website. One of those injured was a juvenile with a head injury and the other an older person with a broken hip, according to local media citing the sheriff’s office. It is unclear if the earthquake caused any deaths.
“Be prepared for aftershocks. Check gas and water lines for damages or leaks. Exercise caution if traveling,” the office said on Twitter.
Police have closed the Ferndale bridge over the Eel River in and out of Ferndale because of four large cracks in the bridge and the roadway is at risk of sliding, the California Highway Patrol said.
Officials have closed at least four roads in Humboldt County because of large cracks, some with the smell of natural gas in the area from a possible gas line rupture, the highway patrol said. One road section was reportedly sinking, the patrol said. Highway 101 and Highway 299 remained open through Humboldt County, State Senator Mike McGuire said on Twitter.
J. B. Mathers, a Eureka, California, resident told CBS News his home  “shook and shook and shook.”   “Anything that was on the walls broke off the walls — fish tank and all,” Mathers also said.  “It’s still pretty dark here.

10,Taliban ban university education for girls,"KABUL: The Taliban authorities on Tuesday ordered a nationwide ban on university education for females, as the...","KABUL: The Taliban authorities on Tuesday ordered a nationwide ban on university education for females, as the hardline Islamists continue to crush Afghan women’s right to education and freedom.
Despite promising a softer rule when they seized power last year, the Taliban have ratcheted up restrictions on all aspects of women’s lives, ignoring international outrage.
“You all are informed to immediately implement the mentioned order of suspending education of females until further notice,” said a letter issued to all government and private universities, signed by the Minister for Higher Education, Neda Mohammad Nadeem.
The spokesman for the ministry, Ziaullah Hashimi, who tweeted the letter, confirmed the order in a text message. The ban on higher education comes less than three months after thousands of girls and women sat university entrance exams across the country, with many aspiring to choose teaching and medicine as future careers.
After the takeover of the country by the Taliban, universities were forced to implement new rules including gender segregated classrooms and entrances, while women were only permitted to be taught by women professors or old men.
Most teenage girls across the country have already been banned from secondary school education, severely limiting university intake.
The Taliban adheres to an austere version of Islam, with the movement’s supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada and his inner circle of Afghan clerics against modern education, particularly for girls and women.
But they are at odds with many officials in Kabul and among their rank and file who had hoped girls would be allied to continue learning following the takeover.
Women have been pushed out of many government jobs — or are being paid a slashed salary to stay at home. They are also barred from travelling without a male relative, and must cover up outside of the home, ideally with a burqa.
In November they were also prohibited from going to parks, funfairs, gyms and public baths.
In a cruel U-turn, the Taliban in March blocked girls from returning to secondary schools on the morning they were supposed to reopen.
Several Taliban officials say the secondary education ban is only temporary, but they have also wheeled out a litany of excuses for the closure — from a lack of funds to time needed to remodel the syllabus along Islamic lines.
Since the ban, many teenage girls have been married off early — often to much older men of their father’s choice.
Coupled with economic pressure, several families interviewed last month said that securing their daughters’ future through marriage was better than them setting idle at home.
The international community has made the right to education for all women a sticking point in negotiations over aid and recognition of the Taliban regime.
“The international community has not and will not forget Afghan women and girls,” the UN Security Council said in a statement in September.
In the 20 years between the Taliban’s two reigns, girls were allowed to go to school and women were able to seek employment in all sectors, though the country remained socially conservative.

Musk responded to a suggestion from a Twitter Blue subscriber, who said only subscribers should get a vote on policy polls, with  “Good point. Twitter will make that change”, without specifying when the change would come into effect.
Musk said on Sunday he would abide by the results of the CEO poll, but did not give details on when he would step down if the results said he should. He has not yet named a successor for the role.
Twitter re-enabled Twitter Blue sign ups earlier this month, with accounts for individuals getting a blue check, while gold and gray check marks will denote business and government accounts. The monthly subscription price for the service is $8 on the web and $11 on Apple devices, respectively.

12,Taliban free two Americans in ‘goodwill gesture’,"""This was not part of any swap of prisoners or detainees. There was no money that exchanged hands,” says Ned Price.","WASHINGTON: The Taliban have freed two Americans in detention in Afghanistan, the State Department said on Tuesday, on the same day that the regime faced condemnation for banning women at universities. 
“This, we understand, to have been a goodwill gesture on the part of the Taliban. This was not part of any swap of prisoners or detainees. There was no money that exchanged hands,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. 
The two Americans were released to Qatar, which has played a key role supporting US interests in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover. 
Price said that confidentiality rules forbade him from offering more details on the two Americans. 
CNN reported that one of them was Ivor Shearer, a filmmaker arrested in August with his Afghan producer — whose fate is unclear — while filming the site of a US drone attack that killed Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. 
The release came on the same day that the Taliban banned women from universities, drawing strong condemnation from the United States, which warned it would impose costs on the regime. 
“The irony of them granting us a goodwill gesture on a day where they undertake a gesture like this to the Afghan people, it’s not lost on us.” Price said. “But it is a question for the Taliban themselves regarding the timing of this.” 
The United States has repeatedly condemned the Taliban’s track record since the militants swept back to power last year when President Joe Biden pulled out US troops, leading the two-decade-old Western-backed government to collapse.
But the Biden administration said that the Taliban were largely helpful during the takeover on letting out US citizens.
