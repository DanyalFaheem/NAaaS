KARACHI: Bears ran amok in the stock market on Tuesday as unending political chaos took a toll on sentiments.
Arif Habib Ltd said the benchmark index opened in the red zone as a sell-off plunged the benchmark by 1,437 points in intraday trading. Investors stayed on the sidelines while a majority of shares closed on the lower side.
A major cause of the downswing was that the ruling alliance at the federal level moved a no-trust resolution in a provincial assembly currently controlled by a coalition led by former premier Imran Khan’s party — a development that’ll further muddy the political waters. In addition, the news about the federal government increasing the electricity rates to placate the International Monetary Fund also dampened the sentiments, according to analyst Ahsan Mehanti.
As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 39,832.45 points, down 1,138.4 points or 2.8 per cent from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume increased 86.1pc to 265.3 million shares. The traded value went up 57.2pc to $29.1m on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom Ltd (33.6m shares), K-Electric Ltd (19.9m shares), Hascol Petroleum Ltd (12.5m shares), Cnergyico PK Ltd (10m shares) and Telecard Ltd (7.3m shares).
Sectors that contributed negatively to the index performance were technology and communication (191.1 points), commercial banking (104.8 points), exploration and production (100.3 points), cement (98.8 points) and fertiliser (94.1 points).
Companies registering the biggest increase in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs190), Bata Pakistan Ltd (Rs49.33), Colgate-Palmolive Pakistan Ltd (Rs16.66), Al-Ghazi Tractors Ltd (Rs16.57) and Gatron Industries Ltd (Rs10.10).
Companies that recorded the biggest declines in their share prices in absolute terms were Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs116), Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs90.28), Sanofi-Aventis Pakistan Ltd (Rs61), Reliance Cotton Spinning Mills Ltd (Rs30) and ICI Pakistan Ltd (Rs27.46).
Foreign investors were net sellers as they offloaded shares worth $0.61m.

1,WB okays $1.7bn for flood-hit Sindh,ISLAMABAD: The World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors has approved $1.692 billion in financing to Pakistan for...,"ISLAMABAD: The World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors has approved $1.692 billion in financing to Pakistan for five projects to support people living in flood-affected areas of Sindh.
According to an announcement by the Washington-based lending agency, three projects support rehabilitation and housing reconstruction and the restoration of crop production for vulnerable communities, while another two projects support health services for mothers and children.
“Sindh was the province worst affected by the 2022 floods. There was huge damage to the housing, health, and agriculture sectors and people lost their livelihoods. Beyond the rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged houses and infrastructure, our engagement in the flood response effort is an opportunity to strengthen resilience, and reform institutions and governance structures”, said Najy Benhassine, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.
The first project, Sindh Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project ($500 million) will help rehabilitate damaged infrastructure, provide short-term livelihood opportunities, and strengthen the government’s capacity to respond to disasters. The project will help restore and improve critical irrigation and flood protection infrastructure, water supply schemes, roads, and related infrastructure. 
The second project, Sindh Floods Emergency Housing Reconstruction Project ($500m) will support owner-driven and multi-hazard resilient reconstruction of core housing units. A housing subsidy will provide reconstruction and restoration grants for 350,000 housing units (almost 20pc of the total housing rehabilitation needs for Sindh). Cash grants will be provided for houses with structural damage to partially finance reconstruction or restoration. In addition, basic rainwater harvesting systems and twin pit latrines will be provided to improve access to water and sanitation.
The third project, Sindh Water and Agriculture Transformation Project ($292m) will increase agricultural water productivity, improve integrated water resources management, and restore crop production by flood-affected farmers. 
The fourth project, Sindh Strengthening Social Protection Delivery System Project ($200m) will strengthen the provincial social protection delivery system and enhance access to and utilisation of maternal and child health services. The project supports alignment and connectivity with the Federal National Database Registration Authority and will provide conditional cash transfers (CCTs) to 1.3m mothers and their children to support improved maternal and child health outcomes, particularly in the wake of service disruption after the floods. 
The 5th and last loan project, Sindh Integrated Health and Population Project ($200m) will help improve both the quality and utilisation of basic reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and nutrition services.

2,Ados Pakistan to go private next month,Ados Pakistan Ltd is going to delist from the PSX on Jan 9 after the bourse accepted its request for going private.,"KARACHI: Engineering firm Ados Pakistan Ltd is going to delist from the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Jan 9 after the bourse accepted its request on Thursday for going private.
Engaged in the supply of oil and gas field–related equipment, Ados grappled with “serious concerns” about its ability to continue its regular operations following low sales and “structural changes” in the energy exploration and production (E&P) industry.
The PSX’s Voluntary Delisting Committee approved in August the minimum buyback price of Rs29 per share. The exchange advised minority shareholders on Tuesday to approach the company’s sponsors if they want to participate in the share buy-back exercise.
The sponsors have already submitted an undertaking to the regulator under which they are bound to purchase the remaining shares held with minority shareholders at Rs29 apiece until Nov 17 next year.
The company’s current stock price is also Rs29 per share.
According to company CEO Zia Akbar Ansari, the sponsors are taking Ados private because they wish to protect the interest of the minority shareholders amid an “extremely uncertain” future.
The state-owned E&P companies stopped buying equipment from Ados after declaring it disqualified “on the basis of experience”. Declining sales and long-term net losses left the company unable to service the licensing and certification costs for its manufacturing licence from the American Petroleum Institute — a prerequisite for doing business with state-owned E&P firms.

3,TPL Properties inches closer to acquiring mobile tower company,"TPL has “conditionally accepted” the offer that a consortium for the purchase of 10,500-plus cellular sites in Pakistan.","KARACHI: TPL Properties Ltd said on Tuesday it has come close to concluding a deal to acquire a mobile infrastructure company.
The parent entity of a large telecom tower operator has “conditionally accepted” the offer that a consortium led by its subsidiary TPL REIT Management Company has made for the purchase of 10,500-plus cellular sites in Pakistan.
Even though the official announcement didn’t mention the transaction size, a source privy to the development said it’ll be worth “Rs100 billion-plus”.
A mobile infrastructure company owns and/or operates purpose-built towers with communication equipment that allows area residents to use wireless devices.
TPL Properties made no reference to the name of the counterparty, but a recent report by Bloomberg News quoted Veon Ltd CEO Kaan Terzioglu as saying that the global company that operates under the brand name of Jazz in Pakistan was trying to sell its mobile towers. The news story put the transaction size between $600 million and $960m based on the fact that a single tower was valued at around $60,000-$80,000.
The offer is subject to the signing of “definitive agreements” — a process that may take “one to two months,” the source told Dawn.
The other strategic investor in the consortium is TASC Towers, a UAE-based operator of more than 14,000 mobile telecom towers in multiple geographies.
The deal is backed by “one of the biggest banks” that’ll provide debt structuring advisory and arrangement services. Separately, the consortium’s strategic investors are holding discussions with “several international institutions to raise equity for the equity component required for the consummation of this transaction”. The two parties will also be exploring the opportunity to acquire more telecom tower assets soon.
Earlier this month, Engro Corporation Ltd also expressed interest in acquiring a mobile tower business without confirming if the business in question belonged to Veon Ltd (Jazz).
The total number of mobile towers in Pakistan is north of 40,000. Each mobile network operator (MNO) operates on average 10,000-11,000 towers. The four MNOs collectively operate more than 80pc of all mobile towers.
The rest of the infrastructure is operated by four independent tower companies. Engro Corporation already operates one such firm by the name of Enfrashare, with 2,246 towers across Pakistan.
In a recent briefing to stock market analysts, the conglomerate claimed Enfrashare dominates the non-MNO segment with a 49pc market share. The second big player in that segment is Edotco Pakistan with 1,860 towers.
If executed, the deal will reduce the share of Veon/Jazz in the mobile tower business to zero and let it focus on revenue streams that are central to its business.

5,Investors call for consistent economic policies,Pakistani diaspora in US highlights hurdles to investments.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pak­istani diaspora in the United States asked Islamabad on Tuesday to work out a long-term strategy to ensure predictability in policymaking along with ensuring ease of doing business to attract investment in the manufacturing sector.
The diaspora at a panel discussion on US-Pakistani Diaspora’s Commercial Investments in Pakistan shared current and future opportunities and challenges in sectors of construction, real estate, technology, tourism, hospitality, e-commerce and manufacturing.
The US Mission in Pakistan, through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and in close collaboration with the US-Pakistani diaspora, hosted a one-day engagement conference. More than 100 participants attended in person, including members of the US-Pakistani diaspora and prominent local business leaders.
 






Leading US-Pakistani businessmen identified a lack of consistency in policies, adequate energy, and improving ease of doing business to attract investments in Pakistan. It was also highlighted that there is no succession plan for a smooth transition of government as well as continuity of policies in Pakistan.

Pakistani diaspora in US highlights hurdles to investments

Prime Minister’s Ambassador at Large on Investments Zeeshan Shah agreed with most of the points highlighted especially the lack of consistency in policies. He said this is the outcome of an immature democratic government in Pakistan. The successive governments scrap previous governments’ policies, he deplored.
Mr Shah said this situation could be handled only through a long-term roadmap. “There is a need for a national charter of the economy”, he said, adding the charter will give certainty to economic policies.
It was also pointed out during the discussion that economic policies in Pakistan favour investments in real estate and encourage imports of finished goods. There is no effective plan to encourage investments in the manufacturing sector in Pakistan.
At the conference, United States Embassy Chargé d’Affaires Andrew Schofer emphasised that the United States considers the US-Pakistani diaspora as a key partner in the humanitarian, social, and commercial sectors in Pakistan.
Mr Schofer highlighted the long history of the US and Pakistan working together to advance Pakistan’s economic growth and solve development challenges. He also highlighted opportunities for future partnership: “As the Green Revolution improved lives in the past, a ‘Green Alliance’ between the US and Pakistan will help us jointly strengthen climate resilience, develop clean energy alternatives, and foster economic growth”.
The conference showcased key contributions and investments by the US-Pakistani diaspora in the humanitarian, social, and commercial sectors, and explored avenues for future joint engagements.
At the closing session, USAID signed two partnership memoranda of understanding with US-Pakistani diaspora entities: one with Datarocx to set up digital centers in Pakistan in the Special Technology Zones and the other with Global Semiconductor Group and HUM Network Limited for Pakistan Katalytic Fund to improve access to growth capital for established businesses in the technology sector.

7,Senate panel seeks record of KE privatisation as CEO skips meetings,Committee member vow to hold company’s management answerable to people.,"• Committee members also displeased over absence of power minister
• Vow to hold company’s management answerable to people
ISLAMABAD: Displeased at the continued absence of the power minister and K-Electric’s chief executive from its meetings, a Senate panel on Tuesday sought a complete record of the original privatisation and subsequent changes to the shareholding structure of Karachi’s power utility and vowed to hold its management answerable to the city’s people.
The committee, led by Senator Saifullah Abro, also unanimously decided to take up with the Senate chairman the continuous absence of Power Minister Khurram Dastgir Khan and KE Chief Executive Officer Moonis Alvi from the committee’s meetings.
The members, particularly Mr Abro, argued that since the government had a 24.36pc shareholding in KE, its management was answerable to the parliament and the people of Pakistan, and the committee would make sure Mr Alvi was held accountable.
“He is so powerful that he says he is not accountable to the parliament. We are trying to make him accountable to the people,” Mr Abro said, adding that KE might be independent to the extent of its private shareholding, but it was answerable for the government stake.
KE’s chief regulatory affairs, Imran Qureshi, told the committee that the company’s CEO had not turned up because of medical reasons, but many members said it was a constant excuse to avoid the panel’s meetings, as the KE’s CEO had been engaged in other activities.
After Mr Qureshi struggled to respond to various questions on his presentation and repeatedly requested to get back with such information after consulting the head office, the committee directed Mr Qureshi and the power division’s additional secretary to ensure that the KE chief should answer all questions raised in the next meeting on Monday.
The committee members showed displeasure that an executive among the top eight in the company and appearing on behalf of the CEO was unprepared for a single-point agenda because many issues were beyond his jurisdiction, unlike the CEO, who must be well-versed in all affairs.
Mr Qureshi told the committee that since its privatisation in 2005, the company earned its first profit in 2012 and had made a foreign direct investment of $700 million. The company, he said, had made a total investment of Rs474bn in the power infrastructure as of the 2021-22 fiscal year. He, however, couldn’t give an annual breakdown of investments.
He also could not provide investment details of six projects he reported to have been established after the privatisation — including Korangi Combined Cycle, Korangi Gas Turbine, SITE Gas Turbine, Bin Qasim Power Station (BQPS) II, BQPS III, and Port Qasim — with a total capacity of around 1,870 megawatts.
Senator Saifullah Abro questioned why K-Electric was still unable to meet Karachi’s energy requirement despite producing 1,870MW with an additional 1,100MW supply from the government.
He inquired the KE officials about the cost incurred on these power projects and details relating to the power purchase agreement (PPA) of K-Electric with the government.
Representatives of the power division also told the committee that the power supply to KE from the national grid had been increased from the original 650MW to 1,100MW through a revised agreement, but they failed to satisfy when and who signed the revised PPA.
A backbencher quipped that there was no PPA between KE and the federal government on 1,100MW and even the original 650MW agreement had expired many years ago.
Mr Abro expressed dissatisfaction over the briefing and directed the power division officials to provide a comprehensive briefing in the next meeting and come up with responses and documentation about the PPAs in the next meeting.
Senior officials of the Priva­tisation Commission told the committee that the government decided in 1992 with a strategic plan for the commercialisation and privatisation of the power sector. K-Electric was facing losses for the last 13 years, including Rs16.4bn in 2001, Rs17.7bn in 2002, and Rs14.4bn in 2003.
The company’s privatisation started in 2001 but could not be completed as a suitable buyer was unavailable.
The process was again initiated in 2003 and the contract was awarded to a consortium led by private equity firm Hasan Associates with a bid of Rs15.86bn — at Rs1.65 apiece for the 9.6 million shares — after the successful bidder of Saudi Arabia’s Kanooz Al-Watan declined to pay the bid money and take over the company.
Hasan Associates agreed to match the highest bid, although it had originally offered Rs1.1 per share (or Rs10.5bn).
Moreover, the matter relating to electricity provided to Balochistan’s agricultural sector for tube wells was also taken up amid complaints that KE and the Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco) were charging electricity bills for tube wells that were not even functional.
