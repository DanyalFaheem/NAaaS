0,Babar rues lack of experience after Pakistan’s first-ever home whitewash,"“The bowling was not the same as our previous series,” he says.","KARACHI: Babar Azam rued the absence of experienced players at his disposal after his Pakistan side became the first to suffer a  whitewash in  a Test series at home.
Needing just 55 to win on Tuesday — the penultimate day of the third Test — here at the National Stadium, England finished the job in less than an hour to win the series 3-0.
Resuming at 112-2, the visitors took just 38 minutes to reach the modest 167-run target as opener Bun Duckett and captain Ben Stokes finished unbeaten at 82 and 35 respectively.
Pakistan were coming into the Karachi Test on the back of 74 and 27-run defeats in Rawalpindi and Multan respectively in what was England’s first Test tour to the country since 2005.
Already without pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi — who is nursing a knee injury — the Babar-led unit lost fast bowlers Haris Rauf and Naseem Shah, also due to injuries, after the first Test.
They fielded six debutants over the course of the series, including Haris — a T20 mainstay. The hosts also handed debuts to pacers Mohammad Ali and Mohammad Wasim along with spinners Abrar Ahmed and Zahid Mahmood and batter Saud Shakeel.
Apart from Saud and Abrar, who was capped in the second Test, no other debutants were able to make an impact. 
“The bowling was not the same as our previous series,” Babar said during the post-match press conference.  “Our main fast bowlers Shaheen, Hasan [Ali], Naseem and Haris got injured.  
“When you don’t have that backbone and new players come in its not easy for them. The way England play, they don’t let you settle.”
Babar admitted Pakistan’s Test side was in a rebuilding stage and that the group needed time to emerge as a formidable red-ball unit. 
“There is a need to build this team because there have been three-four debuts in this series,” said the right-hander. “You need experience in Test matches and our experienced players were unfit or out of form.   
“When you give new players a chance it takes time for them to improve.  
“This series was full of difficulties; there is a lot of difference between new and experienced players.”
Unlike his English counterpart, Babar’s captaincy throughout the series did not pose much threat to the opposition. The 27-year-old has been under criticism for not being able pressurise the hosts with attacking field placements and smart bowling changes.
Babar, however, shrugged off any possibility of him stepping down as the Pakistan skipper. 
“Captaincy is a matter of honour for me. I will do whatever best I can for my country and for myself,” he said.  
“I enjoy it more when under pressure and it doesn’t affect my batting.” added Babar, who suffered his sixth defeat in 16 Tests as captain.
WHITEWASH ‘PRETTY SPECIAL’
For England skipper Stokes, becoming the first team to whitewash Pakistan on the hosts’ home turf was an unbelievable achievement. 
“It won’t really sink in until we get home or in the new year,” Stokes said after securing what was only England’s second series whitewash in the subcontinent following a similar result in Sri Lanka in 2018. 
“I know it’s a cliched thing, but being out in the subcontinent is one of the hardest places to do it,” Stokes said. “I understand, and we understand, what we’ve done is pretty special... to win 3-0 out here, it will be something to be really proud of.” 
Pakistan had prepared slow, turning pitches to counter England, who predominantly depend on pace to take wickets.
Stokes’ out-of-the-box thinking, however, helped the visitors thrive in conditions they are not used to and the all-rounder said how his tactics worked was “the best thing”.
He was full of praise for all his team members. 
“I think everyone who has played has, at some point throughout the series, put their hand up and contributed to us winning a game,” said Stokes.

1,Comment: Clueless Pakistan touch new low in England drubbing,"Unprepared Pakistan drastically misjudged England’s stre­ngth as well as their intentions, and consequently paid a heavy price.","AN unprepared Pakistan drastically misjudged England’s stre­ngth as well as their intentions, and consequently paid the heaviest price ever at the National Stadium. The first-ever clean sweep at home is going to be extremely damaging for the hosts who suffered their fourth consecutive Test loss in their backyard on Tuesday.
Firmly embracing the novel ‘Bazball’ mindset since May this year, England on the other hand continue to enjoy purple patch, the resounding eight-wicket victory in Karachi was their ninth in the last 10 Tests. Perhaps Babar Azam and Saqlain Mushtaq overlooked the fact that before arriving in Pakistan, the Ben Stokes-led team this year had won Test matches against world champions New Zealand, South Africa and India. 
For Babar-led Pakistan, who have had a nasty 2022 as far as Test cricket is concerned, many tough questions await. With a sole victory — amid five losses — in eight Tests (six of which were held at home) in their pocket, Pakistan have dipped alarmingly before touching a new low yesterday at the National Stadium which otherwise has remained a prolific arena for the hosts for decades.
A genuine appraisal, focused inwardly, is the need of the hour.
It is not that simple, however. The jigsaw of anomalies and loopholes hurting Pakistan cricket are many and run deep. Yet the set of long-held irregularities look very obvious. The consequences have now started to emerge. It is indeed puzzling as well as disturbing!
After having lost the three-match home series to Australia 1-0 with an age-old recipe featuring featherbed pitches earlier this year, the Pakistan think-tank simply failed to learn, at least surface-related lessons and continued with the same run-of the-mill practice against England. 
The hosts carried a confusion-laden approach throughout the England series which was played on three different types of tracks. The strip in Rawalpindi was dead, Multan was sporting with a bit for everybody and Karachi was a turner.
Yet England’s crystal clear plans were not at all hampered by this variance. They had “no interest in playing draws”, as Stokes had declared after winning the Rawalpindi Test while stumped Pakistan were caught off guard. 
While accepting, to some extent, Babar’s justification in his post-match presser in Karachi that his team largely comprised inexperienced youngsters — due to injuries to a number of players — one may ask the captain: how then England’s young leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed managed to take seven wickets on his debut in an away series? How did Harry Brook, with experience of just one Test prior to the Pakistan series, amass 468 runs (averaging 93.6, three centuries) at a totally unfamiliar territory to earn the man-of-the-series honour? Is it a surprise that opener Ben Duckett, having played just four Tests before coming to Pakistan succeeded in smashing 357 runs in the series at a healthy 71.4?
And what about middle-order Saud Shakeel who in his debut Test series cracked 346 at a notable 57.66? His exploits along with those of mystery leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed (17 wickets, averaging 27.17) is a testimony to the fact that giving appropriate and timely chance to promising youngsters on the domestic circuit eventually pay rich dividends to the team at the international level. When a specific domestic cricketing system is in place and operating it should be duly patronised by the stakeholders concerned.
Talking about injuries to Pakistan’s frontline fast bowlers, one can surely recall it all started in July this year with spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi suffering a knee problem which exacerbated during the all-important T20 World Cup final potentially ruling him out of the entire series against England. Shaheen was followed by Naseem Shah who missed the last two Tests against England after developing a shoulder niggle during the Test in Rawalpindi. Haris Rauf, having no experience of Tests, was out of the blue fielded against the formidable England on a lifeless Rawalpindi track. He missed the remaining two Tests due to an unexpected injury incurred during a practice session.
The Pakistan team management amid heaps of white-ball games, perhaps, has no idea on how to adjust the workloads, particularly of fast bowlers. 
It seems no lessons were learned by the management when Shaheen finally crumbled mainly after playing non-stop cricket in all formats. Naseem wilted after bowling on an ultra-docile Rawalpindi pitch. Is Pakistan cricket system ready to blunt its own pace bowlers by keep laying batting paradises? 
Fragile batting has remained a perennial headache for Pakistan team management which it seems never devises solid plans for future. Had it done so, then one reckons a fading Azhar Ali would have been shown the door after this year’s home series against Australia. Whereas England after bagging the series in Multan axed their 177-Test stalwart James Anderson for the Karachi game, definitely for the team’s cause, and the move resulted in a historic triumph for the tourists. Can we ever expect our team management to think out of the box and make a change like this? A big no, I reckon, not in the near future at least.
The aging Azhar, who had lost his focus even on slow Sri Lankan tracks, never deserved to play against England in Karachi but again ‘seniority’ and ‘experience’ somehow prevailed that compromised the team’s interest. Imagine how beneficial it would have been for Pakistan had left-handed Saud been picked for the two-Test away series against Sri Lanka earlier this year. Alas, it was not to be!
Last but not the least, one thinks the hosts blundered by retaining Mohammad Rizwan, who struggled with the bat in the first two Tests, for the inconsequential match in Karachi. By giving former captain Sarfaraz Ahmed a chance would have tested him besides giving Rizwan, who has operated without a break for a while, a much-needed break to recuperate.
Babar, his charges, Saqlain and the entire coaching staff need to sit down and go back to the drawing board before the Tim Southee-led New Zealand squad lands in Karachi. While the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials are advised to wake up and make solid and futuristic changes, particularly on pitch making, before it gets too late.

2,Vettori stumped as Warner delivers wrong’un with Bali joke,MELBOURNE: Austr­alia opener David Warner may have lost form with the bat but showed on Tuesday his sense of humour...,"MELBOURNE: Austr­alia opener David Warner may have lost form with the bat but showed on Tuesday his sense of humour remains intact as he sent officials scrambling with a social media post suggesting he was holidaying in Bali in the lead-up to the ‘Boxing Day’ Test.
Warner posted pictures of himself and his children on a plane with the caption:  “My current situation. Bali here we come”.
Australia bowling coach Daniel Vettori was asked by reporters whether a trip to the Indonesian tourist destination was the ideal preparation for the second Test against South Africa at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
New Zealander Vettori grinned and asked:  “Is that true?”  Another team official was quick to express doubt about the trip but said he would find out.
Warner later put the issue to bed with another social media post.
“For those who are concerned I’m currently walking Coogee beach ... and will be heading to the grocery store after. Until then stay tuned,” he wrote, referring to the Sydney beach near his home.
Warner is set to play his 100th Test at the MCG but his declining output has led to speculation he might retire from the format after the New Year’s Test in Sydney.
Selectors, however, said he is part of Australia’s plans for the tour of India starting in Feb­r­uary and have backed him to find runs against the Proteas.

3,Removing fear of failure has helped England: McCullum,"""What we have seen over the last 7-8 months is that skill and talent is not in question with this England side,"" he says.","

PAKISTAN captain Babar Azam (R) with his England counterpart Ben Stokes after the third Test.—White Star

 
KARACHI: England head coach Brendon McCullum said removing the fear of failure has helped the talent in his team come through after they became the first test side to complete a 3-0 whitewash in Pakistan on Tuesday.
England comfortably chased a target of 167 to win the third and final match in Karachi, adding to their wins in Rawalpindi and Multan.
The high-risk high-reward approach that has brought England nine wins from 10 Tests has been dubbed ‘Bazball’ in a nod to McCullum’s style but the New Zealander shifted the credit to new captain Ben Stokes. 
“The side is very much in the image of the skipper,” McCullum told Sky Sports. “He wants the guys to go out there and play with as much freedom as they can. 
“He has identified that taking away that pressure and fear of failure allows the talent to come out. 
“And what we have seen over the last seven to eight months is that skill and talent is not in question with this England side.”  
That fearlessness is not limited to the pitch, however, with McCullum also showing some moxie on the sidelines.
After a shirt he had signed for a fan got stuck at the top of a chain link fence on Monday, the 41-year-old head coach wasted no time in scaling the barrier to retrieve it before throwing it over the other side.
Prior to the tour, England had won only two Tests in Pakistan and it was their first series win in the country since 2000-2001.
McCullum said he was “incredibly proud” of the team.
He also praised 18-year-old Rehan Ahmed, who became the youngest bowler in men’s Test history to take a five-wicket haul on debut. 
“He’s got a real future,” McCullum said. “He’s been on the radar for English cricket. It took some courage from Stokes to thrust him into this side. The more we’re willing to do that, the better for us.”

4,ICC rates Gabba pitch ‘below average’ after two-day Test,BRISBANE: Brisbane’s Gabba cricket ground has received one demerit point after the International Cricket Council...,"BRISBANE: Brisbane’s Gabba cricket ground has received one demerit point after the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Tuesday rated the pitch for the first Test between Australia and South Africa — which ended in two days —  “below average”.
Australia got the win in Brisbane in very fast time, batting marginally better than the Proteas on a perilous, grassy pitch, with South Africa captain Dean Elgar saying he had asked the umpires if the green Gabba wicket was unsafe for playing.
“Overall, the Gabba pitch for this Test match was too much in favour of the bowlers,” said Richie Richardson, a member of the governing body’s elite panel of match referees.
“There was extra bounce and occasional excessive seam movement. The odd delivery also kept low on the second day, making it very difficult for batters to build partnerships.”
Venues can be suspended for a year if they pick up five demerit points and for two years if they pick up 10. Demerit points remain active for a rolling five-year period.
The second Test of the series will be played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from Dec 26.

5,India eye clean sweep over Bangladesh,DHAKA: India will look to steamroll a plucky but inconsistent Bangladesh in the second Test starting on Thursday in...,"DHAKA: India will look to steamroll a plucky but inconsistent Bangladesh in the second Test starting on Thursday in Dhaka to cement their standing in the ICC Test Championship.
The visitors will however again be without injured skipper Rohit Sharma after he missed the first Test with an injured thumb, the Indian cricket board said Tuesday.
India are currently second in the Test Championship league table behind Australia, who are currently 1-0 up against South Africa in a three-match series at home.
The current cycle runs to June 2023, with the nine teams each playing six series. The top two sides will meet in the final at the Oval in London.
India beat Bangladesh in the first Test in Chittagong by 188 runs but the visitors, led by KL Rahul in the absence of Rohit, had to work hard for the victory.
Set a monumental target of 513 runs, Bangladesh put up a strong fight with Zakir Hasan and Najmul Hossain sharing a record opening partnership of 124.
Debutant Zakir made 100 and skipper Shakib Al Hasan added 84 but India kept their cool and got the win, with Axar Patel taking four wickets and Kuldeep Yadav — the player of the match — grabbing three.
“That’s Test cricket. You are never going to get a win that is easy. We have played enough cricket to understand that there will be phases when the opposition plays well and you need to respect that,” Rahul said.
Cheteshwar Pujara scored 90 and 102 not out in two innings, while Shubman Gill also recorded his maiden Test hundred in the second innings.
Bangladesh, bottom of the table in the Test championship with just one win from 11 matches, were left ruing their dismal first innings.
“The most disappointing thing is the poor decision-making from the batters,” said coach Russell Domingo.
“There’s a lack of confidence in the top order. They are not managing to find a way to get out of the slump,” he said.
Bangladesh will see at least one change in their line-up after pace bowler Ebadot Hossain was ruled out with a back injury.
The hosts called up uncapped left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed, although a team official said a call would be made later on whether he or fit-again Taskin Ahmed would replace Ebadot.
Bangladesh squad: Zakir Hasan, Najmul Hossain, Mominul Haque, Yasir Ali, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan (capt), Liton Das, Nurul Hasan, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Taijul Islam, Taskin Ahmed, Khaled Ahmed, Mah­m­udul Hasan, Rejaur Rahman Raja.
Indian squad: KL Rahul (capt), Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant, KS Bharat, Ravichandran Ashwin, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Shardul Thakur, Mohammed Siraj, Umesh Yadav, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Saurabh Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat.

This affiliation is in line with the PSB Rules 2022, a PBBF spokesman said in a statement.
According to the spokesman, the decision to grant affiliation was taken during the 26th PSB Board meeting held under the chairmanship of Federal Minis­ter for Inter-provincial Coordination (IPC) Ehsan-ur-Rehman Mazari, who is also PSB president.
Under its president retired Brig Brigadier Moh­a­m­mad Iftikhar Mansoor and secretary general Khalid Bashir, the PBBF is playing an active role for promoting basketball in the country. The PBBF is also recognised by the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA), International Olympics Committee (IOC), Intern­ational Basketball Federa­tion (FIBA) and FIBA Asia.
Recently, the PBBF organised events for men and women and is planning to hold a series of tournaments next year as well.
After the approval and formally notified by PSB, the PBBF is the only representative organisation at the national and international levels that can take all kinds of measures for the development of basketball, the spokesman said.
He asked the departments and divisions to take prior permission from the PBBF to organise basketball competitions in the country.

7,Macron intervened to ask French team to greet fans: federation,PARIS: President Emmanuel Macron intervened to ask France’s footballers to greet fans after their defeat in the...,"PARIS: President Emmanuel Macron intervened to ask France’s footballers to greet fans after their defeat in the World Cup final, leading to a brief public ceremony, the French football federation chief said Tuesday.
France’s players initially wanted to head straight home Monday after their loss on penalties to Argentina the previous evening, the head of the French Football Federation, Noel Le Graet, told AFP in a statement.
“Under the weight of the disappointment, the sadness and such strong emotions, I understood this choice and I respected it,” he said.
“The situation changed around 10:00 am (on Monday) after an exchange with the president, who wanted a moment of communion. Naturally I accepted along with the team,” he added.
After a confusing day of contradictory statements, the French players eventually appeared for a few minutes on Monday evening on the balcony of the five-star Crillon hotel at the historic Place de la Concorde.
Around 50,000 people packed the public square to wave, cheer and sing the national anthem, many having waited for more than four hours in the dark and cold.
Despite a mostly festive atmosphere, some in the crowd grumbled that the players were barely visible as they waved regally from the balcony behind a wide police cordon.
Several French players said they were delighted by the sight of the crowd.
“Frankly, it’s magnificent, it warms the heart, it’s a great pleasure to see that we were able to make so many French people proud and happy,” forward Marcus Thuram told TF1 TV.
Reaction in France has been overwhelmingly supportive of the national team which came close to retaining the World Cup despite a series of injuries to senior players such as Ballon D’Or winner Karim Benzema and a virus in the camp last week.
Macron’s performance at the final at the Lusail Stadium outside Doha on Sunday has sparked almost as much commentary as that of the team.
The 44-year-old football fan could be seen jumping from his seat during the game before descending to console the distraught players at the end as they crumpled to the turf following the penalty shoot-out.
The centrist then delivered a post-game pep talk in the changing room, leading to criticism from some domestic opponents and commentators that he was intruding too much into the team’s space.

8,World Cup winners Argentina return ahead of welcome home party,BUENOS AIRES: Argentina’s World Cup winners led by captain Lionel Messi returned home from Qatar in the early ...,"BUENOS AIRES: Argentina’s World Cup winners led by captain Lionel Messi returned home from Qatar in the early hours of Tuesday morning ahead of a welcome home party in the nation’s capital.
Having beaten France in Sunday’s thrilling final, the players will now spend the night at the Argentine Football Association (AFA) training complex near the Ezeiza airport where they arrived in Buenos Aires and where thousands of supporters were waiting to greet them.
They will then head to the iconic Obelisk monument for a tour of the Buenos Aires city center from midday on Tuesday with millions expected out in the streets on what is a public holiday.
“We will be here all night and tomorrow as well,” student Ayrton Kerdocas, 25, told AFP outside the airport.
“Tomorrow we are not working, we won’t do anything and we’ll go directly to the Obelisk with Argentina.”
Argentina won the final in Qatar 4-2 on penalties after a rollercoaster 3-3 draw over 120 minutes of unparalleled drama for their first world title in 36 years.
Messi, who scored twice in the final, was the first player to emerge from the plane, holding the World Cup aloft, with coach Lionel Scaloni right behind him.
Forward Julian Alvarez, a revelation in Qatar with his four goals, was one of the next players out of the Aerolineas Argentinas Airbus A330.
A picture of Messi was emblazoned on the plane’s tail with the words:  “one team, one country, one dream” on its side.
The players made their way from the plane along a red carpet straight to a white open-top bus with the words  “world champions” and three stars on its side as their World Cup theme song blared out.
Excitement had been brewing since the party that began after Sunday’s final ahead of the players’ arrival.
A private reception at a VIP suite in the airport had been arranged to greet the returning players.
Messi, 35, finally crowned his record-breaking career with football’s  biggest prize as he produced one of the greatest World Cup final  performances, scoring a first-half penalty and netting again in extra  time. 
In doing so he emulated his predecessor as Argentina’s  idol, Diego Maradona who inspired the country to their second world  title with a series of match-winning displays at Mexico 1986. “I remember ‘86 but this victory yesterday was much more emotional and much more stressful,” architect Ricardo Grunfeld, 65, told AFP.
“I don’t know if there’s any difference with ‘86 but this comes at a good time,” added Zulema Guereri, 80.
Argentina had led 2-0 with 10 minutes of normal time left and 3-2 with only two minutes of extra-time to go but Kylian Mbappe completed only the second World Cup final hat-trick in history to take the gripping final to penalties, before Gonzalo Montiel swept home the decisive spot kick.
Despite the huge numbers of revelers during Sunday’s festivities  “people acted in a very positive way,” a spokesperson for the municipality said.
Fewer than 20 people were arrested for isolated incidents of violence or theft.

Argentina keeper Emiliano Martinez saved Coman’s effort from the spot and Tchouameni fired wide as Argentina captured their first world title since 1986, and third overall.
Coman’s club Bayern Munich have posted a message of support for the 26-year-old, condemning the racist comments made towards him.
“The FC Bayern family is behind you, King. Racism has no place in sport or our society,” they said on Twitter.
The incident follows the racist abuse aimed at England players Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka after the Euro 2020 final defeat against Italy last year.
All three players missed their penalties in the shootout and were targeted on social media following the game.

There have been several arrests in connection with suspected bid-rigging in connection with the Tokyo Games, and Sapporo’s mayor was quoted last week as saying it might be difficult to carry out promotional activities under current conditions.
Kyodo gave no further information, and the Japan Olympic Committee was not immediately available for comment.
Earlier this month, the Intern­ational Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to postpone its decision on the host city for 2030, citing concerns about climate change.
Sappporo and Salt Lake City in the United States are the only cities bidding to host the event after others pulled out.
Police in Japan raided the offices of several advertising agencies late in November as part of investigations into the Tokyo 2020 Olympics scandal. In August, Haruyuki Takahashi, a former member of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics board, was arrested on suspicion of receiving bribes from Olympic sponsors.
“The IOC has taken note of the allegations against some Japa­nese organisations involved in the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 and has utmost confidence in the Japanese authorities to fully investigate this matter,” the Olympic body said in a statement.
The IOC has stated it aims to become  “climate positive” by the end of 2024 by reducing its direct and indirect carbon emissions by 30%. Starting in 2030, Olympic host cities will also be contractually obligated to be  “climate positive”.
The IOC has said it might award the 2030 and 2034 host cities simultaneously to create stability for winter sports and the Winter Games, and that hosting rights may rotate  “between a certain pool of cities and regions,” as it faces a shrinking pool of potential bidders.
There were only two candidates for the 2022 Winter Games — Beijing and Almaty, Kazakhstan. The IOC chose Beijing by four votes. The 2026 Winter Games will be held in Milan-Cortina.

13,IOC chief ‘faces dilemma over Russian athletes’,PARIS: Olympics chief Thomas Bach faces  “the toughest decision of his presidency” as he weighs whether Russian...,"PARIS: Olympics chief Thomas Bach faces  “the toughest decision of his presidency” as he weighs whether Russian and Belarus athletes should be allowed to compete in the 2024 Games, a senior former International Olympic Committee (IOC) executive has told AFP.
The signs coming from bodies such as the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) in the past fortnight suggest athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus should be permitted to try and qualify for the Games in Paris.
The IOC has agreed to  “explore” a proposal allowing athletes from those countries to compete in international events in Asia.
Olympic authorities had banned them following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and those federations who have allowed athletes from those countries to take part have insisted that they do not display national emblems.
The argument given was that the events’ integrity would be damaged by the athletes competing.
However, the IOC said this month that both the OCA and some International Federations (IFs)  “on the Asian continent” believe  “the reasons for the protective measures no longer exist”.
The softening of their attitude enraged Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, who called Bach.
Zelensky claimed 184 Ukrainian athletes have died since the Russian invasion and called for the  “total isolation” of Russia and its ally Belarus.
The IOC’s former marketing chief Michael Payne — who was credited with overhauling the movement’s brand and finances — said Bach faces a conundrum.
“It is probably the toughest decision that Bach is facing in his presidency,” Payne told AFP.
“He and the IOC are caught between a rock and a hard place.”
Another former IOC marketing executive, Terrence Burns, an American who has since played a role in five successful Olympic bid campaigns, said one problem was that the Ukraine war had gone on for much longer than expected.
Burns said the change in the IOC’s stance was not a  “retreat or softening”.
“The IOC’s very reason for existence is to use sport as a unifying platform -- perhaps the only one -- and to keep and hold the world together,” he told AFP.
“I see it as a pragmatic evolution of direction in an almost no-win situation.
“Principles and values matter, no matter how unpopular they be when applied.”
Payne, who is Irish, said the IOC has to view the attitudes to the Ukraine conflict through a multi-cultural prism.
“One can’t look at this purely through the culture of an Anglo-Saxon viewpoint,” he said.
“There is no question Asian culture views what is happening slightly differently from the West.
“If you are a global body you cannot allow yourself to only look at something through only one cultural prism.”
Payne argued that the  “one size fits all” model of punishing nations was not practical.
“As horrific as the Ukraine-Russia war is, it is not the only one going on on the planet at the moment,” he said.
“If you are looking at it from an Asian perspective, how do some of the American adventures in the Middle East play out?”
Bach had also spoken about the participation of Russian and Belarus athletes being politicised by some governments and called for a return  “to sporting merits”.
Burns said their case should be looked at more positively when taking into consideration by their respective governments.
“Do a nation’s citizens have a responsibility for their government’s actions?” said Burns.
He said while that might be the case  “in a fully-functioning open democracy”, but:  “In a totalitarian/police state with little to zero ability to demonstrate, and by doing so risking imprisonment or death, I would argue  “no.”
“That is where we are with the Russian conundrum.”
Burns says the awarding of the Olympic Games to places like China and Russia “virtually guarantees the mingling of sport and politics.
“It is inevitable and to believe otherwise is nonsense,” he said.
“I think the IOC’s charter — believe it or not, like it or not, respect it or not — is based on principles that differ from popular geopolitical rhetoric.”
