0,Rural women main contributors to informal economy: Kashmala,"ISLAMABAD: Rural women working in agricultural fields are the largest contributors to informal economy, but they are...","ISLAMABAD: Rural women working in agricultural fields are the largest contributors to informal economy, but they are not acknowledged, counted and protected. 
Rural women have the same rights as that of working women in cities, but there is no recognition for their contribution.
This was stated by Federal Ombudsperson for Protection against Harassment Kashmala Tariq in a statement at the launch of a study on the rights of women agricultural workers organised by Awaz-CDS Pakistan.
Kashmala Tariq said there was a strong need to implement laws already in place for women agricultural workers’ rights as they often earned less than men and were deprived of basic rights and protection. She stressed the need for creating awareness among women agricultural workers through mass media and effective role of local governments in addressing their issues.
The study titled, ‘The Hands That Feed Us: Struggles of Women Agricultural Workers in Pakistan’ was conducted by Awaz-CDS Pakistan in collaboration with Forum Asia and Bread for the World in the aftermath of Covid-19 pandemic. 
Chief Executive Awaz-CDS Pakistan Ziaur Rehman highlighted that women agricultural workers often earned less than 50pc of the men wages.
“Women agricultural workers traditionally face malnutrition, discrimination, violence and ill-treatment by their partners, including exploitation and sexual harassment. Most of them are married at an early age and forced to work in fields on behalf of in-laws as bonded labourers,” he said.
Highlighting the need to carry out the study, he said: “There are several women empowerment studies but limited research is available on the measurement of empowerment in the agricultural context. Therefore, it was decided to carry out a study to assess, identify and articulate the contributing factors associated with socio-economic, legal, gender and political empowerment of WAW in Sindh and Punjab provinces.”
The study findings suggested appropriate measures and recommendations to address identified policy and practice level gaps. 
Former convener Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and chairperson Common Wealth Women Parliamentary Forum Shandana Gulzar said the rights of rural women workers were not an issue of social welfare, but of basic human rights.
Head of SDG Programme of Hashoo Foundation Mahwish Afridi said there was a need to empower women agricultural workers by imparting them with required technical skills to make linkages with the market.

1,Envoy hails 10pc increase in Pakistan-Vietnam trade,"ISLAMABAD: The ambassador of Vietnam, Nguyen Tien Phong, on Friday night appreciated the 10 per cent increase in...","ISLAMABAD: The ambassador of Vietnam, Nguyen Tien Phong, on Friday night appreciated the 10 per cent increase in trade volume between Vietnam and Pakistan this year.
“The trade between Vietnam and Pakistan jumped to $848 million compared to $794 million last year,” he said at a reception hosted for media that contributed to activities of the embassy of Vietnam throughout the year.
“Your export to Vietnam increased 55 per cent, which was good news for Pakistan and also for Vietnam. However, this year the total trade volume of Vietnam stood at $750 billion and Pakistan’s share of the slice was little. This is mostly due to lack of awareness of the potential of the business opportunities between the two nations.”
The ambassador said Pakistan exported more to Vietnam which was amazing because Vietnam utilised the raw material imported from Pakistan to manufacture finished products.
“We strongly believe in the policy that we will be happy when Pakistan is happy. We will be strong when Pakistan is strong and we will be prosperous when Pakistan is the same. We need to be reliable partners and friends. We make the future together,” said the ambassador.
Ambassador Phong said in the year 2023 Vietnam had many activities starting with interactions between foreign ministers of the two countries followed by the meeting between Pakistan’s the prime minister with the vice president of Vietnam in Kazakhstan.
The ambassador said the outgoing year was very special for Vietnam and Pakistan when the two countries celebrated 50 years of cordial relations.
He said Pakistan sent its first diplomat to Hanoi at a time when Vietnam was in a very difficult situation. “From then on, we have come a long way. In the last 50 years we have witnessed many achievements and seen relations grow. We have seen that people who came to us when we were going through extremely difficult times were true and reliable friends. After 50 years, we have firm and sold cooperation also for the years ahead and optimistic of further developments in political and trade and economics,” he said.
He appreciated the contributions made by media to Vietnam activities in Pakistan. “More important has been their contributions to Vietnam and Pakistan relations. We hope that in 2023, we continue to support and cooperate to help in building stronger relations between the two countries.

3,Non-Muslims should also be given tickets for general seats: archbishop,Says implementation of laws imperative for interfaith harmony,"! Archbishop Joseph Arshad. — Photo by Mohammad Asim 
ISLAMABAD: Christmas has the message of peace, love and joy for all humanity irrespective of religion, caste and creed that is why Jesus Christ is called the “Prince of Peace,” and on this occasion we also pray for the needy, said Archbishop Joseph Arshad of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
Talking to Dawn, Bishop Arshad said the Catholic Church Pakistan called upon political parties to award tickets to non-Muslims on general seats to contest elections.
“Such a move will realise the concept of interfaith harmony in the society,” he said, adding peace and tranquility in society comes from the implementation of laws, all religions and prophets have presented laws for the society.
“Interfaith harmony is the need of the time,” he said, adding: “The government should implement laws of the country to eradicate differences among the citizens as these differences lead to extremism, hate and eventually violence among communities.” He added that the concept of society had been stressed in all religions and one of the key ingredients of a healthy society was a strong family system.

Says implementation of laws imperative for interfaith harmony

The Islamabad-Rawalpindi Diocese of the Catholic Church has declared 2023 as the year of the “Family” to promote family values and impart the sense of responsibility towards families among its followers.
“The church has the responsibility towards the residents of the world to highlight the need for repairing the damage done to nature. Pope Francis has called upon the humans to fulfil their responsibilities for the universe.” The Catholic Church of Pakistan will plant one million trees across the country with the view to help protect nature from further degradation.
Bishop Arshad is the first Pakistani priest to join the Vatican diplomatic servicing various countries from 1999 to 2013.
In 2013, Pope Francis appointed Father Arshad as the bishop of Faisalabad Diocese and in 2016 he was appointed as the archbishop of Islamabad-Rawalpindi Diocese, which extends from parts of central Punjab and includes whole of KP, Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK.
Bishop Arshad said there were around 100 schools and a few colleges in the jurisdiction of Islamabad and Rawalpindi Diocese, and they always faced difficulty accommodating the large number of students who want to get admissions there.
“We have serious resource constraints, restricting us to grow our educational setup and this is hurting the Muslims of Pakistan too,” Archbishop added.
At the same time, he said, the policy introduced in 2013 for regulating NGOs to receive foreign funding has aggravated the financial limitations of the church.
“Most of the church expenditures are met through funding by donors and these expenditures include services committed to the society through the education and health institutes.” Bishop Arshad said

Saturday as the temperature dropped to 1°C while the Met Office predicted further drop in the temperature and fog in coming days.
The Met Office said visibility reduced to 30 metres from 7am to 10am on Saturday.
Due to persistent dry weather, dense foggy conditions are likely to continue in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar, Rashakai, Mardan, Charsada, Swabi, Nowshehra and D. I. Khan), Punjab (Jhelum, Lahore, Gujranwala, Narowal, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Jhang, Sargodha, Mianwali, Toba Tek Singh, Okara, Sahiwal, Bhakkar, Layyah, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Multan, Rahimyar Khan and Dera Ghazi Khan) and Sindh (Sukkur, Larkana, Hyderabad, Moenjodaro and surrounding areas).

He said there were chances of a light rain in twin cities and snow in Murree and surrounding area next week.
On the other hand, in the cold weather, low gas pressure was reported in different parts of the twin cities. 
The low gas pressure in the cold weather affected the daily routine of the residents in the city area, who demanded the government release natural gas and take action against those who installed gas compressors.
The supply of gas in the majority areas of Rawalpindi has deteriorated. 
However, the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGPL) claimed that the demand had increased in the cold weather and supply was limited. 
But the residents were of the view that it was an issue of mismanagement, not the gap between demand and supply.
Due to foggy weather, several flights, including to Skardu and Gilgit, were canceled.
A senior official at Islamabad International Airport told Dawn that the flight operation was disturbed in northern areas due to bad weather there while the remaining operations were operated as per routine.
Meanwhile, due to the dry spell and dust, flu and other ailments have increased. 
The government-run hospitals are receiving a large number of patients suffering from seasonal ailments on a daily basis.

Sources in the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) told Dawn that the body parts of only two persons – the policeman and the ‘suicide bomber’ – were received. The identification of the man can be established through the face which was recognisable, they claimed.
Police said they would establish the identity of the deceased, whose face is intact, with the help of Nadra and added that body parts kept in the mortuary would be used to establish the identity of the attackers and the actual number of people slain in the attack.

9,"QAU faces administrative, academic issues in absence of vice chancellor","QAU VC Dr Mohammad Ali was the last VC, who completed his four-year tenure on Sept 21.","ISLAMABAD: The country’s top ranked educational institution, Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) is currently being run without any regular or temporary vice chancellor (VC) as the education ministry has failed to make appointments on time. This has caused administrative and academic issues.
QAU VC Dr Mohammad Ali was the last VC, who completed his four-year tenure on Sept 21 and since then, the office of the VC has been lying vacant and the university has been facing several administrative issues, a source said.
“There is a complete vacuum in the absence of an acting and regular VC. Around 400 students, who have completed their degrees are suffering as we are unable to issue their degrees without the signature of the VC. Similarly, our meeting of the advance studies and research board to review progress of research work of PhD and MPhil scholars also cannot take place without the VC,” said a senior official of QAU.
Speaking to Dawn on Thursday, he said that since the VC acts as the university’s financial officer as well, “our financial matters are also on halt”. The university has no competent authority to make liaison with other government organisations.
Meanwhile, the process of appointments of regular VC QAU, VC of Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) and rector of International Islamic University (IIUI) has been facing delay as well as the interview process is yet to be completed.
Sources said that as per rules and tradition, the senior most dean of the university should have been given charge of the acting VC.
This time, they said that the ministry did not give charge to the senior dean, apparently, because of his open opposition to the Bhara Kahu bypass project. Whereas, the ministry and government also did not ask any other faculty members to run the affairs of QAU till the appointment of a regular VC.
On the other hand, the VC of Allama Iqbal Open University Dr Ziaul Qayyum completed his tenure last month and the education ministry immediately gave look after charge to a senior faculty member.
However, the ministry last month, had moved a summary to the Prime Minister’s Office to give temporary charge of VC QAU to temporary executive director of HEC Dr Shaista Sohail, but no further development come to the fore on this summary.
QAU faculty members have been demanding the government to appoint someone as acting VC till the appointment of a regular one. A month has passed since the tenure of vice chancellor of QAU ended. 
The government is yet to appoint an acting VC as routine work is piling up, a member of the QAU faculty Prof Dr Ilhan Niaz said.
He expressed hope that HEC, the ministry, PMO and President Dr Arif Alvi would swiftly address the matter. Another alumni of QAU Ahsar Awan tweeted that hundreds of students were waiting for degrees and many visiting teachers were waiting for their salaries.
A search committee headed by Education Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain conducted interviews a couple of week ago of a number of candidates out of a list of 108 educational experts.
Interviews of the remaining candidates will be conducted in the next week. An officer of the education ministry said that the education minister and secretary (education) are currently out of the country on official tours. “Once they return, we will restart the process of interviews,” said an official of the ministry.

10,Azad Kashmir plans special economic zone for women,MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government plans to develop a special economic zone for women in the...,"MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government plans to develop a special economic zone for women in the next three months to reduce unemployment and provide economic self-sufficiency to the people, Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas said on Saturday.
“The government is determined to empower women by offering them fiscal and technical assistance for launching small and medium size business ventures in different sectors, particularly the cottage industry,” he said in a statement.
He said since there was good potential for cultivation of saffron and grapes in many districts, the government would extend cooperation and guidance to all those interested in the activity, because both commodities were in high demand in the local and international markets and could improve the fiscal health of growers in a short span of time.
My Ilyas noted with satisfaction that even though the honeybee produced in many areas of AJK was in accordance with international standards the government would also launch refresher courses for all those engaged or interested in beekeeping for further improvement in processing and packaging of honey.
Similarly, he said, a policy was also being formulated on establishment of orchids for production of native and exotic varieties of fruits on a commercial level.
He said he had issued directives for collection and compilation of data of experts of different fields so as to connect them with the relevant government departments and derive benefit from their expertise for the greater good of the state.
He said public sector jobs in AJK were too few to absorb hundreds of thousands of educated youths and resultantly the ratio of unemployment was skyrocketing in the state.
“It is therefore we are looking beyond public sector jobs and exploring new avenues of employment through encouraging establishment of the small and medium sized undertakings in agriculture, floriculture, livestock, arts and crafts sector,” he said.
He said he firmly believed that an educated youth could better manage any line of work and strengthen not only their personal economy but also that of the area.
