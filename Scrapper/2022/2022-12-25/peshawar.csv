0,Housing societies eating up agricutlural land in Kohat,KOHAT: Thousands of acres of agricultural land have been used up by housing societies since the influx of Afghans in...,"KOHAT: Thousands of acres of agricultural land have been used up by housing societies since the influx of Afghans in 1981, leaving little to grow vegetables and grains.
President of property dealers’ association, Kamran Shah, told Dawn on contact that there were only two dozen housing societies in 2000, but now their number had increased to 160 registered, and still many unregistered.
He said rapid growth of housing societies had eaten up agricultural land used for growing vegetables, wheat, maize, and fruit on Rawalpindi, Bannu, and Hangu roads.
He said about 32,000 kanals of fertile land in Jarma on Bannu Road had been occupied by the internally displaced people from Orakzai, Kurram, Darra Adamkhel, Waziristan, Swat and Bajaur.
President of Kohat Chamber of Commerce and Industry Haji Rasheed Paracha expressed concern over investment of ‘drug money’ in housing societies.
He deplored that despite merger of former tribal areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, tribesmen were still growing hemp and opium in their own areas and invested the proceeds from sale of drugs to buy land and shops in Kohat.
He claimed that the Afghans were free to buy land in Kohat. He called for imposing ban on land purchase by Afghans.
He said Dhodha area, which previously fulfilled the requirements of vegetables of the city residents, was turned into a residential area after the construction of a cadet college there. Similarly, he said Mir Ahmedkhel area, which was famous for growing cabbage, carrots, guava and wheat, had been turned into a housing society.
He said cost of land in Kohat had increased from a few thousands rupees per marla to more than a million.

Mr Ahmed checked the security arrangements in and around the police station, met the policemen deployed there and issued fresh security guidelines for them.

2,Pipeline fire disrupts gas supply to parts of Peshawar,SNGPL insists drilling by cable operators caused gas leak.,"

Rescue workers try to put out the blaze at gas pipeline in Chamkani area along GT Road in Peshawar on Saturday. — White Star

 
PESHAWAR: The supply of natural gas to many parts of the provincial capital remained suspended for several hours on Saturday after a massive fire broke out in the main pipeline.
The gas utility, SNGPL, restored the supply to the relief of the residents amid the chilly winter.
The fire incident also disrupted gas supply to CNG filling stations forcing transport drivers to stay off the roads.
The police and Rescue 1122 insisted that the main gas pipeline in the Chamkani area caught fire at around 8:45am.
“It was a massive fire. Our firefighters tried to douse the flames for around four hours but they were controlled only after the main pipeline valve was turned off by the SNGPL,” an official of Rescue 1122 told Dawn.

SNGPL insists drilling by cable operators caused gas leak

He said the incident was caused by a wildfire in bushes along the main pipeline.
Officials of the Chamkani police station expressed ignorance about the cause of the fire and said they hadn’t registered a case about the incident.
Officials of the SNGPL said the fire was caused by a gas leak after unidentified cable operators drilled a hole in the main pipeline.
They said the supply of natural gas to various localities was stopped due to repair of the pipeline along the GT Road near the Chamkani Flyover after the fire incident.
The areas included the Tarnab-Hashtnagri section of the GT Road, Old City, Ring Road, and Peshawar cantonment’s localities, including Governor’s House, Chief Minister’s House, Saddar, Shami Road, Dalzak Road and Charsadda Road.
The SNGPL officials claimed speedy work on the pipeline and said the gas utility had directed consumers not to use gas appliances as a precautionary measure against any damage to their life and property during the repairs.
They said staff of the engineering section reached the area shortly after learning about the gas leak and the fire and turned the main valve off for welders to repair the pipeline.
The fire incident also led to the suspension of gas supply to CNG stations disrupting the sale to drivers, including transporters.
Urban Transport Union president Khan Zaman Afridi told Dawn that most transporters opted to stay off the roads during the closure of CNG stations.
He, however, said the drivers, who used petrol, didn’t charge commuters any extra amount.
Mr Afridi said the transporters would increase fares if the gas supply to CNG stations wasn’t restored today (Sunday).
Saleem Khan, a resident of Gulshan Colony, said he learned about disruption of gas supply only waking up in the morning and awaited its resumption for long hours.
He said his area had no gas supply, so the residents struggled to make breakfast and lunch at home.
The resident demanded of authorities to ensure smooth gas supply to the population during the winter season saying children and elderly people suffered the most due to supply outages coupled with harsh weather.

Scores of people from different walks of life from Yousafabad and its adjacent areas attended the demonstration held at the local bazaar.

They said that the power suspension in the area along the main Mardan road just three kilometres from Khar had been causing numerous problems for the residents, including shortage of drinking water. 
Local political and social activists and traders, including Amjad Yousaf, Khan Wali and Fazal Khan, said that the prolonged absence of electricity in the harsh winter was a great injustice with the area residents. 
The speakers alleged that the prolonged suspension might be an attempt of the Tesco officials to force the residents to install electricity meters at their homes and workplaces. They said that the officials should take them into confidence on the matter. 
The residents ended the protest after a team of district administration officials assured them of resolving the issue on priority.

12,"Man acquitted in drug, fake currency case",PESHAWAR: A local court has acquitted a man on the charge of possessing the ice drug and counterfeit currency ...,"PESHAWAR: A local court has acquitted a man on the charge of possessing the ice drug and counterfeit currency notes.
Additional district and sessions judge Nasir Khan pronounced that the prosecution failed to prove its case against the accused, Haris Ahmad, a resident of Peshawar, while the evidence available on record, too, didn’t connect him with the commission of the offence.
An FIR against him was registered at the University Town police station on March 15, 2022, under Section 11-B of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substance Act and Section 489-B of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The prosecution claimed that a police patrol had spotted the accused near the Canal Road over suspicious behaviour, body-searched him and seized the ice drug (crystal meth) packed in a plastic envelope along with four counterfeit currency notes valuing Rs1,000.
Bail petitions of the accused were turned down by the Peshawar High Court and the Supreme Court. The apex court had directed the relevant court on June 29 to conclude trial in four months.
The defence counsel, Mohammad Hamdan, claimed that his client was falsely implicated in the case.
He added that the prosecution witnesses had recorded conflicting statements raising doubts about the recovery of the contraband and fake currency notes from his client.
The lawyer argued that while the police claimed the arrest of the accused in a public place, they didn’t produce private witnesses. He contended that the manner and mode of recovery of the contraband was dubious.
The court observed that keeping in view the settled principles of criminal law that a single doubt would be sufficient to discard prosecution story, the prosecution version in the case suffered from many infirmities and contradictions, which caused reasonable doubt about involvement of his client in the commission of the offence.
It ruled that the accused facing trial couldn’t be convicted on the basis of mere surmises or speculations and instead, the prosecution had to prove his guilt by producing reasonable, consistent and admissible evidence.

The directions come in line with the advice of the NCOC, the country’s nerve centre for the fight against Covid-19, for all provinces to ensure that doctors, nurses, paramedics and support staff of hospitals get the required jabs of coronavirus vaccines as the country’s overall virus positivity rate nears four per cent.
In an advisory, the KP health department ordered speedy vaccination of the employees of medical teaching institutions and other health facilities against Covid-19 through two mandatory and booster jabs each to protect themselves and others from the virus.
According to officials, the second dose is administered a month after the first, while the subsequent booster jabs have a spacing of four months.

Directions come from health dept after rising virus cases in country

They told Dawn that hospital employees attending to patients were vulnerable to the infection due to the arrival of hundreds of unvaccinated people every day.
A total of 5,049 employees of health facilities in the province have been infected with Covid-19 since the outbreak of the virus early 2020 with 49 of them eventually losing life, according to a report of the World Health Organisation’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa sub-office.
Of those cases, 3,532 were men (70pc) and 1,517 women.
The report said the doctors accounted for 2,406 coronavirus patients (47pc), nurses 1,911 (38pc) and paramedics 732 (14pc) cases.
It added that a total of 224,856 cases were recorded by the province and 140,144 of them (61pc) were men and 84,712 (39pc) women.
According to the report, 6,374 lost life to the virus and 59pc of them (3,761) were men and the rest (2,613) women.
The cases included 49,517 from the age bracket of 21-30, 45,122 from 31-40 and 27,361 from 40-50.
The report said the virus was diagnosed in 5,371 children aged up to 10 years and 32,581 aged between 10 and 20 years.

According to the report, four children below four years of age also died of the infection, while the people killed by it in the age bracket of 11-20 totalled 34.
Health officials told Dawn that though the countrywide Covid-19 incidence was rising, the infectious disease was “vanishing” in the province with only a few cases being reported daily and that, too, mostly in Peshawar district.
They said the health department wanted to ensure that the first and second coronavirus booster jabs are administered to all population to prevent the outbreak of the virus in case of the emergence of its new variants.
The officials said the people were required to get the first booster shot six months after full vaccination and second four months later to ensure their complete protection against the virus due to the emergence of new variants from time to time.
They said a vaccination facility was available at all health centres in the province free of charge.
The officials said the Covid-19 would break out in the province “anytime”after the surfacing of its new variants in other countries, so the people should get jabs without delay as a precautionary measure.
They said currently, eight coronavirus patients were admitted to hospitals in the province.
The officials said the Covid-19 vaccination was compulsory for every citizen until the official announcement by the WHO that the pandemic is over.
