1,"Fighting climate change, and the rhetoric","""Climate change is a ticking time bomb,"" says Unilever Pakistan Ltd CEO Amir Paracha.","KARACHI: When the master of ceremonies opened the floor for comments at a recent roundtable on climate change organised by the chamber of big foreign investors, some participants expressed views that weren’t exactly music to the ears of the suits sitting at the head of the table.
“I hope you don’t turn climate change into some sort of product to sell and make profit from,” said one participant while looking straight into the eyes of Unilever Pakistan Ltd CEO Amir Paracha, who also serves as vice chairman of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI).
Another participant who introduced herself as an architect said she fears corporate giants jumping on the bandwagon of climate change may lead to greenwashing — a global practice where big businesses co-opt the environment cause and resort to exaggerated or outright false claims about the environment-friendly nature of their processes.
“[Climate change] is like a ticking time bomb. If we don’t act today, it’ll be too late. It’s already very late for a country like Pakistan,” said Mr Paracha in a passionate prologue to the presentation of the OICCI-backed white paper on the private sector’s engagement in the fight against climate change.
And what does that engagement entail? The private sector demands that the government’s climate policies “must incentivise” businesses to invest more in climate-friendly practices and adopt a sustainable consumption and production pattern.
According to the updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) targets that Pakistan presented at the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26), the country is going to halve its carbon emissions by 2030.
Of the 50 per cent reduction target, a 15-percentage-point reduction is unconditional, meaning without the expectation of any foreign aid. The larger part consisting of the 35-percentage-point reduction in emissions is “subject to conditional support from bilateral and multilateral sources”.
Hence, the vociferous demand from big business for incentives to make the transition make sense.
Seeing big business take centre stage in the debate on climate change is both reassuring and confounding. It’s reassuring because big business is a key stakeholder. The needle on climate change mitigation won’t move unless big industry is on board.
But it’s confounding at the same time because big industry is the main reason the planet is becoming inhabitable. 
It’s already broken enough china and shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the china shop.
CEOs of blue-chip companies trafficking in climate-change rhetoric will have a hard time convincing people of their sincerity of purpose unless they stop making plastic bottles, burning coal and selling dirty fuels — in the here and now, not in 2030.
After all, it’s “already very late” for Pakistan, no?

3,‘ECB must be ready for more rate hikes’,"FRANKFURT: The European Central Bank must be prepared to take the heat and raise interest rates further, including ...","FRANKFURT: The European Central Bank must be prepared to take the heat and raise interest rates further, including by more than the market expects, if that is needed to bring down inflation, ECB policymaker Isabel Schnabel said in an interview published on Saturday.
The ECB raised rates for a fourth straight time last week and hinted at further hikes - jolting eurozone bond markets and triggering a backlash from the Italian government.
Investors now expect the rate that the ECB pays on bank deposits, currently at 2pc, to rise to 3.4pc next year, compared to a 2.75pc peak priced in before last week’s decision.
Schnabel, the leading voice in the ECB’s hawkish camp that has driven the recent string of hikes, opened the door to increasing the deposit rate even further than the market expects if the inflation outlook requires it.
“Whether we will still need to go higher than that will depend on the future inflation outlook,” she told German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
She added that the ECB will focus on medium-term inflation expectations, rather than current readings, and saw little risk of raising borrowing costs too far at present given that real interest rates are still very low.

4,"India should raise rates carefully, says IMF",The Reserve Bank of India has raised its key policy rate by 225 basis points since May.,"NEW DELHI: India’s future interest rate hikes should be carefully calibrated and its intervention in the foreign exchange market should be limited to managing volatility, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has raised its key policy rate by 225 basis points since May, taking the rate to the highest in over three years.
“Inflation pressures have led to an appropriate shift towards policy tightening,” IMF said in an annual consultation report. The report is prepared by IMF staff in accordance with its Article IV of Agreement, which requires the fund to hold annual consultations with officials from member states about economic development and policies.
“Additional tightening should be carefully calibrated and communicated,” it added.
Last week, minutes of the RBI’s monetary policy meeting showed a majority of rate-setters were concerned about elevated inflation and felt the central bank could not afford to prematurely pause its rate tightening cycle.
The IMF projected inflation at 6.9pc for the current fiscal year that ends on March 31, 2023 and said price gains would moderate gradually.
The world’s fifth-largest economy is broadly tipped to outperform its major global peers in the year ahead, supported by pent-up post-pandemic domestic demand, investment and credit growth, analysts say.
However, the IMF expects India’s economic growth to moderate reflecting a less favourable outlook and tighter financial conditions, projecting 6.8pc growth for the current fiscal year and 6.1pc for the next fiscal year that starts on April 1.
“Uncertainty around the outlook is high, with risks tilted to the downside,” the Washington-based fund said.
A sharp global growth slowdown in the near-term would affect India through trade and financial channels. It projected the current account deficit to widen to 3.5pc of GDP in the current fiscal year as a result of both higher commodity prices and import demand.
The fund said the exchange rate should act as a  “shock absorber” and that the RBI should only intervene to address disorderly market conditions.
India’s foreign reserves had fallen around $100bn from its peak of October 2021, but have since recovered partially due to the resumption of dollar inflows.
Fiscal consolidation should be more ambitious than the current baseline, targeting additional general government primary consolidation of around 1pc of GDP by 2027-28, the report said.

5,German inflation to stay high for two years: govt official,BERLIN: Inflation is likely to remain high for another two years as companies pass on higher input costs and in some...,"BERLIN: Inflation is likely to remain high for another two years as companies pass on higher input costs and in some cases exaggerate them, the head of the council of economists that advises the German government was quoted as saying on Saturday. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has further stoked already rising costs for food and energy, pushing inflation in Germany to its fastest pace since the early 1950s, with consumer price rises of around 11.3 per cent in November.
The Bundesbank has warned that even a planned price cap on gas and electricity may not be enough to bring inflation down from double digits.
“Inflation will also be an issue in 2024, and only thereafter will we maybe see it returning to 2pc,” Monika Schnitzer, the head of the so-called  “wise men”, was quoted as saying by the Rheinische Post newspaper.
“Inflation is remaining high because we are seeing second round effects, with companies passing on their higher costs — and some significantly exaggerating.”  She said she was not concerned about a wage-price spiral given measured wage rises in the chemistry and metal industries.
Workers in those industries agreed to what will likely prove to be below-inflation pay increases in return for one-off compensation payments.
She was concerned, however, about high electricity prices, saying the government should urgently check whether it would make sense to let the remaining three nuclear plants run for two or three years longer than planned.
“It would make sense to quickly order new fuel rods now, that would give us more security next winter,” she said.
Europe’s biggest economy had planned to phase out nuclear power by the end of this year but the government decided in October to extend the lifespans of the remaining three plants until April given the current energy crisis. Some members of government would like to see their lifespan extended further.

6,Political noise drags stocks down in jittery week,KARACHI: The stock market remained bearish in the outgoing week as the benchmark index hit a 26-month low last...,"KARACHI: The stock market remained bearish in the outgoing week as the benchmark index hit a 26-month low last Wednesday.
Arif Habib Ltd said the main reason for the decline was uncertainty on the political front. The announcement by the PTI that it’d dissolve the Punjab Assembly was followed by a no-confidence motion against the provincial chief minister — a stretched-out episode of political confrontation that took a heavy toll on stock prices throughout the week.
On the economic front, the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves decreased by $584 million to $6.1 billion, lowest since April 2014.
Furthermore, the current account deficit decreased to a 19-month low of $276m in November. Foreign direct investment went down 48 per cent to $82m in November. Moreover, the real effective exchange rate clocked in at 98.85 in November versus 100.19 in October. In addition, the rupee depreciated by 0.13pc week-on-week against the dollar and closed at 225.64.
As a result, the index closed at 39,669 points after losing 1,632 points or 3.95pc on a weekly basis.
Sector-wise, negative contributions came from technology and communication (379 points), fertiliser (283 points), banking (235 points), cement (161 points) and food and personal care products (101 points).
Sectors that contributed positively were miscellaneous (20 points) and tobacco (five points).
Scrip-wise, negative contributors were TRG Pakistan Ltd (231 points), Engro Corporation Ltd (145 points), Systems Ltd (124 points), Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (77 points) and MCB Bank Ltd (63 points).
Meanwhile, positive contributions came from Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (28 points), Pakistan Services Ltd (26 points), Lotte Chemical Pakistan Ltd (24 points), Adamjee Insurance Company Ltd (nine points) and Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (eight points).
Foreign selling clocked in at $3.3m versus a net sale of $9.6m a week ago. Major selling was witnessed in commercial bank ($4.2m) and exploration and production ($0.4m). On the local front, buying was reported by banks ($7.9m) and companies ($5m). The average daily volume clocked in at 180.2m shares, up 11.3pc from a week ago. The average daily value traded settled at $21.7m, up 7.7pc week-on-week.
According to AKD Securities, the stock market is expected to witness pressure in the near future. “The sentiment is further worsened by the advent of security tensions in the northern part of the country,” it said, noting that further tightening of the interest rate by the central bank seems to be on the cards, which may keep sentiments in the equity markets muted.

7,Tesla suspends production at Shanghai plant,"SHANGHAI: Tesla suspended production at its Shanghai plant on Saturday, according to an internal notice and two...","SHANGHAI: Tesla suspended production at its Shanghai plant on Saturday, according to an internal notice and two people with knowledge of the matter, bringing ahead a previous plan to pause most work at the plant in the last week of December.
The US automaker cancelled the morning shift and told all workers at its most productive manufacturing hub they could start their break, said the people and the notice seen by Reuters. The company did not give a reason.
Reuters reported earlier this month that the electric car giant planned to suspend Model Y production at the plant from Dec 25 to Jan. 1.
The suspension comes among a rising wave of infections after China eased its zero-Covid policy earlier this month, an abrupt move welcomed by businesses and the public but heavily disrupting business operations in the short term.
One of the people said workers at Tesla and its suppliers have also been falling sick as part of this wave, posing challenges to operations in the past week.
Tesla is also grappling with elevated inventory levels as its second largest market braces for a downturn.
The Shanghai plant has been focused on making models for export in the last week, the person added.
A media representative at Tesla China did not immediately respond to request for comment.
The plants suspension of Model Y assembly at the end of the month would be part of a cut in planned production of about 30pc in the month for the model, Tesla’s best-selling model, at the Shanghai factory, Reuters had reported.
The Shanghai factory, the most important manufacturing hub for Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company, kept normal operations during the last week of December last year.
It has not been an established practice for the plant to shut down for a year-end holiday.
