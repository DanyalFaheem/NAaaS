2,How brutal Huns massacred the Buddhist Lahore,"It was merely 1,500 years ago that Lahore and its entire surrounding lands were ruled by a fierce barbarian Hun...","It was merely 1,500 years ago that Lahore and its entire surrounding lands were ruled by a fierce barbarian Hun called Toramana, also known as Toramana Shahi Jauvia, the king of the Alchon Huns, who shattered the Gupta empire.
Among the seven known destroyers of old Lahore, probably Toramana–the Hun was the worst who actually flattened the city only to realise much later the immense trading value of its port and hence, like tyrants before him, set about rebuilding the basics of the city and its fort. For a long time, research was afoot about just who was Prakasaditya, with many assuming that that he was a Gupta ruler. In his research, Pankaj Tandon, who studied, in detail, the coins of that era, discovered that he was Toramana–the Hun. These coins can be seen in the Lahore Museum.
For some time now, we have been writing about foreign invaders who ruled over us and lately there has been an increasing interest in just how Buddhism, the sole religion of Lahore for 700 years, was erased suddenly from the city.
Another research of interest is based on ancient manuscripts by A. Cunningham on the ruler of Lahore and Multan in the 5th and early 6th century AD. It is clear that the term ‘Maharaja-dhi-raja’ or the ‘great king of kings’ applied to Toramana, the ruler of the land that is today Pakistan and beyond.
Many descriptions exist of this ‘great’ ruler and the most widely used is the White Alchon Huns of Central Asian steppes. In terms of historical timescale, the Huns conquered Punjab much after Alexander and Porus clashed in 326BC in the Battle of the Hydaspes (Jhelum River) and the coming of the Turko-Afghan invader Mahmud in 1021AD. So Toramana, the Hun, came in between to conquer our land and city.
The defeat of the Huns by Skandagupta has been ascribed to the power of the Rajputs who some sources identify with the Huns. My interest in Toramana came about not merely by the fact that he destroyed Lahore but it was triggered as one studied the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas, where mention of the ‘white Huns’ were aplenty. We know that these books were written in Punjab and are, probably, not as ancient as is made out to be.
The successor of Toramana, his son Mihiragula, was finally defeated as he expanded eastwards by a collation of armies, led by Yashodharman in central India. This defeat led to the Rajput elements splitting over religious beliefs, for the white Huns were ancient animists and totemists. The power of the priestly Brahmins soon held sway, for through them the Huns were able to collect large revenues. Even today in India they are the richest, for the Hindus to reach the Almighty ‘believers’ have to pay the Brahmin first. All priests of every religion in one way or another follow this pastime, call it rule to wealth.
But back to the Alchon Huns. History teaches us that once the local rulers continuously fought for power, all they achieved was to weaken themselves. This prepared the ground, as in olden days, for fierce nomads to rush in. Unconventional forces have this attribute of being virtually ‘invisible’ and speed and surprise is their main weapon. That’s why both the Roman Empire in Europe and the Gupta Empire in the sub-continent were destroyed by nomadic barbarians.
The first of the two Alchon Huns was Toramana who continued his conquests and faced considerable resistance from the ruler of Lahore. He decided to flatten the city. This was achieved by killing off all males and all females below the age of 40 were handed over to the soldiers to ‘relax’ as one document tells us. We also have a description by the Chinese pilgrim Song Yun who wrote that the Huns after enjoying what the young women were ordered to behead them and ‘move on’.
But then Toramana had conquered the entire land from Kashmir to Multan and from the Indus to the vicinity of Delhi. Once he had made Sialkot his capital, he realised that without the port of Lahore for trade to commence, he had to rebuild the city. A mud fort was once again built along with three areas of the old walled city. My guess is, and mind you it is a guess only, that the three mounds from Lohari onwards north were the places where the first houses came up. That seems a logical setting but then archaeological research should determine the true facts.
Those days Toramana had sculptures built to celebrate his ‘greatness’, starting from Peshawar eastwards. Samples of the most of them can today be seen in the Lahore Museum. 
The ancient river port of Lahore on the Ravi was rebuilt. One description of the Huns by Gibbons says: “They were different from other human species, for they had very broad shoulders, flat noses and black eyes, but no beards that add to manliness. They seem the off-springs of witches”.
Once the son of Toramana, named Mihiragula, took over, he immediately asked the Buddhist priests to teach him their religion. The man they sent did not impress the ruler and immediately threw him in front of elephants and crushed him to his delight. Then a campaign began to eliminate all the Buddhists and in this effort the Hindu Brahmins assisted him with logical explanations of why they were a ‘curse’ on him. They reasoned that: “how could a religion have no god, no theology, imagine no priests and no promise of the future, with no spirits to help when bad times came” (Baden-Powell 95). But we see that when priests take over the essence of beliefs, nothing but destruction follows. That is still the case.
Every tyrant invariably meets his match and Mihiragula confronted the combined forces led by Yasodharman of Mandasor. Once the Huns were shattered, the local Rajputs absorbed the Huns left. For the first time, the Hindu Brahmins gave a physical shape to their deities, a pastime, and very paying at that, still continues.
Mihiragula fled to Kashmir where he was imprisoned but managed to entice the mother of the ruler who got him released. In return, he murdered the king and all his sons and tried to take over. But then, so claims Hugh Kennedy Trevaskis in his book ‘The Land of Five Rivers’, a Hindu Brahmin poisoned him. Thus ended the rule of the Alchon Huns over the land of Punjab and the city of Lahore.
Once the Huns were eliminated, from their ashes emerged, what scholars call, ‘The New Hinduism’. The peaceful belief of Gautama Buddha, who stayed in Mohallah Maullian in Lohari Gateway for three months, that made humans believe in themselves. The invasions from the West continued and still do in one form or another.
New priests from beyond the mountains have emerged, with support within our beautiful land. It is bizarre to see once poverty-stricken local priests now running around with armed guards and classy vehicles. The Huns in a new guise seem to be returning.

5,Nankana industrial estate land acquisition stayed,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has stayed the process of land acquisition for the project of Nankana Sahib Industrial...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has stayed the process of land acquisition for the project of Nankana Sahib Industrial Estate.  
Justice Shahid Karim passed the order on petitions filed by Amir Zulqernain and other owners of the agricultural lands acquired by the Punjab Industries Estates Development and Management Company, the district collector and the land acquisition collector of Nankana Sahib.  
Petitioners’ counsel Waqar A Sheikh argued before the court that the respondents issued the impugned notification under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 on Oct 24, 2022 for an allegedly public purpose namely “Nankana Sahib Industrial Estate.”  
The counsel contended that over 1,331 kanals agricultural land owned by the petitioners falls in the site of the proposed industrial estate. He pointed out that the land in question is arable and irrigated whereon, wheat, rice/paddy and guava are cultivated.  
He alleged that the selection of the project site is politically motivated as a former federal minister for narcotics control, who belongs to Nankana Sahib and has a political rivalry with the petitioners, wrote a letter to the then prime minister on Jan 11, 2022 to establish an industrial estate in his district.  
He said the then government selected three sites for the proposed project but without any due deliberation and owing to political vendetta of the former federal minister, the respondents chose the site on such a land which is multi-crop green fertile and cultivable and adjacent to M-3 Motorway. He said the site was selected on the land of the petitioners deliberately despite the fact that there were two other suitable sites available.  
The counsel submitted that in a meeting convened by the Planning & Development Board on Sept 7 a representative of the Urban Unit, additional secretary (Technical) irrigation department and chief (Industries) objected to the selected site for being a flood-prone area.  
He said the chief (Industries) had an opinion that the consumption of fertile agricultural land for housing societies and industrial estates should be discouraged.  
However, the counsel said, despite the objections raised by the relevant officials, the site was chosen under a political influence.  
He said the prime minister on Oct 11 wrote a letter to the provincial secretary for board of investment informing him that an earlier notification of Feb 3 regarding the initiation of the project has been withdrawn.  
He said the respondents are adamant to finalise the project despite the direction issued by the prime minister.  
The lawyer asked the court to declare that the establishment of the Nankana Sahib Industrial Estate at the proposed site is a gross infringement of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the petitioners and detrimental to the environment and laws related to fertile land. 
He also asked the court to set aside the impugned notification for the acquisition of the petitioners’ land for being unlawful.  
The judge suspended the impugned notification and sought replies from the respondents by Jan 19, 2023.

The provincial cabinet had accorded approval to the establishment of PHA for the home town of Chief Minister Parvez Elahi at least a month ago; however the Punjab government’s department of housing, urban development and public health engineering has now formally issued the notification.  
As per the notification, the authority will function only within the limits of Gujrat Metropolitan Corporation whereas formation of a board of directors has also been sanctioned.  
At least 298 posts have also been created for Gujrat PHA which will comprise 12 directors whereas a managing director will be appointed by the provincial government.  
The greenbelts and public parks across the city have been in a very poor condition for long as the local municipality and administration could not undertake maintenance of these facilities.  
A senior official of the district administration said with the creation of PHA in Gujrat the greenbelts and parks would easily be maintained as the local authorities had been demanding such an agency for the beautification of the city for a long time.  
Earlier in the month, the provincial government had released a grant of Rs500m as a first instalment for the expenditures on the establishment of Gujrat Waste Management Company (GtWMC).  
The amount has now been transferred to company’s bank account a couple of days ago, said an official source and added that with the establishment of Gtwmc and PHA in Gujrat, the city’s basic issues of cleanliness and beautification might get resolved.

11,Shahbaz Gill briefly ‘disappears’ from Lahore hospital,Gill was admitted to the hospital earlier this month after experiencing difficulty breathing.,"LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Dr Shahbaz Gill, who had allegedly disappeared from a VVIP room of Services Hospital on Friday afternoon, returned to the facility on Saturday.  
Mr Gill, who is also PTI chief Imran Khan’s chief of staff, was admitted to the hospital earlier this month owing to shortness of breath. He was reportedly having difficulty breathing and coughing.  
Services Hospital Medical Unit-II Registrar Dr Nauman Zafar had issued an absence report to the medical superintendent that Mr Gill had disappeared from a VVIP room of the facility without informing the management.  
The letter stated that during a visit to the VVIP room for Gill’s regular follow-up, he was found “no longer admitted to the hospital”, adding no file or record could be “retrieved” from the ward.  
Meanwhile, Punjab government’s spokesperson Musarrat Jamshed Cheema rejected the disappearance report, claiming Dr Gill was still under treatment at Services Hospital.  
“A day earlier, he went to a private orthopaedic for a check-up for some time,” she claimed on Twitter. 
Sources claimed the PTI leader had gone ‘missing’ from the hospital on Friday morning and returned on Saturday evening. “Mr Gill ran away from the hospital after Governor Balighur Rehman removed Chief Minister Parvez Elahi from office,” he said. He further said Gill returned after the Lahore High Court restored Mr Elahi and his cabinet. 
Dr Gill was facing a number of cases since his controversial comments about the military establishment on a private TV channel. He was also not hospitalised for the first time. Earlier, he was shifted to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences Islamabad after his health deteriorated in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail in September.  
Balochistan Police had also summoned Gill in connection with a sedition case registered against him in Qila Abdullah under seven sections of Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act 2016.  
Another case was registered in Karachi against him for inciting the public against a state institution earlier this month. A citizen, Muhammad Saeed, lodged the first information report against Gill at the Brigade police station for speaking against former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa.

12,‘Unknown people’ forced Punjab CS to sign governor’s order: Imran,"PTI chief says the chief secretary had tried to resist the ""pressure"".","LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan has claimed that Punjab Chief Secretary Abdullah Khan Sumbal was persuaded and pressurised by “namaloom afraad”, who usually call from unknown phone numbers, to sign and give effect to the governor’s notification denotifying the chief minister and his cabinet.  
Speaking to journalists at his Zaman Park residence here, Mr Khan said Governor Balighur Rehman had put forward legal opinions given by his private lawyers, including Khalid Ranjha, and wanted Chief Secretary Sumbal to sign the notification.  
Answering a question, he claimed the chief secretary had tried to resist the ‘pressure’ and written to the governor to appoint a panel of legal experts, but his demand remained unheeded.  
Sources also said Mr Sumbal was pushed to sign the governor’s notification on the basis of three legal experts’ opinions forwarded by the Governor House. They said the CS had explicitly responded to the order that there were varied interpretations of the notification and he needed inputs for a nuanced understanding of such a serious matter.  
They also said the CS was not detained or harassed, but he stayed engaged in long, protracted meetings and negotiations. He got a lot of solicited and unsolicited legal opinions.
Sources in the PML-Q also said the chief minister wanted the chief secretary to delay the notification.  
Meanwhile, PML-Q leader Moonis Elahi said in an interview to a news channel that the Punjab government was investigating who coerced the chief secretary to sign the notification. The governor’s personal lawyers had prepared legal opinion on the order, which was later suspended by the Lahore High Court, and wanted the chief secretary to sign on instantly.  
“The chief secretary takes legal opinion on legal matters from the Punjab Law Department or the advocate general, but he was denied this facility,” he claimed.  
Mr Elahi, however, expressed ignorance on the reports that Mr Sumbal was detained in his office for three hours, as claimed by PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry, before he signed the governor’s order denotifying the chief minister and dissolving the provincial cabinet. He also said he was unaware if the chief secretary was in touch with the chief minister.  
Mr Chaudhry had claimed on Friday that the Punjab Assembly had summoned the chief secretary for Saturday to explain what happened and who forced him to sign the notification after midnight on Thursday. Only elected representatives could elect or remove a chief minister, he maintained. 
However, sources told Dawn, the chief secretary was never summoned by the assembly to explain his position.
