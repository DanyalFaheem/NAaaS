0,ANP wants report on 2016 Quetta tragedy implemented,A terrorist attack on a govt hospital in Quetta in 2016 claimed the lives of more than 60 lawyers.,"ISLAMABAD: Awami National Party (ANP) president Asfandyar Wali Khan on Monday called for implementing the recommendations mentioned in the report of the inquiry commission headed by Justice Qazi Faez Isa on the terrorist attack on a government hospital in Quetta in which more than 60 lawyers died.
In a statement issued by the party’s information secretary Zahid Khan on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the Quetta incident, the ANP chief also called for implementing the National Action Plan against terrorism which had been prepared by all political parties of the country with consensus after the terrorist attack on Army Public School in Peshawar.
Mr Khan was of the view that terrorism could be eradicated only through the implementation of the Qazi Faez Isa report in letter and spirit.
He lauded the lawyers’ community for their struggle for the cause of sanctity of the bar and the bench despite facing such tragedies. He said the sacrifices rendered by the lawyers’ community so far in the wake of terrorism in the country would not go in vain.
The ANP chief said the terrorists had eliminated a whole generation of the lawyers in the bloody attack. He said some “conspirators” were still active in the region to destroy peace. He termed the terrorist attack on the lawyers in Quetta one of the biggest tragedies suffered by the country.
On Aug 8, 2016, terrorists struck a government hospital in Quetta where a large number of lawyers had gathered after an attack on Bilal Anwar Kasi, the president of the Balochistan Bar Association at the time.
Taking a suo motu notice, the Supreme Court constituted an inquiry commission under Justice Qazi Faez Isa and the 110-page report of the commission containing some 18 recommendations was published in December 2016.
“The people of Pakistan have been subjected to sustained terrorist attacks, which continue unabated, and deserve answers. Those who have failed the people of Pakistan need to be held accountable. Things cannot go on as they have been. Without top-tier accountability, it is unlikely systemic change will be possible,” stated the report, urging the state to re-exert itself against those spreading hatred and murder.
It also urged the state to strictly abide by the laws, such as the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), the National Counter-Terrorism Authority Act, the Pakistan Penal Code, and, above all, the Constitution of Pakistan.
The report suggested that the ATA “needs to be enforced, and terrorists/terrorist organisations must be proscribed without delay. They must not be permitted to hold meetings. Those claiming to be members of proscribed organisations should be prosecuted in accordance with the ATA.”

According to data released by the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), over 19,000 tests were conducted while the national positivity rate stood at 3.32 per cent. As many as 163 patients were in critical care.
Although the city-wise data showed a double-digit positivity rates, low testing in some cities has significantly skewed the data.
The positivity rate in Nowshera was 33.33pc; however, only three tests were conducted, of which one was found positive. Swabi also showed a similar result, with 30pc positivity rate from a mere 10 tests.
Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi were the only cities in which over a thousand tests were conducted.
The most number of tests — 5,389 — were conducted in Karachi, where 80 people tested positive for the coronavirus, showing a positivity rate of 1.4pc.
Pakistan has reported over 620 cases every day for the past 10 days with the exception of Aug 3 when 392 cases were reported.

In a specific reference to public gatherings and processions being held in connection with Muharram, the authority asked people to strictly use face masks and sanitiser.
The use of masks and sanitiser has been made mandatory for the participants of majalis and processions, the NCOC added.
According to it, only vaccinated people would be allowed to attend majalis which would be held in open spaces with adequate ventilation arrangements.
Besides, social distancing must be maintained during congregations and processions, while old people and children should refrain from attending gathering with huge crowds.
Last month, Karachi saw an uptick in the number of cases amid Eidul Azha celebrations and relentless monsoon rains. On July 12, the positivity rate in the country’s financial capital, reached alarming levels to come in at 39.5pc.
The country feared a renewed wave of the virus in June when the number of cases began increasing. However, authorities have said that the situation was currently under control due to a robust vaccination drive all over the country.

Flood-affected people receive relief goods distributed by the district administration in a village near Chaman on Monday.—Dawn

 
ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of National Health Services has sent a team of 12 doctors of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) to Balochistan’s Lasbela district to provide medical treatment to flood victims.
Talking to Dawn, the ministry’s spokesperson Sajid Shah said that the team will hold free medical camps in Uthal’s District Headquarters Hospital and Lakhra’s Rural Health Center.
“There are general physicians, general surgeons, neurosurgeons, orthopaedic surgeons and other experts in the team,” he said, adding that free medicine would also be provided to the patients.
In a statement, federal Health Minister Abdul Qadir Patel said that another consignment of medicines would be sent to Balochistan after Ashura.
“We will continue the support for our brothers in Balochistan and use all possible resources to provide them with relief,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Red Crescent Society (PRCS), with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC), has expanded its rescue and relief operations in Balochistan and other parts of the country under the Disaster Response and Emergency Fund (DREF).
The PRCS is carrying out relief activities in flood-hit areas of Balochistan. In addition to cash assistance, clean drinking water and hygiene kits will be distributed among the flood victims.
A high-level meeting at the PRCS headquarters took several decisions for relief and rehabilitation in the flo­od-affected areas of Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
PRCS Chairman Abrarul Haq said the Society was devoted to help people who were affected by heavy rainfall and floods.
He added that PRCS had deployed mobile health teams with doctors, paramedics and free medicine in Tank, Jhal Magsi and Jafferabad districts to provide health services to flood-affected population.

3,EU sees little cooperation between govt and parliament,Says security situation and access to justice are matters of concern; earmarks initial grant of 265m euros under MIP.,"ISLAMABAD: The European Union has observed that politics in Pakistan is highly partisan, with little cooperation and compromise solutions between the government and parliament despite three elections and two peaceful transitions between civilian governments since 2008.
The role of the military in politics and administration is seen as guarantee for stability, but also criticised for undermining civilian governance capacity, according to the ‘Multi-Annual Indicative Programme (MIP) for 2021-202, which was recently signed by Pakistan and the European Union.
The latest programming is guided by the country’s strategic development priorities and the overall geopolitical programme of the European Commission for promoting green and sustainable inclusive growth and jobs, advancing governance and human development, and fostering resilience, peace and security as well as digitalisation.
The duration of the new MIP is of seven years, for the period 2021 to 2027, and it will be implemented in two phases with a mid-term review of progress taking place in 2024. This review will provide an opportunity to possibly redefine and redirect EU priorities and actions in the light of evolving economic, social and political developments as well as lessons learnt.

Says security situation and access to justice are matters of concern

For this reason, EU has earmarked an initial grant of 265 million euros. The multi-annual indicative programme (MIP) and the ‘Vision 2025’ are expected to be revised, following the 2023 general elections. This will allow realigning the second half of the MIP with a new government strategy as it may emerge, EU document says.
The third elections since the end of the military regime in 2008 and, therefore, the second successive peaceful transfer of power between civilian governments took place in 2018 in relative calm. However, the security situation and access to justice in the country remains challenging.
The efficiency of law enforcement and judiciary institutions is impacted by outdated regulatory frameworks. There is thus the need for capacity strengthening, and for improved coordination and cooperation between the stakeholders. This situation affects both internal security and citizens’ trust in the institutions, as well as the investment climate.
A slow recovery from the Covid-19 crisis and its related socioeconomic impact could further delay needed economic and structural reforms. These will be mitigated through increased coordination and dialogue with other development partners, regular policy and political dialogue, provision of dedicated capacity building activities, including in the area of public financial management, mainly through technical assistance, and whenever possible exchange of expertise from EU member states.
The MIP will also aim at enhancing cooperation in the areas of the Strategic Engagement Plan such as economic, social, and environmental sustainability, energy, the rule of law, good governance and human rights. This MIP also fully takes into account the situation in Afghanistan further to the Taliban takeover, covering in a mainstreamed approach the refugees and their hosting communities, and complements the specific programmes financed at the regional level.
The MIP will address capacity issues and integrate disaster risk management in future programmes in order to increase resilience of economic activities, building upon actions supported by the EU’s humanitarian assistance.
While the MIP covers all the country, it is proposed to concentrate most of the support in the provinces and fragile territories adjacent to the western border with Afghanistan, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the territory of Gilgit-Baltistan. This support will be complemented by federal level interventions and whenever justified interventions in the other provinces and territories. The proposed geographical targeting should trigger increased focus and impact and a more transformational effect.
Agriculture is the main economic sector in Pakistan and water availability is under increasing stress. Skewed land distribution and precarious tenure rights impact negatively agricultural competitiveness and livelihood opportunities and keep small farmers and landless families trapped in poverty.
A critical factor to ensure that agriculture production can meet the growing food demand is access to energy.

4,ARY News ‘pulled off air’ in parts of country,"Transmission faced disruption in Islamabad, parts of Punjab and Sindh; channel blames Pemra.","ISLAMABAD: ARY News went off air on Monday evening in many parts of the country with the channel blaming the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) for the move.
However, Pemra didn’t give any reason for its action.
The channel’s transmission started to face disruptions at around 8pm in Islamabad, parts of Punjab and Sindh, though it was available in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
While local cable operators replaced the ARY News slot with other channels, the subscribers of Nayatel saw a static screen displaying the message: “The channel is currently unavailable. Sorry for the inconvenience.”
Some subscribers in Karachi received a message from their cable operators that the service had been suspended. The message read: “Valued customer, the transmission of ARY News is suspended on instructions of Pemra till further notice. Inconvenience is regretted.”
The channel said the “strategic media cell” of the ruling PML-N was spreading false information and fake news to create divisions between PTI chief Imran Khan and the armed forces.
It also said that several fake accounts were involved in defaming PTI by spreading fake news regarding the Lasbela helicopter crash, in which six army officers and soldiers were martyred.
Pemra officials could not be reached despite repeated attempts for comment, apparently due to restrictions on mobile phone services and slow internet on account of Ashura-related security measures.
ARY claimed that the channel was taken off air “after its June 27 report on the activation of the ruling PML-N’s strategic media cell proved to be true”.
But that could not be confirmed from official or other sources.
ARY News also went off air in May ahead of the PTI’s Azadi March.

6,Forensic audit finds irregularities in Establishment Division,"Report finds Rs48m spent on buying stationery and store items, weak internal, administrative controls, violation of policies.","ISLAMABAD: A forensic audit of the Establishment Division — the government’s human resources arm — has exposed poor administration, violation of its own policies and irregularities in financial matters.
The audit, ordered by former prime minister Imran Khan in March, was completed by the Auditor General for Pakistan, who recently submitted the report to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The audit points out that the national exchequer suffered a loss of Rs48 million as senior officials of the Establishment Division minted money through “fictitious purchase of stationery and other store items”.
The audit said the exercise violated the General Financial Rules, which state that the “purchase must be made in the most economical manner in accordance with the definite requirement of the public service”.

Report finds Rs48m spent on buying stationery and store items, weak internal, administrative controls, violation of policies, etc

The Establishment Division manages bureaucracy and, in turn, ensures the country’s affairs are run smoothly. It serves as the nerve centre of the bureaucracy and its officers act as management consultants for the federal government.
The audit report states that the division floated open tenders during 2016-17 and 2017-18 fiscal years to buy stationery and other store items and Rs48m was spent during the three fiscal years through 2018-19.
The procurement was made without approval from the purchase committee. An internal inquiry was conducted in the Establishment Division, but its findings were not shared with the audit team. The division spent Rs20.3m on stationery in 2017, Rs21.5m in 2018 and Rs6m in 2019.
A previous report had observed that “during the financial year 2018-19, there was a substantial decrease in expenditure on purchase of stationery”.
The audit held that this was a serious violation of General Financial Rules.
The audit objection was based on a complaint filed with the then establishment secretary Ejaz Munir. However, the Establishment Division’s section officer, who raised the issue, was posted out.
Chief Finance Officer Mohammad Afzal, who confirmed the financial irregularity and urged the establishment secretary to hold an inquiry, was also transferred from the division.
The inquiry into the matter has been pending since 2019, while the inquiry officer is proceeding abroad on a scholarship.
The latest forensic audit points out several reasons for this financial misappropriation, including “weak internal and administrative controls”, “partial implementation of E-Office applications”, “non-observance of rotation policy by the Establishment Division caused long-time stay of officers/officials in same posts”, “procurement of stationery, computer stationery and other store items on the basis of unrealistic demand” and “unauthorised purchase of stationery and other store items by a section officer”.
The audit recommends that the division must devise and implement a yearly procurement plan to end such financial irregularities in future.
It also suggests that the “rotation policy of staff and officers may be observed in true letter and spirit so that opportunities of misappropriation/fraud may be curtailed”.
A previous audit report pointed out that the Establishment Division itself has been violating the rules governing the transfer and posting of civil servants on deputation.
The auditors pointed out that several officers working at the division on deputation have overstayed their deputation period well over the extended five-year limit.
These officers include those from provincial education departments, ex-cadre and non-cadre officials and, in one instance, a veterinary doctor from Balochistan.
As per the Establishment Division’s own rules, “The normal period of deputation for all categories of government servants would be three years. This would be extendable by two years with the prior approval of the competent authority”.
After five years have elapsed, “both the borrowing and lending organisations must ensure the immediate repatriation of the deputationist”.
“If a person is on deputation to a government organisation and has completed the maximum tenure of five years, he must revert or be reverted by the borrowing office to his parent/lending organisation… otherwise, the audit offices concerned shall not make payment of salary and allowances to him beyond the date of expiry of five years,” according to the rules.

Pakistan requests UN, international community for humanitarian assistance

Karachi division has also sent two tonnes of dry ration and miscellaneous eatable items, besides mineral water bottles and juices to flood-hit areas.
Global community’s help sought
In a separate development, the federal government has officially requested the UN and international community for humanitarian assistance in view of the devastation caused by recent floods and heavy rainfall across Pakistan. 
According to the European Commission’s Directorate General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (Echo), the Foreign Office has officially asked the international community for assistance. 
According to initial estimates seven million people across Pakistan have been affected by floods with almost half of them from Balochistan, Echo said in a statement released on Sunday. 
Out of 35 Balochistan districts that were hit by flash floods and torrential rains, 24 have been declared calamity-hit, while nine were severely affected. These districts were: Lasbela, Jhal Magsi, Qila Saifullah, Pishin, Noshki, Kachhi, Khuzdar, Kalat and Chaman. 
According to Echo’s estimates, the total population in the affected districts was 3.1 million, of which 50 per cent was estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance. 
Balochistan Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) was already undertaking a rapid multi-sectoral assessment with technical support from the UN and other humanitarian partners, said Echo. 
The authority has also set up five camps with an accommodation capacity of 300 to 500 families per camp while several government institutions and humanitarian partners were also responding to the needs of flood victims. However, persisting severe weather conditions were stretching the capacity of already limited resources available to the stakeholders. 
Over the past few months, above average monsoon rains have significantly affected Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, resulting in urban flooding flash floods. 
Quoting Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Echo said that overall rainfall increased by 180pc from the expected level of 63mm, with Balochistan receiving the highest rainfall (163mm or 450 pc deviation) during July. “The crisis comes amidst a serious economic crisis in the country as well as an upward trend of a new wave of Covid-19,” it added.

17,Suspect held over attack on MPA in Dir,One suspect arrested by CTD and under interrogation; police spokesperson says case registered against unidentified persons.,"LOWER DIR:  One suspect was arrested by the Counter Terrorism Department and under interrogation as all four vicitims who were killed in an attack on a PTI MPA’s vehicle in Lower Dir were laid to rest at their ancestral graveyards on Sunday.
Malik Liaqat Ali Khan, the injured MPA, was shifted to a hospital in Islamabad from Peshawar’s Lady Reading Hospital on Sunday, his relatives said. 
The administration and law enforcement agencies denied imposition of curfew in the area, saying that a search operation was in progress to arrest attackers and their handlers.
Four persons, including two policemen, were killed and three others injured when the lawmaker’s vehicle came under attack in his home town late on Saturday night,
Malik Liaqat was returning home after attending a funeral at Nagotal Maidan on Saturday night when unknown assailants peppered his vehicle with bullets. 
Jehan Alam, brother of Malik Liaqat, Yasir, his nephew, police constable Naseer and Levies sepoy Bacha Rawan died on the spot. 
Besides the MPA, his aide Muhammad Shuiab, Huzaifa and Shakireen were seriously injured.
Law enforcement agencies had cordoned off the area after the attack. The suspects, taking advantage of the dark, managed to flee.
A spokesman for Zaimdara police station said a case against unidentified persons had been registered while a suspect, identified as Bakhtfoor, was taken into custody by the Counter Terrorism Department. He was taken to an undisclosed place for interrogation.
Moazzam Jah Ansari, the chief of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  police visited the scene of the attack and offered fateha. 
On Sunday, two relatives of the MPA were laid to rest at Gal Maidan. Moving scenes were witnessed during their funeral prayers. 
The locals called upon the government to arrest the killers and give them exemplary punishment.

The deputy commissioner laid floral wreaths on his grave. 
Talking to his relatives, the official assured him that killers would be arrested soon.
Maidan is the home town of Maulana Sufi Muhammad, founder of Tehreek-i-Nifaz-i-Shariat-i-Muhammadi. It remained under control of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan  in 2009. 
Although a military offensive cleansed the region of the militants, residents say some of them fled to Afghanistan and continued to operate from there to sabotage peace in the region.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan has directed the inspector general of police to take steps for the immediate arrest of the suspects.
Condemning the incident, the chief minister termed it a cowardly act and said the “culprits cannot dodge the law”. 
“The people involved in the incident will be arrested and brought to justice soon,” the chief minister said.

18,Fafen seeks reforms to regulate role of money in politics,Says ‘minimalist campaigns’ will enable ordinary citizens to contest polls.,"ISLAMABAD: The Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) on Sunday called upon parliament and political parties to strengthen the regulations on political finance to curtail the role of money in elections. 
It noted that unchecked use of money in electoral exercises practically deprived the majority of the population of exercising their right to contest elections.
In a statement, it asked the parliamentary parties and those outside the Parliament to develop a consensus on critical electoral reforms, including those required to regulate the use of money in elections.
It noted that the Elections Act 2017 has weak provisions to regulate political finance “which encouraged excessive use of money in 2018 general elections and subsequent by-elections and local government elections”.

Says ‘minimalist campaigns’ will enable ordinary citizens to contest polls

“Meaningful reforms for regulating election expen­ses and political finance were imperative to boost public confidence in the democratic dispensation. Fafen considers the recent order by the Election Commission on the prohibited funding case as the awakening call for strengthening legal and regulatory checks on parties’ accounts and sources of funds, along with provisions to bind the commission to scrutinise the political parties’ audited statements annually. The timely scrutiny is a prerequisite for greater diligence among political parties about their accounts and sources of funds,” the group of NGOs working together to make electoral processes more transparent said.
Fafen also recommended strengthening the legal framework to regulate expenses incurred during an election by contesting candidates and political parties alike, and timely scrutiny of assets and liabilities submitted by the members of parliament and provincial assemblies. “Any false or materially incorrect submissions or withholding information should be criminalised with punitive implications, including disqualification,” it said.
It pointed out that the current provisions in the Elections Act 2017 do not clearly define the election expenses or provide any implication for a person making election expenses on a candidate’s behalf without the candidate’s permission. While the law specifies the maximum limit for election expenses by the contesting candidates, there is no such bar on political parties, making it difficult for the commission to check any extravagant spending on an election campaign, it added.

19,Rana Sanaullah calls PTI’s power show ‘political stunt’,Says Imran trying to divert attention from his theft; warns whoever will not cooperate with FIA in funding probe will be arrested.,"ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah on Sunday said that PTI’s announcement to hold public gatherings across the country was a mere “political stunt” as former prime minister and PTI chairman Imran Khan was trying to divert attention from his theft, Geo.tv reported. 
In a statement, the interior minister said Mr Khan will suffer defeat during the upcoming by-elections on all the nine National Assembly seats that fell vacant after the NA speaker accepted the resignations of PTI MNAs. 
Commenting on the inquiry launched by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in prohibited funding received by the PTI, the minister warned that whoever will not cooperate with the FIA will be arrested. 
Without giving a date, Mr Sanaullah also said PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif will return to Pakistan ahead of general elections in 2023. 
On Saturday, the PTI’s political committee decided to hold a power show in Islamabad on Aug 13. The decision was taken at a meeting, chaired by Mr Khan and attended by Asad Umar, Fawad Chaudhry, Shireen Mazari, Omar Ayub, Saifullah Niazi and others. 
Reacting to Mr Sanaullah’s statement, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry warned the interior minister to refrain from issuing statements against the PTI chairman.
“Your [Mr Sanaullah’s] value is not more than an SHO of Kohsar police station,” Geo.tv reported while quoting Mr Chaudhry.

20,ADB to provide $200m for resource mobilisation programme,Fact-finding mission to arrive in Islamabad next week to discuss proposed loan with authorities.,"ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank will provide a loan of $200 million to Pakistan for a resource mobilisation programme, and an ADB fact-finding mission will arrive in Islamabad next week to discuss the proposed loan with authorities, it was learnt here on Sunday. 
The proposed ‘Improved Domestic Resource Mobilisation Reform Programme’ will help the government address major binding constraints to mobilise larger resources to enhance productive investment by improving domestic revenue mobilisation; quality of public expenditure and cash management for improving allocation efficiency of scarce public resources; and mobilisation and utilisation of domestic savings and foreign direct investment (FDI). 
These key reform areas were closely aligned with the government’s reform agenda for public sector management outlined in the ‘Vision 2025’, the national development strategy, the medium-term budget strategy, and ADB’s country partnership strategy for Pakistan covering 2021-2025 period. 
Prior to finalising the loan, the ADB had approved a technical assistance to Pakistan to prepare the improved domestic resource mobilisation reform programme to ensure fiscal sustainability and generate fiscal space to finance critical invest­ments in human capital, infrastructure and poverty alleviation. 
With a large informal economy, macroeconomic shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and the global supply chain disruption in 2021 have pushed the country’s poor deeper into poverty. 
ADB said the country’s ability to mobilise adequate domestic resources, including the creation of fiscal space through better expenditure management, remain critical to ensure quality investments in essential public services such as health and education and promote equitable development across its provinces. 
The transaction technical assistance will focus on the first and third key reform areas. Through the Ministry of Finance and Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the technical assistance will 
support the implementation of critical tax administration, pension system, and institutional and capacity development reforms in Pakistan. 
The assistance for the development and implementation of the second key reform area, for improving the quality of public expenditure and cash management, will be provided through an ongoing regional technical assistance facility for supporting public financial management and tax policy. 
According to details, the technical assistance coverage of all key reform areas will ensure not only adequate support for implementation of complex reforms but also strong demonstration of ADB value-addition. 
The technical assistance will be implemented by four international and seven national experts.

21,Missing Indian woman found in Pakistan counts days to return home,"Hamida Banu, who was missing for 20 years, was sent to Hyderabad in Sindh instead of Dubai by recruitment agent.","

Hamida Banu: pining for home

 
AN INDIAN woman who was missing for 20 years has been found in Pakistan with the help of a video on social media. Hamida Banu left India in 2002 after a recruitment agent promised to get her the job of a cook in Dubai. Instead, she says, she was tricked and trafficked to Pakistan. 
Banu’s family in India’s Mumbai told BBC Marathi that they spent two decades trying to find her — and they finally managed to do so because of two men, one in India and the other in Pakistan. 
In Banu’s case, she was also hobbled by a lack of financial resources and know-how. 
But through the years, she never stopped yearning to meet her children. Finally, last month, Waliullah Maroof, a social media activist, interviewed Banu and uploaded the video online. 
Indian journalist Khalfan Shaikh, who lives in Mumbai, shared the video with his followers, which led to Banu’s family finding her. 

Hamida Banu was sent to Hyderabad, Sindh, instead of Dubai by recruitment agent

The two men then helped set up a video call between Banu and her daughter Yasmin Shaikh. “How are you? Did you recognise me? Where were you all these years?” Yasmin was seen asking in the emotional video. 
“Don’t ask me where I was, and how I have been. I missed you all so much. I didn’t stay here willingly, I had no other choice,” Banu replies. 
Banu’s journey
In the interview with Maroof, Banu says she had been financially supporting her four children in India after her husband’s death. She had worked as a cook in Doha, Qatar, Dubai and Saudi Arabia in the past without any problems. 
In 2002, she had approached a recruitment agent to help arrange a job in Dubai. The woman asked her to pay 20,000 rupees. 
Banu says in the video that instead of Dubai, she was brought to Hydera­bad in Pakistan. There, she said, she was detained in a house for three months.
Sometime over the years, she married a man who lived in Karachi — but he died during the Covid-19 pandemic. Banu now lives with her stepson. 
Yasmin says that in her mother’s previous stints abroad, she would call them regularly. But after she left in 2002, they waited months for a phone call. Finally, they approached the agent who had organised the trip. 
“She told us that our mother was well and didn’t want to speak with us. We kept returning to ask questions about our mother, and then she [the agent] suddenly vanished,” Yasmin added. 
Finding Banu
Maroof, an imam at a mosque in Karachi, says he first met her around 15 years ago when she moved to his neighbourhood and opened a small shop. “I have been seeing her since my childhood. She always looked distressed,” he says. 
For years, Maroof had used his social media accounts to help women from Bangladesh — who had been trafficked to Pakistan — find their families. 
After Banu’s second husband died, she often asked Maroof’s mother to persuade him to help her as well. 
Maroof said he sympathised with her, but was hesitant because of the frosty relations between Pakistan and India.
“My friends advised me to stay away from India, suggesting that 
it might land me in trouble. However, I felt so bad for her that I couldn’t resist it anymore,” he said, saying that he doesn’t take any money for his efforts. 
In the interview, Banu had mentioned her Mumbai address and the names of her children. 
When Shaikh shared the video, it was spotted by Yasmin’s son, Aman. The 18-year-old had never met his grandmother, as he was born after she left, but Yasmin recognised her immediately. 
Maroof said that officials at the Indian High Commission in 
Pakistan have contacted him and asked Banu to submit an application with details of the case so they can begin the process of repatriation. But he isn’t sure how much time it will take. 
In the meantime, Banu is counting the days until she can return home. She said she had almost lost hope of ever meeting her children again. 
Across the border, the emotions were similar, Yasmin said. 
“We waited for her for 20 years. I am so happy now. I can’t stop smiling ever since I saw that video. It’s a strange feeling.”

22,Questions raised over Reko Diq deal,"Voices being raised against ""compromise solution"" with investor, says Balochistan Economic Forum head.","QUETTA: Balochistan Economic Forum president Sardar Shoukat Popalzai on Sunday expressed reservations over the recently signed agreement on Reko Diq between the Balochistan government and a Canadian company, Barrick Gold Barrick Gold Corporation, saying serious concerns needed to be addressed before implementing the project. 
In a statement, he said copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq were considered to be one of the largest in the world and the project was valued at $260 billion.
“More and more voices were now being raised against the compromise solution with the investor and calling for autonomy and mineral rights,” he said while adding that the involvement of locals was the key to the project’s success.
He said neglecting the locals result in mineral-rich areas results in poverty and further leads to conflicts and agitation. 
He said the mineral sector in Balochistan has suffered greatly due a myriad of challenged including the law and order situation and political instability.
Corruption and malpractice in awarding contracts, shares in the income beyond royalties and shares of locals in revenue were also the issues that have hampered projects in the past, said Mr Popalzai. 
He added that Pakistan had suffered international embarrassment due to the $6billion penalty imposed on the country for in the Reko Diq case.
He further added that in the past, Saindak copper project had suffered greatly due to mismanagement by successive governments and resulted in huge losses to the national exchequer. 
“It [Saindak project] was finally developed with the help of a friendly country, while many other mineral projects, like lead and zinc project at Duddar, also faced difficulties in which Irish and Australian companies have made huge investments but abandoned the project due to bureaucratic red tape.”
An iron ore project in Dilband was mishandled by a public sector company, which was awarded the contract despite lacking expertise and past experience, he added. 
Mr Popalzai said that in 1993, Balochistan government, through Balochistan Development Authority, signed an agreement for prospecting, exploration and exploitation with Broken Hill Proprietary Minerals (BHPM) of Australia for Reko Diq and for seven years, there was no physical progress on the site.
Pakistan had been embroiled in arbitration since the Supreme Court in 2013 declared null and void the Reko Diq development lease, signed with Barrick Gold and Chilean firm Antofagasta. In 2019, World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) had imposed a penalty on Pakistan for unlawful denial of mining. 
However, in March, the consortium of Barrick and Antofagasta reached an agreement with the government for the settlement of ICSID’s award. Barrick decided to become a 50 per cent partner with the governments of Pakistan and Balochistan and state-owned entities in the project, while the Chilean firm exited the contract in exchange for $900 million by Pakistani shareholders.
Earlier this month, Barrick Gold Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said sought a legal cover for the deal saying that he expected Pakistani parliament and the Supreme Court to sanctify the $6 billion out-of-court settlement to pave the way for $7bn investment in the project. 
This was the first time that the demand for support from the major state institutions — parliament and the judiciary — had come to light for a commercial agreement on settlement of the arbitration award against Pakistan.

23,Anger as Balochistan’s remote areas await help,"Six more rain-related deaths reported in province; more rains, flash floods across the country predicted this week.","QUETTA/ISLAMABAD: As rescue and relief operation in Balochistan’s flood-hit districts continued, people in many far-flung areas were still waiting for aid from the government and welfare organisations.
On Sunday, six more rain-related deaths were reported in different areas of Balochistan, taking the total numbers of casualties to 176 in the province and over 80 injured.
Homeless and without food and drinking water, hundreds of people in Jhao and other areas of Awaran district protested on Sunday against the administration’s failure to launch relief operations. The land route of the district with other areas of the province remained cut off due to washing away of bridges and link roads.
Protesters gathered at the main road linking Jhao to Karachi suspending traffic. They placed road blocks and chanted slogans against the district administration.
They alleged that despite being badly affected by rain and flash floods, relief goods sent for Awaran district were distributed to other areas.

More rains, flash floods across the country predicted this week

While talking to Dawn, Obaidullah Umrani, a local Balochistan Awami Party leader, said that injustice in distribution of relief goods and aid was unacceptable and there should be an equitable distribution among all affected people.
“Standing crops and date orchards have been destroyed by floods and people were deprived of their livelihood,” he said, adding that roads were not fully restored between Awaran and Karachi which resulted in food shortages in Mashkey, Jhao, Gajjar and other areas.
Shops were running out of food items and other daily use items, he added.
He also demanded Balochistan Chief Minister Abdul Qudus Bezenjo to take notice of this “injustice” and provide relief goods to flood victims in Awaran.
Reports from Mashkey also painted a grim picture as people were still reeling from the devastation left behind by flood and torrential rains as several areas were still inundated with flood water, creating hurdles in rescue and relief operations.
Kalat Division Commissioner Muhammad Dawood Khilji and Awaran deputy commissioner visited flood-hit areas in Awaran on Saturday and directed the authorities concerned to speed up relief and rescue operations in the area.
“Kalat division was badly affected by floods which caused massive destruction in Lasbela, Khuzdar, Mastung and other areas,” said Mr Khilji while adding that the government was making all out efforts to provide maximum relief to people.
He said that thousands of people who were rendered homeless in Hub and other areas of Lasbela district were moved to tent cities.
Nasirabad Division Commissioner Fateh Khan Khajjak, along with Base Commander Shahbaz Airbase Asim Raja distributed 1,000 bags of ration among displaced families in Goth Pilyani area and also provided medicine to 614 patients.
The situation in Jhal Magsi and Nasirabad was improving as more rains were not reported in the area. We have already distributed 2,500 bags of ration in Nasirabad division so far and established medical camps,” Mr. Khajjak said. 
As several parts of the country were still reeling from the devastation left behind by previous spell of torrential rains, Flood Forecasting Division (FFD), on Sunday issued an advisory, warning of more flash floods and urban flooding in several cities between Aug 10 and 14, adds APP. 
According to the advisory, a low pressure area formed over northwestern Bay of Bengal was likely to become more marked in the upcoming days while mild moist currents from both Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal continue to penetrate into upper parts of the country up to 4,000 feet.
Monsoon activity was likely to become vigorous during Aug10 to 14 over Sindh and Balochistan. However, the upper half of the country and southern Punjab will have a relatively less intense activity from Aug 10 to 13.
Furthermore, isolated to scattered thunderstorm and rain may also occur over Punjab’s Rawalpindi, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Lahore, Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur divisions; Sindh; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; eastern Balochistan and over upper catchments of rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej during the same period. 
Heavy rains may generate urban flooding in Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Hyderabad, Dadu, Jamshoro, Sukkur, Larkana, Shaheed Benazirabad, Mirpurkhas, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Lahore, Gujranwala, Peshawar, Nowshera and Mardan divisions, the advisory added.
Flash floods were also expected in nullahs of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Shakargarh, Sialkot, Narowal, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Dir, Karak, Lakki Marwat, Bannu, Qilla Saifullah, Loralai, Barkhan, Kohlu, Musakhel, Sherani, Sibi, Bolan, Kalat, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Turbat, Panjgur, Pasni, Jiwani, Ormara Gwadar and some areas of Azad Kashmir.
Catchment areas of Ravi, Jhelum and Chenab rivers may receive heavy downpour, which could significantly increase the water level, while scattered thunderstorm and moderate rain was also expected over the upper catchment of River Indus, during the next 24 hours.
Water level normal in rivers 
The Federal Flood Commission (FFC) has said that water level has returned to normal in all main rivers except for River Indus which was flowing in medium flood at the Guddu-Sukkur reach. 
According to FFC’s daily report on Sunday, the combined live storage of Tarbela Dam, Mangla Dam and Chashma Barrage was 7.837 MAF —58.22 per cent of the total 13.461 MAF capacity.
