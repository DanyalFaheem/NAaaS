KARACHI/LAHORE: Arshad Nadeem had an unwavering conviction coursing through his veins in Birmin­gham on Sunday evening that no matter what the other competitors did, no matter what the state of his injured elbow would be, he would be the one with the gold medal across his neck.
And since his record-breaking throw of 90.18 metres in the javelin final of the Commonwealth Games brought Pakistan’s first track and field medal at the quadrennial spectacle in 56 years, everything’s been a rush for him.
It’s understandable. Pakistan’s wait for an athletics gold has been even longer. Before Sunday, the last time the country’s flag was raised; the national anthem played at the track and field venue for the Commonwealth Games was 60 years ago.
Arshad, who improved on his personal best three times during the session, was in tears after his victory but had a wide grin as the rendition of the national anthem came to an end — the medal he’d so longed for, and promised he’d deliver, draped around his neck.
Longing for another gold
Once off the podium, it was time for his dope test. Once done with giving his sample, it was almost midnight.
Monday was time to pack all the stuff and catch a flight to Turkiye, where Arshad is looking forward to another gold at the Islamic Solidarity Games.
“Just another day in an athlete’s jet-set life,” Arshad told Dawn in an interview while rushing to the airport, already running late to his flight for Konya.
Arshad had arrived in England after competing at the World Athletics Championships in Oregon where he finished fifth. His first stop was the Cambridge University where Dr Ali Sher Bajwa checked his elbow injury. He wasn’t a part of the Pakistan contingent’s march at the opening ceremony and was flying out well before the start of Monday’s closing ceremony.
“I’ve got the gold and that’s what matters most to me,” said Arshad.
What’s more remarkable about Arshad’s victory in Birmingham is that he didn’t have his coach with him. Salman Butt was watching Arshad perform on television after he couldn’t get his accreditation made in time.
It wasn’t a surprise for Salman that Arshad became the first javelin thrower from South Asia to cross the 90-metre barrier.
“He can do even better,” Salman told Dawn on Monday. “I was convinced he could do it.”
Arshad too believed. “I wasn’t going to give up without a fight … I knew I would win.”
Arshad had led the contest for the longest time, but it seemed Grenadian world champion Anderson Peters had turned the contest on its head when he launched the javelin to 88.64 metres with his penultimate throw. But Arshad hit back immediately with a throw that set the Games record and sealed the gold medal.
Wild celebrations
That sparked wild celebrations across the country, but the loudest ones were in Arshad’s hometown of Mian Chunnu where family members had all gathered around a television set.
“It was a great moment for the family,” his brother Aleem Arshad told Dawn. “At the same time, we were concerned about how his heavily-strapped elbow was holding up.”

Arshad revealed that he was in a “lot of pain but the desire to win meant all the pain was forgotten.”
He, however, realises that he can’t carry on with his elbow pain for long if he’s to fulfil his lofty ambitions.
“Dr Bajwa has had a good look at my elbow but hasn’t exactly told me what we need to do,” he said. “Once we’re done with the Islamic Games, we’ll start with the treatment.
“We have some time till next year’s Asian Games in China and I’m hoping that I’m pain-free for that as well as the 2024 Paris Olympics.”
Dr Bajwa termed Arshad’s victory “a miracle”.
“We will soon sit down with his coach [Salman] and the Athletics Federation of Pakistan to finalise a roadmap for his early recovery,” he told Dawn on Monday. “There is also an old knee problem which we’re looking at.”
Salman believes that once the injuries are treated, Arshad can improve his best distance “by a further five metres”.
Arshad, who finished fifth at last year’s Olympics in Tokyo, had a two-month training camp in South Africa under coach Terseus Liebenberg before competing at the world championships.
During his time in South Africa, Arshad met javelin world record holder Jan Zelenzy of Czech Republic, who threw the spear to a distance of 98.26 metres in 1996.
“The aim is to set the world record,” Arshad said. “Zelenzy told me to keep training hard and it will happen. I know I have the capacity to do that.”
Pakistan-India rivalry
Arshad’s mark at the Games was 39 centimetres short of the Olympic record set by Norwegian Andreas Thorkildsen in 2008 but much better than Neeraj Chopra’s winning effort of 87.86 metres in Tokyo.
India’s Chopra was ruled out of the Commonwealth Games due to injury, but he was quick to congratulate Arshad on social media with the duo sharing a friendly rivalry.
They have been competing against each other since 2016 and while Neeraj seemed to be a rung above Arshad, the Pakistani beating him to the 90m mark has raised hopes of a South Asian battle for supremacy at javelin’s top table in the years to come.
“It has set things up very nicely,” Arshad’s coach Salman said. “It’s going to be an interesting battle between them in the forthcoming events.”

1,Biden slams attacks on Muslims,WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has denounced the recent killings of four Muslim men in New Mexico state that...,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has denounced the recent killings of four Muslim men in New Mexico state that police are treating as a hate crime against Muslims. 
“I am angered and saddened by the horrific killings of four Muslim men in Albuquerque,” President Biden said on Twitter on Sunday. “While we await a full investigation, my prayers are with the victims’ families, and my administration stands strongly with the Muslim community. These hateful attacks have no place in America.”
New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham called the killings “wholly intolerable” and said she was sending additional state police officers to Albuquerque to aid in the investigation. “We will continue to do everything we can to support the Muslim community of Albuquerque and greater New Mexico,” she said.
A Muslim community leader in the city of Albuquerque, where the killings happened, said the assurances were much needed.
“Incredibly terrified. Panicked. Some people want to move from the state until this thing is over. Some people have moved from the state,” Ahmad Assed, president of the Islamic Center of New Mexico (ICNM), told CNN. “Businesses are closing ... early. Students won’t leave their homes.”
ICN’s Director Public Affairs Tahir Gauba said the area’s Christian and Jewish groups are holding an interfaith meeting at the ICNM mosque on Tuesday, where they would pray with Muslims to underline their support for the community.
A Jewish community centre has offered to deliver halal food to the area’s Muslims “if they are afraid of going out to do grocery,” Gauba said.
Two of the victims — Mohammad Afzal Hussain and Naeem Hussein — were Pakistanis. Two others — Aftab Hussain and Mohammad Ahmadi — were Afghans, although they lived in Pakistan too as refugees before migrating to the United States.
Afzal Hussain, 27, was born in Hujra Shah Moqeem in 1994, was killed on Aug 1 near his home, while Naeem Hussain, 25, was killed on Friday. He was from the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas.
Aftab Hussain, 41, was killed on July 26 in the city’s international district. Mohammad Ahmadi, 62, the first victim of this senseless violence, was killed in November behind the halal market he and his brother owned.
Afzal’s brother Mohammad Imtiaz Hussain said the White House contacted the ICNM soon after the Aug 1 murder. “Even President Biden issued a statement.”

2,"Shell-shocked Gaza starts clearing rubble, burying dead as truce holds",Israel and Islamic Jihad warn each other of response if ceasefire violated,"

PALESTINIAN youths salvage belongings from the rubble of their house, which was destroyed during Israel’s air strikes in Rafah last week.—AFP

 
GAZA CITY: Shell-shocked Gazans on Monday sifted through the rubble of three days of deadly conflict between Israel and Islamic Jihad militants as a truce held and life slowly returned to normal.
An Egypt-brokered ceasefire reached late Sunday ended the intense fighting that killed 44 people, including 15 children, and wounded 360 in the enclave according to Gaza’s health ministry.
Israel had since Friday launched a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of Islamic Jihad positions in Gaza, leading the latter to fire over a thousand rockets in retaliation, according to the Israeli army.
As relative calm returned to Gaza on Monday, and electricity was restored, Palestinians tried to salvage their belongings from the rubble of shattered homes and to start clearing the debris.

Israel and Islamic Jihad warn each other of response if ceasefire violated

“We received the news of the ceasefire with joy and happiness and we went back to our work,” said Gaza shopkeeper Hazem Douima. “We did not want more bloodshed.”
Bereaved families buried their dead, including at one funeral joined by hundreds of mourners in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip where a family laid to rest four minors killed in the conflict.
“Gaza is tending to its wounds,” said one resident, Mohammed Alai.
Gaza’s sole power plant, after a two-day shutdown, “started working to generate electricity”, said spokesman Mohammed Thabet, hours after fuel trucks passed the reopened good border crossing.
The outage had sparked fears about the impact on hospitals overwhelmed with casualties amid Gaza’s worst fighting since an 11-day war with militant movement Hamas last year.
‘Right to respond’
The Israeli military said roads would gradually reopen in the border area where restrictions were imposed in the lead-up to the offensive, which Israel said was launched to stop looming attacks.
Three people in Israel were wounded by shrapnel and 31 lightly hurt while running for safety, emergency services said.
Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid’s office late Sunday agreed to the truce, but said that “if the ceasefire is violated”, Israel “maintains the right to respond strongly”.
Islamic Jihad also accepted the truce, but said it too “reserves the right to respond”. US President Joe Biden welcomed the truce and thanked Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for Cairo’s role in brokering it.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that it was “crucial to work to consolidate the ceasefire”.
Tehran said it will always “defend the active resistance”.
Islamic Jihad said 12 of its leaders and members had been killed. The groups Mohammad al-Hindi said the ceasefire deal “contains Egypt’s commitment to work towards the release of two prisoners”.
They were named as Bassem al-Saadi, a senior figure in the group’s political wing who was recently arrested in the occupied West Bank, and Khalil Awawdeh, a commander, also in Israeli detention. North of Gaza in the Israeli city of Asheklon where air raid silents had wailed and people fled to bunkers, beachgoers returned to the Mediterranean shore.
Sitting in a cafe, Eitan Casandini said locals were feeling “very good”. “After we destroy them we can sleep peacefully,” he said. “I don’t think (Islamic) Jihad will do anything again in the next three or four years.”
Islamic Jihad is aligned with Gaza’s rulers Hamas but often acts independently.
Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of the enclave in 2007, including the conflict in May last year.
Israel has said it was necessary to launch a “pre-emptive” operation against Islamic Jihad, while the diplomatic official said the group had been planning an attack by sniper fire or with anti-tank missiles.
The army killed senior leaders of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, including Taysir al-Jabari and Khaled Mansour. The senior Israeli diplomatic official said Islamic Jihad had been dealt “a very serious blow” which had “taken them back decades”.

3,UK govt under pressure to act over cost of living crisis,Bank of England warns long recession is on its way as energy prices surge to unprecedented levels.,"LONDON: The British government came under pressure on Monday to set out plans immediately to support families through a mounting cost of living crisis, with a leading business group and former prime minister saying a political vacuum cannot be allowed to last.
The Bank of England warned on Thursday a long recession was on its way as energy prices surge to unprecedented levels, pushing inflation to a 40-year high of 9.4 per cent in June and leaving many households on the brink of economic hardship.
But the political response has been stymied by the race to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister after he was forced to quit over a string of scandals. While he remains in office, he has recently been on holiday and his successor will not be announced until September 5.
Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the country could no longer afford to wait for a new leader, with action needed now before energy prices leap again by an expected 70pc in October.
Brown, the country’s finance minister for 10 years from 1997 and prime minister from 2007 to 2010 during the financial crash, said many households were facing an economic timebomb.
“Take action this week and deal with these multiple problems that amount to a national emergency,” he told LBC Radio. “You don’t wait till the crisis hits you in October and then say you’re surprised.”
The CBI agreed, urging the prime minister and finance minister to prevent a “summer of drift” by meeting the two candidates to replace Johnson — foreign minister Liz Truss and former finance minister Rishi Sunak — and agree a way forward.
Britain’s energy regulator Ofgem will publish its new domestic household price cap on August 26.
“We simply cannot afford a summer of government inactivity while the leadership contest plays out followed by a slow start from a new prime minister and cabinet,” Tony Danker, CBI Director-General, said in a statement.
Johnson’s spokesperson said it would be up to the next British leader to decide whether further support was needed, and that the government had already put in place a funding package to help people this winter.

4,"A year on, Afghans hide out fearing death by data","Taliban have access to payroll data, digital ID systems; donors, aid agencies fail to secure systems, activists say.","• Taliban have access to payroll data, digital ID systems
• Donors, aid agencies fail to secure systems, activists say
KABUL: Sadaf was at work last year at the attorney general’s office in suburban Kabul when her sister rang with news that the Taliban had entered the Afghan capital, and begged her to race home.
“Cover your face! And don’t tell anyone where you work,” her sister said, her voice shaking with fear.
Sadaf didn’t know it then but this was the start of exile within her own country, a life of lying low to avoid death by data. Like thousands of Afghans, she has spent the past year hiding out in a series of safe houses, hoping to evade her digital trail and prevent the Taliban tracking her family.
When her sister broke news of the takeover, Sadaf grabbed her bag and rushed from the office, pulling her headscarf low over her face and tucking her office ID into her shoe.
Outside was chaos. Streets were jammed with vehicles and people running in every direction, desperate to flee. After walking part way home, Sadaf hitched a ride and made it to her house two hours later.
She quickly hugged her three children, then shut herself in the bedroom, gathered all her identity papers and any documents related to work, and burnt the lot in the bathroom sink.
“I was very scared,” said Sadaf, who had worked at the government office for more than 25 years — over half her life. The 48-year-old, who asked that her last name not be used, knew only too well the danger she faced.
The Taliban had previously bombed their vehicles; Sadaf was injured in two of those attacks and had lost several colleagues.
“I didn’t want anything to fall into the hands of the Taliban,” she said by text message from an undisclosed location in Afghanistan.
A week after the Taliban took over, men knocked on Sadaf’s door and spent hours searching her home. They knew where she worked, and left with a warning that they were watching.
The next day, Sadaf packed her belongings and fled, along with her children and husband, a carpenter. They have been in hiding ever since, lodging with relatives and friends, and never staying anywhere for more than two weeks.
“I am in danger because of my job,” said Sadaf.
Sadaf is among the tens of thousands of Afghans — including former government officials, judges, police and human rights activists — who remain in hiding one year on, fearful of being tracked with digital ID and data systems that the militants gained with regime change.
In the past year, human rights groups and the United Nations have documented the killing or enforced disappearance of hundreds of former members of the security forces, as well as journalists, judges, activists and LGBT+ people.
A Taliban spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Like many poor nations, Afghanistan pushed to digitise its data in recent years with funding and expertise from the World Bank, United States, European Union, the United Nations’ refugee agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme and others. One such programme is the digital ID system known as e-Tazkira, which holds a wealth of personal and biometric data including a person’s name, ID number, place and date of birth, gender, marital status, religion, ethnicity, language, profession, iris scans, fingerprints, and a photograph.
The ID is needed to access services, jobs and to vote. But it also exposes vulnerable ethnic groups, and people who worked in government or with foreign agencies, rights groups say.
“Everyone is vulnerable,” said Aziz Rafiee, executive director of the non-profit Afghan Civil Society Forum, who gets hundreds of desperate messages every day from Afghans in hiding. The systems were “a big mistake right from the beginning”.
“In a country like Afghanistan, there is always the possibility that the information would end up in the hands of terrorists, and you could be killed,” said Rafiee, who did not apply for an e-Tazkira, fearing this very outcome.
Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch confirmed that the Taliban controlled payroll data of the government and the supreme court, and biometric systems of the police and army, and those who worked with foreign governments and aid agencies.
“For those in hiding, there is no way to avoid detection because the Taliban are carrying out identity checks — with photos, fingerprints, iris scans — at checkpoints,” said Belkis Willie, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.
“So people are not able to leave the houses they are hiding in. In addition, anyone who goes to the passport office to get their passports to try and leave the country — their identity would be very clear to anyone,” she said.
Life and death by data
Advocates for biometric registration say it enables more accurate counts and identification of people in need, ensures more efficient aid delivery, and helps prevent fraud. But critics say registers can be misused for profiling and surveillance, and many exclude the most vulnerable of people.
The events in Afghanistan have underscored the risks of ID systems that are built without considering the possible impact on human rights, and without safeguards to prevent abuse, said Raman Jit Singh Chima at Access Now, a digital rights group.
Over the past year, digital rights groups have called on aid agencies, foreign donors, and telecom and tech companies to rethink how they gather biometric data, and to secure their systems to prevent harm. But this has not happened, said Chima, a policy director.
“Digital ID programmes with grave implications for human rights are still being implemented, or encouraged, even in high risk or crisis hit environments,” he said.
And in Afghanistan, Sadaf is still in hiding. “Lack of employment and poverty on the one hand, and fear on the other hand, has made my life very difficult,” Sadaf said. “I wish this was a nightmare and that I could wake up.”

5,"Israel, Palestinians agree to truce in Gaza Strip",The hostilities leave 41 people dead in the Hamas-ruled territory...,"GAZA CITY: Israel and the Islamic Jihad group agreed to a Cairo-mediated truce on Sunday, raising hopes of an end to the most serious flare-up on the Gaza frontier in more than a year.
The truce came into effect at 20.30 GMT, Islamic Jihad and the Israeli government said in separate statements.
Since Friday, Israeli forces pounded Gaza Strip through the weekend, triggering longer-range rocket attacks against its cities.
The latest clashes have echoed preludes to previous Gaza flare-ups, though they have been relatively contained as Hamas, the governing group in Gaza Strip and a more powerful force than Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad, has so far stayed out.
Gaza officials said 43 Palestinians, almost half of them civilians and including children, had so far been killed. The rockets have threatened much of southern Israel and sent residents in cities, including Tel Aviv and Ashkelon,  to shelters.

The hostilities leave 41 people dead in the Hamas-ruled territory

Israel launched what it called pre-emptive strikes on Friday against what it anticipated would be an Islamic Jihad attack meant to avenge the arrest of a leader of the group, Bassam al Saadi, in occupied West Bank.
In response, Islamic Jihad said, it had fired hundreds of rockets at Israel. The group said the truce would involve al Saadi’s release. 
On Sunday, Islamic Jihad extended its range to fire toward Jerusalem in retaliation for the overnight killing of its southern Gaza commander by Israel — the second such senior member it has lost in the fighting.
Israel said its Iron Dome interceptor, whose success rate the army claims to be 97 percent, shot down the rockets just west of the city. Palestinians dazed by another surge of bloodshed — after outbreaks in 2008-09, 2012, 2014 and last year — picked through the ruins of houses to salvage furniture or documents.
“Who wants a war? No one. But we also don’t like to keep silent when women, children and leaders are killed,” said a Gaza taxi driver who identified himself only as Abu Mohammad. “An eye for an eye.”
17 Palestinians killed
Nine children were among 17 Palestinians killed on Sunday in Gaza, raising the toll to 41 since fighting began on Friday. 
Gaza’s health ministry said more than 300 people were wounded in Gaza since Saturday. Two rockets were intercepted in the centre of Israel’s com­mercial capital Tel Aviv on Sunday evening. 
“We haven’t slept for days (due to) heat and shelling and rockets, the sound of aircrafts hovering above us... is terrifying,” Nour Abu Sultan, 29, said. 
Since Friday, Israel has carried out heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of Islamic Jihad positions in Gaza, with the latter firing hundreds of rockets in retaliation. 
Buildings have been reduced to rubble in Gaza, while Israelis have been forced to shelter from a barrage of rockets. 
Dalia Harel, a resident in the Israeli town of Sderot close to the Gaza border, said she was “disappointed” at news of a truce despite her five children being “traumatised”. 
“We’re tired of having a military operation every year,” she said. “We need our military and political leaders to get it over with once and for all...we’re not for war, but we can’t go on like this.” 
Islamic Jihad extended its barrage earlier on Sunday to fire two rockets targeting Jerusalem, but they were shot down by the Israeli army. 
The military has said the entire “senior leadership of the military wing of the Isla­mic Jihad in Gaza has been neutralised”. 
Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director general of the Shifa hospital in Gaza City, said medics were treating wounded people in a “very bad condition”, warning of dire shortages of drugs and fuel to run power generators. “Every minute we receive injured people,” he said earlier Sunday. 
The Gaza health ministry said 15 children were among the 41 dead. Eyewitnesses saw six bodies at the hospital there, including three minors.

6,Imran to spell out ‘counter-fascism’ strategy on Aug 13,"Says country is being ruled by a ""cabal of crooks and their handlers"".","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan on Sunday said that in order to counter the “fascist” government led by coalition parties, he will announce a strategy to “counter this fascism” during a rally at Islamabad’s Parade Ground on August 13.
In a tweet, the former premier said “every era has its Yazids”. He equated fascism with Yazidiat and termed the rulers as present-day Yazids.
He said Pakistan is facing fascism today in the form of rule by a “cabal of crooks and their handlers” brought to power through US regime change conspiracy. “Will our people bow down before this conspiracy in fear or, as a nation, face up to the challenge?” he asked.

 





 

Says country is being ruled by a ‘cabal of crooks and their handlers’

The decision to organise what Mr Khan termed ‘Azadi March’ a day before Independence Day was taken by the PTI leadership on Aug 6.
In a comment on the upcoming gathering at Parade Ground, PTI leader Ali Awan claimed that the public meeting on Aug 13 will pave the way for “true independence”. 
Speaking to the members of regional advisory council in Islamabad, he claimed that it will be for the third time in the history of Islamabad that Parade Ground will be “completely filled” with people. “Every time only PTI has made it possible,” he added. 
Commenting on the decision by the party chairman that he will contest by-elections on all nine seats, Mr Awan said that the former prime minister has proved that he can fight against all his opponents alone. 
“Opponents don’t have the courage to face Imran Khan and now they have been trying to find technical reasons to stop him from contesting [elections] on nine seats. We are confident that Imran Khan will win all the nine seats and make a record in the history of Pakistan,” he said.

7,Muslims in New Mexico's Albuquerque urged not to walk alone at night,Police ask citizens to share any tips they may have about 4 recent murders that are being treated as hate crimes against Muslims.,"WASHINGTON: Police in the New Mexico city of Albuquerque urged citizens on Sunday to share any tips they may have about four recent murders that police are treating as hate crimes against Muslims. 
In a separate message, the Islamic Center of New Mexico (ICNM) urged Muslims in Albuqu­erque on Monday to avoid walking alone at night and to make sure they are not followed to their homes. 
A local newspaper, Albuquerque Journal, reported that “people are beginning to panic” after the fourth murder. All four victims are of Pakistani and Afghan descent. 
“We urge everyone to take precautions and be aware of your surroundings including making sure that you are not being followed home and avoid walking alone at night,” the ICNM community message said. “This is especially true for our members living in the southeast part of the city where these killings have taken place.” 
The Albuquerque Police Depart­ment (APD) said their homicide detectives were investigating an overnight murder of a Muslim man that might be linked to three similar murders in the area. The FBI is assisting them in the investigation. 
On Friday, just before midnight, APD officers in the southeast area responded to reports of a shooting in the area of Truman Street and Grand Avenue NE. An adult male was located and found to be dead. 
According to investigators, the victim, Naeem Hussain, believed to be in his mid-20s, is Muslim and a native from South Asia. They believe Friday’s murder may be connected to the recent murder of three Muslim men, also from South Asia. 
Detectives on Thursday determined there’s a connection between the Aug 1 murder of Muhammad Afzal Hussain, 27, and the July 26 murder of Aftab Hussein, 41. “Both men are Muslim and are from Pakistan,” police said. They were killed in southeast Albuquerque near Central Avenue.  
As a result of these murders, detectives are now trying to determine whether the Nov 7, 2021, murder of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim from Afghanistan, is also related to more recent homicides. Ahmadi was killed outside of a business he and his brother ran at 1401 San Mateo Blvd NW. 
Anyone with tips about these murders is urged to call Albuquerque Metro Crime Stoppers at 505-843-STOP (7867). 
The ICNM online message page said they have held several meetings with city and state officials and law enforcement agencies. “Every­one is working diligently to ensure that Muslims in our city remain safe and that the criminals are brought to justice,” the message added. 
ICNM officials said they have shared with the police “whatever tips and information we had.” 
The 2022 report by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) pointed out that in recent years, anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States has spiked. 
“Existing and proposed mosque sites across the country have been targeted for vandalism and other criminal acts, and there have been efforts to block or deny necessary zoning permits for the construction and expansion of other facilities,” the report said. 
Tahir Gauba, ICNM’s director of public affairs, said the local Muslim community — especially students who live near the area where two most recent shootings happened — “is feeling very afraid”. 
At a Saturday afternoon news conference at APD headquarters, city and police officials denounced the violence and assured the community that they were working together and devoting every possible resource to the investigation, Albuquerque Journal reported. 
“We urge our entire interfaith community of Albuquerque and all the people of Albuquerque to help law enforcement identify and catch the person or persons responsible,” said Michelle Melendez, the office’s director. “Please, please, call with any bit of information.” 
Deputy Chief Josh Brown, with APD’s Field Services Bureau, said the department was consulting its partners in the Muslim community to determine what they need and where they’re most vulnerable when deciding where to put its resources.
Their remarks were translated into Arabic, Farsi, Dari and Urdu.

8,"Russia, Ukraine trade blame for strike on nuclear plant","MOSCOW/KYIV: Moscow and Kyiv on Sunday blamed each other for a new strike on the Zaporizhzhia atomic power plant,...","MOSCOW/KYIV: Moscow and Kyiv on Sunday blamed each other for a new strike on the Zaporizhzhia atomic power plant, where recent fighting sparked a UN warning of a potential nuclear disaster.
Zaporizhzhia — Europe’s largest atomic power complex that was occupied by Russia early in its offensive — has in recent days been the scene of military strikes that have damaged several structures, forcing the shutdown of a reactor.
With Russia and Ukraine blaming each other for the attacks, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the Inter­national Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) warned on Saturday of  “the very real risk of a nuclear disaster”.
On Sunday, Russian occupation authorities in Energodar city where the plant is located said that overnight  “the Ukrainian army carried out an attack with a cluster bomb fired from an Uragan rocket launcher.” The projectiles fell  “within 400 metres of a working reactor,” Russia’s TASS state news agency quoted them as saying.
The strike damaged some administrative buildings and fell in a  “zone storing used nuclear fuel”.
However Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom that operates the plant said the  “Russian military keeps committing acts of nuclear terrorism” at the site.
“Yesterday ... the Russian occupiers once again fired rockets at the site of the Zapori­zhzhya nuclear power plant and the town of Ener­hodar,” a company statement said.
“One... employee was hospitalised with shrapnel wounds caused by the explosion,” it added. The company accused the Russians of aiming at spent fuel casks, which are stored in the open near the site of shelling.
“Three radiation monitoring detectors around the ... site were damaged,” the statement said adding that as a result radiation detection was impossible.Energ­o­atom had on Saturday said strikes on Friday had  “caused a serious risk for the safe operation of the plant”, damaging a power cable andforcing the shutdown of one of the reactors.
The operator on Sunday called for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the site and for it to be declared a demilitarised zone.
More grain sets sail
Four  more ships loaded with grain set off from Ukrainian ports on Sunday as  Moscow and Kyiv blamed each other for a new strike at a  Russian-occupied nuclear plant. Kyiv’s infrastructure ministry wrote on  Telegram that a second convoy of Ukra­inian supplies had just left,  three from Chornomorsk and one from Odessa.
It said the Mustafa  Necati, the Star Helena, the Glory and the Riva Wind were carrying   “around 170,000 tonnes of agriculture-related merchandise”.
Amnesty regrets report
Amnesty International apologised on Sunday for  “distress and anger”  caused by a report accusing Ukr­aine of endangering civilians which  infuriated Presi­dent Volodymyr Zelen­skiy and triggered the resignation  of its Kviy office head.
The rights group published the report on  Thurs­day saying the presence of Ukrainian troops in residential areas  heightened risks to civilians during Russia’s invasion.

9,Thousands trapped in China’s tourism hotspot,"Over 80,000 tourists stranded in resort city after a Covid flare-up leads authorities to impose strict travel restrictions.","BEIJING: Over 80,000 tourists are stranded in a resort city popularly known as “China’s Hawaii” after a Covid flare-up led authorities to impose strict travel restrictions. 
Tourism hotspot Sanya is a city of more than a million people on the southern island of Hainan, where 483 Covid cases were reported on Sunday. All flights out of the city were cancelled over the weekend, with authorities also halting train ticket sales. 
Tourists who want to leave must test negative in five PCR tests over seven days, health authorities said. Hotels in the city have been asked to offer guests a 50 per cent discount until the travel restrictions ease, an official said during a news briefing on Saturday. 
China is the only major economy still holding fast to a zero-Covid strategy with snap lockdowns and long quarantines, battering local tourism. 
The country’s borders have also remained largely closed since early 2020, halting international tourism. 
The latest Covid outbreak comes during peak tourism season in Sanya, a popular surfing spot. 
All entertainment venues including spas, karaoke bars and pubs have been closed since last week, but essential services such as supermarkets and pharmacies remain open.

10,Flight tracking exposure irks ‘billionaires and baddies’,Websites and Twitter accounts offer real-time views of air traffic — and sometimes major news like Pelosi’s Taiwan trip.,"WASHINGTON: How to upset Russian freight companies, Elon Musk, Chinese authorities and Kylie Jenner in one go? Track their jets. 
Flight following websites and Twitter accounts offer real-time views of air traffic — and sometimes major news like Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan trip — but that expo­­sure draws pushback ranging from complaints to gear seizures. 
Whether Russian air freight firms, Saudi Arabian plane owners or others, Dan Str­eufert said his group gets dozens of “requ­ests” each year to stop posting aircrafts’ whereabouts. 
“We have not removed anything so far. This is all public information. And I don’t want to be the arbiter of who’s right and who’s wrong,” added Streufert, founder of the US-based flight tracking site ADS-B Exchange.

Limits do apply in some cases, but groups that piece together the flight paths note that the core information source is legally available and open to anyone with the right gear. 
US rules require planes in designated areas be equipped with ADS-B technology that broadcasts aircraft positions using signals that relatively simple equipment can pick up. 
A service like Sweden-based Flightradar24 has 34,000, mostly volunteer-operated receivers around the world to pick up the signals, a key source of information that’s routed back to a central network and combined with data on flight schedules and aircraft information. 
Figuring out or confirming to whom a plane actually belongs can require some sleuthing, said jet tracker Jack Sweeney, who filed a public records request with the US government that yielded a form bearing the signature of a particular plane’s owner: Tesla boss Elon Musk. 
Sweeney has gotten quite a bit of attention with his Twitter account that tracks the movements of the billionaire’s plane and even rejected Musk’s offer of $5,000 to shut down @ElonJet, which has over 480,000 followers. 
“There’s so much traction, I’m doing something right. The celebrity thing — people like seeing what celebrities are doing, that and the whole emissions thing,” he told AFP, referring to concerns over the planes’ greenhouse gas impact. 
“Putting it on Twitter makes it easier for people to access and understand,” Sweeney added. 
‘We will track anything’ 
Another of Sweeney’s Twitter accounts, powered by data from ADS-B Exchange, showed in July that US model and celebrity Kylie Jenner’s plane took a flight in California that lasted just 17 minutes. 

 





 
The internet was not pleased and she faced a torrent of criticism on social media over concerns about the message it sent regarding climate change. 
“They tell us working class people to feel bad about our once a year flight to a much needed vacation while these celebs take private jets every other day as if it’s an Uber,” tweeted @juliphoria, in an example of the outrage. 
Neither Sweeney nor Streufert evoked a distinct redline they were concerned could be crossed by publishing the flight data. 
“We will track anything because honestly, if somebody really was a bad actor, and they wanted to know where this stuff is, you can build the electronics for $100 and just deploy receivers to pick up the same signals yourself,” said Streufert from ADS-B Exchange. 
The services’ information  has significant potential for impact far beyond embarrassment of celebrities or the rankling of billionaires.
For example, ADS-B Exch­a­nge’s data was cited in a non-profit group’s report alleging Eur­ope’s border agency Frontex wor­ked to prevent migrants from crossing the Mediterranean, while US media used it to show sur­veillance planes flew over racial justice protests in Washington in 2020.
