The railway track was damaged at three points after heavy rains last night that lashed Chagai and Naushki districts and caused flash floods that also washed away around 100 houses and swept away the bridge linking Naushki with Quetta-Taftan national highway. 
A senior official told Dawn that the track was damaged at Naushki-Ahmedwall, Dalbandin-yak-Mach and Nokkundi-Taftan sessions. 
Officials further said that four goods train enroute Zahedan loaded with rice have been stopped at Dalbandin station while train coming to Quetta carrying sulphur has been stopped at Yakmach station.  
A Pakistan Railways (PR) officer Sikandar Hussain Lashari said that 30 breaches occurred on the track in Dalbandin section and it would take at least three days to complete the repair works.

However, he added that flash floods were continuously coming from mountainous areas, causing difficulties in rehabilitation work. Another PR official Barkat Bugti in Nokkundi said that almost 20 breaches in the Nokkundi-Taftan were repaired while the remaining would completed as soon as possible.  
The friendship gate at the Pak-Afghan border in Chaman was also closed after heavy rains and floods at the Quetta-Kandahar highway that suspended trade activities. 
Long queues of trucks carrying goods were formed on both sides of the borders waiting for the resumption of trade activities. 
Meanwhile, the road link of Balochistan with Sindh was completely cut off after a bridge and a road connecting the two provinces were damaged in Lasbela and Khuzdar, respectively.   
The traffic on Quetta-Karachi highway was still suspended due to collapsing of major bridges and sweeping away of big portions of the highway.  
124 dead, 10,000 houses damaged in Balochsitan 
Outlining the scale of disaster caused by recent rains and floods, Balochistan Chief Secretary Abdul Aziz Uqaili on Friday said that around 124 people, including women and children, have lost their lives and 10,000 houses were damaged out of which 6,700 were completely destroyed. 
Addressing a press conference, Mr Uqaili said at least six main bridges were damaged besides thousands of people being rendered homeless. 
Floods damaged approximately 565 km of roads and 197,930-acre of agricultural land while 712 livestock also died, he added. 
While briefing the reporters on the government’s response, the chief secretary said that 17,500 people affected by heavy rains and flash floods were rescued while the federal and the provincial governments have announced Rs1 million compensation for the deceased. 
The government would also compensate property and livestock losses, he added. 
He said that Section 144 has been enforced in the province and the citizens have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel for 10 days.  
He said many people were still awaiting help from the flood-hit areas. 
Meanwhile, Pakistan Navy was also providing assistance and disaster relief support to people stranded in Urki, Uthal, Lakhra and other small isolated areas of Lasbela district.  
Commander Coast Rear Admiral Javed Iqbal along with officials of the district administration undertook an aerial visit of the flood-hit areas to review relief activities on Friday.  
Pakistan Navy helicopters evacuated a critically ill woman, along with six other people stranded in Uthal while also air dropping ration packs for people awaiting rescue.

1,Rashid sees fresh election in October,Claims matter settled with two mainstream parties...,"ISLAMABAD: Chief of Awami Muslim League (AML) Sheikh Rashid on Friday said that general elections would be held in October this year and the matter had been settled with two mainstream political parties, but JUI-F chief had not approved the issue.
“There will not be by-elections in the country, but general elections will be held,” Mr Rashid said in a tweet, adding: “Everyone will soon hear the date of general elections in October, formation of a new election commission and a caretaker government.”
Announcing details of the election, the AML leader said the matter had been settled and, in an indirect referring to PPP co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari, who has contracted Covid-19, he said “even those in quarantine have agreed to elections”.
He said that only JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman had been left in this arrangement.

Claims matter settled with two mainstream parties

Mr Rashid also touched economic issues in his tweet and said the rising value of dollar and increase in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity prices would badly hit the country’s economy, adding that these conditions would lead to shutdown of industries.
In a statement, PTI Central Secretary General Asad Umar said worsening condition of the economy was very disturbing and the situation was moving from bad to worse every day.
He gave details of declining foreign exchange reserves and borrowing of fresh loans from China which he said had resulted in sharp drop in the value of rupee and global rating agencies had all downgraded Pakistan.
“The value of rupee is declining so fast that there is no example of any such scenario in the country’s history,” Mr Umar said.
He said since the day the no-confidence motion was moved against Imran Khan, the Pakistani currency had fallen by Rs62 against the dollar. 
“This situation has stirred a storm of inflation in the country,” the PTI leader said, adding that due to depreciation of the rupee over the last two weeks, there would be further increase in prices of electricity and fuel.
“The situation has become so serious that banks are reluctant to open letter of credit (LC) for import of raw materials which is required to make essential medicines,” Mr Umar said.
He said it was dangerous for the integrity of the country to drag this artificial and imported system any more. 
“Pakistan has already suffered a lot and the time has come to end this imported and artificial system imposed on the country without wasting time,” Mr Umar said.
Meanwhile, Dr Shahbaz Gill said in a tweet that articles had been published in foreign press accusing Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif of accepting bribe.
Dr Gill said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should be informed that it had been published in the foreign press that Abraj Group gave $20 million bribe to him and his brother.

2,"PTI funding, economic crisis dominate discussion in Senate",Opposition leader Shahzad Wasim accuses govt of violating Article 73 by failing to lay real budget document before the house.,"ISLAMABAD: As the ruling coalition and the opposition traded charges in the Senate holding each other responsible for the economic meltdown, the controversy over prohibited funding echoed in the house.  
The issue was raised in the house by Mini­s­ter for Climate Change Sherry Rehman.
Chiding Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Dr Shahzad Wasim for holding the present government responsible for the economic mess, the PPP senator pointed out that the PTI, which had promised to break the begging bowl, almost doubled the external debts in just less than four years in power.  
Earlier, Shahzad Wasim accused the government of violating Article 73 of the Constitution by failing to lay the real budget document before the house.   
JI Senator Mushtaq Ahmed, speaking on the situation of floods, regretted the indifferent behaviour of the federal and provincial governments as well the institutions concerned to cope with the devastating heavy rains in different parts of the country. “Where is the state, where is the government?”  
He said floods had destroyed peoples’ homes, agriculture, livestock and businesses, but the state was invisible at the time of this difficulty. “Where is prime minister? Has the premier visited the flood-affected areas, including Karachi?”  
He said the performance of the NDMA and provincial disaster management authorities were abysmal in this time of emergency. “These institutions have become white elephants.” He demanded that the federal and provincial governments compensate the flood-affected people.
BAP Senator Mazoor Ahmed Kakar said the floods had ruined Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh, but politicians were busy blaming each other. He alleged that the ruling coalition was only busy protecting its government and was least concerned about the bad situation of people due to rains.  
PTI Senator Ijaz Ahmad Chaudhry endorsed the viewpoint of his colleagues and said the country had plunged into floods while rulers were enjoying the power. He said Karachi had sunk into water and the PPP, which had been ruling the province for 14 years, was least concerned about this situation. He accused the PPP of misappropriating public funds instead of using them to stop floods.

3,"All funds from Arif Naqvi were kosher and disclosed, says Imran","Likens ex-Abraaj head’s fall to BCCI closure; says COAS call to US official means ""country is getting weaker"".","• Likens ex-Abraaj head’s fall to BCCI closure; says COAS call to US official means ‘country is getting weaker’
• ‘Orders’ Punjab govt to expedite Ravi riverfront, Lahore business district projects
KARACHI/LAHORE: Admitting that his party had indeed received funds from businessman Arif Naqvi, former prime minister and PTI Chairman Imran Khan claimed on Thursday that all the funds came through banking channels and were disclosed in the party’s audited accounts. 
His remarks came a day after the Financial Times published a story claiming that Mr Naqvi’s company “bankrolled the PTI” despite Pakistani laws forbidding foreign nationals and companies from funding political parties. 
Talking to ARY News, Mr Khan called Arif Naqvi “a bright star” and a “rapidly rising Pakistani star in the global financial world,” whose rise among powerful quarters “would have greatly benefitted Pakistan”. 
“I had known him [Mr Naqvi] for a long time [and] he gave a lot of money to Shaukat Khanum [hospital]. He used to live in Dubai and supported our fund-raising events,” said Mr Khan. 
Mr Naqvi organised two fund raising dinners in 2012 for the PTI. The first one was in London where he organised a cricket match at his own ground and the second event was in Dubai where he invited top businessmen, added Mr Khan. 
“This is called political fund raising. All over the world money is raised like this and PTI was the first party [in Pakistan] to raise money through political fundraising,” Mr Khan said, while adding that the party has data of 40,000 donors who gave the money. Calling the charges against Mr Naqvi “tragic,” the PTI chairman likened his fall to that of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). 
He added that as per his knowledge, in Mr Naqvi’s, case no one has suffered any loss and everyone got their money back. 
Mr Khan also demanded the ECP probe the funding of PPP and PML-N  along with the PTI, as he claimed that the two parties “raise money  through funding from big businessmen” 
“After coming into the government, they favour those businessmen. This is called crony capitalism.” 
“I  had learned that in one instance, Nawaz Sharif used his party for money  laundering and the PPP embezzled [Pakistan] embassy’s fund in the US  and moved it to their party’s account,” the former prime minister  claimed. 
He added that if the government thinks it can disqualify  him in the foreign funding case, the PPP and the PML-N leaders would  also go to jail. 
Commenting on the report that Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Bajwa contacted US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman for expediting the IMF loan program, Mr Khan said that this shows that neither the foreign governments nor the IMF trust the government and “that is why the army chief took the responsibility”. 
“If the army Chief was contacting the US and seeking help, it means that the country was getting weaker.” 
However, he added that the US’ help would not come without any reciprocal demands and added that he feared “those demands would compromise Pakistan’s national security”. 
Linking the current economic crisis with political instability, Mr Khan said that when his government was toppled as a result of a conspiracy it led to political instability that tanked the economy. 
“You have seen that everything has been downhill since then. [All economic indicators, be it the] industry, tax collection, exports or remittances, have gone down,” he said while adding that the only way to bring back political stability was free and fair elections. 
Mega projects
Earlier, addressing a meeting via video link, Mr Khan directed the provincial government to focus on the swift completion of two mega projects — the Ravi  Riverfront Urban Development and the Lahore Central Business District  Development projects, as well as other projects launched during his tenure as the  country’s prime minister.
Presided by  Punjab Chief Minister Parvez Elahi, the meeting was attended by former federal  ministers Fawad Chaudhry, Moonis Elahi, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Farrukh  Habib, Dr. Shahbaz Gill and Asad Umar. The head of the Ravi Urban  Development Authority (RUDA), Lahore Central Business District  Development Authority (LCBDDA) and other senior officials  attended the meeting.
The former PM said the Pervaiz Elahi-led PTI  government would leave no stone unturned to ensure timely completion of  all mega projects, including those launched by RUDA and LCBDDA because  these projects of public interest cannot be left in the middle.
“I have already given directions to the Punjab government in this regard,” he added.
Addressing  the meeting, the Punjab chief minister said in a bid to ensure  transparency in public welfare projects and schemes, the government would evolve a comprehensive and foolproof monitoring system.  “I would personally monitor the progress on these projects regularly,” he  said.

5,Sibtain becomes speaker amid allegations of ballot violation,Deputy speaker Mazari ousted through no-trust motion...,"LAHORE: The ruling coalition in Punjab comfortably won the contest for the Punjab Assembly speaker’s office here on Friday, though the polling process was marred by allegations of violation of the secret ballot method.
PTI leader Sibtain Khan secured 185 votes to defeat the opposition PML-N’s Saiful Malook Khokhar, who bagged 175 ballots, while four votes were rejected – one for the ruling coalition and three polled for the opposition. The total strength of the provincial house is 371 out of which 364 lawmakers cast their votes.
Independent MPA Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan as well as three other members did not turn up, while one MPA was recently disqualified by the election commission for holding a fake graduation degree. Two PML-N MPAs had resigned earlier this month.
The polling process was going on smoothly, and about 200 ballots had been cast when it was pointed out that the ballot papers being issued to the ruling PTI and PML-Q members carried serial numbers. Those being issued to the opposition PML-N, PPP and independents were without such marks.

Deputy speaker Mazari ousted through no-trust motion

The opposition protested and PML-N MPA Rukhsana Kausar tried to snatch the copy of the ballot papers from the presiding officer issuing them.
Polling was suspended for five minutes and the chair, Waseem Badozai, summoned the assembly’s security staff for help when opposition legislators tried to besiege him in protest against the alleged secret ballot violation and demanded the election be held afresh.
Opposition leader Hamza Shehbaz announced challenging the election in court on Saturday (today) after the chair turned down the demand for re-polling.
Later, Mr Badozai administered the oath to Sibtain Khan, while the proceedings were suspended for half an hour to take up the next agenda item – no-trust motion against Deputy Speaker Dost Muhammad Mazari.
Mazari voted out
In a late night development, the ruling coalition managed to oust Mr Mazari as the deputy speaker after 186 MPAs voted against him on a no-confidence motion.
It was a challenging situation for the PTI-PML-Q alliance, as a vote of no-confidence required an absolute majority – more than half of the total strength of the house despite vacant seats. In the case of the 371-member assembly, the required number was 186, which is just what the coalition had. The rejection of even a single vote for any reason could have cost the treasury dearly in the no-trust motion.

6,‘Mismanaged’ test for health dept jobs sparks protest in Gilgit,"Candidates tear up question papers, boycott test, stage protest outside CM House.","GILGIT: Hundreds of candidates boycotted a test for 32 posts in the Gilgit-Baltistan health department and protested outside Chief Minister House on Friday against “mismanagement” during the exam.
Protesters tore up the questions papers and chanted slogans against the GB government and health officials. Around 12,000 candidates applied for the recently advertised positions. 
Soon after the test began, at a girls’ college in Gilgit’s Chinar Bagh area, hundreds of candidates started gathering outside the examination hall as a protest against mismanagement during the process, alleging that the question paper had already been leaked and there was no check on candidates carrying smartphones during the exam. 

Candidates tear up question papers, boycott test, stage protest outside CM House

“It seems the test was just a formality. There were no arrangements,” Raza Khan, a candidate who appeared in the exam, said. “There was even no option of writing the candidate’s name on the answer sheet.”
The protest prompted GB Chief Minister Khalid Khurshid Khan to take notice of the incident and he ordered that the test be postponed.
Candidates alleged that the management had no interest in conducting a fair test because the positions had already been finalised.
Another protester, Shabbir Hussain, regretted that the GB government had cancelled a contract with a private testing service agency and was now conducting departmental tests, “which cannot be impartial” as it helped government officials to “adjust” their favourite candidates on the posts.
The protesters asked the authorities concerned to address the issue and resolved that they would continue to boycott such exams until they were conducted by independent testing agencies.
