In his concluding arguments, a prosecutor of the agency stated that the trial court granted bail to Ogra’s officials, ignoring facts of the case. He said the officials were involved in the scam and the case was registered in the light of a report of an inquiry commission.  
He asked the court to set aside the bail granting order of the trial court as custody of the suspects was required to complete the investigation.  
After hearing the arguments, Justice Amjad Rafiq reserved the verdict on the petition.  
The FIA alleged that the suspects were involved in billion of rupees fraud committed through price fluctuation and hoarding of petroleum products, which also created an artificial shortage. The agency also accused the owners of oil marketing companies of laundering the money accumulated through the fraud in the prices.  
The FIA had initiated the inquiry on the direction of the LHC.  
The court had directed the government to release the commission report on artificial shortage of petroleum products immediately.
The government in 2020 constituted the commission which conducted the probe while taking all stakeholders on board.

The punishment was awarded to the M/s Biotech Pakistan on the recommendations of a six-member committee of senior doctors, admin officials and the technical experts of the medical teaching institute.
Headed by neurosurgery department head Prof Manoor Ahmad, the committee comprised the director purchase, biomedical engineers, the deputy superintendent and other officers/officials.
The firm had failed to pay the demurrages/penalties imposed by the customs authorities for not getting the imported medical equipment cleared. Consequently, the authorities auctioned the imported medical equipment, declaring the firm defaulter, hindering the operation threatres project.
In its strongly-worded recommendations, the committee declared that the firm had shown non-professional attitude and failed to complete the project despite repeated reminders sent to it during the last five years. It also recommended “strict administrative/legal actions” against the firm as per rules and regulations for its failure to follow the contract agreement to provide critical facilities for the neuro patients.
A copy of the relevant documents available with Dawn, show the company’s scale of negligence towards over Rs398 million project, caused five-year delay in its completion.

8,High prices of DAP may affect wheat crop,LAHORE: Expressing their concerns at higher prices of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) but the lower inventory of the...,"LAHORE: Expressing their concerns at higher prices of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) but the lower inventory of the compost as compared with last year in the country, farmers have warned that the issue may lead to a drastic drop in wheat production and thus increase the need for more import of the commodity. 
“Currently, one 50-kg bag of DAP is being sold at Rs14,000 against Rs6,000 in the last year, while 352,00 tonnes of the fertiliser are currently in stocks against 428,000 tonnes during the same month the previous year,” says Kisan Ittehad Pakistan president Khalid Mahmood Khokhar. 
He says that since January this year only 0.222 million tonnes of DAP has been imported against 0.725mt imports during the same period last year. He warns that this huge gap may lead to a shortage of compost at the onset of the Rabi season in September further pushing up its prices in the local market and reduced application by the farming community. 
Data shared by Mr Khokhar reveals that DAP offtake in the country in the first seven months of 2022 remained 0.6mt against 0.768mt in 2021 and 0.851mt in 2020 during the same period of time. This means the ratio of DAP applications is coming down with the increase in its price. 
The lowering application of the fertiliser, the farmer leader cautions, will cause a fall in the production of wheat, the main staple food in the country, and overburden the national kitty because of higher grain imports. 
Keeping in view the falling DAP application trend, he estimates that the wheat production may plummet by 20 percent or over 5.4mt. 
The country is already importing 300,00mt of grain to meet the shortage of the last harvest. 
Mr Khokhar suggested the government cut the DAP price by 50pc through direct subsidy to the farming community to encourage its application and thus ward off the risk of importing more wheat worth $3.0 billion.

Weather pundits have predicted rain for more days in the cotton belt region. Cotton production has already been on the decline.  
Almost all the tehsils in the district and parts of Cholistan have been hit by downpours for the last two weeks or so. 
The cotton crop and mangoes face threat of damage. The rainwater has accumulated in the cotton fields and is likely to affect the production.  
Deputy Director Agriculture Muhammad Shafiq told Dawn that more rains could affect the cotton yield. At present, he said, the standing cotton crop did not need any more water. He said the agriculture department had estimated yield of 20 to 22 maunds of cotton per acre but if the current weather conditions persisted, it could be reduced.  
However, in his advisory to the cultivators, he said they should try to drain the water out of the cotton fields at an earliest besides removing weeds and bushes.  
He also asked the owners of mango orchards that they should begin shredding of their trees.  
The deputy director said the district had missed the target of the cotton sowing of a total area of 600,000 acre but was still expecting good cotton yield if more rains may not hit the areas here.

The public has been asked to refrain from buying plots in the housing scheme as the administration also removed the billboards and other publicity material of the scheme across the district on Friday.  
The administration launched legal action against the marketing for the scheme also. The housing scheme is owned by Amer Malik, the son-in-law of property tycoon Malik Riaz. 
Deputy Commissioner Rizwan Qadeer, also the administrator of the district council, issued a public notice, warning the people and real estate dealers of making investment at their own risk as the society had never been approved nor did the management of the company apply for the approval.  

Warns public against sale, purchase of land in City Housing 

The notice also stopped the real estate developer and management of the housing scheme from sale and purchase and launch of any development work or marketing. The district council and the municipal corporation are the competent authority for approval of such housing schemes.  
The notice shows that the company, City Housing (PvT) Ltd, has not yet even formally submitted an application for approval but launched the marketing of plots files, collecting billions of rupees through dealerships and other deals.  
Moreover, there has been no progress on ground in terms of infrastructural development as well as getting the required no objection certificates from the departments concerned.  
The Pakistan Railways train track also passes through the land purchased by the company.   
Talking to Dawn, the DC said the notice had been issued in the larger interest of the general public and the people would be responsible by itself in case of any fraud or scam.  
However, he said, in the next phase, the local office of the company could also be sealed as it was not legally authorised to be involved in such activities. 
In a major operation, the administration started removal of all the publicity material of the company across the district.  
An official of the land revenue department says the Punjab Local Government Department has already imposed a ban on approval of such housing schemes until zoning of the districts about the classification and declassification of the land since agricultural land could no longer be used for developing housing schemes.  
He said the zoning of Gujrat district had been pending for the last more than a year and added that the Citi Housing had purchased a huge chunk of land in the area near Rakh Pabbi Sarkar Forest where few other housing schemes had already been approved during the last few years.  
Earlier, the district administration had declared 15 housing schemes of Gujrat as illegal and issued warnings for the masses, telling them that sale/purchase of plots on the file-based system was totally illegal.

The department undertook the construction of 12 canal miles, of 19 miles, years ago to improve the condition of the minor and water flow. One canal mile covers 5,000 feet. The incomplete work has forced the farmers to irrigate their farms through diesel-or electricity-run tubewells. 
Farmers Rai Ashraf Musrera, Rai Imran Jazib, Rai Sakhawat and Muhammad Riaz spoke about the situation the farmers of 19 villages along the Jandarka Minor are facing. They said the canal miles situated some 20 km from the city and three kilometres in the south of the River Ravi were extremely in a dilapidated condition. 
It is important to mention that when the reconstruction project was approved, the contractor pointed out an “error” in the plan, which mentioned “filling and cutting and placing of cemented slabs”.  
The contractor refused to start work till the correction of the error as the mentioned terms would cost him higher than the approved expenditures. The department took three years to redesign the project. A group of small farmers of the area told this correspondent they had to spend a considerable amount of irrigation because of the dilapidated condition of the canal. 
Canal Irrigation Department Sub-Divisional officer Chaudhry Muhammad Saeed Dhudhi told Dawn that the official procedures consumed extra time to get the project plan error fixed. He said the department had completed 60 per cent of the work, and the reconstructed area of the minor was being given the water supply.  
He said he was hopeful the remaining length of the minor would be completed soon. Locals demanded that the government look into the matter keeping in view to avoid in future such situations in other areas.
