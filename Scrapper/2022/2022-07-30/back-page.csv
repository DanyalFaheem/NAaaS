0,"Diesel to go up, decrease in petrol rate expected",Move part of measures to conform with IMF pre-conditions for release of $1.18bn tranche.,"ISLAMABAD: Owing to an outstanding pre-condition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for increase in petroleum development levy (PDL), the price of high speed diesel (HSD) is estimated to go up by about Rs8 per litre this weekend, while petrol is estimated to be about Rs11 per litre cheaper.
This will strengthen Pakistan’s case for disbursement of $1.18bn when it is to be taken up by the IMF executive board on August 24.
Senior government officials told Dawn that both the major petroleum products — HSD and petrol – were set to go down significantly with effect from August 1, but three major factors — currency depreciation, higher PDL and increase in dealer commission — deprived the consumers of the benefit of international price cut.
These officials said the government had committed a prior action with the IMF to increase PDL by Rs10 per litre on HSD, kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) and Rs5 per litre on petrol to ensure a uniform rate of Rs15 per litre on all products at the start of August. At present, PDL is Rs10 per litre on petrol and Rs5 each on HSD, kerosene and LDO.

Move part of measures to conform with IMF pre-conditions for release of $1.18bn tranche

The ECC has already approved about 43pc increase in dealers’ commission on petrol and 70pc increase on HSD to Rs7 per litre each that will also have an additional impact of Rs2.10 and Rs2.87 per litre on petrol and HSD respectively. The currency depreciation also negatively impacted the relief otherwise due to consumers due to international price reduction over the past fortnight.
Based on international import price and exchange rate impact, the HSD price was estimated to go down by about Rs3.30 per litre and that of petrol by about Rs19 per litre. However, because of Rs10 per litre increase in PDL and Rs2.87 per litre increase in dealer commission, the HSD rate would instead increase by about Rs8 per litre. The petrol price, on the other hand, will still go down by about Rs11 per litre after negative adjustment of Rs5 per litre increase in PDL and Rs2.10 per litre.
As such the HSD’s ex-depot sale price is estimated to be close to Rs244 for the first fortnight of August instead of Rs236 per litre at present while petrol rate would be around Rs219 per litre instead of slightly over Rs230 at present.
The official said the government could have kept the prices of POL products unchanged for next 15 days through transfer of increase in HSD rate to petrol, but perhaps this was not an option because of the IMF limitations.
On July 14, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced a reduction of Rs18 to Rs40 per litre in the prices of various products as international prices went down. This was the first time the PMLN-led coalition government reduced petroleum prices after it came to power in the second week of April.
Between May 26 and July 1, the petrol price had increased by 66pc, or Rs99 per litre, while HSD price went up by 92pc since May 26 from Rs144.15 per litre, up by 132.39 per litre. Likewise, the ex-depot price of kerosene had gone up to Rs230.26 per litre, up by 95pc between May 26 and July 1. Similarly, the ex-depot price of LDO went up to Rs226.15 on July 1, up 80pc from Rs125.56 per litre on May 26, up by about Rs100.59 per litre.
Under the deal with the IMF, the government has to gradually increase PDL on oil products to a maximum of Rs50 per litre to collect Rs855bn during the current fiscal year.
The petroleum levy had come to an end on March 1 price revision as international prices went up and the PTI government decided to not only reduce petroleum prices by Rs10 per litre but also to freeze it for next four months i.e. until end of June. After initial indecision, the PML-N-led coalition government had been increasing petroleum prices since May 15 under the IMF deal.
At present, the GST is zero on all key products, including petrol, HSD, kerosene and LDO against 17pc normal GST. The government is also charging about Rs20 per litre custom duty on petrol and HSD. The previous government had given a commitment in December 2021 to the IMF for Rs4 per litre increase in PL on the first of every month to a maximum of Rs30 per litre, but went back on it on February 28.

1,World Bank refuses new funding for bankrupt Sri Lanka,"No plan to offer new financing until adequate macroeconomic policy framework is in place, it says.","COLOMBO: The World Bank on Friday said it would not offer new funding to Sri Lanka unless the bankrupt island nation carried out “deep structural reforms” to stabilise its crashing economy.
Sri Lanka has suffered an unprecedented downturn with its 22 million people enduring months of food and fuel shortages, rolling blackouts and rampant inflation.
The South Asian nation defaulted on its $51-billion foreign debt in April and huge protests earlier this month forced then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign.
The World Bank said it was concerned about the impact of the crisis on Sri Lanka’s people but was not ready to give funds until the government had bedded down necessary reforms.
“Until an adequate macroeconomic policy framework is in place, the World Bank does not plan to offer new financing to Sri Lanka,” the lender said in a statement.
“This requires deep structural reforms that focus on economic stabilisation, and also on addressing the root structural causes that created this crisis.” The World Bank said it had already diverted $160 million from existing loans to finance urgently needed medicines, cooking gas and school meals.
Sri Lanka is currently in bailout talks with the International Monetary Fund but officials say the process could take months.
The island nation has run out of foreign exchange to finance even the most essential imports, and chronic shortages have inflamed public anger.

2,PM Shehbaz vows measures to cut reliance on imported fuel,"Value of dollar would drop to Rs190 after approval of IMF package, NA assured.","ISLAMABAD: Vowing to stabilise crippling economy, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Friday the government would soon launch 6,000MW to 7,000MW solar energy projects to cut dependence on imported fuel.
The prime minister also said that promotion of foreign investment was one of the top priorities of the government. “Short-term and long-term plans would be implemented to cut dependence on imported fuel,” the PM said while talking to a delegation of the Pakistan America Business Forum.
He said a project to generate 7,000 megawatts through renewable sources was in the offing.
Mr Sharif said the government was committed to ensuring favourable conditions for foreign investors with the aim to strengthen the national economy.

PM Sharif said the coalition came to power during tough times with an objective to uphold the sanctity of state over politics. He mentioned that the government took difficult decisions to revive the economy and save the country from default. He held the previous government responsible for damaging the economy. 
However, he added, efforts were afoot to ensure development of the country through hard work.
As part of austerity measures, he mentioned imposition of ban on import of luxury goods as well as reduction of unnecessary government expenditure.
The delegates appreciated the measures taken by Prime Minister Sharif for restoration of economy, besides extending facilities to export industry and addressing the problems of overseas Pakistanis. 
They apprised the premier about their problems and also gave feedback on various related matters.
The prime minister instructed the authorities concerned to resolve their problems on priority basis and assured them of every possible facilitation by the government.
‘Dollar to drop to Rs190’
Meanwhile, parliamentary secretary for finance and revenue Rana Mohammad Ishaq on Friday claimed that the value of the dollar would come down to Rs190 after the approval of IMF package.
The claim was made by the parliamentary secretary while responding to a Call Attention Notice (CAN) moved by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) members “regarding increase in the prices of edible items” on the day Pakistani rupee fell to an all-time low in the open market, trading as high as 250 against the dollar, according to data shared by the Forex Association of Pakistan (FAP).
“This CAN is based on facts. There is price-hike in the country and people belonging to every class are perturbed,” said Mr Ishaq after PPP lawmaker Qadir Khan Mandokhail moved the notice.
“We will get IMF (International Monetary Fund) programme next month. After it the [US] dollar will come down to Rs190. We expect that it will come down to Rs190-200,” he said.
The parliamentary secretary, who was responding on behalf of Finance Minister Miftah Ismail, first stated that price-hike was a global phenomenon and then blasted the previous Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government for “ruining” the country’s economy.
Later, when the movers of the notice castigated the government against blaming the past rulers for the price hike, Mr Ishaq said it was the responsibility of the provinces to maintain and control prices, saying that the federal government was coordinating with the provincial authorities. 
Later, parliamentary secretary for law and justice Mehnaz Akbar Aziz presented the Inter-Governmental Commercial Transa­ctions Bill 2022.

3,Instagram to pause ‘TikTok-like features’,Move comes after complaints by users that new features make Instagram too much like TikTok.,"SAN FRANCISCO: Instagram will pause features that users have campaigned against and complained make the social network too much like TikTok, according to a report in the Platformer tech newsletter. 
Celebrity sisters Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner were some of the most vocal users to have posted messages on social media this week calling for the company to “make Instagram Instagram again” and stop trying to be like TikTok. 
The slogan sprang from a Change.org petition that had received more than 229,000 signatures as of late Thursday. “Let’s go back to our roots with Instagram and remember that the intention behind Instagram was to share photos, for Pete’s sake,” the petition read. 
Instagram chief Adam Mosseri had responded to the controversy earlier this week with a video on Twitter in which he said the features were a work in progress, and being tested with a small number of users. 

 





 
Changes included playing up short-form video, displaying it full-screen the way TikTok does, and recommending posts from strangers. “We are going to have to lean into that shift.” Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg backed that position during an earnings call on Wednesday, saying that people are increasingly watching videos online.

4,Kyiv forces accused of killing 40 in rebel-controlled jail,Zelensky oversees grain being loaded for export onto a Turkish ship.,"KYIV: Russia has accused Kyiv forces of striking a jail in Olenivka in the separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine, where Russian defence ministry said 40 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed and 75 wounded.
Russia said the jail in Donetsk had been targeted overnight with US-made HIMARS rocket systems. 
The Russian army on Friday accused Kyiv forces of striking a jail holding Ukrainian prisoners of war in separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine, saying 40 people died and scores were wounded.
The Russian defence ministry said that the jail in Olenivka in the separatist-held region of Donetsk had been targeted overnight with US-made HIMARS rocket systems. “Forty Ukrai­nian prisoners of war were killed and 75 wounded,” the defence ministry said in a statement, adding that eight employees of the detention centre were also injured.

Zelensky oversees grain being loaded for export onto a Turkish ship

The Russian defence ministry said that the Ukrainian prisoners of war included members of the Azov battalion, who defended the Azovstal plant in the port city of Mariupol.
Russian television showed what appeared to be destroyed barracks and tangled metal beds but no casualties could be seen. Moscow claimed that the “bloody provocation of the Kyiv regime” was designed to discourage Ukra­inian troops from laying down their arms and surrendering.
“This egregious provocation was carried out to intimidate Ukrainian servicemen,” the defence ministry said.
Bus stop hit in south 
Russian strikes on the heavily bombed Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv near the southern frontline killed five people and wounded seven more on Friday, the regional governor said. “Today, they shot at another area near a public transport stop,” Vitaliy Kim said in a statement.
He initially announced a death toll of four, but later said five people had been killed in the strike and seven were wounded, with rescue services working on the scene.
Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea, has seen roughly half of its estimated pre-war population of nearly 500,000 people leave and the city has been shelled daily for weeks.
It is the largest Ukrainian-controlled urban hub near the frontlines in the Kherson region, where Kyiv’s army has launched a counter-offensive to regain control of the economically and strategically important coastal territory.
Grain export 
The presidency said the export of  grain will begin with several ships that were already loaded when  Russia invaded in February but unable to set sail due to the start of  the war. The deal to lift Russia’s blockade — the first significant  accord involving the two warring sides since the assault began — is  aimed at helping mitigate a global food crisis that has seen prices soar  in some of the world’s poorest nations. Ukraine — one of the world’s  top grain exporters before the war — says it aims to export  some 20 million tonnes of produce, worth some $10 billion, under the  plan. “It is important for us that Ukraine remains the guarantor of  global food security,” Zelensky, who was escorted by ambassador from the  G7 nations, said in the statement.
President Volodymyr Zelensky has visited a port in southern Ukraine  to oversee grain being loaded for export onto a Turkish ship, the  presidency said on Fri­day, following a deal with Russia brokered by the  UN and Turkey.
“The first vessel, the first ship is being loaded  since the beginning of the war. This is a Turkish vessel,” Zelensky  said, according to a statement from the presidency. Footage from the  Chorno­morsk port released by the presidency showed him in front of a  ship, called Polarnet. Exports could start in “the coming days” under  the plan, the statement added.
Russian soldier’s term reduced 
Meanwhile, a Ukrainian court reduced to 15 years a life sentence handed to a Russian soldier in May for pre-meditated murder in the country’s first war crimes trial.
“According to the result of the appellate review, the appeal filed by the defence was partially satisfied,” a statement on the Kyiv court of appeals’ website said, adding that Russian soldier “Vadim Shishimarin was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment.” 
Shishimarin, who was 21 at the time of the ruling in May, was found guilty of war crimes for killing an unarmed civilian and handed a life sentence, in the first verdict of its kind of Russia’s invasion. The sergeant from Siberia had admitted to killing a 62-year-old civilian, Oleksandr Shelipov, as he was riding his bike in the village of Chupakhivka in northeast Ukraine.
Shishimarin claimed he shot Shelipov under pressure from another soldier as they tried to retreat and escape back into Russia in a stolen car on February 28. His lawyer Viktor Ovsyan­nikov had vowed to appeal the verdict, arguing that “societal pressure” weighed on the decision.
“Our side is fully prepared. We sent all the signals to our partners — the UN and Turkey, and our military guarantees the security situation. The minister of infrastructure is in direct contact with the Turkish side and the UN. We are waiting for a signal from them that we can start,” Zelensky was quoted as saying.
