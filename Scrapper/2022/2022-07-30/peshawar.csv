A bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Fazal Subhan issued the order on a petition by Imamia Jirga’s Muharram Committee to seek orders for the government to hold a meeting with the committee for proper arrangements, schedule and specifications of processions, its venues and timings.
The petitioner also requested the court to restrain the respondents, including the chief and home secretaries and commissioners and deputy commissioners of different divisions and districts from placing any unlawful restrictions on peaceful religious processions during the month of Muharram.
He sought orders to stop respondents from taking any ‘illegal’ action, including registration of FIRs against participants of Muharram processions.
The bench observed that since it was a sensitive matter and the month of Muharram was at hand, the secretary of the home and tribal affairs department should convene a meeting of all stakeholders within four days in which the petitioner should submit written proposal relating to religious activities in the month.
It directed the secretary to issue an appropriate order on the matter after consulting law-enforcement agencies and the petitioner.
The bench fixed the next hearing for Aug 2.
Advocate Shabbir Hussain Gigyani appeared for the petitioner and requested the bench to direct the respondents, including police and district administration, to sit with the petitioner to come up with a proper mechanism about religious processions.
He contended that the petitioner continued to request the government to hold meetings with stakeholders so that a comprehensive plan could be devised.
Additional advocate general Barrister Babar Imran Shahzad produced minutes of a meeting held on July 25 with Peshawar’s capital city police officer in the chair.
The bench observed that it was evident from the minutes of the meeting that the respondents had extended assurance to the petitioner for the resolution of some of their grievances but the community’s representatives insisted that some of their grievances had yet to be settled.
It added that it would be appropriate that the home secretary should convene a meeting of stakeholders.

1,"Italian lensmen all praise for KP’s cultural diversity, hospitality",The group is here to find eye-catching images for an international exhibition,"PESHAWAR: A seven-member group of Italian photographers, which is on a week-long tour of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has termed the province a must see destination for the tourists as cultural diversity and hospitality provided them with a charming sight to experience after mingling with the local people. 
The group came here to find some eye-catching images for their photo exhibition and right there it fell upon a treasure trove in the north of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
Interacting with this scribe on arrival in Peshawar city on Friday, the tourists said they witnessed a satisfying image of the people in KP, altogether different from what was being portrayed in the media that forced them to change over their lens. 
“Images caught by our cameras are so wonderful that they surly would win us first award at the display,” the group hoped. 

The group is here to find eye-catching images for an international exhibition 

They said KP was not on their checklist in their initial trip schedule to Pakistan’s northern areas, it was only Gilgit-Baltistan, but a little digging into history it came up that curiosity should be satisfied and strolling through the old Peshawar city really made them feel better and quite at home. 
“People’s response in terms of hospitality was quite amazing and smile on the faces of old and young men and women was noteworthy and welcoming. There was not even a remote sign of terror. We went around the entire city, including Qissa Khwani, Namak Mandi, Masjid Mahabat Khan, Gor Khatri and several other places,” narrated Nicola Ducati, a member of the visiting group. 
The tourists observed that earlier they had toured the Central Asian States, Afghanistan, India and Gilgit-Baltistan, but the scenic beauty and people’s response in KP impressed them very much. “On our return to home country, we will float the idea to visit the land of multicultural people,” they observed. 
Starting their journey from Gilgit-Baltistan 14 days ago, the group was in fact in search of catching up with some rare images of sights, people and their old traditions still in practice so that they could put them up for an international photo exhibition to be held in Paris next year. 
“It could be no other place, but KP where its north – Chitral, Swat and Peshawar – presented plenty of it what the camera required to fill its belly with the most charming and inspiring images, firsthand experience of mixing with local population around cities and its busy streets remained enough stuff,” explained Riccardo Melzi, a group leader. 
Ms Aurora Arcese, member of the visiting group, said that Pakistan’s north was blessed with extraordinary natural beauty and people with diversifying cultural panorama, colourful dresses and tasty foods that rendered them awestruck. 
Ehsanullah, a GB-based tour guide, said over 50 per cent of foreign tourists rescheduled their trip after arrival in Pakistan, but unfortunately visit to the historic Khyber Pass was not permitted. He said if hurdles were removed the Peshawar city would be flooded with foreign visitors.

4,CM opens work on two high-rise buildings in Peshawar,The buildings and other allied facilities will be completed at a total cost of Rs17.5 billion.,"PESHAWAR: Chief Minister Mahmood Khan on Friday performed the groundbreaking of two high-rise residential and commercial buildings on the Warsak Road here.
These multi-story buildings comprising a total of 1,240 residential flats of different sizes and other allied facilities will be completed at a total cost of Rs17.5 billion, according to a statement issued here.
One high-rise building will be constructed on more than five kanals of land, which will have three commercial and 10 residential floors. The other one will be constructed at Rehman Baba Complex on a 79-kanal of land having facility of 10 residential floors.
Addressing a ceremony held on the occasion, Mahmood Khan felicitated the provincial minister for housing and his entire team for initiating practical work on the construction of high- rise buildings, and said his government, in line with the vision of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman Imran Khan, was working for the wellbeing of common man. He added that construction of apartment towers to provide residential facilities to the low-income people was also a part of that vision and strategy.
Mahmood Khan said the provincial government was going to launch the mega housing project of the province – New Peshawar Valley – which would be the only housing society to be established under the land sharing formula. He said government housing schemes were also being initiated on the available non-agricultural lands in other districts.
The chief minister said the provincial government was not only working on housing projects but also taking visible steps to protect the agricultural land in the province. 
Touching upon the current political situation in the country, the chief minister said when the country was on the path of development and the people were realising the positive change in their lives, “a group of incompetent rulers had been imposed on the country”.
Mahmood Khan said two political parties ruled the country for 40 years, but they did nothing for welfare of people. He claimed that development projects of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been excluded from this year’s Public Service Development Programme.
He said free treatment facility for the people of the merged districts was also stopped by the federal government.

5,Institutions shouldn’t be used for ‘political gains’: Fazl,"PDM chief says ruling coalition to contest by-polls from joint platform, terms PTI a group of anarchists.","PESHAWAR: Calling the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) a group of anarchists, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Friday said the ruling coalition in the centre would contest the upcoming by-elections from a joint platform to defeat former prime minister Imran Khan’s party.
Addressing a news conference at the party’s provincial secretariat here on Friday, Mr Fazl, who also heads the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), said judges, generals and senior bureaucrats should join mainstream politics instead of using their respective national institutions for ‘political gains’.
“If you [judges, generals and bureaucrats] are interested in politics, then do not malign your institutions and instead formally join politics,” he said.
On the occasion, PTI leader and former provincial minister Iftikhar Khan Mohmand along with his supporters announced the joining of the JUI-F.

PDM chief says ruling coalition to contest by-polls from joint platform, terms PTI a group of anarchists 

The JUI-F chief said allied parties of the PDM and other coalition partners would contest the upcoming by elections from a joint platform, which would allow them to wipe out the ‘fascist’ group by ballot paper.
He said the speaker of the National Assembly had begun accepting letters of resignation submitted by the PTI MNAs and that the PDM and its allies would field joint candidates in those by-elections.
Mr Fazl urged party workers to fully support whichever candidates the PDM chose to contest by- elections.
He said all schools of thought, irrespective of their political ideologies, including nationalist, secular, liberal and religious groups, had a consensus about the elimination of the fascist group, PTI.
“Although we have political and ideological differences, we will fight against this menace,” he said.
The JUI-F leader said he had a lot of respect for state institutions but the judges should refrain from meddling in political affairs.
“For God’s sake, do not put your names in the list of CJPs Justice Munir and Justice Saqib Nisar,” he said.
Expressing serious reservations about the verdict of a three-member Supreme Court bench in the Chaudhry Pervaiz Ellahi case, he said a larger or full bench of the apex court should have heard the ‘historic’ case.
In a veiled reference to the chief justice of Pakistan, Mr Fazl said, “I think they did not trust other respectable judges and therefore, a full bench was not constituted and every case is referred to the same bench, which comprises three judges.
He said the Judicial Commission of Pakistan’s meeting was called on the ‘very strange’ pretext that the judges were on leave.
The JUI-F leader said 25 MPAs of the Punjab Assembly were de-seated on the basis of a letter by the PTI chief but the bench chose to ignore a similar letter by PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain.
“How do they [courts] expect us [PDM] to trust them when they gave relief to one party and punished another on a similar legal matter,” he said.
Mr Fazl urged the Election Commission of Pakistan not to further delay the decision in foreign funding case against the PTI.
He said a Financial Times report had disclosed that the Abraj Group had donated $2 million to the PTI in the name of donations for charity work.
The JUI-F leader said the PTI had handed over Punjab to someone whom its chief and former prime minister Imran Khan had once called the province’s biggest thief.
He claimed that the coalition government in the centre would complete its term and general elections would be held on time.

9,NAB response sought to builder’s  plea against fraud probe,PHC also suspends orders for freezing petitioner’s bank accounts,"PESHAWAR: A Peshawar High Court bench has directed the National Accountability Bureau chairman and its Khyber Pakhtunkhwa director-general to respond to a builder’s petition seeking the quashing of an inquiry against him about the alleged fraud in the garb of an illegal housing society.
Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Shahid Khan also issued a stay order suspending the NAB’s directions to a private bank to freeze two accounts of petitioner Jehan Alam, who owns the Paradise Developers and Builders company.
The bench fixed Aug 11 for next hearing while seeking comments of the NAB chairman and its provincial director-general on the petition.
Advocate Ashfaq Ahmad Daudzai appeared for the petitioner and requested the court to declare the NAB inquiry against his client illegal in light of the amendments made to the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999, through the National Accountability (Amendment) Act, 2022.

PHC also suspends orders for freezing petitioner’s bank accounts

He said the NAB had initiated the inquiry on the allegations of cheating public at large under the garb of sale of plots in the City Galaxy Housing Scheme, an illegal housing society on Peshawar’s Ring Road.
The lawyer argued that in the recent amendment public at large had been defined as at least 100 people, whereas the case in hand didn’t come within the definition of public as the number of the alleged affected people were much less.
He said the proceedings so started by the bureau were against the law.
Mr Daudzai pointed out that the petitioner in 2006 had made investment with Ubaidur Rehman, the actual owner of the City Galaxy Housing Scheme.
He said his client had gone to perform Haj in 2007 and in his absence, that man had sold numerous plots in the scheme.
The lawyer contended that last year, a call-up notice was issued to the petitioner regarding initiation of the said inquiry following which he appeared before a combined investigation team.
He added that the petitioner provided entire information to the investigation team, whereas those who made the business transaction or carried out marketing with buyers had gone into hiding at that time.
Mr Daudzai said the start of inquiry in the case was without lawful authority, having no mandate in the matter as in the absence of element of fraud and inducement, the offence of cheating public at large did not constitute at all.
He said the NAB had also imposed ‘caution’ under Section 23 of the National Accountability Ordinance on two bank accounts of the petitioners without reasonable grounds.
The lawyer said under Section 23, once a caution was issued against a property, it couldn’t be altered or transferred.
He said that section of the ordinance had also been omitted through the recent amendments and therefore, the caution imposed against two bank accounts might also be removed.

12,"Fake investment MoUs inked in Dubai expo, alleges opposition MPA",Govt fails to inform house about foreign investment received since event held,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Friday failed to give a ‘satisfactory’ reply to an opposition member’s question in the provincial assembly about the foreign investment received by the province since the signing of several memorandums of understanding at the 2020 Dubai expo.
During the assembly’s question hour, Awami National Party MPA Shugufta Malik asked the government to share details of the investment that came to the province after the Dubai expo.
She said the government had claimed that $8 billion worth of MoUs were signed by it with different investors during the expo.
The lawmaker alleged that senior officers had gone to Dubai with their families for recreation, while fake MoUs were signed during the expo with some expatriates from the province.

Govt fails to inform house about foreign investment received since event held

She said non-local artists, who were unaware of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s culture, were taken to Dubai to perform in the expo.
In Jan this year, the provincial government had claimed the signing of the MoUs with 44 foreign investment companies at the Dubai International Expo, 2020, to bring more than $8 billion investment to different sectors in the province.
“Regrettably, an AK-47 rifle was also displayed at the show, which has nothing to do with our culture,” the woman MPA said.
She said when visitors protested the display of AK-47 rifle, the expo organisers had the gun removed from the province’s pavilion.
Ms Shugufta criticised the government for appointing a non-local person as the chief executive officer of the Board of Investment and Trade and said that officer, despite receiving a huge salary package, had failed to bring any notable investment to the province.
Culture minister Shaukat Yousafzai claimed that a record number of people had visited the 2020 Dubai expo, while the provincial government had signed MoUs with foreign companies as well as Pakistani investors.
He said the government had briefed all stakeholders before sending delegations to the expo. “Artists projected a positive image of the province at the show through their performances,” he said.
The performance of the excise, taxation and anti-narcotics department also came under fire in the assembly with the opposition members accusing the relevant authorities of failing to eradicate drugs from the province.
Opposition member Humaira Khatoon said every third youth in the province was a drug addict due to the ‘terrible’ performance of the department.
She also said the department had begun a massive ‘requirement’ campaign in settled districts of the province but tribal districts were ignored.
Ms Khatoon said the excise department, through a written reply, had confirmed that not a single gram of narcotics had been confiscated in Khyber tribal district since 2019.
Naeema Kishwar of the opposition MMA said the Anti-Narcotics Force and excise department were tasked with cracking down on drugs.
She said both ANF and excise department had set up checkpoints on all highways to check the smuggling of contraband but despite that, drug trafficking was ‘extremely common’.
The MPA said there was no need for the ANF in the presence of the provincial anti-narcotics force.
Minister Shaukat Yousafzai told the house that the ANF was a national institution, which had been functioning for the eradication of drugs across the country.
He asked lawmakers not to ‘criticise institutions for the sake of criticism’.
Speaking on a calling attention notice, the minister said the Peshawar commissioner and the social welfare department had launched a joint campaign for the rehabilitation of drug addicts in the division, and a total of 2,200 addicts had so far been rehabilitated.
He said the rehab centres had been set up in Khyber and Orakzai tribal districts at the cost of Rs29.63 million and five more such centres would be established in South and North Waziristan, Kurram, Bajaur and Mohmand tribal districts with Rs350 million being allocated for it in the current budget.
