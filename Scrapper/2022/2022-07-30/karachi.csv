0,"Amid opposition boycott, Sindh PA seeks verdict in PTI ‘prohibited’ funding case",GDA terms issue irrelevant; PPP lawmakers say delay poses a further risk to our national security.,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and Grand Democratic Alliance on Friday staged a walkout as the Sindh Assembly adopted a resolution, demanding the Election Commission of Pakistan to pronounce its verdict in the PTI ‘prohibited’ funding case terming former prime minister Imran Khan a ‘security risk’ to the country.
The house witnessed ruckus immediately after Question Hour when Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari gave the floor to Opposition Leader Haleem Adil Sheikh to speak about his arrest and subsequent release.
He started with heavy criticism on the provincial government in draining out the rainwater, which according to him, had flooded the entire province, including major cities.
“Even your home city Sujawal and other cities including Thatta, Badin, Larkana and district East of Karachi are flooded,” the opposition leader told the chair. ““Even streets surrounding the Sindh Assembly are still inundated.”

GDA terms issue irrelevant; PPP lawmakers say delay poses a further risk to our national security

However, his remarks on the provincial government’s performance during the recent spells of monsoon did not please the chair who interrupted him to remind that he wanted to talk about his arrest. 
“I wanted to talk about the problems of people of the province first before I speak about myself,” he retorted and said that he was being victimised for his five-hour speech on the provincial budget.
He said that he was implicated in a 31-year-old case and the judge discharged the case against him as nothing was found against him by the investigators.
Parliamentary Leader Mukesh Kumar Chawla rose to term the opposition leader as ‘the biggest land grabber’. “First return the land you have illegally occupied,” he asked Mr Sheikh.
The PTI lawmakers gathered in front of the speaker’s rostrum chanting slogans against the government and then walked out from the house and boycotted the proceedings as the chair allowed an out-of-turn resolution of a PPP member.
PPP’ Sadia Javed moved the resolution stating that the ‘prohibited’ funding case against the PTI was of great national importance and had remained pending disposal for years before the ECP.
‘Irrelevant matter’
Shaheryar Khan Mahar of the GDA termed the resolution irrelevant and against the assembly rules, asking the chair to take up any other agenda which was in the interest of the people of Sindh. 
“The entire Sindh has submerged and the provincial assembly is talking about an irrelevant matter,” he added.
Mr Mahar said that it was illegal to discuss the issue as the matter was subjudice. 
“According to Rules 125(7) and 126 of rules and procedures of the Sindh Assembly, any matter which is pending before the court or statuary body cannot be discussed in the Assembly,” he said, brandishing the assembly rules book to the chair.
Disputing the stance of the GDA lawmaker, Women Development Minister Syeda Shehla Raza said that they were not discussing the conduct of judges, but were just demanding immediate pronouncement of the reserved verdict. 
“The case has been pending disposal before the ECP for the last eight years and now the verdict is reserved,” she added.
The resolution read: “The case has been delayed on one pretext or the other. The indecision poses a further risk to our national security since the foreign powers through such funds are in a position to influence the political discourse of our country.”
It said that there were sufficient pieces of evidence showing that the PTI got funds from foreigners to run political campaigns in Pakistan. “As per the laws of Pakistan, funds received from foreign governments and multinational corporations are deemed as foreign funding. The leading British newspaper Financial Times, in its report has also disclosed complete details of how PTI received funds in the name of charity and later utilise them for political purposes,” the resolution added.
Speaking on the resolution, Labour Minister Saeed Ghani said that the case was pending for the last eight years and the PTI had been exposed for its ‘malpractices’.
He said that the PTI had indulged in ‘malpractices’ ever since its inception, adding that huge amount of money was used by the top party leaders in the PTI’s intra-party elections. “Arif Alvi, Pervaiz Khattak and Imran Ismail used money to manipulate the PTI’s intra-party elections,” he alleged.
He said that the PTI was targeting the chief election commissioner to get a decision in their favour in the foreign funding case.
He said that when the ECP initiated the probe into the foreign funding, the PTI had concealed its accounts, adding that the PTI would hardly get a way out in the foreign funding case as the ECP had enough evidence in the case.
“Honourable judges have strange wisdom. They brought him [Imran Khan] up as blue-eyed. The courts are making decisions on pick and choose basis. The country cannot be run with this attitude,” he added.
Education Minister Syed Sardar Shah said that Imran Khan was suffering from ‘grandiose narcissism’ and a threat to the national security.
Later, the resolution was adopted unanimously in the absence of all opposition parties as the GDA was the last one to walk out against what they termed ‘irrelevant’ discussion.
Following the adoption of the government resolution, the chair took up the six call attention notices of as many members who all were absent in the house.
Two privilege motions, one given by Syed Abdur Rasheed of the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal and the other by PPP’s Sharmila Faruqui, also did not come up as both the members were not present in the house.
Later, the sitting was adjourned to Monday.

1,Confusion over extension in summer vacations in Karachi,"Some private schools announce extension owing to weather conditions, Ashura and Independence Day; no official notification issued.","KARACHI: There is no official decision regarding the extension of summer vacations in the metropolis. Still, there was a lot of confusion among parents regarding this matter on Friday after some private schools announced that they were going to extend the vacations due to the weather conditions, Ashura and Independence Day.
Due to heavy monsoon rains many of the city’s private schools decided to extend their summer vacation till Aug 9 as that would cover the heavy rains as well as Ashura. 
Some other private school went even further to say that they will reopen on Aug 15 to also include Independence Day in their summer vacations. The decisions left many people confused. Some thought that the schools were following provincial government directives.
Meanwhile, according to the Sindh education department, the summer vacations are to officially conclude on July 31 with Monday, Aug 1, as the first day of school. It has not shared any notification regarding extension of holidays.
However, PSMA chairman Danish Uz Zaman explained that the decision regarding extension of summer vacations was taken by some private schools only. 
“There has been no change of holiday schedule at the government level. The private schools that are going to reopen on August 15 also include the chain of Army Public Schools. But as the PSMA follows the Sindh education department, we are going to reopen our schools on Monday as planned earlier. If the education department issues a new directive on the matter, we will surely follow it,” he concluded.

4,Unfreezing of suspects’ bank accounts ordered in Dua abduction case,SHC issues notices on Zaheer’s plea for quashment of FIR.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday directed the authorities to unblock the computerised national identity cards (CNICs) and unfreeze bank accounts of the family members of Zaheer Ahmed, the purported husband of Dua Zehra Zaheer.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro also disposed of another petition filed by Zaheer seeking protection, as police said that he would not be harassed, but dealt as per law.
Zaheer’s brother Shabbir Ahmed also filed a petition in the SHC against freezing of bank accounts and blocking of CNICs and SIM cards of the petitioner and other family members.
The bench in its order said that on the request of the lawyer for Dua’s father Mahdi Kazmi, the SHC had ordered blocking and freezing of the CNICs and bank accounts of Zaheer’s family members on June 3 till the recovery of Dua.
It further noted that since the girl had been recovered, there was no reason to decline the petitioner’s plea and recalled its June 3 order directing the authorities concerned to unblock and unfreeze the CNICs and bank accounts, respectively.

SHC issues notices on Zaheer’s plea for quashment of FIR

About the petition of Zaheer for protection, the bench noted that the petitioner had already been granted bail by the trial court, while police officials and state’s lawyer said that he would be treated in accordance with law with no element of harassment.Meanwhile, the same bench on Friday issued notices to the provincial home secretary, police, complainant and other respondents on a petition of Zaheer seeking quashment of the case pertaining to alleged abduction of Dua Zehra.

Lawyer for complainant, on behalf of his client, submitted certain documents which were taken on record, and a copy was provided to the counsel for petitioner. 
Contempt plea referred to CJ
Dua’s father filed an application in the SHC on Friday seeking contempt proceedings against some persons for reportedly passing contemptuous remarks against a judge of the SHC in a talk show at a YouTube channel.
The bench in its order stated that since remarks were against one of the members of this bench, it was not appropriate for it to hear this application or pass any order thereon.
“In the circumstances, let this matter may be placed before the Honourable Chief Justice for either referring this application to some other bench or passing any appropriate order as his lordship may be pleased to,” it added.
Order reserved for today
Judicial Magistrate (East) Aftab Ahmed Bughio reserved his order till Saturday (today) on an application filed by the investigating officer seeking permission for a medical examination of Dua.
IO Saeed Rind stated in the application that the minor was required to be medically examined to determine whether or not she had been subjected to any sexual act during the period she spent with her purported husband after her alleged child marriage.
He said since the incumbent court had sent minor/victim to the Shelter Home for Destitute and Orphan Social Welfare, therefore, permission was required to move her custody to the hospital for the purpose of her medical examination.
Therefore, the IO requested the magistrate to allow him shifting the girl from the shelter home to a medical facility for a medical examination.
The state prosecutor, as well as the counsel representing the parents of girl and her purported husband, also supported such request.
After hearing arguments from parties, the magistrate fixed the matter on July 30 (today) for announcement of order on the application.
Progress report filed
In the meanwhile, IO Rind filed a progress report incorporating Sections 363 (kidnapping), 368 (wrongfully concealing or keeping in confinement, kidnapped or abducted person) and 375(v) (rape with or without her consent when she is under sixteen years of age) of the Pakistan Penal Code in the case lodged against Zaheer and 23 others.
In the report, the IO stated that detained suspect Shabbir Ahmed had during interrogation disclosed that he was present along with his brother Zaheer Ahmed in Karachi on April 16 when they had allegedly kidnapped Dua and took her to Punjab.
He added that Zaheer was using a SIM card, which was registered in the name of his mother, which showed his presence in the city on the day of the incident, adding that the suspect had switched off his phone in the area of Nooriabad.
The case was already fixed for Aug 1.

5,"Rains disturb vegetable supplies to Karachi, cause price hike","Incessant rains have continued to hit Sindh for almost nearly a month, thus, resulting in thin arrivals of vegetables in city.","

KARACHI: While already struggling over high cost of living owing to soaring utility bills and food items prices, consumers are now faced with massive hike in vegetable prices due to demand and supply gap caused by the torrential rains in Sindh and Balochistan and destruction of road networks and damage to crops in the two provinces.
Incessant rains have continued to hit the provinces for almost nearly a month, thus, resulting in thin arrivals of vegetables in Karachi, which entirely depends on the supply of greens from upcountry fields.
Retailers said a sizable quantity of various vegetable varieties came from Balochistan and the impact of rain-related devastation was now being felt in Karachi.
A number of retailers said that they were not bringing cucumber, cabbage, capsicum, mint (podina), green coriander (hara dhania) and green chillies to the city due to soaring rates at the New Subzi Mandi on Superhighway, fearing that consumers would not be able to pay hefty prices.
As a result of the price hike, buyers have become selective in purchasing vegetables as per their requirement.
Big green chillies are now being sold at Rs 240 per kg after reaching a peak of Rs 400 two days back. Small green chillies prices came down to Rs 160-200 per kg from Rs 320.
One small bunch of mint is now tagged at Rs20-30 which was easily available for Rs10 a few days back. Small and large bunch of green coriander now sell at Rs30 and Rs60 as compared to Rs10 and Rs20 each.
Tomato price scaled to Rs 160 from Rs 100 per kg while two days back, the red fruit was selling at Rs 300 per kg.
Cabbage now costs Rs 200 as compared to Rs 120-150 per kg a week back while it hit the ceiling of Rs 400 per kg two days back. Bringle (Baingan) rates have increased to Rs150 from Rs80 per kg.
Cucumber is being sold for Rs 120 as compared to Rs200-240 per kg two days back while it was available at Rs80 per kg last week. Lady finger rate surged to Rs 320 from Rs200 per kg two days back while it was selling at Rs 150 per kg a week back.
During Eid holidays, consumers had paid Rs400 per kg for capsicum which later plunged to Rs200 per kg. After rising intensity in rains, the rate has again gone up to Rs320 per kg.
Onion price had soared to Rs90-100 per kg ahead of Eid, but it has now settled at Rs80 per kg.
After Eid, the price of ridge gourd (Turrai) and bottle gourd (Loki) had climbed to Rs200 per kg from Rs80-100 per kg prior to Eid. Now, they have fallen to Rs120 and Rs150 per kg, respectively.
The president of the Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market, Haji Shahjehan, said the arrival of onion and tomatoes for the last two days from Balochistan had been suspended, while rains in Sindh had also hampered supplies of greens from various areas of Sindh.
He said the demand for vegetables is not high in the rainy days due to skyrocketing prices, but the supply crunch from producing areas is putting extra pressure on the prices.

7,"Poet and critic Ashfaq Hussain’s life, work celebrated",Firasat Rizvi says sometimes MA thesis work proves more important than PhD dissertation...,"KARACHI: Speakers shed light on the life and work of poet and critic Ashfaq Hussain, who resides in Canada and is these days visiting Pakistan, at an event held in his honour at the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi on Thursday evening.
Presiding over the event, poet Anwar Shaoor said that despite the longevity of the programme (speakers before him took some time to present their arguments) was not sufficient to know Mr Hussain. He claimed that the visiting guest is a multitalented person, who has a sound judgment (sa’ib-ur-ra’i). To support his claim he mentioned Mr Hussain’s book Faiz Ki Muhabbat Mein.
Poet Firasat Rizvi said the first thing that comes to mind while speaking about Mr Hussain is that there are basically three facets to his personality. The first is: he is a poet. He began his literary career by composing verses. Poetry is his first love. His second love is the legendary poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz.
“It was in 1974 that he [Hussain] did his MA in Urdu literature from the University of Karachi and wrote a thesis to obtain the degree. There are a good number of people whose MA theses have proven to be more important than their PhD research papers. For example, the book that Dr Farman Fatehpuri wrote on Urdu Ruba’i was basically the thesis that he wrote when he was in pursuit of an MA in 1958. Hussain penned his thesis on Faiz which was published by Idara-i-Yadgaar-i-Ghalib in the late 1970s. It was the first book of criticism on Faiz,” he said.

Firasat Rizvi says sometimes MA thesis work proves more important than PhD dissertation

Mr Rizvi said that subsequently Hussain wrote nine books on Faiz. “About one of his books, Faiz Ke Maghribi Havaley, Prof Sahar Ansari once said to me that he hadn’t read a better book on Faiz. And his last publication brought to light the researcher in him as well.”
The third facet to Mr Hussain’s journey that Mr Rizvi touched upon is his association with the Progressive Writers Movement. He highlighted the fact that throughout his life, Mr Hussain did not leave the ideology that he adhered to. 
Ashfaq Hussain started his speech by talking about the guests who were present in the Haseena Moin hall of the council on Thursday, some whom he pointed out he has known for 50 years. He then went down memory lane when he used to live in Karachi, especially the time spent in Korangi. He also recited some of his poetry.
Shahid Rassam, Dr Sher Mehrani, Akbar Laghari, Mujahid Barelvi and Ahmed Shah also spoke. Shakil Khan, who exuded nervous energy, moderated the event.

9,Bike riding becomes ‘back-breaking’ job for Karachiites,Study finds around 56pc motorcyclists suffer from lower back pain...,"KARACHI: The fast depleting infrastructure, poor road conditions and further damage to thoroughfares after seasonal rains is now taking toll on health of Karachiites with most of them are youngsters as more than 50 per cent bikers in the city have been found with chronic lower back pain due to injuries they suffer while riding.
Citing recent data and study, health experts claimed that 56pc young bikers are paying the price for riding their motorcycles on badly damaged roads, which have become almost not motorable due to hundreds of potholes, open manholes and accumulation of sewage.
They said not only the motorbikes, but even women who travel in rickshaws in Karachi are suffering from lower back pain due to strain and injuries they suffer on the broken roads of Karachi, and urged authorities to launch an immediate drive to repair all the main and branch roads in the city to prevent young men and women from permanent disability due to dilapidated condition of roads in the megalopolis.
“Our research and data collected from various health facilities indicate that around 56pc motorcyclists, mostly young college and university students are complaining of chronic lower back pain due to broken and undriveable roads of Karachi,” renowned rheumatologist and Pak-American Arthritis Centre (PAAC) Managing Director Dr Saliha Ishaq told a news conference on Thursday. 

Study finds around 56pc motorcyclists suffer from lower back pain

“It’s alarming and I say this because many motorcyclists are now found unable to drive their bikes for sustaining serious damage to their ligaments or backbone because of dilapidated condition of roads in Karachi.”
She referred to the unprecedented increase in the complaints of muscle and joint pain, which led to an effort to collect the data  and ascertain the reason behind the fresh trend. She warned that if the timely treatment of such problems was not carried out, it could  damage the quality of life.
“So we advise people with such complaints to approach trained and qualified rheumatologists for the timely diagnosis and treatment for their conditions. Realising the growing need, Pakistan’s first arthritis centre has been launched in Karachi recently by a group of health experts for the early diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal diseases and systemic autoimmune conditions, commonly referred to as rheumatic diseases,” she added.
According to experts, rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease, in which the immune system of a person attacks healthy cells in his or her body by mistake, causing inflammation (painful swelling) in the affected parts of the body. Rheumatoid Arthritis mainly attacks the joints, usually many joints at once.
“If a person is having joint and muscle pain which aggravates while taking rest, but becomes bearable while working, the person should immediately approach a rheumatologist,” suggests Dr Saliha.
Dr Babar Saeed of Ehad Medical Center (EMC), which is treating such patients at its 20 centres across Karachi in collaboration with PAAC, said that around 3pc of Pakistani population is already suffering from different autoimmune diseases as well as rheumatoid arthritis, but unfortunately, due to lack of trained and qualified rheumatologists in Pakistan, thousands of people, both young and old are living with chronic pain for years without proper treatment and management.
“Now, this fast depleting infrastructure and poor road conditions in Karachi are further adding burden to our health system and most alarmingly affecting people’s health and routine life,” he said.
Unfortunately, he said, most of the patients with arthritis, especially backache, are misdiagnosed and suffer for months or even years before reaching any trained and qualified rheumatologist.

14,Crocodiles unleash terror in villages around Haleji Lake,Overflowing lake enables the reptiles to come out of their sanctuary.,"THATTA: People living in villages around Haleji Lake spent a sleepless night after an unknown number of crocodiles reportedly sneaked into nearby ditches and trenches on Thursday morning through crevices in the embankments in the wake of heavy rains, which raised water level of the natural lake.
Early on Friday, a group of people in Makke Dinu Jokhio village near Jungshahi town managed to rope in a crocodile, which had foraged into the village in search of food, after a risky operation to save them and their families from the beast.
They were pondering over the ways to get rid of it when an official of wildlife department and a policeman reached there only to get themselves photographed with the trapped reptile and take credit for the ‘successful rescue operation’, said villagers.  

Overflowing lake enables the reptiles to come out of their sanctuary

They claimed that the reptiles occasionally made forays into nearby settlements. In recent past, they killed 11-year-old Ayesha and injured Baghal Jokhio, Ibrahim Mirbahar, Kallo Mirbahar, Maman Mirbahar and others, and dragged away 16 goats, two cows, one buffalo and a number of other cattle near the lake’s banks.
An official of the wildlife department, who was custodian of the reptiles, disclosed that seven crocodiles were released into the lake as a gift from then chief minister Mumtaz Ali Bhutto.
A source in the department disclosed on condition of anonymity that since the budget for the food of crocodiles was embezzled by the department, the volatile creatures remained hungry and did not wait to sneak into the nearby villages whenever they found an opportunity.
As per official statistics, about 200 marsh crocodiles inhabit the lake spread over 6.58 miles or nearly 1,700 hectares. It is known as birds’ paradise which is also abode of migratory birds from Siberia, coots, purple, moorhens, kingfishers and teals.

The conference resolved that the Sindh Action Committee (SAC) would continue to be part of the ongoing public mobilisation campaign on the issue.

Convened by JSQM, conference demands expulsion of all outsiders from Sindh

He said his party had resolved to get all illegal immigrants expelled from Sindh. This conference, he added, was aimed at holding consultations with all stakeholders on the issue.
Senior JSQM leader Asif Baladi said that Pakistan Peoples Party was not protector of Sindh’s interests but it was tinkering 
with the integrity of this province. He accused PPP of dishonesty with the vote of Sindhi people.
He said emancipation was the right of Sindhi people and Sindh was within its right to take its decisions. “Sindh will take its historic decision one day,” he vowed.
Sindh Taraqqi-pasand Party (STP) senior vice chairman Hyder Shahani remarked that “Sindh has been made Jerusalem, where outsiders are settled to convert Sindhis into a minority under a conspiracy”. He said that people of Sindh voted for PPP, therefore, it should refrain from working against interests of the province.
Qaumi Awami Tehreek vice president Dr Aziz Talpur said that ever since its invasion by Arabs, Sindh had become a colony and this had led to injustices and tyranny. He deplored that Afghans, Bengalis, Burmese and Biharis were settled in Sindh to turn Sindhis into a minority.  
Awami Tehreek leader Sajjad Ahmed Chandio cited a 2011 report that suggested that around 2.5m Afghans, Burmese, Biharis and Bengalis were living in Karachi alone, and said this figure had increased substantially. He described settlement of outsiders as the biggest issue of Sindh. He noted with concern that the Supreme Court’s 2011 directives to the federal and provincial governments had not been implemented as yet. 
He said that PPP had maintain an undeclared emergency in Sindh over the last 14 years.
Sindh Qaumi Party leader Nawaz Khan Zour suggested that Sindhis should not show emotional reaction, rather they should ponder over these issues seriously. He said no outsider could have the right to hold property and register vote in Sindh. He was of the view that since government received funds for refugees, so it would not repatriate them.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl Sindh leader Maulana Taj Mohammad Nahiyoon, Porhiyat Mazahimat leader Masroor Shah, Zulfiqar Halepoto, Mohsin Joyo, Zulfiqar Qadri and others also spoke. 
They noted that a campaign against Sindhis was launched on the social media but it died down soon because people knew that Sindhis were not weak.
They condemned unscrupulous Sindhi officers for issuing domiciles to outsiders “in lieu of money”, and selling Sindh’s lands at higher prices to them.
