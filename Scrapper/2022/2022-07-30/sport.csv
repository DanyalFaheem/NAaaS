However, the way it happened indicated the controversy surrounding the country’s national sport is far from its end. 
Nasir Ali — member of the four-man committee appointed by the Pakistan Sports Board to run the PHF’s affairs after it de-notified president Khalid Sajjad Khokhar and secretary Asif Bajwa from their respected posts — named Mohammad Riaz as the federation’s election commissioner.
Riaz, an advisor of the Azad Jammu Kashmir government, who has served the PHF as the election commissioner before, was given the role again, but without the approval of the remaining three members of the PSB-appointed committee.
Former internationals Rehan Butt and Arshad Mehmood told Dawn that they were not consulted before Riaz’s name was finalised. However, Nasir has advised his fellow members to submit their objections over Riaz’s appointment in the next 48 hours.
The fourth member of the committee is Khokhar, who had been included by the PSB as a former PHF president. The election commissioner being announced without Khokhar’s consultation also implies that the PHF has given up its constitutional right to conduct its polls.
Despite being ripped off his powers as president, Khokhar appointed Haider Hussain as the PHF’s interim secretary on Wednesday.
PSB director general Asif Zaman is expected to take notice of the situation when he returns from Birmingham, England, where he had travelled to with the Pakistan contingent for the Commonwealth Games.
Meanwhile, the PHF elections are set to be held from August 5. The district level elections will be completed by August 13 before the provincial polls on August 17 and the national level elections on August 19, the federation said Friday.
All clubs which took part in the recently concluded Chief of Army Staff Inter-club Hockey Championship have been recognised as genuine clubs. Clubs that failed to feature in the tournament can acquire voting rights after being cleared by the PHF scrutiny committee. 
LAWMAKERS BASH KHOKHAR
Meanwhile, in Islamabad, members of the National Assembly voiced their concerns over the continuing decline of hockey in Pakistan.
During the parliament’s question hour session on Friday, MNA Moulana Abdul Akbar Chitrali criticised Khokhar for not being fit enough to run the sport.
He said the PHF president is fighting bad health and uses a wheelchair and that the PHF’s matters “should be looked into”.
Akbar rued that nepotism had taken Pakistan hockey towards decline. The lawmaker’s views were echoed by his colleague Nawab Sher, who heads the NA’s standing committee on Inter Provincial Co-ordination.
Nawab said the committee had discussed the national team’s poor performance in its meetings and that it had given recommendations to send the PHF officials home.
 “The PHF president is on a wheelchair, he has no activity,” he told the house. He claimed that upon recommendations of the committee, the PHF was abolished, but in surprise to many, the committee was told that elections of federation are going to be conducted under the chairmanship of the removed PHF president.
Meanwhile, in a written reply to another question, federal minister IPC Ehsan-ur-Rehman Mazari, who is also in the UK with the national Commonwealth Games contingent, said that restricted availability of funds along with inappropriate use of the available funding by PHF had incurred financial losses to Pakistan hockey. 
“Such funding may have been used in appropriate manner for domestic activation of hockey,” he added. 
“The PHF’s managements did not keep hockey up to their priorities resulting in poor governance and non-productivity.” 
Earlier this month, Khokhar — along with secretary Bajwa and treasurer Ikhlaq Usmani — had been de-notified by the PSB after failing to hold elections of the country’s hockey governing body which were due in May this year. Khokhar had rejected PSB’s move. 
“Please be informed that I am still the President PHF and not the former President according to the Constitution of PHF,” he said in a letter to the PSB, dated July 22. 
“I, therefore, regret to accept your illegal, unlawful and unconstitutional letter.” 
Khokhar too, is currently in the UK for the Commonwealth Games.

The races are being held after a fortnight as they were cancelled owing to rain on July 24.
The Karachi Cup, which tops the action in a five-race card, has a strong field of 11 contenders under 
scale order VI and VII and will go over sprinting distance of four furlongs. It is the third race in the racing order.
Club Champion had notched up a length-and-a-quarter victory over Denzo on July 17 and is tipped to repeat his winning feat by overcoming challengers. He is likely to be opposed by Daffodles Wave and Faster Than You, respectively.
A competitive card of five horses envisage the fifth and last race that is also the day’s feature event classified under combined scale order I and II being run over four-and-a-half furlongs.
Bay horse Shahbaz looks destined to make amends by returning with flying colours. His last victory came on June 5 and was placed third and second, respectively in his next two outings.
He may be chased by bay horse Geo Jalal. Three other aspirants in the race are Torrent, Sweet Golden and Faris.
Another nine horses will be seen in action in the fourth and supporting race under combined scale order III, IV and V that will also take place over four-and-a-half furlongs.
It seems to be a three-way tie featuring mare Balochistan Queen, chestnut horse Marvellous and mare Zahrish.
At the outset, mares Stayin’ Alive and Stifee look poised to dominate the first and second race, respectively. The first race is classified under scale order VIII while the second under scale order VII. Both the races will be run over four furlongs.
The first race starts at 3:30pm.

Imran and Munro joined former Pakistan captains Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Malik and ex West Indies skipper Darren Sammy in the mentors’ line-up of the six-team franchise T20 league, which will see local and foreign under-19 players in action from October 4-17 in Lahore, the Pakistan Cricket Board said Friday.
The sixth mentor will be announced in due course. Pakistan legend Javed Miandad was earlier named as the PJL’s “overall mentor”. 
“After the team naming rights have been confirmed, these celebrated former international stars will be allocated sides,” the PCB said in a statement.
Imran is a veteran of 20 Tests, 107 One-day Internationals and 38 T20Is. He was a part of the Multan Sultans side that finished as the runners-up in the last edition of the Pakistan Super League.
Munro on the other hand is known for his hard-hitting at the top of the order. The left-hander boasts three T20 centuries for New Zealand and has played for Islamabad United and Karachi Kings in the PSL.

The former India all-rounder has been an important part of Australia’s set-up, helping turn Adam Zampa and Ashton Agar into world class spinners in the short formats. 
“After being on the road for six years it’s with a heavy heart I have decided to move on from my current role as an assistant coach of the Australian men’s team,” Sriram said in a statement on Friday. 
“I feel this is an opportune moment keeping in mind the team, giving them enough time to prepare for two World Cups and the World Test Championship.”  
Cricket Australia did not clarify whether Sriram’s departure would mean new personnel but former New Zealand all-rounder Daniel Vettori recently joined Andrew McDonald’s staff as a full-time bowling coach.

Heading into Saturday’s curtain raiser to the Premier League season, the pressure is on Haaland and Nunez to provide evidence they can justify their hefty price tags over the coming months.
The pair represent over 100 million ($121 million) of goalscoring firepower as the rivalry between City and Liverpool intensifies.
Much has changed at City and Liverpool since Pep Guardiola’s side pipped the Reds to the title by one point after a thrilling come-from-behind victory over Aston Villa on the last day of the season.
City’s fourth title in five seasons was just reward for their incredible consistency, but Guardiola’s perfectionist personality ensured he would not rest on his laurels.
Aware that City’s success last season was achieved despite their lack of a natural central striker, Guardiola made a blockbuster move for one of Europe’s brightest young stars as he landed Norway international Haaland from Borussia Dortmund for 51 million pounds.
The 22-year-old’s ability to mesh with City’s array of creative talents is one of the key storylines that will define the title race.
The early signs are promising as Haaland took just 12 minutes to score on his City debut in a friendly against Bayern Munich.
“As you probably all know, I’ve been watching a lot of City games for the last years,” Haaland said.
“The last years (they) have been without a striker, so of course I’ve been seeing myself in these kind of situations. I’m not surprised. The quality is good.” Signing England midfielder Kalvin Phillips from Leeds for 42 million further underlined City’s dynastic ambitions.
While City will start the season as title favourites whatever the result this weekend at Leicester’s King Power Stadium, Liverpool’s threat to their supremacy remains clear and present.
Jurgen Klopp’s team came within two games of football immortality after spending the second half of the season engaged in a thrilling chase to win an unprecedented quadruple.
With history in touching distance, Liverpool fell painfully short as City won the title before Real Madrid beat them 1-0 in the Champions League final.
Beating Chelsea on penalties in the FA and League Cup finals was scant consolation for a manager with Klopp’s ferocious drive.
The months since that agonising finale have seen Liverpool finally end speculation over Mohamed Salah’s future by tying the Egypt star to a new contract.
The departure of Sadio Mane to Bayern Munich was a blow, but Klopp filled the void left by the Senegal forward when he paid an initial 64 million, that could rise to a club record 85 million, to sign Nunez from Benfica.
Nunez, 23, has endured a rollercoaster pre-season, with an embarrassing miss against Manchester United followed by a four-goal demolition of Leipzig, then a blank in a defeat against Salzburg.

6,Captain Umar Bhutta optimistic about Pakistan hockey team’s chances of podium finish,"Despite Pakistan’s rich title history in hockey, their record at the Commonwealth Games is relatively poor.","KARACHI: Despite Pakistan’s rich title history in hockey, their record at the Commonwealth Games is relatively poor. 
Only twice have the Greenshirts, record four-time winners of the World Cup and three-time Olympic gold medallists, finished amongst the medal places — a bronze in 2002, followed by a silver in 2006. 
Part of it could be explained by the fact that once hockey was introduced to the Commonwealth Games in 1998, Pakistan’s decline in the sport had already begun. 
Pakistan last won the World Cup in 1994 and their last Olympic medal — a bronze — came in 1992. Although Pakistan won gold at the 2010 Asian Games and a silver at the following edition of the quadrennial continental spectacle, those medals were quickly forgotten with the national team failing to qualify for each of the last two Olympics as well as the 2014 World Cup. 
The team will also miss next year’s World Cup having failed to secure qualification for the event after finishing fifth at the Asia Cup earlier this year. 
Captain Umar Bhutta, however, is heading into the team’s Commonwealth Games Pool ‘A’ opener against South Africa on Saturday confident that his side can breathe some life into Pakistan hockey by securing a medal in Birmingham. 
“The motivation is to take Pakistan back to where it belonged,” Umar told Dawn in a telephone interview on Friday. “The players are pumped up and want to achieve something here … we want to get a medal and improve Pakistan’s legacy at these Games.” 
Pakistan’s young side, with several players having come into the team only last year, also face New Zealand, Scotland and six-time champions Australia in their pool with the top two advancing to the semi-finals. 
“It is a challenge for us but the good thing about having a young side is that there is no fear,” said Umar. “They are gunning to go all out.” 
Umar believes a medal at the Games would also ease out some pain of missing out on next year’s World Cup. 
“We worked very hard but we couldn’t make it,” he reflected. “It was difficult for us and things didn’t fall our way but the players realise that this is just the start of a long journey to take Pakistan back to the top.” 
Umar admitted that Pakistan, the pioneers of fancy stick-work in the sport, had failed to improve on the technical side of the sport to fall behind the rest of the world. 
“Modern-day hockey is very technical,” he said. “There is a lot of stress on fitness and the new coaching set-up [led by Dutchman Siegfried Aikman] is working on bringing us up to the top level in that regard. What we need is stability and facilities at par with the international standard.” 
The Pakistan skipper believes a good performance at the Commonwealth Games could set the tone for next year’s Asian Games and the Olympics in Paris the following year.
“We can build from here,” said Umar. “The Asian Games offer a direct qualification slot for the Olympics for the winner. That’s our aim right now.”

7,Pakistan athletes fall to Indian opponents at CWG,Boxer Suleman Baloch no match for his Indian opponent; Pakistan’s mixed badminton team was swatted aside.,"BIRMINGHAM: A hammering in the ring followed by a thumping on the court— both by the same margin and against opponents from the same country. The first day of action at the Commonwealth Games wasn’t too inspiring for Pakistan. 
Pakistan boxer Suleman Baloch was no match for his Indian opponent Shiva Thapa while the country’s mixed badminton team was swatted aside by their arch-rivals on Friday. 
Pakistan’s four swimmers also failed to progress to the semi-finals from their heats while the same fate befell gymnast Mohammad Afzal. 
The only bright spot for Pakistan was Nasir Iqbal’s 3-0 win over Jamaica’s James Morrison in the round-of-64 of the men’s singles squash competition. 
Iqbal won 11-5, 11-4, 11-3 and his victory ensured Pakistan are guaranteed a spot in the round-of-16 as he set up a clash with compatriot Tayyab Aslam. 
Earlier at the National Exhibition Centre, Suleman lost 5-0 to Thapa, who hardly broke a sweat to advance to the round-of-16 of the light welterweight (63.5kg) category. 
The nimble-footed Thapa, five-time Asian Championship medallist, was at his calculative best against Suleman who started off aggressively, exploiting his height to the fullest. 
But Thapa ensured that Suleman had some misses up front to tire him out before going for the kill, bringing all his experience to play from second round onwards. 
He landed some quick jabs as Suleman lost control for a split second in the remaining minutes. At one point, Suleman lunged forward to punch but Thapa effortlessly moved out of the way as the Pakistan boxer fell on the canvas. 
The Indian was scored as the winner by all five courtside judges — 30-26, 30-25, 30-28, 30-36, 30-26 and 30-23 — for the bout. 
Pakistan’s shuttlers were also no match for India’s fancied line-up which swept to a 5-0 win in the Group ‘A’ opener. 
Mohammad Irfan Saeed Bhatti and Ghazala Siddique fell to a 21-9, 21-12 loss in the mixed doubles clash to B. Sumeeth Reddy and Machimanda Ponnappa before Kidambi Srikanth got the better of Pakistan’s Murad Ali 21-7 21-12 in the men’s singles match. 
Victory for India was secured when double Olympic medallist P. V. Sindhu grabbed a dominant 21-7, 21-6 win over Mahoor Shahzad in the women’s singles. 
Murad and Irfan then went down 21-12, 21-9 to Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty in the men’s doubles and the rout for India was completed when Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand crushed Mahoor and Ghazala 21-4, 21-5 in the women’s doubles. 
Pakistan’s first representation at the Games came in the pool but that also ended in disappointment although Haseeb Tariq bettered his national record. The 26-year-old clocked 25.97 seconds in the 50m butterfly, finishing 35th among 54 competitors. 
Mishael Ayub clocked 37.96 in the women’s 50m breastroke and was third-bottom among 33 competitors while Bisma Khan finished her 100m butterfly heat in a minute and 8.21 seconds to stand 31st among 38. 
Jahanara was 22nd among 30 swimmers in the 200m freestyle after clocking two minutes and 31.28 seconds. 
Elsewhere, Afzal failed to qualify for any of the three apparatus finals in gymnastics. 
The 39-year-old Afzal finished second-bottom among 19 competitors in the floor exercise, 12th out of 14 in the rings and last in the vault during the qualification round.

The 34-year-old Duffy finished in 55min 25sec, 41 seconds clear of England’s Georgia Taylor-Brown, who also took silver behind Duffy in Tokyo last year.
Beth Potter of Scotland finished third.
“No one has ever won twice and that was weighing on me,” Duffy told the BBC.  “The crowd was really behind Georgia [Taylor-Brown] but I was soaking it up and it was really special.
“It’s been a really strange start to the year and coming off the Olympics, and having Covid twice, but I knew if I gave myself time and patience I could put on a good performance here.”
Duffy held the slenderest of leads over Taylor-Brown heading into the third and final leg of the sprint-distance event, the five-kilometre run.
However, despite some poor form this season, which she put down to suffering from coronavirus, she blew her 28-year-old rival away on the first lap.
“I was a bit flat on the run, I just didn’t have the legs,” said Taylor-Brown.  “Considering how I felt before the race, I am just happy with a silver medal.
“I am bored of coming home second to Flora.” 
YEE WINS GOLD
Taylor-Brown may have been unable to turn silver into gold but her compatriot and Olympic runner-up Yee managed to do so in the men’s race.
He hailed his victory as his  “greatest achievement” despite his second-place finish at last year’s Tokyo Games.
The 24-year-old made up a deficit of 15 seconds following the bike section to overhaul long-time pacesetter Hayden Wilde on the run and finish in a time of 50:34.
New Zealand’s Wilde briefly regained the lead but, with a 10-second penalty hanging over him, he patted Yee on the shoulder and waved him on to take the honours on his own.
“Just bizarre that it’s me doing this,” Yee said.  “There were so many nations and athletes that I have not raced before.
“I feel extremely grateful and proud to be a triathlete today.
“This is a home Games and the first time I have been able to race in front of my parents for a long time. This is probably I’d say my greatest achievement ever.”
Yee also won mixed relay gold at the Tokyo Olympics alongside Taylor-Brown.
Wilde sat out his penalty — incurred for not putting his cycling helmet away properly in the transition — but last year’s Olympic bronze medallist still took silver.
“I am chuffed for the guy [Yee],” he said. “He played the perfect race. He was always in contention and I knew it was going to be a hard task [on the run].”
Wilde, who timed 50:47, said having Yee as a rival was a great motivation for him.
“We have had such great battles since Tokyo, with him getting the (Olympic) silver and me getting the bronze,” he said.
Australia’s Matthew Hauser, who finished three seconds behind Wilde, won bronze in an event in which 2018 champion Henri Schoeman pulled out before the start.
Multiple world champion Jonny Brownlee was another high-profile absentee due to a broken elbow.

9,‘Motivated’ Arshad Nadeem eyes javelin medal,He is without his coach Salman Butt in Birmingham as POA couldn’t get latter's accreditation made in time.,"LAHORE: Being awarded honourary membership by the Cambridge University Sports Centre had added to Arshad Nadeem’s motivation to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games.
Pakistan’s big medal hope, the 25-year-old javelin thrower is currently training at the facility where he’s also nursing his elbow injury under the supervision of Pakistan-origin Dr. Ali Sher Bajwa ahead of his event on Aug 5 at the Birmingham Games.“It has boosted my morale further and added to my motivation before the competition,” Arshad told Dawn in a message regarding the membership.
Arshad, who last year became the first athlete from Pakistan to qualify for a track and field final at the Olympics in Tokyo, heads into the Commonwealth Games after a fifth-place finish in the javelin event of the World Athletics Championship in the United States last week.
However, he is without his coach Salman Butt in Birmingham after the Pakistan Olympic Association couldn’t get his accreditation made in time after a delay on the part of the Pakistan Sports Board in sending the required documents.
Salman, however, has been holding training sessions virtually and said Arshad’s chances of winning a medal had been significantly increased with India’s Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra withdrawing from the Games due to injury.
“It’s difficult as you can only view a limited plan of his movements virtually but somehow we are managing,” Salman told Dawn on Friday. 
“On current form, only world champion Anderson Peters of Grenada [ who won in Oregon with a throw over 90 metres ]stands between Arshad and a gold medal.
“Peters is the only one among the top four of the World Championships who will be competing in Birmingham and Arshad’s confidence is high that he can return with a medal.”
Salman informed Arshad was getting a medical check-up for his elbow pain and that his medical tests, scans and x-rays of his throwing elbow, had been done on Thursday. Despite the injury, Arshad managed a throw of 86.16m at the World Championships.

She smashed nine fours in her 52 not out off 35 balls while Grace Harris chipped in with 37 off 20 balls before Alana King (18 not out) helped finish the job.
India bowler Renuka Singh took 4-18 in her four overs but the effort was in vain.
India had opted to bat first after winning the toss and made 154-8 in their 20 overs thanks to skipper Harmanpreet Kaur’s 52 off 34 balls — a knock that included eight fours and a six — as well as opening batter Shafali Verma’s 48.
But Jonassen’s 4-22 meant that the lower order could not take them to a bigger total.

11,Birmingham opening ceremony breathes life into doomed Games,BIRMINGHAM: A Common­wealth Games that once appeared doomed exploded into life with a dazzling opening ceremony on...,"BIRMINGHAM: A Common­wealth Games that once appeared doomed exploded into life with a dazzling opening ceremony on Thursday that put a modern spin on a sporting event often seen as a relic of the British Empire’s colonial past. 
Ten years after the 2012 London Olympics it was Birmingham’s moment in the spotlight, although a smaller one, as Prince Charles, reading a message on behalf of The Queen contained in a Baton that had travelled through all 72 nations and regions of the Commonwealth, declared the Games open. 
No one could deny Birmingham for giving itself a massive pat on the back for taking on the responsibility of staging the 2022 Games after Durban, South Africa was stripped of hosting duties for failing to deliver on promises made in its bid. 
Instead of the usual six-seven years to prepare, Birmingham had four and that challenge was multiplied by the arrival of Covid-19. 
While the pandemic forced the delay of an Olympics and an Asian Games, Birmingham pushed ahead, delivering on its promise of an on time, on budget project. 
“I’m a Brummy and this is a great city founded by people who just got on with,” said Birmingham 2022 chair John Crabtree. “People just go on with it, that’s why we’re here frankly. Birmingham is a modest city that would like to have the spotlight on it for just a bit.” 
For one night at least, Birmingham got its due as 30,000 spectators packed into renovated Alexander Stadium to take in a slick show that would match up against any Olympic production. Organisers say it was watched by over a billion people. 
The opening ceremony at the revamped Alexander Stadium paid tribute to the industrial heritage of the city and celebrated the diversity of its modern make-up. 
Prince Charles arrived with his wife Camilla in his personal Aston Martin during a segment highlighting Birmingham’s rich history of motor manufacturing. 
Nobel Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai, who moved to the city after surviving a Pakistani Taliban assassination attempt when she was 15 and spent part of her recovery in Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital, also had message. 
“Every child deserves the chance to reach her full potential and pursue her widest dreams,” she told the audience. 
Prince Charles declared the Games open as Duran Duran got the party started to a backdrop of fireworks across the city. 
The relevance of the quadrennial Commonwealth Games — first held in 1930 as the British Empire Games — has come under scrutiny, with persistent questions over Britain’s colonial legacy. 
Several Commonwealth nations, including Barbados and Jamaica, have either removed Queen Elizabeth II as head of state or have signalled they intend to do so. 
But British sports minister Nigel Huddleston is adamant there is still a place for the event in the sporting landscape. 
“The Commonwealth still has resonance and value, particularly in a diverse city like Birmingham where there’s a lot of people who have come from the Commonwealth,” he said in the build-up to the Games. 
“It does have meaning,” he said. “It might not be what it was in the past but it’s evolving and changing, and that focus on values and what can unite us is key.”

Rossouw’s innings was the cornerstone of a total of 207-3, with Reeza Hendricks making 53 — the opener’s second fifty in as many days.
Left-arm wrist-spinner Tabraiz Shamsi then took 3-27 and all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo 3-39 and paceman Lungi Ngidi 2-11 as England, chasing 208 to win, were dismissed for 149 in the 17th over.
South Africa also held several fine catches in a vastly-improved fielding effort following a shoddy display during a 41-run defeat in Wednesday’s series opener at Bristol where England posted an imposing 234-6.
England captain Jos Buttler hit 16 runs in three balls from Phehlukwayo — two sixes followed by a four — only to fall for 29 off the next when caught off a soaring top-edge by Hendricks.
England were 77-3 in the ninth over when struggling opener Jason Roy holed out for 20 off Shamsi, with Hendricks holding another good catch.
The Proteas then reduced England to 88-4.
Moeen Ali, who in Bristol had hit England’s quickest T20 fifty off just 16 balls, fell for 28 when he drove Shamsi only for Maharaj, running round from wide long-off, to cling onto the ball low down.
Shamsi, whose three wicketless overs on Wednesday cost an expensive 49 runs, then had Sam Curran caught as he tried to clear the short, straight boundary.
Fast bowler Kagiso Rabada dismissed Bairstow when the in-form batsman uppercut at a slower-ball bouncer, with Ngidi taking an excellent catch over his shoulder at backward point.
And when the big-hitting Liam Livingstone, was caught behind off Phehlukwayo, England were 141-7 in the 16th over before Ngidi cleaned up the tail.
Buttler surprisingly opted to field first despite England’s run-spree in Bristol.
Off-spinner Moeen made the breakthrough when De Kock (15) mistimed a drive to mid-on.
New batsman Rossouw hit the last two balls of the powerplay for 10 runs, flicking Richard Gleeson for six and driving him through extra-cover for four.
Hendricks completed a 29-ball fifty, but was out soon afterwards when Bairstow took a well-judged catch running back towards the long-leg boundary.
England thought Rossouw was caught behind down the legside by Buttler off Chris Jordan for 37 but the TV umpire ruled the ball had bounced into the wicketkeeper’s gloves.
Left-hander Rossouw’s third T20I fifty came over seven years after his second, with the 32-year-old left-hander only recently returning to international action after becoming a Kolpak player in English county cricket in 2016.
But his hopes of a hundred were dashed when Jordan conceded a mere four runs off the last over. Rossouw faced 55 balls including 10 fours and five sixes.

Test revelation Prabath Jayasuriya took five wickets with his left-arm spin as the hosts thumped Pakistan by 246 runs on Thursday to level the two-match series 1-1.
Sri Lanka were a mixed bag through a month of Tests at Galle, where they also hosted top-ranked Australia and again drew the series 1-1.
Silverwood, appointed in April to lead Sri Lanka having overseen England’s Ashes humiliation in Australia, cautioned that his new side were “nowhere near a complete team yet”. 
“We still have a lot of lessons to learn and we are developing and a work in progress,” the 47-year-old Englishman said. 
“We have been creating opportunities, which is good, but we need to obviously seize them.” 
The 30-year-old newcomer Jayasuriya was the pick of the Sri Lanka bowlers, taking his fourth five-wicket haul in just his third match, and was ably supported by fellow spinner Ramesh Mendis.
But Silverwood said he wants more from all his bowlers, and not just on turning sub-continent tracks. 
“Consistency within the bowling attack, I don’t want it to come in from one or two places, I want it to come from all the bowlers on a consistent basis,” Silverwood said. 
“I want to step up pressure on opposition teams around the world, not just on turning tracks here, so the seamers will have their opportunity at some point to show that they can create pressure.” 
Jayasuriya, who only made his Test debut earlier this month, emerged as an unlikely hero for Sri Lanka with his ability to dry up the flow of runs and pick wickets at crucial junctures.
Silverwood admitted he did not know much about Jayasuriya until he made the team in the second Australia Test, following a Covid outbreak in the home camp. 
“The biggest thing he has contributed is that control, he can create pressure on the opposition batsmen, he gets balls in good areas more often than not and he creates pressure, he creates opportunity,” said Silverwood. 
“You turn to him when the game is getting away from you. You can put him on and you know he can dry the runs up. He has been superb for us.” Sri Lanka next play a red-ball series in March when they travel to New Zealand for two Tests.
