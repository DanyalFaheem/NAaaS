0,Salman Rushdie hurt in New York knife attack,An assailant stabbed the British author in the neck at a literary event; police take suspect into custody.,"NEW YORK: British author Salman Rushdie, whose sacrilegious writings have made him the target of death threats, underwent emergency surgery on Friday after an assailant stabbed him in the neck at a literary event in New York state.
Police said a male suspect stormed the stage and attacked Rushdie and an interviewer, with the writer suffering “an apparent stab wound to the neck.” 
Rushdie fell to the floor when the man attacked him, and was then surrounded by a small group of people who held up his legs, seemingly to send more blood to his upper body, according to a witness attending the lecture.
He was taken by helicopter to a local hospital, police said.
A state trooper assigned to the event at the Chautauqua Institution, where Rushdie was due to give a talk, took the suspect into custody, while the interviewer suffered an injury to the head.
Police gave no details about the suspect’s identity or any probable motive.
Social media footage showed people rushing to Rushdie’s aid and administrating emergency medical care.
“A most horrible event just happened (and) the amphitheater is evacuated,” one witness said on social media.
Rushdie, 75, was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel Midnight’s Children in 1981, which won international praise and Britain’s prestigious Booker Prize for its portrayal of post-independence India.
But his 1988 book The Satanic Verses brought attention beyond his imagination when he was forced to go underground.

1,"Four injured in Jeddah suicide bombing, says Saudi media","One Pakistani, three security personnel shifted to hospital; suspect wanted in connection with deadly 2015 bombing in the kingdom.","RIYADH: A Saudi Arabian man wanted in connection with a deadly 2015 bombing in the kingdom detonated an explosive device in Jeddah on Wednesday as security forces attempted to arrest him, killing himself and injuring four others, state media reported on Friday.
The terror suspect, identified as Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Shehri, detonated the explosive belt on Wednesday night in Jeddah’s Al Samer neighbourhood, injuring three members of the security forces, who were seeking to arrest him, and a Pakistani national, Saudi news agency SPA reported on Friday.
The injured, who were not named, were taken to hospital, it said, without giving details of their injuries.

One Pakistani, three security personnel shifted to hospital

According to Saudi state media reports, Al-Shehri was suspected of being a member of a domestic terrorism cell that coordinated the 2015 suicide bombing of a mosque in Abha frequented by security force members. Eleven members of the security forces and four Bangladeshi nationals were killed in the attack, and 33 people were injured, state media reported at the time.
The Saudi Arabian government named Al-Shehri in early 2016 as one of six Saudi nationals wanted in connection with the bombing. 
Saudi Arabia was the scene of a series of large-scale militant attacks in the 2000s, including on security forces and Western targets. 
Such attacks were carried out by the Islamic State miltant group, Al Qaeda and other organisations. 
Though attacks have since mostly subsided, several people were wounded in a 2020 attack that used an explosive on a World War One remembrance ceremony in Jeddah.
Earlier this year, French prosecutors opened a terrorism investigation into a December 2021 explosion under a French vehicle involved in the Dakar rally sports race in Saudi Arabia.

2,"Militants present in Swat, but situation under control: police",Say they are cognisant of video clips circulating on social media showing heavy presence of militants in Swat.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police on Friday acknowledged the presence of militants in some remote mountainous areas of Swat district.
A brief statement issued by the Central Police Office said the police were fully cognisant of the fact that some individuals from Swat, previously living in Afghanistan, were present in some far-flung mountainous areas of Swat.
However, police said, the situation was “totally under the control of civil administration” and all law enforcement agencies were ready to respond to any misadventure.
The statement came after the provincial government’s days-long silence on a clash between the police and the Taliban in a remote area of Matta tehsil, the hometown of Chief Minister Mahmood Khan. A DSP and some security personnel were reportedly detained by suspected militants after the clash. They were later released after intervention of a jirga.
Police said they were cognisant of video clips circulating on social media showing heavy presence of militants in Swat. 
They said the department was also aware of public apprehension that Swat may return to the 2008-09-like era when militants ruled the valley with their version of Sharia.
“Peaceful society of Swat has no space for terrorism in any form and manifestation,” the police said.
The statement added that law enforcement agencies were “appropriately placed to resort to all possible measures to ensure peace in Swat as per aspirations of the local populace”.
Earlier on Friday, a large number of people took to the streets across Swat and demonstrated against the recent incident.

3,"Eight killed in heavy rains in Balochistan, Karakoram Highway bridge swept away","Thunderstorms likely in several areas of Sindh, including Karachi; Balochistan battered by flash floods, two dams breached.","KARACHI/MANSEHRA/QUETTA: At least eight people were killed in the fresh spell of heavy rains and flash floods in different areas of Balochistan, traffic between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan was suspended for the second time this month after flash floods swept away a bridge, while the Met department on Friday forecast thunderstorms with a few “heavy” to “very heavy” falls and occasional strong winds in several parts of Sindh in the next two days.
“The well-marked low-pressure area over the northeast Arabian Sea has intensified into an intense low-pressure area (depression) with a maximum wind speed of 50-55 kilometres per hour,” a Met department advisory said but added that none of the coastal areas was under threat at present.
“The system is located around latitude 22.6N and longitude 66.4E, at a distance of about 260km south/southeast of Karachi and 280km from Thatta. This weather system is likely to move in northwest direction initially and then westwards,” it said.
Chief Meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz told Dawn the system was unlikely to turn into a cyclone as prevailing monsoon conditions did not support its formation and the depression would likely advance into its next stage, called deep depression, before dying out.

Thunderstorms likely in several areas of Sindh, including Karachi; Balochistan battered by flash floods, two dams breached

The department has forecast thunderstorms with a few heavy to very heavy falls and occasional strong winds in Tharparkar, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Badin, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Hyderabad, Matiari, Thatta, Sujawal, Sanghar, Shaheed Benazir­abad, Naushahro Feroze, Khairpur, Sukkur, Larkana, Ghotki, Kashmore, Shikar­pur, Jacobabad, Dadu, Jamshoro and Kambar Shahdadkot districts and Karachi division until Aug 14 with occasional gaps.
Dr Sarfaraz said the low-pressure area over India’s Rajasthan state has weakened, which would help the current pattern of isolated heavy to very heavy falls in Sindh continue.
“Sea conditions would remain very rough during the next three days. Fishermen in Sindh are advised not to venture in the open sea till Aug 14 and those in Balochistan should also remain extra cautious during the forecast period,” the advisory said.
Rainfall is also likely to intensify in Balochistan’s north-eastern and southern districts and may trigger flash floods in Dadu, Jamshoro and Kambar Shahdadkot districts and downstream.
Besides, heavy rains over Khuz­dar, Lasbela and Hub districts and over the Kirthar mountain range may create extra pressure on Hub and Thaddo dams and downstream areas.
Heavy falls may create waterlogging and urban flooding in low-lying areas during the forecast period.
Bridge washed away in Kohistan
Traffic between Khyber Pakhtun­khwa and Gilgit-Baltistan was suspended for the second time this month on Friday after a temporary steel bridge installed at the Karakoram Highway (KKH) was swept away by flash flood in the Ichar nullah area of Upper Kohistan.
“We installed a Bailey bridge some three days ago at Ichar nullah, but it was swept away in the flash floods which brought heavy boulders, rocks and eroded lands, suspending traffic between KP and GB,” Mohammad Asif, the deputy commissioner of Upper Kohistan, told reporters.
He said that traffic en route to GB and KP had been diverted to the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad road.
The working sites of the Dasu hydropower projects were also inundated in the floods, which also swept away machinery, including shovels.
120 houses destroyed
In Balochistan, at least eight people, including a child, were killed in the fresh spell of heavy rains and flash floods in different areas and amid reports of the breach of Machka and another dam in Qila Abdullah, while hundreds of houses were washed away in Qila Saifullah district.
Of those who lost their lives, three were killed in the Killi Khali neighbourhood located on the outskirts of Quetta where heavy rains collapsed the walls of two houses. Another death was reported in Chaman district.
Four of the deceased were swept away in flash floods that hit Qila Abdullah district late on Friday night, said Munir Ahmad Kakar, the district’s deputy commissioner. They were among the 15 who were on a tractor trolley when it was washed away. The rest of the people remained missing.
Officials said traffic between Quetta and Karachi was once again suspended as the linking highway had been damaged in different areas of Lasbela district.
In Qila Saifullah district, around 120 houses were swept away by hill torrents on Thursday night, Zakaullah Durrani, the assistant commissioner of Muslim Bagh, told Dawn, adding that 200 houses were also damaged in other localities.
Rains also continue to batter Pishin, Chaman, Qila Abdullah, Ziarat, Harnai, Duki, Sanjavi, Loralai, Fort Minro, Barkhan, Zhob and Sherani areas.
