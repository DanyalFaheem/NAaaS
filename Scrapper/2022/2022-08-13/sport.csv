0,Arshad Nadeem extends golden run to Islamic Solidarity Games,Javelin thrower sends the spear to 88.55 metres for the best throw ever at the multi-sport event.,"KONYA: Another Games for Arshad Nadeem, another record-breaking gold for the Pakistan javelin thrower.
Six days after his victory at the Commonwealth Games, Arshad was at it again on Friday at the Islamic Solidarity Games when the 25-year-old sent the spear to 88.55 metres for the best throw ever at the multi-sport event involving elite athletes from members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
Arshad though was head and shoulders above the rest in Turkey. Qatar’s Ahmed Magour, who held the previous record at the Games at 83.45 metres, was the silver medallist with a throw of 74.28 metres while Iran’s Ali Fathi Ganji took bronze with a throw of 71.24 metres.
Arshad, however, has achieved these feats despite an elbow injury that has troubled him since the Olympics in Tokyo last year where he finished fifth.
Arshad’s best attempt came in his second throw after he opened on 79.40 metres. His third throw reached a distance of 75.50m and his fourth and fifth throw were 82.40m and 83.33m respectively.
The ongoing fifth edition of the Islamic Solidarity Games were initially scheduled to be held last year but were postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
On Sunday, Arshad had stormed to gold at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham with a record throw of 90.18 metres. In doing so, he became only the second Asian ever to cross the 90m mark in the sport.
In July, he had also finished fifth at the World Athletics Championships in Oregon.
With the Asian Games in China postponed to next year, Arshad will now undergo treatment on his longstanding elbow issue in London in consultation with Cambridge University’s Dr Ali Sher Bajwa.
He is expected to go under the knife next month before starting his comeback in May next year ahead of the Asian Games.
Arshad has stated that he wants to be in optimum condition for the 2024 Paris Olympics and that he’s looking to break the javelin world record that stands at 98.48m.

The top-order batsman-cum-wicketkeeper captained Zimbabwe to a winning 2-0 lead over Bang­ladesh last Sunday in another ODI series, before a sprained hand ruled him out of a final-match loss.
Zimbabwe will face India in a positive mood after 2-1 ODI and Twenty20 series victories over Bangladesh this month. Pakistan-born Sika­ndar Raza, who starred in the ODI series, is part of a 17-man squad named on Thursday by recently hired coach Dave Houghton.
The series, part of the Cricket World Cup Super League, will be staged at the Harare Sports Club.
Squad: Ryan Burl, Regis Chakabva (capt/wkt), Tanaka Chivanga, Bradley Evans, Luke Jongwe, Innocent Kaia, Takudzwanashe Kaitano, Clive Madande, Wessly Madhevere, Tadiwanashe Marumani, John Masara, Tony Munyonga, Richard Ngarava, Victor Nyauchi, Sikandar Raza, Milton Shumba, Donald Tiripano.

2,England Lions thrash SA in warm-up,LONDON: England’s second-string Lions rounded off a commanding innings win over the South African tourists at...,"LONDON: England’s second-string Lions rounded off a commanding innings win over the South African tourists at Canterbury on Friday — just five days before the first Test at Lord’s.
The match, which was not first-class because South Africa wanted to give a run out to more than 11 players ahead of the opening fixture of a three-Test series, saw the Lions take the final seven wickets they needed for victory as they won by an innings and 56 runs.
This win was achieved despite Craig Overton, who took five wickets in the first innings and is in England’s squad for the first Test, leaving the field with a back injury during Friday’s morning session.
In his absence, the wickets on the final day of four were shared, with Ollie Robinson, recalled to the England squad for the South Africa series, removing Rassie van der Dussen in the morning to finish with five for the match.
Spin bowlers Dan Lawrence and Liam Patterson-White and promising Derbyshire quick Sam Conners polished off the tail, the latter finishing with figures of 4-23, as the South Africans slumped to 183 all out.
Aidan Markram was the only batter to make the most of his chance for some time in the middle, scoring a measured 88 not out.
Earlier, in the match Harry Brook (140) and Ben Duckett (145) were the major contributors as the Lions made a mammoth 672 in reply to the tourists’ first innings 433.

3,Surprise date-change overshadows World Cup 100-day countdown,"FIFA, Qatar promise action to help fans, sponsors and broadcasters hit by the change.","DOHA: FIFA and Qatar organisers on Friday counted the cost of bringing forward the start of the World Cup by a day as they launched the 100-day countdown to the event.
Football’s ruling body and the wealthy Gulf state both promised action to help fans, sponsors and broadcasters hit by the change, announced late Thursday, but did not give details.
The sudden move to bring forward Qatar’s match against Ecuador by 24 hours — to make it the gala opening match — has only added to the public relations concerns as the conservative host country counters criticism of its rights record and fan worries about what to expect when they arrive.
“It is less than three months from the start. This has come out of the blue. It is not critical but it is a headache,” said an executive for one World Cup broadcaster, speaking on condition of anonymity.
FIFA said its president Gianni Infantino and the six heads of the continental confederations had unanimously agreed to make Qatar’s game and the official opening ceremony a  “stand-alone” event.
“The change ensures the continuity of a long-standing tradition of marking the start of the World Cup with an opening ceremony on the occasion of the first match featuring either the hosts or the defending champions,” FIFA said in a statement.
Under the old schedule, Qatar against Ecuador was to be the official inauguration match on the evening of November 21 but Senegal against Netherlands would have been the first match of the day, followed England against Iran.
Under the new plan, the Group A game between Senegal and the Netherlands has been shifted from 1:00pm (1000 GMT) on November 21 to 7:00pm start.
FIFA said tickets for the affected matches  “will remain valid irrespective of the new date/time.”
It added:  “In addition, FIFA will seek to address any issues arising from this change in a case-by-case basis.”
Qatari organisers, who have spent billions of dollars preparing for the event since winning hosting rights in 2010, welcomed FIFA’s gesture for their  “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to host the event.
“The impact of this decision on fans was assessed by FIFA. We will work together to ensure a smooth tournament for the supporters affected by the change,” organisers added in a statement, without giving details.
Some Ecuador fans may have to change flights to arrive in Qatar earlier and football sources said the date switch could force changes to World Cup commercial contracts.
Ricardo Fort, a sports industry consultant and former head of sports marketing for Coca Cola — a major FIFA backer — said the date change would be  “a huge problem for sponsors”.
“They invited and confirmed hospitality guests, booked flights and hotels, and contracted with all the necessary logistics. Imagine changing it all!” Fort wrote on Twitter.
But some companies linked to the tournament, the first World Cup in an Arab country, expressed confidence that any disruption would be overcome.
“It is something we will deal with,” said Jaime Byrom, chairman of Match Hospitality, which has a contract with FIFA to organise hospitality packages for World Cup matches and has locked in 450,000 tickets for the tournament.
“It is really not — compared to the other challenges that we could have faced or have faced in the past — a particularly large problem.
“In this case we will be looking at our Ecuadorian customers who are travelling from overseas, and making sure that they are on time for the match.”
Official countdown clocks for the event were quickly changed and 100-day events were hastily moved from Saturday to Friday.
FIFA has already made significant accommodations to Qatar, moving the tournament to the winter months for the first time to avoid Qatar’s searing heat.
The massive preparations have also put the spotlight on Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers and rights for LGBTQ visitors. Homosexuality is illegal, while alcohol is severely restricted in the Muslim state.
However, Infantino has insisted it will be the  “best-ever” World Cup.

The matches will take place under floodlights at Kensington Oval in Barbados on August 17, 19 and 21.
The three games are the West Indies’ last remaining three fixtures in the Super League which will decide automatic qualifying spots for the 2023 World Cup in India.
Only the top seven sides along with hosts India qualify automatically with those outside having to go through a qualifying competition.
Sinclair made his international debut in T20I cricket last year against Sri Lanka and has so far played six games in the shortest format.
Left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie has also been named in the squad but will have to undergo a fitness assessment on a finger injury sustained against India last month.
All-rounder Roston Chase is unavailable due to injury while fellow all-rounder Fabien Allen is out due to personal reasons.
Squad: Nicholas Pooran (captain), Shai Hope, Shamarh Brooks, Keacy Carty, Shimron Hetmyer, Jason Holder, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Brandon King, Kyle Mayers, Gudakesh Motie, Keemo Paul, Jayden Seales, Kevin Sinclair.

The Indian conglomerate also owns Pollard’s Indian Premier League (IPL) team Mumbai Indians and the Cape Town-based franchise in an upcoming Twenty20 league in South Africa.
Pollard is one of the four West Indies players, including white-ball captain Nicholas Pooran and veteran Dwayne Bravo, to join MI Emirates for the six-team tournament beginning in January next year.
Bravo and Pooran have played for Mumbai Indians in the past.
Former Mumbai Indians player Boult is among the 14 overseas players directly signed by the franchise.
The left-arm seamer gave up his central contract with New Zealand Cricket on Wednesday to spend more time with his family and focus on playing Twenty20 leagues.
Veteran South Africa spinner Imran Tahir, Englishman Samit Patel and a trio of Afghan players including middle-order batter Najibullah Zadran have also joined the franchise.
Teams can field up to nine foreigners in their playing XI. 
“...local players from UAE will be added to the squad in the near future,” the franchise said.

7,Tottenham’s Premier League title credentials face Chelsea test,MANCHESTER: Tottenham lived up to pre-season hype they could challenge for the Premier League title by going top of...,"MANCHESTER: Tottenham lived up to pre-season hype they could challenge for the Premier League title by going top of the table on the opening weekend of the season, but face a truer test of their credentials away to Chelsea on Sunday.
Antonio Conte has been heavily backed in his first full season as Spurs boss with the signings of Richarlison, Yves Bissouma, Ivan Perisic, Djed Spence, Clement Lenglet and Fraser Forster in the transfer window.
But none of the six new faces started in an impressive 4-1 win over Southampton to underline the strength in depth now on offer to Conte.
Spurs, though, have only won once in the league at Stamford Bridge in 32 years and beating the Blues would send an early season statement of intent that they can bridge the gap to Manchester City and Liverpool.
Chelsea also got off to a winning start in less flamboyant fashion as they needed a Jorginho penalty to see off Everton 1-0.
Thomas Tuchel has demanded an improvement this weekend, but believes Chelsea will get better as the season goes on after a turbulent 2022 that saw the club suffer sanctions before Todd Boehly’s consortium took control from Roman Abramovich.
The American has not held back in backing Tuchel with the signings of Raheem Sterling, Kalidou Koulibaly, Marc Cucurella and Carney Chukwuemeka.
And Sterling believes Chelsea are also on the up as he outlined his reasoning for leaving Manchester City on Thursday.
“You look at Chelsea in the last couple of years, it’s four or five finals that they’ve been in,” said the England International.
“It’s a team that shows that they are competing and they’re only going to get better. So with the new ownership and the takeover it made a lot of sense.” Former England team-mates Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard go head-to-head on the touchline for the first time on Saturday as Aston Villa host Everton with both seeking their first points of the season.
Gerrard’s decision to strip Tyrone Mings of the Villa captaincy and drop the England international for a desperately disappointing 2-0 defeat to promoted Bournemouth on Saturday has upped the pressure on the former Liverpool captain.
Expectations were high for Villa in Gerrard’s first full season after Diego Carlos and Boubacar Kamara turned their backs on Champions League football with Sevilla 
and Marseille respectively to sign over the summer.
But Gerrard’s men have won just two of their last 12 Premier League games dating back to last season and those were against relegated Norwich and Burnley.
Everton only narrowly avoided the drop last season and another difficult campaign lies ahead with Richarlison sold to Spurs and England striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin out injured for the first six weeks of the season.
Despite the Toffees struggles to comply with financial fair play, Lampard has been given the resources to bring in Belgian midfielder Amadou Onana from Lille and Conor Coady on loan from Wolves this week.
“He’s one of the greatest English players of all time, one of the greatest midfielders of all time. It’s probably one of the best phone calls I’ve ever had,” said Coady on the conversation with Lampard that convinced him to sign.
Manchester United had arguably the worst opening weekend of all as Brighton won for the first time at Old Trafford to burst any bubble of optimism for a fresh start under Erik ten Hag.
The Dutch coach’s decision to start Christian Eriksen in an unfamiliar role as a false nine has been criticised after the Dane shone once he was restored to his normal midfield role in the second-half.
Ten Hag is badly in need of a response at Brentford this weekend and has a big decision to make on whether to recall Cristiano Ronaldo to the starting line-up.
The five-time Ballon d’Or winner started on the bench against Brighton due to a lack of pre-season training as he looks for an exit to join a Champions League club before the end of the transfer window.
Fixtures (all times GMT):
Saturday: Aston Villa v Everton (1130), Brighton v Newcastle, Manchester City v Bournemouth, Southampton v Leeds, Wolves v Fulham, Arsenal v Leicester (all 1400), Brentford v Manchester United (1630) 
Sunday: Nottingham Forest v West Ham (1300), Chelsea v Tottenham (1530)

“Massive thanks to everyone who had an input in my career over the years & after long hard conversations I’ve finally decided to walk away & on my 34th birthday I say Bon voyage,” Fury posted on Twitter.
The announcement has been greeted with scepticism as Fury has previously stated his intention to retire only to return to the ring.
He was expected to fight the winner of Oleksandr Usyk’s rematch with Anthony Joshua on August 20 for the chance to unify the world heavyweight titles.
As recently as Tuesday, Fury suggested his most recent spell in retirement was over in order to set up a trilogy fight against Derek Chisora and even claimed to have appointed a new trainer in Isaac Lowe.
However, he has now announced the intention to retire undefeated with a record of 32 wins and one draw from 33 bouts.
Fury went onto thank his wife, promoter Frank Warren and a series of other training partners and television companies who have bought rights to his fights over the years.
The Brit stated ahead of his win over Dillian Whyte in March that he would retire after that fight as he has  “150 million in the bank and nothing to prove.” However, earlier this week, Warren had cast doubt on the suggestion Fury will not fight again.
“I think what’s going to happen is, see what happens on 20 (August) and the outcome of that, and that’ll determine what he intends to do in the future,” Warren told talkSPORT.
“I think he will (return), because he’s a fighting man and he misses it. That’s what he does, he wants to fight.”

The European body of European football said that a jury made up of journalists and representatives of clubs playing in European competitions voted for the trio from a list of 15.
Polish striker Robert Lewandowski was fourth on the ballot and just missed out.
The award will be presented on Aug 25 during the draw for the Champions League group stage.
Real won the Spanish Liga and the Champions League.
Benzema was named Champions League Player of the Season after scoring 15 goals in the competition, including three in Real’s semi-final victory over Manchester City.
When he scored Real’s second goal against Frankfurt on Wednesday in the European Supercup, Benzema became the club’s second-highest scorer in history with 324 goals, behind Cristiano Ronaldo.
Courtois was spectacular as Real edged Liverpool 1-0 in the final and was named player of the match.
De Bruyne made the shortlist for the third straight year after inspiring City to the Premier League title.
Jorginho won the title last year after winning the Champions League with Chelsea and the delayed Euro 2020 with Italy.
UEFA also announced the three nominees for coach of the year which includes Real Madrid’s Carlo Ancelotti, Man City’s Josep Guardiola and the man they had to beat to win their biggest title last season: Liverpool’s Juergen Klopp.

The South American ranked 24th in the world beat her third top-10 opponent this season, but notched her first career win over a world number one as she clawed out the victory in three hours. 
Haddad Maia, who won titles at Nottingham and Birmingham in June, became the first Brazilian to reach the quarters at a WTA 1000 tournament. 
Swiatek, whose six titles this season include the French Open, missed her chance at a 50th match win this year in the setback that comes two weeks before the start of the US Open.
Haddad Maia, 26, will next meet Olympic champion Belinda Bencic, who converted all four of her breakpoint chances against two-time major winner Garbine Muguruza of Spain to complete a 6-1, 6-3 win in a late match. 
Muguruza also had four opportunities on Bencic’s delivery but the Swiss, who won the 2015 tournament, saved them all to seal her spot in the last eight of the US Open tune-up event.
In other third-round action, Coco Gauff survived 15 double-faults to squeeze out a 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) win over Aryna Sabalenka. 
The American teenager will next face two-time Grand Slam winner Simona Halep after the former number one from Romania defeated Switzerland’s Jil Teichmann 6-2, 7-5 in 91 minutes. 
Seventh-seeded American Jessica Pegula advanced, beating defending champion Camila Giorgi of Italy 3-6, 6-0, 7-5.

At the ATP Montreal Masters on Thursday, Australian Nick Kyrgios produced another extraordinary performance to demolish compatriot Alex de Minaur 6-2, 6-3 to reach the quarter-finals, a day after stunning world number one Daniil Medvedev. 
The fiery Wimbledon finalist has been playing the best tennis of his career and is showing no signs of slowing down in Montreal, where he next faces Poland’s Hubert Hurkacz, who edged Spaniard Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-7(6-8), 6-2, 7-6 (7-3). 
Casper Ruud kept his title hopes alive as he duelled for more than three hours to overcome Roberto Bautista Agut 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (7-4), 6-4. 
The Norwegian, who at fourth is the highest seed still standing, will play Canadian sixth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime, who harnessed his mighty serve to down Briton Cameron Norrie 6-3 6-4 to delight his home crowd. 
Briton Daniel Evans fought back from a disastrous second set to overcome American Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-5) 1-6 7-5, producing a remarkable defence as he fended off a dozen break points, to book a meeting with American Tommy Paul, who beat Marin Cilic 6-4, 6-2. 
Unseeded Briton Jack Draper advanced, moving through when French veteran Gael Monfils retired with an injury while trailing 6-2, 0-2.

Afghanistan captain Mohammad Nabi chose to bat first after winning the toss, but the tourists left themselves too much to do with the ball after posting just 122-8 from their 20 overs.

However, the loss of three wickets for 14 runs gave Afgha­nistan hope until Dockrell’s 19-ball cameo got Ireland over the line with an over to spare.

The agreement comes after the club signed a deal with digital fan token firm Socios.com to sell off 25 per cent of their stake in Barca Studios last month.
“With this investment the strategic partners in Barca Studios show confidence in the value of the project and the future of digital content in the world of sport,” the club said in a statement.
Barca have been using several mechanisms to increase their revenue in order to offset losses, reduce debt and fulfil La Liga’s financial fair play rules.
The deals follow the club’s sale last month of a further 15 per cent stake in their La Liga TV rights to US private equity group Sixth Street, giving Sixth Street a 25 per cent stake.
Barca signed Brazil winger Raphinha from Leeds United and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich following a first investment from Sixth Street when it bought 10 per cent.
The club have also signed the likes of Jules Kounde, Franck Kessie and Andreas Christensen among others, with Spanish media reporting that more could follow.
Barca need to meet La Liga’s salary cap to register their new signings and the new investment deals as well as the potential sale of Dutch midfielder Frenkie de Jong could get them the green light from the league.
Club chief Joan Laporta, who presided over one of Barca’s most successful periods between 2003 and 2010, said in August 2021 that their debts totalled 1.35 billion euros, with 673 million owed to banks.
In June, Barca approved the sale of a minority share of their licensing and merchandising division and the cession of up to 25 per cent of their income from La Liga TV rights.
The club also signed a shirt and stadium sponsorship deal with Spotify in an agreement worth 280 million euros and approved financial plans in December to renovate Camp Nou, including raising an additional 1.5 billion euros in debt.
Xavi Hernandez’s side will begin their La Liga campaign at home to Rayo Vallecano on Saturday.

Belgium international Lukaku scored 24 goals to help Inter win their first title in 11 years in the 2020-21 season before joining Chelsea. He has returned to Italy on loan after a disappointing spell at the Premier League side. 
Pogba, who played a key role in France’s 2018 World Cup win, has returned to Juventus on a free transfer from Manchester United. He won four straight titles during his previous stint with Juve. 
Pogba has been sidelined with a torn meniscus ahead of the season but Italian media reported that he has opted not to undergo surgery and could be back playing by mid-September. 
AC Milan followed in the footsteps of Inter by clinching their first title in 11 years last season but the bookmakers have them behind both their local rivals and a revamped Juve. 
Stefano Pioli’s side kick off the new season against Udinese at the San Siro on Saturday as teams gear up for a 15-match sprint between now and the World Cup in Qatar. 
Milan have lost Franck Kessie to Barcelona but brought in free-agent striker Divock Origi and spent 35 million euros ($36 million) on promising but unproven forward Charles De Ketelaere. 
There has been some worry among Milan fans over the low-key nature of their team’s transfer moves, as well as the fact that the club didn’t renew the contracts of directors Paolo Maldini and Frederic Massara — the architects of Milan’s recent revival — until the last minute. 
Supporters are waiting for the American investment fund RedBird’s purchase of the club to go through, with the closing of the 1.2 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) deal with current owners Elliott due to be completed in late August or early September. 
While welcoming a familiar face in Pogba, Juventus have bid farewell to several players — including Giorgio Chiellini and fellow defender Matthijs de Ligt — to make room for Massimiliano Allegri’s rebuild. 
The manager has been keen to downplay his side’s chances, saying their rivals “have strengthened a lot”. 
“I think Inter, Milan and Roma are much stronger than last year. Winning will be more difficult, you will have to work very well,” Allegri told reporters. 
After a second successive fourth-placed finish, Juve have been busy in the transfer market, signing forward Angel Di Maria and Torino defender Gleison Bremer. 
Roma’s Europa Conference League win — their first major European title in more than six decades and their first trophy in 14 years — and the signing of striker Paulo Dybala from Juve make them dark horses for the title. 
Jose Mourinho will try to lead Roma to their first Scudetto in more than 20 years. 
Venezia had earned promotion to the top flight after a 19-year absence but were sent straight back down again last season, a fate the could await AC Monza, Cremonese and US Lecce. 
Monza, however, are not just planning to survive. 
After taking their transfer spending in the close season to more than 21 million euros ($21.31 million) the Serie A new boys are targeting a place in the top half. 
Former AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi bought Monza for a bargain when they were in the third tier in 2018, three years after the club’s bankruptcy. 
The former Italian prime minister has brought cash, contacts and former Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani in the hope that the club will eventually compete in Europe.

Saturday: AC Milan v Udinese, Sampdoria v Atalanta (both 1730), Lecce v Inter, Monza v Torino (both 1945).
