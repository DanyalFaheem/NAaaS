1,Assad’s opponents rage against Turkish call for ‘reconciliation’ with Syria,"“If Turkiye wants to stand with the world that is already against us, let it be, it won’t change much,” says a protester.","BEIRUT: Thousands of people staged protests across parts of rebel-held northern Syria on Friday after the Turkish foreign minister called for reconciliation between Syrian opposition groups backed by Ankara and the government of Syrian President Bashar al Assad.
More than 11 years after civil war broke out in Syria, the north-western region, near the Turkish border, is the last area still in the hands of fighters seeking to topple Assad, with control divided between jihadist factions and other rebels backed by Turkiye.
The Turkish government maintains thousands of troops in the area and backs a coalition of armed groups opposed to Assad under the banner of the Syrian National Army (SNA).
“We need to bring the opposition and regime together for reconciliation somehow, there will be no permanent peace otherwise,” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters in Ankara on Thursday.
After he spoke, protests began in parts of rebel-held Syria, with people carrying opposition flags through the streets on Thursday evening and pulling Turkish flags from police stations and administration offices.
“We have suffered under this criminal for 11 years and we will continue with our revolution,” Mahmoud Salo, a 45-year-old teacher, said at a protest in Azaz, Idlib.
Around 3,000 people gathered in Azaz on Friday while protests were also held in other parts of the north-western Idlib province and in northern parts of neighbouring Aleppo province.
Many Turkish advisers who work at a number of local institutions did not show up for work on Friday.
Ahmad Shawbak, a refugee from Aleppo working as an engineer in Azaz, said Cavusoglu’s comments were unacceptable.
“If Turkiye wants to stand with the world that is already against us, let it be, it won’t change much,” Shawbak said.  “But we hope that Turkiye’s stance becomes more positive.”
Israeli shelling 
Israeli shelling wounded two civilians in southern Syria’s Quneitra province near the occupied Golan Heights on Friday.
“Two civilians were wounded when a tank belonging to the Israeli occupation forces fired two shells near the village of Hamidiya,” Sana news agency said.
There was no immediate official reaction from Israel.
An army spokesman said: “We do not comment on reports in the foreign media.” 
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed the attack, adding that the two people, whom it did not identify, were in an area bordering the Israeli-occupied Golan.
Groups linked to Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement — a Damascus ally and sworn enemy of Israel — are active in the area, according to the war monitor.

2,Drought declared in parts of England,"LONDON: The UK government on Friday officially declared a drought in several parts of England, following months of...","LONDON: The UK government on Friday officially declared a drought in several parts of England, following months of record low rainfall and unprecedented temperatures in recent weeks.
At a meeting of the National Drought Group, the government’s Envir­onment Agency said the “drought trigger threshold had been met” in parts of southwestern, southern, central and eastern England.
Drought was last officially declared in England in 2018.
The Environment Agency on Friday published a report saying that England as a whole had its driest July since 1935.
The exceptional weather comes as France is also experiencing a record drought and battling huge wildfires.
The Met Office, the UK’s meteorological authority, said the period from January to June this year saw the least rainfall in England and Wales since 1976.
That summer saw the use of drastic measures such as roadside standpipes and water rationing.
The government statement said the move to drought status was based on factors such as rainfall, river flows and levels of groundwater and reservoirs and their impact on public water supply.
“We urge everyone to manage the amount of water they are using in this exceptionally dry period,” National Drought Group chair, Harvey Bradshaw, was quoted as saying.
The Environment Agency and water companies “will step up their actions to manage impacts” and press ahead with their published drought plans, including things like hosepipe bans.
It stressed that “essential supplies of water are safe”. 
The Met Office on Tuesday issued an amber warning over “extreme heat” in parts of England and Wales on Thursday to Sunday, predicting possible impacts on health, transport and infrastructure.
Temperatures were expected to hit the mid-30s Celsius, peaking on Friday and the weekend, after which showers and thunderstorms were forecast.
Temperatures were not expected to hit the record levels seen in July when a temperature of 40.3 Celsius was recorded in Lincolnshire in northeastern England on July 20, during an unprecedented heatwave.

3,NY man indicted for stalking Iranian journalist,NEW YORK: A New York man was indicted on Friday over charges he possessed a loaded AK-47 rifle outside the home of ...,"NEW YORK: A New York man was indicted on Friday over charges he possessed a loaded AK-47 rifle outside the home of an Iranian-American journalist and rights activist.
The defendant, Khalid Mehdiyev, spent two days late last month outside the Brooklyn home of journalist Masih Alinejad, and once tried opening the door, an FBI agent wrote in a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court.
Alinejad has been a critic of Iran’s headcovering laws and has promoted videos of women violating the laws to her millions of social media followers. Last year she was the target of what US prosecutors called a Tehran-backed kidnapping plot.
Mehdiyev was indicted on Thursday for possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Prosecutors are also seeking to have Mehdiyev forfeit the gun and the ammunition.
Last year, prosecutors charged four Iranians they alleged to have been intelligence operatives with plotting to kidnap Alinejad. Tehran has dismissed allegations of government involvement as  “baseless”.

The 40-kilometre active fire front in the Gironde and Landes regions around Bordeaux “has not developed, but the weather conditions are pushing us towards extreme vigilance”, an official told reporters.
Temperatures stood at 39 degrees Celsius in the fire zone, just like the day before.
No new evacuations had been ordered on top of the 10,000 people already asked to leave.
But “temperatures continue to rise and the water table keeps falling”, he said.
Germany, Poland, Austria and Romania have pledged reinforcements totalling 361 firefighters to join the roughly 1,100 French ones on the ground, along with several water-bombing planes from the European Union fleet.
‘Helping you guys’ 
Many of the newcomers went into action on Friday.
“It doesn’t matter which country we’re in, we’re firefighters, we are able to help people around the world,” said Cristian Buhaianu, who commands a 77-strong firefighting contingent from Romania.
At the Merignac air base, near the south-western city of Bordeaux, where Canadair planes and other firefighting aircraft are stationed, a Greek pilot said scenes of devastation like the ones seen in France were commonplace in his country.
“We see this every year in Greece, and right now we see this in France,” the pilot, 36-year-old Anastasis Sariouglou, said. “We have the feeling of helping you guys and it’s nice.”

5,Dutchman arrested over links to crypto ‘launderer’,"THE HAGUE: Dutch investigators said on Friday they had arrested a suspected developer for Tornado Cash, a crypto...","THE HAGUE: Dutch investigators said on Friday they had arrested a suspected developer for Tornado Cash, a crypto currency service sanctioned by Washington for allegedly laundering funds stolen by North Korean hackers.
The 29-year-old was arrested in Amsterdam on Wednesday and was due to appear before an investigating judge on Friday, the Dutch financial and fiscal crime investigation service (FIOD) said.
“We suspect a developer... of Tornado Cash of involvement in concealment and laundering of large-scale criminal money flows by mixing crypto currencies,” FIOD said on Twitter.
“Multiple arrests are not ruled out.” 
The Dutch agency said it had been investigating Tornado Cash since June on suspicion of laundering at least $1 billion worth of criminally-obtained cryptocurrency, on a total turnover of $7 billion, it said.
“These included funds stolen through hacks by a group believed to be associated with North Korea,” it said.
The people behind the service had made “large-scale profits” from these transactions, it said.
Tornado Cash is one of the leading mixers, also known as tumblers, which help people hide the movements of their crypto currencies like bitcoin and ethereum by blending them with the transfers by other users.
The US Treasury slapped sanctions on Tornado cash on Monday.

6,Five Chinese companies to part ways with NY stock exchange,Companies say they will apply to delist their American Depository Shares this month.,"SHANGHAI: Five Chinese state-owned companies, including oil giant Sinopec and China Life Insurance, said on Friday they would delist from the New York Stock Exchange, amid economic and diplomatic tensions with the United States.
The companies, which also include Aluminium Corporation of China (Chalco), PetroChina and Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co, each said that they would apply to delist their American Depository Shares this month.
The five, which in May were flagged by the US securities regulator as failing to meet its auditing standards, will keep their listings in Hong Kong and mainland Chinese markets.
Beijing and Washington are in talks to resolve a long-running audit dispute that could see Chinese companies banned from US exchanges if they do not comply with US rules.
Washington has long demanded complete access to the books of US-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing bars foreign inspection of audit documents from local accounting firms, citing national security concerns.
There was no mention of the auditing dispute in separate statements by the Chinese companies outlining their moves, which come amid heightened tensions after last week’s visit to Taiwan by US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“These companies have strictly complied with the rules and regulatory requirements of the US capital market since their listing in the US and made the delisting choice for their own business considerations,” the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in a statement.
The agency added that it would keep “communication open with relevant overseas regulatory agencies”.  
The oversight row, which has been simmering for more than a decade, came to a head in December when the US securities regulator finalised rules to potentially prohibit trading in Chinese companies under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. It said 273 companies were at risk.
Some of China’s largest companies, including Alibaba Group Holdings, J.D Com Inc and Baidu Inc, are among them. Alibaba said last week it would convert its Hong Kong secondary listing into a dual primary listing.
Analysts said this could ease the way for the Chinese ecommerce giant to switch primary listing venues in the future.
In pre-market trading on Friday, US-listed shares of China Life Insurance and oil giant Sinopec fell 5.7 percent about 4.3 percent respectively. 
Patience wearing thin 
Market-watchers were split over what the delistings might mean for the audit deal, with some saying it was a bad sign.
“China is sending a message that its patience is wearing thin in the audit talks,” said Kai Zhan, senior counsel at Chinese law firm Yuanda, who specialises in US capital markets.
The companies said their US traded share volume was small compared with those on their other major listing venues.
PetroChina said it had never raised follow-on capital from its USlisting and its Hong Kong and Shanghai bases  “can satisfy the company’s fundraising requirements” as well as providing “better protection of the interests of the investors”.  
Global fund managers holding US-listed Chinese stocks are steadily shifting towards their Hong Kong-traded peers, even as they remain hopeful the audit dispute will eventually be resolved.

7,Collapsed tunnel traps suspected bank robber near Vatican,"Firefighters spent eight hours digging him out from under a road in the west of Rome, before he was finally freed.","ROME: An Italian man had to be rescued after becoming trapped in a collapsed tunnel near the Vatican, suspected of being part of a gang burrowing its way to a nearby bank, police said on Friday.
Firefighters spent eight hours digging him out from under a road in the west of Rome, before he was finally freed on Thursday evening and taken to hospital.
“Two people from Naples were arrested for resisting a public official and two, from Rome, for damage” to public property, a police spokesman said.
The rescued man, one of the two Romans, remains in hospital, he said.
“We are still investigating, we do not exclude that they are thieves, it is one of the theories,” he said.
For Italian newspapers, however, the motive was clear, noting the tunnel was found near a bank ahead of the Aug 15 long weekend, when residents traditionally head out of town and much of Rome becomes empty.
“The hole gang,” headlined the Corriere della Sera daily, while La Stampa said: “They dig a tunnel to rob a bank, and one of them is buried underground.” 
An eyewitness said he had seen the man brought out alive on a stretcher, after a day-long operation involving dozens of emergency service workers using mechanical diggers.
The tunnel began underneath an empty shop that had recently been rented.
“We all thought that the people there were renovating the place. So, we had no suspicion and we did not hear noises either,” a resident, Michele, who lives in the same building, said.

8,"FBI removed ‘top secret’ papers from Trump’s home, says Justice Department","Says it has probable cause to believe that Trump violated Espionage Act; Trump terms search for nuclear papers ""hoax"".","WASHINGTON: Agents who searched former US president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida this week removed 11 sets of classified documents,  including some marked as top secret, the Justice Department said on Friday while disclosing it has probable cause to believe he violated the Espionage Act.
The bombshell disclosures were made in legal documents released four days after FBI agents carried out the search of Trump’s residence based on a warrant approved by a federal magistrate judge.
The Justice Department told judge Bruce Reinhart in its warrant application that it had probable cause to believe that Trump violated the Espionage Act, a federal law that prohibits the possession or transmission of national defence information.
Agents belonging to the Federal Bureau of Investigations took more than 30 items, including more than 20 boxes, binders of photos, a handwritten note and the executive grant of clemency for Trump’s ally and longtime adviser Roger Stone, a list of items removed from the property showed. Also included in the list was information about the  “President of France.”   

Trump terms search for nuclear papers ‘hoax’

“Top secret” is the highest level of classification, reserved for the country’s most closely held national security information. It is usually kept in special government facilities because its disclosure could cause grave damage to national security.
Numerous federal laws prohibit the mishandling of classified material, including the Espionage Act as well as another statute that prohibits the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material. Trump increased the penalties for this while he was in office, making it a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.
Earlier on Friday, Trump denied a Washington Post report that the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home was for possible classified materials related to nuclear weapons, writing on his social media account that the “nuclear weapons issue is a hoax”.  
Attorney General Merrick Garland has declined to publicly detail the nature of the investigation.
Monday’s search of Trump’s home marked a significant escalation in one of the many federal and state investigations he is facing from his time in office and in private business, including a separate one by the Justice Department into a failed bid by Donald Trump’s allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election by submitting phony slates of electors.
Garland on Thursday announced that the department had asked Reinhart to unseal the warrant that authorised the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago. This followed a claim by Trump that the search was political retribution and a suggestion by him, without evidence, that the FBI may have planted evidence against him.
Trump’s attorneys on Friday afternoon signalled they will not object to having the search warrant for his Florida residence unsealed to the public, the Justice Department said in a court filing, indicating the unsealing could come shortly.
