0,Cost of Islamabad's delayed slaughterhouse project to increase by over Rs1 billion,Sources say revised PC-I will be made in accordance with rates of 2021.,"ISLAMABAD: The proposed and much delayed slaughterhouse project will likely see an increase in price by over Rs1 billion as Capital Development Authority (CDA) failed to execute it.
As a result, butchers have been slaughtering animals in their houses or in open spaces without any certification.
Sources said according to the PC-I, the worth of the project was Rs1.9 billion, in accordance with rates of 2014. However, now, in the revised PC-I, scheduled rates of 2021 will be mentioned, which means that the cost of the project will cross Rs3 billion. During a meeting, the consultant of the project, National Engineering Services Pakistan (Nespak), was directed to finalise the revised PC-I within a week’s time as CDA will have to submit a report to the court in this regard.

Sources say revised PC-I will be made in accordance with rates of 2021

It is relevant to note here that this project has been discussed a lot in the past decade but practical work is yet to begin. Last year, CDA allocated funds for construction of the slaughterhouse in I-11/4 but the federal government decided that the project would be executed under public-private partnership (PPP) mode. After the bidding process, Nespak was hired as a consultant, which is preparing a business model for it.
CDA Director (Works) Tahir Mahmood told Dawn that consultant has been directed to finalise the revised PC-I in a week as CDA is required to submit a report in court. He said that the earlier PC-I was based on rates of 2014 and the revised one will be made on the basis of rates of 2021. CDA wants to start this project as soon as possible, he said.
Around a decade ago, the CDA had decided to build a state-of-the-art slaughterhouse but could not make any headway on it except changing the proposed location thrice. Finally, a 5-acre plot was allotted in I-11/4 where the proposed slaughterhouse will be set up. Many issues emerged as earlier it was a project of CDA, but after formation of the local government in 2015-16, the project was given to Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI). Last year, the project was given back to the CDA which got it approved from the Development Working Party. 
Now, CDA is planning to execute it through its own funding. Last year, during a meeting, it revealed that the total area of the slaughterhouse was 8,000 square feet and the indoor area would process initially more than 15,000 animals per week. As many as 2,000 goats and 800 cows would be slaughtered at the premises per day.
Major components of the premises include a freezing room, cold storage, deboning area, packing room, dispatch area, area for keeping animals, checking and inspection portion, chilling rooms, administrative rooms, parking, tubewell and waste treatment areas. Participants of the meeting were also informed that facilities like grazing areas, provision of water and other allied facilities for the animals would also be provided. 
When contacted, All-Pakistan Jamiatul Quresh Meat Welfare Association President Khurshid Qureshi said that CDA is not sincere with this project. He said that initially a decade ago, the cost of the project was around Rs500 million, but CDA failed to execute it. “Once again, we are requesting CDA to pay heed towards this project in the greater interest of residents of Islamabad,” he added.

5,Rakhi festival celebrated after two years,"TAXILA: Like other parts of the world, the followers of Hinduism and Sikhism celebrated the Rakhi festival with ...","TAXILA: Like other parts of the world, the followers of Hinduism and Sikhism celebrated the Rakhi festival with great fervour and traditional zeal at Gurdwara Punja Sahib on Friday.
The festival to mark the love bond between brothers and sisters was celebrated in Hassanabdal after a gap of around two years due to the Covid-19 epidemic. The event was attended by a large number of pilgrims from across the country.
Girls tied Rakhi with prayers for their brothers’ long and healthy lives. Attired in colourful and glittering garbs, the girls and boys from the communities turned up at the temple holding wristbands (Rakhis) to tie them in the wrists of their brothers. They also take part in a function called ‘Arti Utarna’, which is a good wish for brothers.
“Our brothers promise to protect us on this festival every year,” a resident of Chaklala in Rawalpindi, Tara Prasad said, as she sat with her brother Vinod Kumar.
“Every year, scores of Hindu and Sikh devotees, especially from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and rural Sindh, participate in the event held at the Punja Sahib in Hassanabdal,” he said.
Due to floods, he said, the number of Hindu devotees from rural Sindh remained thin this year.
Inder Singh, a senior Sikh leader, said while tying the Rakhi on the right wrist, the following mantra is recited: “I am tying a Rakhi on you, like the one on mighty demon king Bali.”
In the Raksha Bandhan ritual, a sister ties a ‘sacred’ thread around her brother’s wrist, symbolically expressing her love for him and seeking his protection in return, according to a senior Hindu devotee, Priya Kumari, who came from Kohat, to celebrate the festival with her sons, daughters and grandchildren.
Sardar Satwant Singh, a Sikh community leader, said the origin of the festival was unknown though mythology was replete with stories that talked about the celebration.
“When a sister ties a thread around a brother’s wrist, he will not forget the meaning of the bond and will be looking after her for the rest of his life,” said Dr Rani Devi from Peer Baba town of Buner district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
She said when the ritual starts, a sister steps forwards and applies tilak on the forehead of her brother and then performs arti and finally ties a thread on his wrist. Following this, the brother gives some gift or money to please his sister. If a brother has more than one sister, all sisters tie a thread on his wrist.

The minister was summoned by the court to appear in person before it in Mirpur for explanation of his conduct in the wake of his phone call to the chief justice wherein he had requested the latter to convene a meeting of the secretaries (general) of all political parties on the issue of local bodies (LB) elections.
According to the court order, the phone call was made by the minister’s personal assistant who placed the chief justice on hold before putting him through to the minister.
In compliance with court notice, Mr Rabbani who was accompanied by Advocate Khawaja Maqbool War submitted a written explanation to the full court bench, wherein he blamed his personal assistant for the “misstep” who he said had been placed under suspension.
However, the court rebuked the minister over the explanation saying it “ran counter to his deeds and actions.”
“You are not conversant with the affairs of your ministry […] You seem to be under political pressure and playing into the hands of others. Why should we not send you back without a flag-bearing car,” the CJ said while addressing the minister, adding: “You should show seriousness and sobriety.”
In response to a query by Justice Raza Ali Khan, Mr Rabbani said he wanted the CJ to hold a meeting with the secretaries of political parties in connection with the local bodies’ elections. When the judge further questioned him about what the apex court had to do with the LB polls, the minister appeared to be at a loss of words.
However, the bench asked him to tender his apology in black and white within one week.
The bench also directed him to withdraw the suspension order of his personal assistant and submit the compliance in this regard in the office of the registrar.
The bench said it would take up this case at the principal seat in Muzaffarabad after the summer vacations.
