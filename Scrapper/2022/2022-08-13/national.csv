0,Shahbaz Gill claims ‘compelled’ to testify against Imran,Tells court investigators have focused  their interrogation on frequency of his meetings with Lt Gen Faiz Hameed.,"ISLAMABAD: PTI leader Dr Shahbaz Gill on Friday told a court in the capital that investigators had focused their interrogation on the frequency of his meetings with Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, and “compelled him to testify against party chairman Imran Khan” in connection with his controversial statement about the army.   
Judicial Magistrate Omar Shabbir, after hearing arguments from both sides, rejected Kohsar police’s plea to extend Mr Gill’s phy­sical remand for further investigation, and sent him to the judicial lock-up of Adiala Jail.  
In a related development, Judicial Magistrate Salman Badar granted post-arrest bail to the spouse of Mr Gill’s driver.  
Unlike previous hearings, PTI workers and some leaders, including Fawad Chau­dhry, Ali Nawaz Awan and Kanwal Shau­zab, were on the court premises to cheer up the party chairman’s chief of staff.  

Court rejects police plea for physical remand; driver’s spouse gets bail

Advocate General for Islamabad Barrister Jahangir Khan Jadoon had argued that Mr Gill’s physical custody was required for recovery of mobile phones, voice matching and conducting polygraph test to ascertain whether the suspect is telling the truth or otherwise. Defence counsel Faisal Hussain and Advocate Ali Bukhari objected to advocate general’s presence, saying this shows the government was keen to keep their client behind bars.  
Mr Gill told the court that he had been subjected to torture and accused the police of asking “irrelevant” questions. He said investigators were even interested in Imran Khan’s diet plan. 
As regards his objectionable remarks, Mr Gill said his statement had been taken out of context, adding that he “respects army and never intended to ridicule” the institution. 
The prosecutor said police had planned to conduct Mr Gill’s polygraph test at the Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory which would require four to five days. 
He said some other suspects were to be arrested and for this purpose police needed Mr Gill’s custody for 12 days.  
Later, the prosecution filed an appeal before Additional District and Sessions Judge Mohammad Adnan against the rejection of plea seeking extension of Mr Gill’s physical remand. 
However, after hearing the arguments, the ADSJ dismissed the plea.
Separately, Judicial Magistrate Salman Badar granted post-arrest bail to the wife of Mr Gill’s driver. The court accepted the bail plea against surety bonds worth Rs30,000.  
Moreover, PTI’s legal team filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court, seeking to quash the FIR registered against Mr Gill as well as the administration of private television channel ARY News in connection with airing of his statement. 
The petition referred to the judgements of superior courts that ruled as illegal the registration of more than one FIR in a single incident and requested the high court to quash the FIR registered with the Memon Goth Police Station, Karachi.  
Meanwhile, the PTI chairman condemned the alleged torture of Mr Gill and the arrest of the head of ARY News, asking the judiciary to take notice of “violations of all laws with impunity” by the present regime. “Strongly condemn the torture being inflicted on Shahbaz Gill. Under what law & under who’s orders is this being done? If he [Gill] broke any law then he should be given a fair hearing. But just to salvage Imported government of crooks the Constitution & all laws are being violated with impunity,” he tweeted.  

 





 
PTI’s senior vice president Dr Shireen Mazari in a statement urged the UN Human Rights Council to take notice of this “inhuman act”.  
Another senior PTI leader, Asad Umar, tweeted: “Hearing that after judicial remand, Shahbaz Gill instead of being sent to Adiala is being taken to unknown location. Complete mockery of law. It’s not about Gill. It’s writ of judicial system being challenged,” he said.

2,LHC turns down plea to stop PTI show at Lahore stadium,"City administration can allow or disallow public meetings, observes Justice Shabbir.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Friday turned down a request by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and others to restrain the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) from holding its public rally in the National Hockey Stadium on Aug 13. 
Justice Muzamil Akhtar Shabbir disposed of the petitions with an observation that the court could not intervene in such matters.
The judge also directed the deputy commissioner to decide the applications of the petitioners for a change of the rally’s venue strictly in accordance with the law. 
The judge observed that the city administration had the authority to allow or disallow public meetings.

City administration can allow or disallow public meetings, observes Justice Shabbir

At the outset of the hearing, the counsel for the PML-N argued that the hockey stadium could not be used for purposes other than sports. He said that the Punjab Sports Board, without holding its meeting, permitted the PTI to hold a public rally in violation of the law. The astroturf of the hockey stadium had been removed to accommodate the PTI rally, he said, adding that the hockey stadium was a national asset and it should not be allowed to be used for political purposes.
At this, Justice Shabbir observed that Mall Road was also a national asset and it was frequently used for public rallies. 
A provincial law officer opposed the petitions, saying that the rally was a peaceful political gathering which was also permitted under the Constitution. He said the government had lawfully allowed the PTI rally. 
The law officer further said that the stadium had been selected by the respondent party as there was a ban on such activities at Greater Iqbal Park.
Justice Shabbir asked the law officer about the government’s plan for restoration of the hockey stadium.
The law officer claimed that the astroturf removed by the hockey stadium management would be used for another ground and the National Hockey Stadium would get a new astroturf. 
Asked about the time frame for the new astroturf for the hockey stadium, the law officer said he needed to seek instructions from the government on this point. 
During the hearing, the judge also asked the PML-N’s counsel about the position of the Pakistan hockey team in an ongoing tournament in Birmingham. The counsel said the Pakistan team probably stood at number eight. 
The judge observed that the national hockey team used to stand first when he was a student.

The government issued a notification about his appointment on Thursday. Mr Ghani — 23rd chairman of Wapda — is a civil engineer and soldier as he has pursued two parallel career streams for the past four decades.  
He obtained Bachelor of Engineering degree from Military College of Engi­neering in 1984 and Mas­ter’s degree in civil engineering from University of Engine­ering and Techno­logy, Lahore, in 1990.

It may be mentioned that the government has appointed Gen Ghani as Wapda chairman for a period of five years. The post has been lying vacant since May 7 this year after the resignation of retired Lt Gen Muzammil Hussain for “personal reasons”. He had remained Wapda chairman for more than five years.  
After Gen Hussain’s resignation, the government handed over the charge to Wapda member (finance) Naveed Asghar till the appointment of a regular chairman.  
Gen Hussain was appointed as Wapda chairman on Aug 24, 2016 by then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, replacing Zafar Mahmood. Gen Hussain’s contract expired on Aug 24 last year, but the PTI-led government reappointed him for another period of five years.  
In his resignation submitted to PM Shehbaz Sharif, the outgoing Wa­­pda chairman stated that he was unable to continue as Wapda chairman due to personal and family compulsions and reques­ted him for the acceptance of his resignation that was later accep­ted by the government.  
Former Wapda chairman Zafar Mahmood had also resigned from his post, citing “personal reasons”.

4,Balochistan PA seeks to make Muslim Bagh new district,Minister suggests administrative division of Quetta into four districts.,"QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly on Friday evening unanimously adopted a resolution that sought Muslim Bagh, a sub-division of Qila Saifullah, to be made a new district while some other lawmakers suggested dividing Quetta into four districts in view of its huge problems, triggered by a growing population.
The resolution was moved in the Balochistan Assembly by parliamentary secretary on excise and taxation, Ms Shaheena Kakar of the Awami National Party (ANP).
Deputy Speaker Sardar Babar Khan Musakaail presided over the session.
While presenting the resolution in the assembly, Ms Kakar said the people of Muslim Bagh faced difficulties in going to Qila Saifullah daily for work and other purposes.

Minister suggests administrative division of Quetta into four districts

Provincial Minister Zamarak Khan Piralizai, Nasarullah Zerey, Akhtar Hussain Langove, Malik Naeem Bazai, Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi and Asadullah Baloch supported the resolution and said that Muslim Bagh should be given the status of a separate district to help the people resolve their issues in the district headquarters.
The Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal) MPA and chairman of accounts committee of Balochistan Assembly, Akhtar Hussain Langove, suggested an amendment to the resolution seeking creation of more districts on administrative basis in the province to help the masses. 
However, PkMAP’s Nasarullah Zerey opposed Mr Langove’s move. This led to an exchange of harsh words between the two lawmakers. Minister Mir Asadullah Baloch intervened and requested the members to maintain decorum of the house.
Mr Langove said that in view of the increasing population and other issues being faced by the people, Quetta should be divided into four districts. This would help resolve administrative issues of the provincial capital, he added.
Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi of the Balochistan Awami Party said that Tump, Jewani, Pasni and Ormara should also be made separate districts.
Later, the house unanimously adopted the resolution to make Muslim Bagh a new district.

5,Hamza asks SC to revisit verdict on Punjab CM election,Requests constitution of full court to decide his plea involving interpretation and application of Article 63A.,"ISLAMABAD: Former Pun­­jab chief minister Hamza Shehbaz Sharif on Friday approached the Sup­reme Court with a plea to revisit and recall its July 26 order which declared Chau­dhry Parvez Elahi as duly elected chief minister of the province for admittedly sec­uring 186 votes against 179 in the July 22 run-off poll.
Filed through senior counsel Mansoor Usman Awan, the review petition also requested for constitution of a full court to decide the present plea involving interpretation and application of Article 63A of the Constitution that deals with defection clause along with other connected matters. 
The review petition argued that the apex court in its July 26 order did not appreciate that 11 SC jud­g­­es, and not eight judges, en­­unciated in the 2015 District Bar Association, Rawal­pin­­di, verdict that non-compliance with directives of the party head with respect to casting votes under Article 63A(1)(b)(i-iii) only entailed de-seating of the parliamentarian.
The apex court had in its July 26 order reasoned that out of 17 judges, who heard the 2015 case to determine the vires of the 18th Consti­tution Amendment, specifically Article 63A, only eight held that the decision as to how to vote had been conferred upon the party head. 
The review petition explained that the 11 judges had in the 2015 judgement indicated that the direction being referred to in Article 63A(1)(b) was to be issued by the party head, at the behest of or on behalf of the political party to the parliamentary party. 
The question was front and centre in the plurality opinion authored by Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed in the 2015 verdict, the review petition contended, adding that in the plurality opinion, the arguments of the counsel recorded were that “by virtue of Article 63A, the right of the parliamentarians to vote on the constitutional amendment has been made subservient to the command of the party head who may not even be the member of parliament”. 
Thus the plurality, comprising eight judges of the Supreme Court, concluded that in the 18th Amendment case that Article 63A had only been amended to the extent that the decision of the party as how to vote had been conferred upon the party head and the matters in which such instructions would apply included an amendment to the Consti­tution, in addition to the money bill and vote of confidence or no confidence, the review petition argued. 
The petition said eight judges had affixed their signatures endorsing that decision, and this understanding was also shared by three other judges, taking the tally to 11 judges in the 2015 judgement.

6,"Barrick Gold to provide $150,000 to PDMA for relief work in Balochistan","In phone call with CM Bizenjo, Barrick president expresses condolences on deaths and suffering inflicted on people due to rain.","QUETTA:  Barrick Gold Corporation (BGC) will provide US $150,000 to Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) of Balochistan to support its relief and rehabilitation efforts in the wake of unprecedented rains and floods in the province.
People living in far-flung areas of the province were the hardest hit by the heavy monsoon rains and flash floods which left more than 500 people dead in the country. 
In a telephone call with Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo on Friday, Barrick President and Chief Executive Mark Bristow expressed the company’s condolences on the loss of lives and suffering inflicted on the people of Balochistan.
He said the contribution to the emergency fund was a demonstration of the spirit of partnership in which Barrick, Balochistan and Pakistan had embarked on the reconstitution and restart of the Reko Diq project, which holds one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper-gold deposits.
Balochistan will have a 25 per cent fully funded share in the project (10pc free carried and 15pc to be funded by the federal government). Pakistan’s state-owned enterprises will hold another 25pc and Barrick, with 50pc, will operate the mine.
“Balochistan will benefit enormously from its stake in the mine. Even before construction starts, once the legalization process has been completed and the project reconstituted, we will start implementing social development programmes representing an estimated investment of $70 million over the construction period. In addition, Reko Diq will advance royalties of up to $5 million in the first year, up to $7.5 million in the second and up to $10m thereafter until construction starts,” Bristow said.
