0,Intense fear in Malakand after recent terrorist attacks: Siraj,JI chief says residents receiving extortion calls,"PESHAWAR: Jamaat-i-Islami chief Sirajul Haq said here on Friday that intense fear prevailed in Malakand division due to recent terror incidents while a large number of people across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were receiving threatening calls for payment of extortion. 
Addressing a protest rally against price hike and gas and power loadshedding and their rising tariffs here in Qissa Khwani Bazaar, he said that people were facing economic terrorism at the hands of government while the peace of the province had been ruined by the incompetent rulers. 
Mr Haq said that a large number of people in Peshawar, Dir, Waziristan, Swabi, Mardan and other areas of the province were receiving threatening calls for payment of extortion. 
He claimed that the chief minister and his cabinet members instead of addressing this issue were themselves paying extortion money. He added that the government only existed on TV and social media. 

JI chief says residents receiving extortion calls

The JI chief said that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was nowhere to be seen during the recent attack on its own MPA in Lower Dir and in Swat where Taliban made a video of law-enforcement personnel with their hands tied. 
He said that PTI chief Imran Khan should have visited Lower Dir and Swat. He said that on the day of Swat occurrence, Mahmood Khan instead of going to his home district went to Banigala. 
Mr Haq said that Imran and Mahmood even did not condole the deaths in Lower Dir. “The PTI leadership is making a hue and cry over the arrest of American national Shahbaz Gill, but they could not go to Swat,” he said. 
He said that people of merged areas and Malakand would never accept displacement again and the chief minister should resign if he could not run affairs of the province. 
Mr Haq also criticised the prolonged power and gas loadshedding in the province besides increase in their tariffs.

3,Peshawar mayor unveils Rs4.49bn budget,Regrets diversion of city govt’s Rs300m funds to TMAs,"PESHAWAR: Mayor of the Peshawar Capital Metropolitan Government Haji Zubair Ali on Friday unveiled the first budget of the city council with an outlay of Rs4.49 billion and insisted that it was a balanced budget prepared with the consultation and guidance of all councillors and a special focus on development.
The 2022-23 budget has Rs1.5 billion allocation for the capital’s development. However, it has no funds for the development of devolved departments, which include primary and secondary education, social welfare, sports and youth affairs, agriculture (extension, livestock, soil conservation and fisheries), population welfare, municipal services including water and sanitation, rural development, public health engineering, coordination, human resource management, planning, development, finance and budgeting functions.
Mr Zubair later told reporters that the council used to approve budget for the city’s development and devolved departments but the provincial government had empowered the deputy commissioner to approve budget for the development of devolved departments.
He said the council members were wondered why there was no development budget for their areas.

Regrets diversion of city govt’s Rs300m funds to TMAs

The mayor alleged that the provincial government had empowered deputy commissioners with ‘ill intentions’ to approve development budget for devolved departments as that move would prompt councillors and their voters to criticise the mayor.
He said the provincial government had diverted Rs300 million capital metropolitan government budget to the weak tehsil municipal administrations without justification.
“Supporting weak TMAs is the responsibility of the provincial government and not the capital metropolitan government’s,” he said.
His budget speech highlighted three main windows of income, including Rs918 million to be received from the provincial government through the provincial finance commission, Rs316 million as octroi and Rs400 million as urban immovable property tax.
Similarly, Rs1.19 billion was reflected in the budget for the salaries of employees, Rs770 million for pension payments, Rs2 million for fuel, Rs120 million for electricity and Rs60 million for court cases.
Mr Zubair said Rs60 million would be utilised by his government on the development of the community, Rs120 million on the maintenance and repair of western and eastern zones of the city, Rs30 million on the installation of streetlights, Rs285 million on the unused property to increase revenue, Rs114 million on water supply and sanitation and Rs57 million on public parks and waiting areas.
He said Rs114 million would be spent on machinery for municipal services and water bowsers, Rs20 million for repair of electricity transformers, Rs7.5 million for natural disaster and Rs3 million for sports.
Talking to Dawn, Zubail Ali said the KP Local Government Act, 2013, had empowered the council to approve budget for devolved departments but the provincial government had usurped that right from the council through an executive order and given to the deputy commissioners for the current fiscal year. He said the provincial government has declared 2022-23 as the transitional period for the local government.
“The deputy commissioner of Peshawar has made budget for devolved departments and approved it without taking the people’s elected representatives on board,” he said.
The mayor said if the provincial government was bent on supporting and giving more and more powers to the bureaucracy, then why it held local body elections.

Talking to this correspondent in Timergara, social activists Akbar Khan and Ebrash Pasha and political activists Arshad Zaman, Yaqub Khan and others said the provincial government had announced the establishment of Dir/Panjkora division in January 2020, but the plan was yet to be implemented. 
They said Lower Dir, Upper Dir, Lower Chitral, Upper Chitral and Bajaur with a total population of about 40 million and an area of 21,421 square kilometres be made a separate administrative division. 
The activists said these districts at present were part of Malakand division, which was one of the largest divisions in Pakistan with a total population of about 90 million and area of 32,000 square kilometres with Saidu Sharif as its headquarters. 
They said the divisional headquarters was located 82 kilometres from Timergara and it was difficult for the top administration to reach it timely during any emergency. 
The activists said the proposed division had a great potential for tourism development as it had scenic spots like Laram Top, Shahi Top, Jazz Banda, Kathora Jheel, Kumrat, Kalash valley, Shandur and Baroghal, while its Panjkora River could be used for generating cheap electricity. 
They said that the existing offices in Timergara could be utilised for the new division.

The report also called for an increase in the number of survey teams for the early completion of damages assessment to pay compensation to the affected families.

Report calls for speedy payment of compensation

Peshawar commissioner Riaz Mehsud had directed heads of all relevant departments and district administration on July 21 to compile a comprehensive report about the problems of Sipah families, whose return to their respective areas had begun on June 13.
The report recommended early provision of health services to those localities and operationalisation of container-based dispensary and government primary school in Sandana area and establishment of schools for both boys and girls in Dre Shaga and Sheikh Mali areas.
It also called for gravity-based drinking water schemes for Nangrosa, Spin Drand, Dre Shaga, Abdalkhel and Drewandi to address water shortages.
The report advocated speedy construction of irrigation canals, protection walls, provision of livestock through livelihood development programme, building of a suspension bridge in Spin Drand area with a focus on the pavement of streets and construction of link roads.
Meanwhile, scores of Kukikhel families, which returned lately, staged a protest demonstration on Friday against what they alleged the denial of some basic items in the relief package to them.
The protesters claimed that the relevant officials didn’t provide them with tents and some food items during the distribution of relief goods despite the fact that they had always called for a comprehensive relief package like that one given away to the internally displaced persons from other militancy-hit areas in the province.
They complained that scores of families were not registered at the time of their displacement and therefore, they were denied ‘equal and fair treatment’ on return.

The protestors said they didn’t get peace as a gift and instead, they earned it and were not ready to be disgraced, displaced and killed again as happened from 2007 to 2009.
They said they were very angry and upset after seeing videos released by the Taliban militants that showed a man claiming to be a militant interview a DSP and two army officers allegedly held captive by the banned outfit.

He was talking to mediapersons at the memorial of the Babara martyrs of August 12, 1948, to mark the 74 years of the gory incident here on Saturday. 
Aimal Wali said irrefutable proofs had emerged about the presence of militants in Swat and other parts of the province.
He said ANP had been warning the government that the Taliban were reorganising, adding now proofs of their presence had emerged, but the IGP’s denial was beyond understanding.
He said on the fateful day of Aug 12, 1948, indiscriminate firing was opened on the peaceful followers of the Khudai Khidmatgar Movement, in which at least 800 Khudai Khidmatgars were martyred. He said after coming to power the party would reopen the case and would hold transparent investigations into the incident.
Aimal Wali said ANP would always stand by the oppressed people.
In Lower Dir, the ANP arranged a function in Chakdara to pay homage to t the martyrs of Babara.
ANP workers from different parts of Adenzai attended the function held at the hujra of Ubaidur Rehman, the party’s general secretary.

In Kohat, the party also paid homage to the 600 followers of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s Khudai Khidmatgar Movement, who were killed during a peaceful rally taken out for his release on Aug 12, 1948.
Speaking at a function, the party’s organising committee president Dr Safdar, secretary general Kashif Shah and others regretted that the gruesome incident had occurred when only two days were left to celebrate the first anniversary of the creation of Pakistan. 
They said Khudai Khidmatgar Tehreek had won a majority of seats but the then governor dissolved the constitutionally-elected government and sent Khan Abdul Ghaffar, Abdul Wali Khan and others to prison.
