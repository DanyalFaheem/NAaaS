0,"Centralised exams for matriculation, intermediate courses in the works in KP",CM asks education dept to develop mechanism.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has decided to centralise matriculation and intermediate board examinations and paper setting and marking in the province as part of education reforms.
Chief Minister Mahmood Khan directed the elementary and secondary education department during a recent high-level meeting to develop a mechanism for early implementation of the decision after legislation, sources told Dawn.
They said the meeting was called to discuss reforms in eight boards of intermediate and secondary education functioning in the province.
“It was decided in the meeting that the Peshawar education board will be the ‘mother board’, while the seven others will function as its branches,” one of the officials, who was present in the meeting, told Dawn on condition of anonymity.

CM asks education dept to develop mechanism

The official said that under the plans, the powers to set and mark exam papers would with the Peshawar BISE after withdrawal from the education boards working in Swat, Malakand, Bannu, Mardan, Dera Ismail Khan, Kohat and Abbottabad.
He also said that the education boards other than Peshawar would work as the board facilitation centres, which could be established even at the district level in the province.
The official said that the documents presented in the meeting revealed that the holding of centralised examinations was meant aiming to have standardised conduct of examination, standardised paper setting and marking, centralised control and to ensure quality and efficiency.
The chief minister also ordered the formation of a five-member committee to come up with a mechanism for the holding of centralised board examinations, paper setting and paper marking.
He the chief minister directed the elementary and secondary education department to send him the names of competent officers and educationists to include them in the committee as soon as possible, the official said.
The transportation of examination papers also came under the discussion during the meeting and it was decided that the committee will also work on it to ensure the safe transportation of the papers from the one district to other, the sources said.
They said thatthe chief minister also floated the idea to establish sub-offices of the proposed mother board (Peshawar BISE) at district levels.
Under the plans, officials at sub-offices will receive papers by email from the central board the night before exams and they will immediate print them before dispatching them to examination halls before dawn. This way, there will be the minimum chances of paper leak, said the sources, adding that currently, the exam papers were printed and dispatched to far-off destinations days before the exams.
According to the documents produced by the education department in the meeting, the Peshawar BISE was established in 1961, those of Abbottabad, Swat and Bannu in 1990, those of Malakand, Kohat and Mardan in 2002 and that of Dera Ismail Khan in 2006.
They revealed that the need for establishing more education boards came in light of the large jurisdiction of Peshawar board, the growing number of government and private sector, the growing number of student enrolments, better workload, and logistic management and public convenience.
The officials insisted that the increasing number of education board brought some negative trends, including promotion of regionalism, a tug of war among boards, ‘loose’ paper marking, deterioration of the quality of exam holding, a lack of standardisation in paper setting and assessment, and corruption.
They said all education boards had been functioning under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education Act, 1990, which was promulgated on Dec 4, 1990.
The officials said for declaring the Peshawar BISE as the ‘mother board’ and all others as the board facilitation centres, the provincial government would legislate after the relevant quarters completed homework.

5,"Insecurity, low payments to workers threaten N. Waziristan polio drive",Paramedics association warns no participation in next vaccination campaign if dues not cleared...,"PESHAWAR: Polio immunisation in North Waziristan, the current hotspot of the virus, is likely to suffer due to lack of proper protection and less payment to the vaccinators. 
The health workers have been demanding foolproof security and protection against attacks in North Waziristan, which has recorded all the 11 polio cases reported countrywide this year. 
Paramedics association, North Waziristan, president Malik Jalauddin told Dawn that in the last campaign from June 27 to July 2, three persons, including two policemen and one of their workers, a social mobiliser, were killed by unidentified gunmen which sent shock waves across the district and the health workers were reluctant to continue the drive owing to extreme fear. 
He regretted that financial package had not yet been extended to one health worker killed and one injured by unknown assailants during the last campaign. 

Paramedics association warns no participation in next vaccination campaign if dues not cleared

“However, we decided to complete the campaign and motivated the vaccinators for the sake of our children who are exposed to the virus. At the same time, we have demanded that foolproof security should be provided to the health staff in the next campaign so that they could conduct vaccination without any fear,” he said. 
Mr Jalauddin said that 566 teams, including 1,698 persons, took part in each campaign in North Waziristan to inoculate 128,000 children and that in the last effort they had achieved 100 per cent target due to the bravery of their colleagues who visited door to door and also convinced the reluctant parents to get their sons and daughters immunised against the crippling ailment. 
However, he said the treatment meted out to them was regrettable. 
“We have in fact carried out a total of 10 days campaign, including the catch-up activity, but we received payment for five days. The amount given to us for such a hard duty is very small. We have decided to stay away from the polio drive if the government does not pay the outstanding dues soon after Eidul Azha,” he said. 
The paramedics association’s president said that one of their injured vaccinators was undergoing treatment in intensive care unit in Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, and demanded the government to provide him free treatment and financial package. 
He said that giving financial package to the heirs of the dead worker and the wounded one would encourage the vaccinators to join the campaign in future, otherwise, most of them wouldn’t opt to put their lives at stake. 
He said every team should be accompanied by armed policemen to safeguard the vaccinators who were often targeted by attackers using similar tactics of riding motorbikes and escaping soon afterwards. 
“The authorities concerned aren’t even condemning such attacks which is a source of disappointment for our workers working in hard areas,” he said. 
Mr Jalauddin said they had conveyed these demands to the district administration, health department and WHO too, and their response was awaited. 
Additional district health officer, North Waziristan, Dr Shamsur Rehman said both the provincial and national emergency operation centres would decide about the financial package for the fallen and injured health workers. 
“We have been trying to provide foolproof security to the health workers to ensure jabs to all the children to eradicate the vaccine-preventable childhood ailment from the district,” he said. 
He said security would be enhanced in the next campaign in August.

6,Bajaur DHQ hospital awaits upgradation to category ‘A’,"The facility lacks key equipment, specialist doctors...","BAJAUR: The district headquarters hospital, Khar, is yet to be upgraded to category ‘A’ from the existing category ‘B’ despite announcement in this regard by then provincial health minister Hisham Inamullah during his visit to the district on January 14, 2019. 
Sources in the DHQ hospital of Bajaur tribal district told this correspondent that then health minister had announced at a jirga that the hospital was being upgraded to ensure proper healthcare facilities to the local people in their district. 
They said the minister had also announced to establish nursing and medical colleges in the district soon. 
However, the sources said work on these health-related projects could not be started despite passage of over three years. They recalled that the second announcement about upgradation of the DHQ hospital was made by the incumbent provincial health minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra during his visit to the district on July 19,2020. 

The facility lacks key equipment, specialist doctors

They said that speaking to local lawmakers and officials of the district administration and health department Mr Jhagra had announced to upgrade the Khar hospital to category ‘A’, but no progress could be made on the matter as yet. 
The sources said the DHQ hospital currently lacked the essential facilities, including equipment and doctors, which should be available even in category ‘B’ government health facility. 
They said of the total 700 employees of the hospital only 45 were medical officers and the facility had been short of specialist doctors. They said the 403-bed hospital lacked essential equipment like CT scan, digital X-ray plant and dialysis machines because of which patients had to go to hospitals in Peshawar for specialised treatment. 
When contacted, medical superintendent Dr Liquat Ali said over 4,000 patients visited the DHQ hospital every month. He said though the hospital had officially been upgraded by the government in mid-2021, it lacked key facilities. He said that SNE (sanctioned new expenditure) regarding the upgradation of the hospital had been sent to the provincial health department about a year ago, requesting it to double the current strength of doctors and appoint specialist doctors besides provision of CT scan machine and other equipment at the facility for treatment of patients. 
However, the official did not specify when the hospital would have all the facilities of category ‘A’ facility after which no patient would be referred to hospitals in Peshawar for specialised treatment. 
“I don’t know when the hospital would be truly upgraded to category ‘A’, but we have completed our preparation in this regard,” he said.

7,"14 years on, Haripur cold storage project incomplete",HARIPUR: The fruit and vegetable cold storage project is incomplete even 14 years after the start of work here....,"HARIPUR: The fruit and vegetable cold storage project is incomplete even 14 years after the start of work here.
Under the plans, a modern facility was to put up at the cost of Rs90 for collecting, grading, packing and storing the locally grown fruit and vegetables before their departure to other cities.
Work on it began in 2008 after the acquisition of four acres of land by the Pakistan Horticulture Board opposite the University of Haripur campus.
The land for collection point had plots in three categories, while two auction sheds and a cold storage was also part of the premises.
The PHB built one auction point and 50 shops but got lukewarm response from the local investors to repeated auction notices.
Official records show that the PHB had fixed Rs400,000 for a shop.
Investor Atiq Ahmad claimed that the price of a shop to be leased out was almost 50 per cent more than the market’s.
He said most shops were either not auctioned or unused.
Former president of the Farm Services Centre, Haripur, Asif Ali Jah complained about faulty construction of shops and overhead water tank and said the agriculture secretary had ordered an inquiry into it, but its findings never came out.
Trader Jehangir Khan said the cold storage construction plan was flawed.
“The PHB should have constructed cold storage before auctioning shops and other plots,” he said.
He said the poor planning by the PHB was to blame for the ‘failure of the much-needed project in which millions of rupees were invested by the government’.
The PHB had installed a fruit and vegetables grading machine after the project’s launch and it has never been functional. Currently, it is rusting away in the open with several parts stolen by the residents.
Aksar Khan, who does business in the local fruit and vegetable market, said the project promised massive financial benefits to the local growers.
He said the cold storage facility was imperative for the storage and grading of fruits and vegetables.
When contacted, director (agriculture) in the district said fruit and vegetable sellers were asked many times to develop plots and purchase shops but they didn’t do so for the ‘reasons best known to them’.
He said the PHB was for cold storage construction with the help of funds generated by shop auctions.
The district is famous for loquat, Khanpuri orange, guava and lychee, while the vegetables grown there include cauliflower, cabbage, onion, green pea, tomato, potato, chilli, turnip and radish.

They mostly remain beneath heavy snow near the Babusar Top, a boundary between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan.
“Voyage to the legendary Seven Lakes is adventurousas you go there on foot. The Dharamsar Lake is the mother of those lakes,” said Sahibzada Jawad, who runs a voluntary club of amateur trekkers.
He told Dawn that he was striving to promote healthy activities among youth, including schoolchildren.
Mr Jawad said the Dharamsar Lake, which stood 12,100 feet above the sea level, was a soothing and pollution-free destination, which fell on the left side of the Babusar Top and had Chilas (Gilgit-Baltistan) in the east.
He said the youngsters, who make it to those seven lakes or Dharamsar Lake in the hot summer, mostly enter the mountainous region in the Kaghan valley via the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road.
The voluntary club’s operator said the Kaghan valley, which was home to the world famous Saiful Muluk, Dudipatsar and Lolusar lakes, was also known as the land of fairies.
He said the wildlife department had divided the entire valley into the Saiful Muluk and Lolusar national parks.
The Saiful Muluk national park covers widely stretched lower parts of the valley, including its commercial headquarters Naran while Lolusar national parkis starched over the upper and mountainous parts of valley including Babusar Top.
“The Dudipatsar, Lolusar and Dharamsar and rest of six lakes located in Seven-Lakes land falls in the Lolusar national park and most of them are still unexplored and visited as Saiful Muluk lake,” divisional wildlife officer Taimur Shah said.
He said Dharamsar and Subaal lakes were almost equal to Saiful Muluk lake in size but the rest of five were smaller and were known as Siri Mala (jewells).
The DWO said the land of seven lakes also had exotics and indigenous species of Golden Eagle, Ibex, Golden Marmot and Brown Bear.
“We have recently arrested a group of international hunters from Seven-Lake land and seized the endangered species that could be sold in million from their possession,” he said.

13,Detention of suspected drug pushers under MPO set aside,PHC declares suspects can be dealt with under narcotics law...,"PESHAWAR: Declaring illegal the detention of five suspected drug peddlers under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, the Peshawar High Court ordered the Swat district administration to release them without delay.
It also ruled that the district administration could deal with suspected drug pushers under the relevant anti-narcotics law.
A bench consisting of Justice Mohammad Naeem Anwar and Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan accepted five petitions separately filed by detainees Hayat Khan, Adalat Khan, Akhtar Ali, Umar Ali and Fazal Qadir and set aside the orders by Swat’s deputy commissioner for their detention last month.
While ordering the detention of the petitioners, the deputy commissioner had said he had received report from the district police officer (DPO) about their involvement in drug peddling and that they didn’t “mend their ways, which is negatively affecting the peace and order of the order.”

PHC declares suspects can be dealt with under narcotics law

He had added that having considered the material placed before him, he was of the opinion that presence of those ‘drug pushers’ in the district was prejudicial to the public safety and maintenance of public order, so it was necessary to issue warrants for their arrest under Section 3(1) of the MPO. He had ordered their detention for a period of 30 days.
Almost identical judgements spread over eight pages each were released in the five petitions, wherein the bench observed that the MPO Ordinance, 1960, was enacted to provide a law for preventive detention and control of persons and publications for reasons connected with public safety, public interest and the maintenance of public order.
Quoting the preamble and Section 3 of the MPO, the bench observed that that section of law under which the petitioner was arrested provided that where the government was satisfied to prevent any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order, then in such like eventuality that person could be arrested and detained for a specified period.
It questioned whether character of the petitioner would be an act, which could qualify the essential ingredients for constituting a ground to press into service Section 3 of the ordinance, which speaks that any person who was acting in any manner prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order?
The court ruled that ‘such’ character of the petitioner could not constitute the essential ingredients of public safety or public maintenance, which were required for issuance of an order of preventive detention, therefore by applying a plain meaning, the allegation so levelled could not be sufficient to justify the arrest and detention of the petitioner.
“It is also relevant to mention here that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substance Act, 2019, was an exhaustive law, which provides a complete and comprehensive mechanism for the trial of those offenders, who are involved in business of narcotics,” the bench observed adding that the alleged act of the petitioner was governed by that special narcotics law.
The bench ruled that in the cases in hand, the court found that the alleged act of the petitioner had got no nexus with the purpose and object of the MPO.
“If the government wants to deal with him, they have at their disposal a robust legal regime in the form of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substance Act, 2019, and the Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979, wherein the legislature has taken care to deal with all aspects of the business in trade of narcotics,” it observed.
The bench added that even if the petitioner was found to have been dealing with any such business of selling narcotics, he might have been dealt with under the provisions of that law.
“Recourse to the provision of Section 3 of the MPO was not at all justified in the circumstances of the case,” it declared.
The bench also observed that where a complete and comprehensive mechanism for the trial of those offenders had been 
provided, it would not be open to the district administration to also use such charges as a ground for preventive detention under the MPO and therefore, it concluded that it was an improper and unreasonable exercise of powers to issue orders of preventive detention.
