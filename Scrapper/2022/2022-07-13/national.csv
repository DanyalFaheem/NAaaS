In his virtual address to an event titled ‘Mobilising the private sector for the Sust­ainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs)’, the minister said that developing countries are facing extreme economic situation due to high commodity pri­c­es in the international markets.  
High commodity prices have also created a financial burden for the private sector, curtailing their ability to finance SDG programmes, he added. 
He also stressed the need for a relief package for the developing countries to enable the private sector to contribute towards achieving the SDG targets.

1,WHO calls for development of new vaccines to cope with antimicrobial-resistant,"Analysis highlights need to speed up trials of AMR-related vaccines in late-stage development, maximise use of existing vaccines.","ISLAMABAD: The World Health Organisation on Tuesday released a report on the vaccines currently in development to prevent infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacterial pathogens. 
WHO’s analysis points to the need to accelerate trials for AMR-related vaccines in the late-stage development and maximise the use of existing vaccines. 
The bacteria have internal intelligence due to which they change themselves according to the medicine and create resistance against the medicines. In the past, bacteria could be killed with low potency medicines but now for the same virus high potency medicines are required due to AMR. 
On the other hand, when antibiotics fail to work, the consequences are longer-lasting illnesses, more doctor visits or extended hospital stays, and the need for more expensive and toxic antibiotics. In some cases, the antibiotic-resistant infections can lead to serious disability or even death.
In 2018, Pakistan faced a major embarrassment as US national public health agency CDC issued an advisory that there was an ongoing outbreak of XDR typhoid fever in Pakistan that does not respond to most antibiotics. During 2018, cases were reported in the UK and in the US among travellers returning from Pakistan. In April 2019, after concerns about the misuse of antibiotics for years, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) finally decided to regulate its sale in Islamabad and as a first step an advisory was issued to all medical stores to ensure that antibiotics were not sold without prescriptions. 
Moreover, medical stores were asked to maintain the record of antibiotics and its sale, including copies of the prescriptions but it could not be implemented.
According to the report, the silent pandemic of antimicrobial resistance is of major growing public health concern. Resistant bacterial infections alone are associated with nearly 4.95 million deaths per year, with 1.27 million deaths directly attributed to AMR. But AMR is about more than bacterial infections. It occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines. 
When an individual becomes infected with these microbes, the infection is said to be resistant to antimicrobial medicines. These infections are often difficult to treat.
Vaccines are powerful tools to prevent infections in the first place, and, therefore, have the potential to curb the spread of AMR infections. The AMR vaccine pipeline report aims to guide investments and research into feasible vaccines to mitigate AMR. 
A statement issued by WHO said that the analysis identifies 61 vaccine candidates in various stages of clinical development, including several in late stages of development to address diseases listed on the bacterial priority pathogens list, which WHO has prioritised for research and development. While the report describes these late-stage vaccine candidates as having a high development feasibility, the report cautions that most will not be available anytime soon.
“Preventing infections using vaccination reduces the use of antibiotics, which is one of the main drivers of AMR. Yet, of the top six bacterial pathogens responsible for deaths due to AMR, only one, Pnuemoccocal disease (Streptococcus pneumoniae) has a vaccine,” said Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Assistant Director-General, Antimicrobial Resistance. 
“Affordable and equitable access to life-saving vaccines such as those against pneumococcus, are urgently needed to save lives, and mitigate the rise of AMR” she added.

Shariat Court
The Federal Shariat Court was established in 1980 by a military regime to examine and decide the question whether or not any law or provision of law is repugnant to the injunctions of Islam and to hear appeals in the cases of rape and unnatural offences. However, there are only 157 cases before the FSC since with the adoption of Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act 2006, the jurisdiction of this court was considerably curtailed, inasmuch as, appeals/applications for revision arising out of trial of offences were taken out from the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance 1979, and now such appeals are filed before the high courts. 
There were 178 cases pending at start of 2021 before FSC and it settled 139 cases and 118 new cases were submitted before it last year.
High courts
The Lahore High Court adjudicated 149,362 cases last year and 148,436 new cases were instituted during the same period and total pending cases were 187,255 on Dec 31 at the LHC.

NJPMC
The National Judicial Policy was formulated in 2009 to reduce the backlog of cases in the judiciary, ensure its independence and eradicate corruption. 
It was devised in the aftermath of judges’ restoration movement (2007-2009) with a view to improve the performance of the justice sector in order to enhance public trust in the administration of justice.
The NJP, formulated by the National Judicial Policy Making Committee (NJPMC), provided short- and long-term measures for expeditious disposal of the cases and set time limits to decide the matters of different categories and it said that priority should be given to dispose of old cases.
The chief justice of Pakistan is chairman of the NJPMC, while the FSC chief justice and chief justices of the five high courts are its members. 
However, according to data collected by the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan, 88,661 and 130,327 old cases — filed up to Dec 31, 2017 — were waiting to meet the ends of justice at the five high courts and subordinate judiciary of the country, respectively, until April 30.

4,Bad weather hits climbing season in GB,Two missing mountaineers spotted through telescope; over 300 international climbers waiting at K2 base camp to start summit push.,"GILGIT: Bad weather has hampered efforts of local and foreign climbers to scale various peaks, including K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-I and Gasherbrum II, while at least two Pakistani mountaineers who had lost contact with their base camp while descending Nanga Parbat were spotted on Tuesday.
Flooding caused by melting glaciers has already blocked K2 Road at multiple locations, making it difficult for trekkers and expedition teams to reach the base camps of various mountains, including that of the world’s second highest peak.
More than 300 international climbers are waiting at K2 base camp to start summit push. Some climbers had established camp-3 but they had to return to the base camp due to inclement weather at higher altitude.
Also, the ‘mountaineer mom’ Naila Kiani, who had set a record by becoming the first Pakistani woman to have conquered an 8,000m, Gasherbrum-II, in Pakistan, is at K2 base camp. According to her, she and her team had completed their rotation to camp-2 two days ago and are now waiting for good weather for next rotation.

Two missing mountaineers spotted through a telescope

Speaking to Dawn, tour operator Sikhawat Hussain said weather would not be stable until next week.
Over 100 climbers were waiting at base camp to scale Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II and Nanga Parbat. 
On Monday evening, it was reported that two Pakistani mountaineers, Imtiaz Sadpara from Skardu and Hasan Shigri from Shigar, had lost contact with the base camp while descending from Nanga Parbat (8,126m) after conquering it on July 10, amid deteriorating weather conditions. On Tuesday, the high altitude police at Diamer confirmed to the authorities that they managed to spot the missing climbers at camp-3 of Nanga Parbat, through a telescope from base camp. 
Earlier this month, two climbers Shehroze Kashif and Fazal Ali were rescued after they had gone missing while descending from the world’s ninth highest peak.

5,Participation of women in workforce greatly constrained in Pakistan: study,"WB study says at 20pc, Pakistan’s workforce participation rate for women is one of the lowest both in South Asia and globally.","ISLAMABAD: Pointing out that women’s participation in the workforce is greatly constrained, a World Bank study says at 20 per cent, Pakistan’s workforce participation rate for women is one of the lowest both in South Asia and globally. 
Low education levels, mobility challenges and gender norms limit women from entering and being retained in the formal workforce, and consequently, a significant proportion of women workers are represented in the informal sector as home-based workers (HBWs), according to details of the study made available to Dawn on Monday. 
Pakistan has 4.4 million HBWs, of whom 3.6m are women. These workers perform work for remuneration from their home or other premises of their choice, and they mainly operate as piece-rate or own-account workers involved in production and manufacturing chains to make products like textile articles, leather goods or raising livestock for agriculture and bi-products.
Because of gaps in available data, study says, estimates likely under-represent the true extent of home-based work. Women HBWs are especially vulnerable to exploitation from contractors or middlemen and typically belong to poorer households, having little to no formal education. They have limited access to markets, training, and most public services and work amenities. HBWs lack rights and social protection, face greater work and safety hazards, and are given little to no consideration in economic and labour policies, according to the study.
In addition, only 10 per cent of non-agricultural workers in the private formal sector are women. Studies indicate that provision of specific facilities, such as transport by the employer, separate toilets for women, and childcare facilities, are a major factor in encouraging women’s labour force participation.
The need for enhanced legal protection for women workers to improve their access to basic facilities in the formal sector was identified as a critical challenge during consultations with experts on gender and social inclusion in Pakistan.
The World Bank’s ‘Securing Human Investments to Foster Transformation’ (SHIFT) programme sought to improve the rights and conditions of home-based workers (HBWs) and other vulnerable women working in Pakistan’s private sector resulted in the adoption of 10 laws by the provincial assemblies. The new laws are intended to extend informal HBWs’ access to social security, fair wages, and improve formal women workers’ access to childcare, separate toilets, transportation, to achieve equal pay, and to end sex discrimination, it says.
The laws are expected to impact a sizable proportion of at least 4.4 million vulnerable HBWs in Pakistan. The data collection activities will be critical in developing a deeper understanding of the impact of the legal reforms.
Further, amendments in labour laws (Shops and Esta­bli­shments, and Factories Acts) achieved through the SHIFT reforms will ensure better working conditions and facilities for 3.7m women workers in the formal private sector, reduce restrictions on work hours, and encourage more women to enter and stay in the workforce, the study says.

6,Covid positivity doubles amid drop in tests,Rate in Karachi reaches alarming level of around 40pc...,"


 
ISLAMABAD: The national Covid-19 positivity rate, the proportion of people who tested positive for the disease, more than doubled to 5.5 per cent on Tuesday as fewer citizens sought out tests during Eidul Azha.
Official data released by the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) showed on Tuesday the number of Covid tests conducted across the country over the past 24 hours dropped by more than a third to 4,674 from 15,038 a day earlier. And it was a far cry from this month’s highest tally of 23,125 reported on July 7.
The highest positivity rate of 39.46pc was reported from Karachi (based on 161 positive results from 408 tests), followed by Islamabad 7.69pc, Hyderabad 5.17pc, Lahore 4.65pc and Peshawar 3.93pc.
One patient succumbed to the virus, whe­r­eas 141 remained in critical care, data showed. 
A spokesperson for the Ministry of National Health Services, Sajid Shah, said a decline in the number of tests was expected during religious festivals and hoped that it would return to normal in a few days.

Rate in Karachi reaches alarming level of around 40pc

“People don’t want to get themselves tested during Eid due to different engagements and travelling,” he said. “Outpatient departments of government hospitals also remain closed during Eid holidays and private labs also conduct fewer tests.”
Mr Shah also expected a drop in the national positivity rate after testing improves in the coming days. 
AFP adds: Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation’s chief lamented on Tuesday that fresh surges of Covid infections show the pandemic is nowhere near over, warning that the virus is running free.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was worried that case numbers were shooting up, putting more strain on health systems and workers.
The number of Covid cases reported to the WHO increased 30pc in the past two weeks, driven by sub-variants of the Omicron strain and the lifting of control measures.
“New waves of the virus demonstrate again that Covid-19 is nowhere near over. As the virus pushes at us, we must push back,” he insisted.
He told a news conference that as transmission increases, governments must also deploy tried-and-tested measures like mask-wearing and improving ventilation.
“Sub-variants of Omicron, like BA.4 and BA.5, continue to drive waves of cases, hospitalisation and death around the world,” Mr Tedros said.
“Surveillance has reduced significantly — including testing and sequencing — making it increasingly difficult to assess the impact of variants on transmission, disease characteristics, and the effectiveness of counter-measures.”
Furthermore, tests, treatments and vaccines are not being deployed effectively.
“The virus is running freely and countries are not effectively managing the disease burden based on their capacity,” he said, both in terms of hospitalisation of acute cases and the expanding number of people with Long Covid.
‘Uncertain and unpredictable’
The WHO’s Covid-19 emergency committee met Friday via video conference and determined the pandemic remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern — the highest alarm the WHO can sound.
WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told the meeting recent changes in testing policies were hindering the detection of cases and the monitoring of virus evolution.
The committee stressed the need to reduce transmission as the implications of a pandemic caused by a new respiratory virus would not be fully understood, the WHO said in a statement Monday.
The group voiced concern over steep reductions in testing, resulting in reduced surveillance and genomic sequencing.
“This impedes assessments of currently circulating and emerging variants of the virus,” the WHO said, feeding the inability to interpret trends in transmission.
The committee said the trajectory of virus evolution and the characteristics of emerging variants remained “uncertain and unpredictable”.
It said the absence of measures to reduce transmission increases the likelihood of “new, fitter variants emerging, with different degrees of virulence, transmissibility, and immune escape potential”.
