0,Committee’s secrecy keeps aspirants for medical varsities’ VCs on tenterhooks,"LAHORE: Contrary to the past practice, the Punjab government’s notified search committee which interviewed nearly...","LAHORE: Contrary to the past practice, the Punjab government’s notified search committee which interviewed nearly 50 senior doctors for the appointment of regular vice chancellors of five medical universities has kept the candidates in the dark about the internal assessment marks they obtained in the name of “merit and transparency”.  
The search committee was to allot the marks on the basis of academic qualifications, experience and research papers of the shortlisted candidates. 
The medical universities are: the King Edward Medical University  (KEMU), Lahore; the University of Health Sciences (UHS), Lahore; the Fatima  Jinnah Medical University (FJMU), Lahore; the Faisalabad Medical University  (FMU); and the Rawalpindi Medical University (RMU).  
In 2017, the then search committee formed for these varsities had updated each candidate who appeared in the interview about the internal marks he/she had obtained. The purpose was to ensure that the candidates were  updated about the merit to avoid litigation. But this time round the candidates are shocked to find out that they have not been informed about the status of the internal assessment points/marks the search committee has given them.  
The five-member search committee notified on May 30 is likely to hold a crucial meeting on Wednesday (today) for the selection of a panel of three candidates against each university as it is  bound to complete the process within three weeks of its constitution. The candidates would be shortlisted from amongst 50 senior medical teachers on the basis of their academic achievements and the marks they obtained during interviews. 
Headed by retired Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, the committee comprises Punjab Specialized Healthcare & Medical Education Department Secretary Ali Jan, Allama Iqbal Medical College’s ex-principal Prof Eice Mohammad, Punjab Information Technology Board ex-chairman Dr Umar Saif and Prof Moazzam Nazeer Tarar, ex-professor/executive director & head of Jinnah Burn and Reconstructive Surgery Centre.  
An official says the search committee is bound to follow the decision of the Supreme Court to recommend names of three persons “in the order of merit” to the government for the appointment of one of them as a regular VC.
“The Search Committee shall complete its work within a period of three weeks and submit/recommend names of three persons in the order of merit to the Government which shall proceed to notify the person of highest merit unless there are cogent reasons for not appointing him which shall be duly recorded in writing and shall be justifiable,” reads the decision.  
The SC had given this decision when a number of doctors had raised objections to the appointments of vice chancellors of the medical universities against merit and questioned the process and constitution of the search committee. Following the SC order, the then Punjab government re-constituted the search committee and informed the apex court that the process had been initiated afresh, the official source said.  
As for the new selection process, he said, the candidates wanted that the government ensure recommendation of a panel of three candidates against each university by the search committee as ordered by the SC rather than recommending the names “alphabetically”. 
While giving reference of another such decision of a three-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by then Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed, on July 2021, he said, the SC had declared the appointment of a candidate as VC of the University of Agriculture Faisalabad illegal for being low on merit. The PTI government had appointed a candidate who was recommended by the search committee on the second number of the merit. The committee had recommended Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan at the top for security 94.2 marks. 
In the strong-worded decision, the SC had directed the government to make his appointment as UAF VC while declaring the appointment of the other candidate “illegal, arbitrary, capricious and unbridled exercise of discretion.”  
The official said the candidates who appeared in the interviews now had expressed reservations for keeping them in the dark about the marks. It had created doubts about the transparency in the selection process, he said, adding that the candidates were already perturbed over rumours that ‘influential contestants’ wanted recommendations of names ‘alphabetically’ to get favours. They had asked Chief Minister Hamza Shahbaz to ensure that the search committee followed the merit, he said.

2,"Farmers fear decline in rice acreage, production","LAHORE: Farmers fears are growing for the rice acreage and production this year as exceptionally dry weather, right...","LAHORE: Farmers fears are growing for the rice acreage and production this year as exceptionally dry weather, right up to the start of July, hindered transplantation of nursery and most of them now claim that though water shortages have ended, their rice nursery has already turned “over-aged and weak,” which may hit the national yield figures.
“This would ultimately hit the yield, where nursery is to be shifted to field in the next fortnight or so,” apprehends Abad Khan, a rice farmer from central Punjab.  
“Yes, water is now available, but what about damage already done?” he adds. 
“Even now, a farmer gets an irrigation turn every week and the canal water hardly covers one-third of the paddy field during that one turn, so he has to wait for a week to have it again. So, the farmers have to mobilise all their financial and irrigation resources to shift the nursery. This is what is being hampered because of rising cost of diesel, unreliable supply of electricity and increasing investment in fertiliser. When nursery was planted between May 15 and June 30, the province was suffering almost 50 per cent water shortage – keeping the nursery under-fed and weak. It all happened after nursery was hit by problems like absence of better seed and farmers are not trained for new technologies like mechanised direct-seeded rice (DSR), which saves water as well as labour cost,” says Raja Ghazanfar – a farmer in the core belt of central Punjab.  
“Expect substantial decrease in cultivation area and, naturally, production this year,” he warns.  
Anticipating these problems, Punjab has already revised its acreage and yield targets for the year. It foresaw some 21pc decrease in the rice cultivation area – dropping from 6.31 million acres last year to only five million acres this year. For yield, it is expecting 4.70m tonnes this year against 5.77m tonnes last year – a drop of over one million tonnes. The province, however, expects a slight improvement in per acre yield and sees it hitting 23.53 maunds per acre – an increase of around three per cent. The farmers, however, fear further shrinking of both – acreage and yield.
According to the growers’ opinion survey, which provides early clue to acreage trend of any crop in the province, Punjab now sees seven to eight per cent drop in farmers’ preference for rice crop this year.
The Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA) had, early this year, fixed national rice production target of 8.6m tonnes and hoped to harvest the crop from 3.1m hectares. The province contributes over 85pc of the national production, but is seeing decreasing trend in area this year.
Rice contributes 3.5pct of value addition in agriculture and 0.7pc of the gross domestic product (GDP). Last year, a record production growth of 13.6pc was witnessed, which essentially came from increased domestic price due to increasing demand for export. Pakistan is among top ten producers of rice in the world and contributes around eight per cent to world rice trade.

Later, a cross-version of the case was also registered (FIR No 511/22) on Tuesday on the complaint of the rival party.

4,Chaudhrys show ‘a semblance of unity’ on Eid while sticking to their guns,Shujaat claims party and family are united and all the issues will be resolved “at appropriate time”.,"GUJRAT: In an apparent bid to show unity among the PML-Q ranks and members of the Chaudhry family, PML-Q chief and former prime minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain spent the first day of Eid at the Kunjah House of his nephew MNA Moonis Elahi, but the gesture may not help resolve the core difference among the two groups recently emerging within the party.
Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, MNA Hussain Elahi, former education minister Mian Imran Masood and others were also present there and offered the Eid prayers together.
However, Shafay Hussain, the elder son of Chaudhry Shujaat, was conspicuous by his absence at Kunjah House, despite being in Gujrat. He preferred to spend Eid day at Zahoor Elahi House in the city. His brother and federal minister Salik Hussain did not visit Gujrat to celebrate Eid, unlike other members of the family.
Traditionally, the Chaudhrys would mostly celebrate Eid in their home town of Gujrat and meet the party workers and supporters during their stay there.
Chaudhry Shujaat invited some local media persons at Kunjah House and talked to them in the presence of Parvez Elahi and his son Moonis Elahi in a bid to dispel the impression of a split within the family and the party.
Despite the show of unity, the PML-Q chief and the father-son duo (Parvez and Moonis) refused to budge from their respective positions — Shujaat supporting the PML-N government in center and Parvez backing the PTI chief Imran Khan.
Responding to different questions, Shujaat claimed the party and the family were united and all the issues would be resolved “at appropriate time”.
About a question regrading visits of PML-N president Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and PPP’s Asif Ali Zardari to his residence in Lahore, Shujaat quipped, “Where there is grain, people do come there.”  
However, he advised the government to control the inflation and prices of food items, and also advised the leaders of different political parties to avoid “bitter statements”.
He also reiterated his support for Parvez Elahi’s candidature for the slot of Punjab chief minister.
Asked about his son Shafay Hussain lobbying as a prospective provincial assembly candidate from Gujrat city seat, he said everyone had the right to contest from anywhere.
Parvez Elahi, however, commended the PTI chief Imran Khan for playing, what he called “a courageous role” to protect the rights of people of Pakistan and vowed to continue supporting him through thick and thin.
He expressed the hope that the PTI would win all the 20 PA seats in July 17 by-polls.
“If I am elected as Punjab chief minister, my focus will be on improving the rural economy in the province that could bring a revolutionary change in the lives of farmers as the current economic condition requires some out of box solutions,” Mr Elahi said.
He termed the PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari a political leader of big stature, who he said had a big heart to show patience and respect to everyone in any situation.
Some insiders say the party’s future strategy depends on the outcome of the July 17 by-polls.
They say that currently, both groups within the PM-Q are trying to win over each other, as party chief seems to be more interested in the unity of all factions of Muslim Leagues in Pakistan.
Some party lawmakers being led by MNA Moonis Elahi have been persuading Shujaat Hussain to withdraw his support for the PMLN-led federal coalition government as two party MNAs are supporting the Shahbaz government and three others are on the PTI’s side, saying the situation is embarrassing for all.
On the other hand, the Shujaat camp argues that its leader has honoured the commitment made by the party with the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) leadership at the time of the no-confidence move against the then PM Imran Khan.

“Moonis Elahi will decide the ticket of MPA from Gujrat city in the next election as he is the MNA of this constituency,” Shujaat said in a statement issued here on Tuesday. He said there might be ideological differences in politics but it should not be turned into personal enmity.  
“All parties should forget their differences and come up with suggestions to fight inflation,” he said and added the army was the protector of the country and knew how to handle it.  
Punjab Assembly  Speaker Parvez Elahi said Shujaat was his family elder and he made decisions (of the family). “The political scenario will change in the next few years as new faces will come into politics. Owing to wrong policies of the PML-N, inflation has made people’s lives miserable. The nation is fed up with these incompetent rulers.”  
Elahi said the Sharif brothers had betrayed the Chaudhrys many times and they could not be trusted. “We will contest the next election in alliance with the PTI,” he declared.  
Moonis Elahi said Imran Khan was capable of solving the problems of the country and his party’s alliance with him would be maintained. “We will win by-elections as the PML-N-led government has failed to serve the people,” he said.

According to a first information report 446/22, Naveed Ahmed, a resident of Madina Town, informed the police that his brother Abdul Rehman (22) came to his shop at Shahi Road at 11:30pm and said he was going for a dinner with his friends at Canal View on July 7. But when Rehman did not come back by late night, he tried to contact on his mobile but he was not receiving the call and later the cell phone was powered off.  
The complainant said he launched a search and finally informed the police.
On the other hand, according to some businessmen, the deceased family received calls from the kidnappers for payment of ransom within a couple of days otherwise Rehman would be killed.  
When his family members approached the deputy superintendent police (city) and the station house officer, they didn’t pay any heed.
Police said when the family of Rehman contacted them, they launched an investigation and took into custody some of his friends and two of them confessed that Rehman was kidnapped by them and murdered for not paying Rs20m ransom.
Later, the police recovered the body of Rehman from Cholistan on the identification of the captors.  
The body was sent to Shaikh Zayed Medical College Hospital for autopsy on Monday. Rehman was laid to rest in a local graveyard on Tuesday.
When contacted, police spokesperson Saif Ali Wains rejected the negligence on the part of the DSP and the SHO.

According to the family, the boy was playing in the park when he accidentally touched the electricity pole which was electrified due rainwater in the field. He suffered severe electric shock and died on the spot.  
While blaming Mepco and the Municipal Committee (MC) officials for the incident, victim’s father Syed Karar Haider, along with residents of the area, said that despite being informed several times about the electrified pole and the accumulation of rainwater on nearby ground, the authorities remained indifferent.  
Rao Azhar, a resident of Mandi Sadiq Ganj, told Dawn that children who come to play in the park on a daily basis were in grave danger. He said that about three weeks ago, a donkey was electrocuted by touching the same pole when it was grazing in the field.  
He said the administration did not bother to take action when they complained about the animal’s death and demanded that the pole should be removed immediately.  
Residents complained that most of the electricity poles installed around the only park of the city got electrified during rainy days. However, neither the MC ensured immediate drainage of rainwater nor did Mepco officials take any measures to rectify these electrified poles.
The protesters demanded that the authorities take strict action against the negligent officials.
HONOUR KILLING: A man who was shot at and injured in Dahranwala on Sunday for favouring a freewill marriage succumbed to his injuries on Tuesday. 
According to police, Hafiz Shahid, a resident of Chak 167 Murad, was on his way to Dahranwala by motorcycle on July 10 when six men on a pickup stopped him near the Government Girls High School around 6pm. They opened fire on Shahid and fled, leaving him critically injured. He was taken to a local hospital from where he was referred to the Bahawal Victoria Hospital due to his critical condition.  
The victim could not survive and died at the hospital, police added. An FIR against six nominated men was registered on the complaint of the victim’s cousin, however, no arrest had been made so far.  
Police said the incident was linked to honour killing because the victim was targeted for supporting Furqan Arshad who recently contracted court marriage with the sister of one of the attackers.

The police investigators who investigated the murder case of Kamran, 10, and his injured brother Rizwan, 6, said they found deep bruises of sharp-edged weapons.  
A police official said the children were hired by Nasrullah, a resident of DHA’s Phase III. He said police received an emergency call from a private hospital that it had received a domestic child worker dead and another critically injured. The doctors said the body of the deceased boy had deep torture marks while the condition of the other boy was serious.  
Police experts reached the hospital and after initial investigation concluded that the act of the brutality was committed by the family of the house owner. The official said Nasrullah and his son Mahmoodul Hassan brought the children to the private hospital to conceal the crime.  
Meanwhile, senior police officers also reached there on being informed about the crime, he said, adding that the injured boy told them that Hassan and his brother Abul Hassan used to torture him and his brother over trifling mistakes.  
On Monday, he said, the suspects tied them with ropes in a room and subjected them to severe torture using sharp-edged tools. They kept on beating them for many hours which led to the death of his elder brother, he said, adding that the other members of the family including women were also present there.  
The police official said those who committed the heinous crime were Nasrullah, his wife Shabana, two sons and his daughter-in-law Hinna.

12,Boy kidnapped by armed men in crowded street in Lahore,CCTV footage showed no one dared to stop two of the armed men as they kidnapped the boy in broad daylight.,"LAHORE: Some unidentified armed men allegedly kidnapped a 12-year-old boy from a crowded street in Sanda area here on Tuesday.
As per police and eyewitnesses, several people were present in the street when four armed men came there in a car, bundled the boy into the vehicle and sped away.
A close circuit TV (CCTV) footage of the incident showed no one dared to stop two of the armed men as they kidnapped the boy in the broad daylight.
Some of the netizens especially criticised a group of young men, present in the street and watching the entire episode as the child even ran towards them for help moments before his kidnap, for not intervening or making any attempt to rescue him.  
They termed it an example of growing insensitivity in society towards crimes, especially those committed against the children.  
A police team, however, reached the spot soon after the footage went viral on social media and lodged a case against the unidentified kidnappers.
Quoting findings of an initial inquiry, a police official says the boy has been identified as Tayyab, a resident of Rajgarh, who was kidnapped while returning home from a video game shop.   
He says the investigators are of the opinion that the kidnapping may have a link to the video game shop, adding that the man running the shop has been taken into custody for interrogation.
The police are trying to get the data of CCTV cameras installed around the crime scene, he says, adding that they are also exploring other angles to dig out the motive behind the crime.
To a question, he said, the police were in contact with the boy’s father Atta Ullah and other family members, who expressed their ignorance about the identity of the kidnappers and the motive behind the crime.
Further investigation was underway, the police official said.

13,Public right of way can’t be denied irrespective of revenue record: LHC,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has observed that even if a street or a passage is not a declared public street in the...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has observed that even if a street or a passage is not a declared public street in the revenue record, a public passage could still come into existence following its use by the general public.
And a district or a sub-divisional magistrate can invoke powers under section 133 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) for the removal of nuisance or blockade of a public thoroughfare.
Justice Muhammad Shan Gul has made these observations in a verdict issued on a petition challenging decision of two lower courts wherein an order of an area magistrate to restore and open a public passage for use of public was upheld.
Some residents of an area in Dera Ghazi Khan complained to the magistrate under section 133 CrPC that a public thoroughfare was in the use of residents to approach a local mosque but that a person namely Ghulam Siddique (who challenged the magistrate’s order) blocked that right of way by constructing small walls on the said right of way.
The magistrate in light of the reports from local patwari and the police ordered the SHO concerned to restore the public way.
After dismissal of his petition and an appeal by the sessions courts, Siddique approached the LHC pleading that the magistrate had no right to exercise powers under section 133 CrPC to open a thoroughfare not registered in the revenue record.
However, Justice Gul in his verdict, observes that reports of the revenue department clearly establish the presence of a right of way used in the past by the public in general and residents of the area in particular for reaching the mosque.
Besides this, he notes that Article 20 of the Constitution allows every citizen the right to profess and practice religion and all executive authorities in Pakistan are obliged to facilitate the enforcement of such right.
The judge says for the applicability of section 133 CrPC, the right of way from which a nuisance is sought to be removed must be one which is or may be usefully used by the public.
He explains that a thoroughfare is a place where the public go irrespective of whether they have a right to go or not.
He observes that the department’s reports show that the public right of way in question did indeed lead the faithful to the mosque in the area. He notes that the public in general used this right of way to reach the mosque as also for other purposes.
Justice Gul holds that the use of land in question as a public right of way and its obstruction by construction of walls from three sides stands proven and the claim of non-existence of such right of way has not been established.
“Once the consistent use of the land as a public right of way is established, there remains no question of whether such land reflects as a public way in the land record or not,” he adds.
The judge maintains that the consistent use of such a piece of land by the public necessitates an order under section 133.
The judge observes that there was ample justification for the courts below to come to a tentative conclusion that the causeway in question did exist and was being used by the public in general.
And the same having been blocked by the questionable and irregular exercise undertaken by the respondent, the courts below were justified to decide, by way of a conditional order, to open the public passage to the public in general, the judge writes in the verdict dismissing the petition.

15,Hamza dispensation ‘dispenses with’ Lumberdari system,Buzdar set-up had promised to allot land to Lumberdars a year back...,"LAHORE: The change of guards in Punjab in the month of April has put on hold the restoration of the Lumberdari system approved around a year ago by the previous provincial government.
The Buzdar government had promised to allot around 398,400 acres of land to Lumberdars (village headmen) across the province for mobilising them for various official duties ranging from collection of taxes to administration of polio vaccination. The government decided to recruit 5,000 more Lumberdars to fill the vacant posts.
There are a total of 38,700 Lumberdars, including 2,800 women, in the province. Of them, only 5,500 have been allotted state land.
The government promised that the rest of the Lumberdars would also be allotted land, 12 acres per village headman, within three months as state land to the tune of hundreds of thousands of acres had been retrieved from illegal grabbers between 2018 and 2021. The authorities concerned were directed in June last to issue orders for the allotments.
As an additional incentive, permission was also granted for abolishing the fee for an honorary licence of 12-bore gun for each Lumberdar as assurance of security of their lives and properties.

Buzdar set-up had promised to allot land to Lumberdars a year back

About new recruitment for the post, it was decided that the new Lumberdars would be selected on a merit under which they would be given 50 numbers for inheritance (offspring of past Lumberdars) and 50 for their qualification.
Then agriculture minister Hussain Jehanian Gardezi had said that the effective role of Lumberdars in assisting the government and general public had been realised and the government was working to institutionalise this role.
“It is very important to activate the Lumberdars for the transfer and distribution of inherited lands. Their services may be hired for coronavirus and polio vaccination, maintaining peace during Muharram in villages, recovery of digital abiana (water rate), running the Gardawari system in an effective manner and the collection of agriculture tax,” the minister had stated.
A former official of the Board of Revenue toldDawnon the condition of anonymity that there had been different policies about allotment of land to Lumberdars: in animal breeding scheme, a Lumberdar was empowered to even sell out the allotted land, in another he may be allotted land at any other place if the same is not available in his/her own village.
He said the policy was misused as in some cases the land was allotted over 100-km away from the village the Lumberdar was head of.
As per his experience in the revenue department, he suggested that the Lumberdars should be offered honoraria instead of land as allotment of land away from the headman’s own village might divert his attention to the area where he had been given the land.

17,Harking back: Story of Lahore’s most beautiful boulevard,In our school and college days we used to walk every evening from our house on Rattigan Road to Charing Cross on The...,"In our school and college days we used to walk every evening from our house on Rattigan Road to Charing Cross on The Mall and back. It was a routine walk for one met friends galore. My father described it as “one of the sub-continent’s most beautiful”.
The story of The Mall is a mere 165 years old, and came about after the events of 1857. So in this piece let us explore its history, and, naturally, we will first consider the beginning. So let us start from Lower Mall, where a few structures stood before the British came. To the south of the Walled City stood the Civil Secretariat, built by the French as a residence of the Sikh’s Fauj-e-Khas commander General Jean Battiste Ventura, a French-Italian soldier of Napoleon.
But before the first main building came up, it was a garden in which the tomb of the beautiful Anarkali was built. Allegedly she was buried alive for having an eye on Prince Shah Jehan, even though she was part of the harem of his father Emperor Akbar. So Ventura got this first house built in Anarkali’s garden, and slowly around this house an entire administrative structure came up.
Near the Walled City was the Horse Coach building of the Sikhs, from where carriages left for and returned from Amritsar. It was built on a mound, and once the British came it became part of the Government College Lahore, being used as the college gymnasium. So between these two main buildings to the east was Anarkali Bazaar. In between was the ‘baradari’ of Wazir Khan in the Old Anarkali garden.
The events of 1857 saw East India Company sepoys revolting and attacking Company soldiers and employees. Those arrested were blow up by cannon in the empty space outside the bazaar, which housed the first cantonment of Lahore. It is a massacre never reported, intense that it was. Old Anarkali as we now call it was the first British cantonment of Lahore. Later as the East India Company settled down the Tollinton Market, originally called the Great Exhibition Hall, came up at this place. At this point the British realised that expanding a cantonment in the middle of a busy bazaar was ‘dangerous’. So a famous incident took place.
The first administrators of Lahore after its capture in 1849 were three persons, they being brothers Henry and John Lawrence and a top British bureaucrat Charles Mansel. One day as the three were out on a morning ride, they met the Commander-in-Chief of British India, Sir Charles Napier, on his horse. Before they could exchange greeting Napier called out: “I know you want to discuss where the new Lahore Cantonment will be.” So they followed Napier as he galloped eastwards about five miles. In the middle of a field they stopped and he announced: “This is where the new cantonment will be.”
That spot today is where the roundabout now having the first church of the cantonment, as well a few bakery stores and a bank exist. It is where today Abid Majeed Road and Tufail Road cross. These roads were originally named Wellington Road and Featherstone Road and is known as Upper Mall.
But let us start from Lower Mall and see how the British built Mall Road in Lahore. The original The Mall is the pride of England for it joins Buckingham Palace to Trafalgar Square.
The British priority for The Mall was to build educational institutions, public health centres and centres of judicial justice. So their priority was education, health and justice. Makes senses if they were thinking long-term. To the south of Lower Mall came up the Lahore Sessions Court, Town Hall, the Mayo School of Arts (now National College of Arts), the Lahore Museum, the Punjab Public Library and the Tollinton Market, originally called the Great Exhibition Hall. In between is an array of government departments, all beautiful buildings.
To the north was built the Lahore District Courts, the Government College Lahore, the Central Model School, the Oriental College and the Punjab University. All these neo-Gothic, baroque and neoclassical structures spoke volumes of the effort put in. They did for Lahore which no ruler before or afterwards has managed. Within a short time period The Mall west of Anarkali Bazaar, which stretches from the Civil Secretariat to Lohari Gate of the Walled City, came about as second to none in the British Empire.
Here we will pause to analyse the structures as representing European influenced. With time as The Mall stretched eastwards, we see the structures acquire an oriental touch. As local architects and builders came forth, they mixed gothic and oriental building influences to come up with a beautiful set of structures. The mix is exquisite.
Slightly to the east of this place came up the Postmaster General’s office, the Lahore High Court (then called the Chief’s Court) and the Telegraph office, and in between the YMCA and other new buildings. In a way this area alone saw the emergence of ‘Lahore the Beautiful’ of the British era. Even today it is a unique set of architecture and represents the best of oriental and western amalgamated design.
Then followed the emergence of the buildings sponsored by local business houses. At the high court corner we have the Cathedral School and its church, and behind it nearby is the Sacred Heart School, while a small distance ahead on the southern side you have the St. Anthony’s school and its beautiful church. In these schools the elite were educated.
Ahead is where they built Charing Cross, named after a similar place in London at the end of The Mall there. In London six roads lead out, but in Lahore five, or let’s say ‘six’ if both directions of The Mall are considered. Here a beautiful Mughal-style structure was erected and a magnificent statue of Queen Victoria was put in place. ‘Malika da Buth’ old folk still call the place.
Come Pakistan and it was removed and now lies in a basement of the Lahore Museum. Gen Ziaul Haq replaced with a wooden structured replica of the Holy Quran, which no longer is there. Opposite the Victoria statue of Charing Cross, the Freemason’s Hall came up and behind it the Lahore Zoo and Lawrence Gardens, in which two beautiful buildings, the Lawrence Hall and the Montgomery Hall, which housed the first Lahore Gymkhana came up. Originally, this club was founded by officers near the shrine of Ali Hajveri. Opposite the Civil Secretariat is the Roberts Club, where the first snooker tables were put in place. This is where the ‘Thug Campaign’ was planned.
Beyond this is the Governor House, originally a Mughal era tomb of a saint and later the resident of a Sikh general. Beyond this the British built the huge Aitchison College for the landed elite of Punjab, and opposite this came about a massive residential area for senior government officers, call the GOR, or Government Officers Residences.
So The Mall moves on to the new Mian Mir Cantonment. But just what did The Mall represent? The initial buildings reflected the finest of the British Raj, which no doubt incorporated oriental influences. As we move eastwards the oriental touch can be increasingly seen, some exquisite. It is the finest boulevard in the land now called Pakistan.
The newer developments of Gulberg and the huge Defence Society do have their boulevards, but not a patch on The Mall. The nearest is the Sir Ganga Ram designed Model Town, for it has managed to retain its greenery. But still just as ‘Lahore is Lahore’, so is ‘The Mall is The Mall’.
