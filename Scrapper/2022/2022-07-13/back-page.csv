0,‘Steps needed to contain population boom’,"Seek to ""normalise family planning""; UN says Asian demographic expansion to tip world population over 8bn by November.","ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi and other stakeholders have sought measures to restrict population growth in Pakistan by “normalising family planning” as a report by the United Nations suggests that the global population could zoom past 9.7 billion in 2050 with half of the projected increase concentrated in eight countries, including Pakistan.
As the global population will surpass eight billion in November this year, the eight countries, in addition to Pakistan, responsible for this boom are Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, the Philippines and Tanzania, the ‘World Population Prospects 2022’ report released by the UN a day earlier to mark the World Population Day disclosed. 
As per the latest projections, the population could grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030 and 9.7 billion in 2050, before reaching a peak of around 10.4 billion people during the 2080s. “Half of the eighth billion added to the world population as a result of Asia’s demographic expansion,” the report revealed. It added that India was on its way to surpassing China as the world’s most populous country in 2023 whereas the global population will reach eight billion on November 15, it said. 
In 1990, Pakistan was in the eighth position among the world’s 10 most populous countries; however, in 2022, the country ranked fifth among the top 10 countries, and in 2050 Pakistan is projected to remain in the same position.

UN says ‘Asian demographic expansion’ to tip world population over 8 billion by November

Global life expectancy at birth reached 72.8 years in 2019, an improvement of almost 9 years since 1990. But in 2021, life expectancy for the least developed countries lagged 7 years behind the global average. In many developing countries, the share of the population at working ages (between 25 and 64 years) has been increasing.
It took hundreds of thousands of years for the world population to grow to one billion — then in just another 200 years or so, it grew sevenfold. In 2011, the global population reached the seven billion mark; it stands at almost 7.9 billion in 2021.
‘Population boom not sustainable’
Meanwhile, in Pakistan, the burgeoning population growth is threatening the sustainable lifestyle along with the changes in climate that are compounding the problem faced by the country of over 225 million citizens. 
To tackle the problem, the government is exercising all options to sensitise the the general public on negative implications of population growth.
President Dr Arif Alvi, in his message on the population day, referred to the meagre resources and urged awareness among the masses about the importance of containing the population growth rate for the sake of better healthcare, a stable economy, and sustainable social life.
The president cautioned, “If we don’t make a serious change, this population is likely to double in the next 30 years.”
“The data shows that the maternal mortality ratio in Pakistan stands at 186 deaths per 100,000 live births.

1,One Rajapaksa flees after brother prevented from leaving,"Colombo court takes custody of $50,000 in cash left behind at presidential palace...","COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s embattled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa flew out of the country in the wee hours of Wednesday morning in a military plane heading to the neighbouring Maldives, local officials said, following widespread protests against him. 
The 73-year-old leader, his wife and a bodyguard were among four passengers on board an Antonov-32 aircraft which took off from the main international airport, immigration officials said. 
Earlier, he had headed to a naval base on Tuesday with a view to fleeing his island by ship following a humiliating standoff at the airport, official sources said. 
Immigration officials also said they prevented the president’s brother and former finance minister Basil Rajapaksa from flying out of the country, as anger mounted against the powerful family for a debilitating economic crisis. 

Colombo court takes custody of $50,000 in cash left behind at presidential palace

Gotabaya Rajapaksa had promised to resign to clear the way for a “peaceful transition of power” following widespread protests against him over the country’s worst economic crisis. 
The 73-year-old leader fled his official residence in Colombo just before tens of thousands of protesters overran it on Saturday. 
As president, Rajapaksa enjoys immunity from arrest, but immigration staff at Bandaranaike International withdrew from VIP services on Monday and insisted that all passengers must go through public counters. 
The presidential party was reluctant to go through regular channels fearing public reactions, a security official said, and as a result, missed four flights that could have taken them to the United Arab Emirates. 
Attempts to arrange a military flight to a neighbouring country also failed as clearance to land was not immediately available, the official added.
The president and his wife spent the night at a military airbase next to the airport.
A top defence source said the president’s closest military aides were discussing the possibility of taking him and his entourage overseas aboard a naval patrol craft.
“The best option now is to take the sea exit,” the defence official said. “He could go to the Maldives or India and get a flight to Dubai.” 
The group left the airbase on Tuesday afternoon in two Bell 412 helicopters, an airport source said, bound for the northeastern port of Trincomalee, site of the naval base where Rajapaksa initially took refuge after fleeing his palace on Saturday. 
Rajapaksa’s youngest brother Basil, who resigned in April as finance minister, missed his own Emirates flight to Dubai early Tuesday after a tense standoff with airport staff.  Basil Rajapaksa — who holds US citizenship in addition to Sri Lankan nationality — tried to use a paid concierge service for business travellers, but airport and immigration staff said they had withdrawn from the fast track service.
“There were some other passengers who protested against Basil boarding their flight,” an airport official said. “It was a tense situation, so he hurriedly left the airport.”
Basil had to obtain a new US passport after leaving his behind at the presidential palace when the Rajapaksas beat a hasty retreat to avoid mobs on Saturday, a diplomatic source said. Official sources said a suitcase full of documents had also been left behind at the stately mansion along with 17.85 million rupees (about $50,000) in cash, now in the custody of a Colombo court.

2,"Putin to meet Erdogan, Raisi in Iran to discuss Syria",MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan and Iranian President...,"

RECEP Tayyip Erdogan

 
MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi to discuss Syria during a visit to Tehran next Tuesday, the Kremlin said. 
It will be Putin’s second foreign trip since the start of Moscow’s armed intervention in Ukraine on Feb 24, following a trip to Central Asia at the end of June.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said three leaders — from the three guarantor states of the Astana process, designed to find a peace settlement in Syria — would hold a trilateral meeting. 


VLADIMIR Putin

 
Russia and Iran are the key military and political backers of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkiye has provided military assistance to the Free Syrian Army and other rebel groups still fighting against Assad’s forces in northwest Syria. 
The Kremlin had said on Monday that Putin and Erdogan, who has been mediating between Moscow and Kyiv since Russia sent its armed forces into Ukraine on Feb 24, would hold in-person talks soon after a phone conversation in which they discussed efforts to facilitate grain exports from Ukraine. 
Peskov made no mention on Tuesday of any bilateral meeting between Putin and Raisi in Tehran. 
Meanwhile, Turkiye said it will host Russian and Ukrainian delegations together with UN diplomats on Wednesday to discuss the resumption of stalled grain deliveries across the Black Sea. 
The four-way meeting with Turkish officials comes as food prices soar around the world due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
Ukraine is one of the world’s biggest exporters of wheat and other grain. 
But its shipments have blocked by Russian warships and mines that Kyiv has laid across the Black Sea. 


EBRAHIM Raisi

 
Nato member Turkiye has been spearheading efforts to resume the grain deliveries. 
Turkish officials say they have 20 merchant ships waiting in the Black Sea that could be loaded quickly with Ukrainian grain. 
Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar announced the meeting in a statement on Tuesday, but did not specify who will represent each side. 
“Military delegations from the Turkish, Russian and Ukrainian defe­nce ministries, and a delegation of the United Nations, will hold talks tomorrow in Istanbul on the safe shipment to international markets of grain wai­ting in Ukrainian ports,” Akar said. 
A Russian foreign ministry spokesman confirmed the meeting but also insisted that Moscow had a list of demands. 
“Another round of expert consultations is planned for July 13 in Istanbul,” ministry spokesman Pyotr Ilyichev was quoted as saying by Russia’s Interfax news agency. 
“Our understandable conditions include the possibility to control and search the ship to avoid the contraband of weapons, and Kyiv’s commitment not to stage provocations,” Ilyichev said.

3,Dutch art detective Arthur Brand recovers ‘Blood of Christ’ relic,"“As a Catholic myself, this is about as close to Jesus and the legend of the Holy Grail you can get,” he says.","AMSTERDAM: It was 10:30pm on a Friday when Arthur Brand got the delivery he was nervously expecting.  
His doorbell rang, and when he opened the door no one was there. Instead, a cardboard box was waiting for him at the door in the dark. In that box he said was one of the most sacred artefacts ever stolen from the Catholic Church: the “Precious Blood of Christ” relic.  
“(My) heart was beating in (my) chest,” the Dutch art detective told AFP in an interview about the recovery of the stolen treasure.  
Brand is dubbed the “Indiana Jones of the Art World” for his remarkable recoveries of stolen art, including the “Hitler’s Horses” bronze statues, a Picasso painting and a ring that once belonged to Oscar Wilde.  
At 52, he is one of the most famous art sleuths in the world, trusted by both thieves and police for his unprecedented access to the criminal trade in stolen art. But getting his hands on the “Precious Blood of Christ” relic was a particularly special experience for him.  
“As a Catholic myself, this is about as close to Jesus and the legend of the Holy Grail you can get. It was a religious experience,” he said.  
When he opened the box, he discovered what he hoped he would: the relic perfectly intact. The ornate container, about 30 centimetres (11 inches) high, has two metal bulbs inside and is said to hold drops of Jesus’ blood collected in the Holy Grail during the crucifixion.

4,EU freezes $13.8bn Russian assets,"""Very large part of it, more than 12bn ... is coming from five member states,” says EU official, but refuses to name five nations.","PRAGUE: The European Union has frozen Russian assets worth $13.8 billion since the country invaded Ukraine on February 24, EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said on Tuesday. 
“For the moment, we have frozen — coming from oligarchs and other entities — 13.8 billion euros ($13.8bn), so it’s quite huge,” Reynders told reporters in Prague. 
“But I must say that a very large part of it, more than 12 billion ... is coming from five member states,” he said ahead of an informal meeting of EU justice ministers held by the Czech Republic, which holds the rotating EU presidency. 
He refused to name the five countries but added that he expected the other members of the 27-member bloc to step up efforts soon. 
German Finance Minis­ter Christian Lin­dner put the value of assets frozen by Ger­many alone at 4.48 billion euros in mid-June. 
Ukrainian Justice Minis­ter Denys Maliuska said in Prague that the assets should be used to cover compensation for war damages. 
“Currently they are protected by sovereign immunity but our understanding is that assets of a state (that) started a war, committed aggression, shall not be protected by sovereign immunity,” he said. 
“We are suffering from economic losses and it does not make sense to cover all those losses by Ukrainian or European taxpayers’ money,” Maliuska added.
At the end of June, an international sanctions task force said its members, including several EU countries, had blocked $30bn in assets belonging to Russian oligarchs and officials.

5,Pakistan calls for action to offset high energy prices,"Islamabad's UN envoy says highest priority must be given to ensuring energy access to all, ""from all sources”.","UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan urged the international community on Tuesday to evolve a financing mechanism to offset the high energy prices for the most severely affected countries. 
Speaking at an ambassador-level briefing of the Group of 77 at the United Nations, Pakistan’s permanent envoy Munir Akram said that “highest priority must be given to ensuring energy access to all, from all sources”. 
This, he said, “should include ensuring equitable access to energy sources and a financing mechanism to offset the high prices”. 
Pakistan acquires most of its primary energy supplies from oil and natural gas. As global crude oil prices skyrocketed, so did Pakistan’s import bill. 
In the first 11 months of the fiscal year 2021-22, Pakistan’s crude oil imports jumped to $4.76 billion, from $2.72bn during the same period of the previous fiscal year. 
“Energy is a key enabler for economic growth, development, and prosperity. It is the entry point for the achievement of most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” said Ambassador Akram while addressing the G-77 briefing on energy.
Pakistan currently chairs the Group of 77, which is a coalition of 134 developing countries in the United Nations. The group promotes collective economic interests of the member states within the UN system. 
Ambassador Akram reminded the international community that energy was responsible for two-thirds of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 80 per cent of CO2 emissions, while emphasising the need to help G-77 nations in developing renewable energy sources. 
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), hydropower is the main renewable source of energy in Pakistan, but wind and solar PV’s shares are slowly growing. Yet, more than 40 million people remain without access to electricity and half the population lack access to clean cooking facilities. 
Ambassador Akram also stressed this point, telling the audience that 733 million people around the globe live without electricity and nearly four million die every year due to non-availability of clean cooking energy. “This suggests that with the current pace we will not be able to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” he said.  
He also quoted from estimates released by various agencies which show that rapid deployment of renewable, coupled with energy efficiency can reduce emission by around 90 per cent in the energy sector by 2050.

6,Biden views Saudi visit as opportunity to ‘reorient’ relationship,US media terms trip starting today a victory for Crown Prince MbS...,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden leaves the US capital on Wednesday for four-day — July 13-16 — visit to Saudi Arabia and Israel that the US media is presenting as a victory for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. 
The president, however, sees his visit to Jeddah as an opportunity to “reorient” America’s relationship with the oil-rich kingdom, which is also the custodian of Islam’s holiest places. 
“To reorient — not rupture — relations with a country that’s been a strategic partner for 80 years,” he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. 
But Carolyn Kissane, a professor of global affairs at New York University, sees it as a clear win for Prince Salman who, she believes, seeks and will get international acceptance of his policies. 

US media terms trip starting today a victory for Crown Prince MbS

“Saudi Arabia is on its way to getting what it wants and needs in Biden’s visit to the kingdom, the first visit to Saudi Arabia since the president took office,” she wrote in an opinion piece for Barron’s, a weekly news magazine published by Dow Jones & Company. “Biden, however, may only get a bit of what he needs, a boost from Saudi Arabia in the form of extra oil output, but it won’t be enough.” 
Other US media outlets also link the visit to the Biden administration’s “desperate effort to convince Saudi Arabia to help ease record-high gas prices, surging amidst Russia’s war with Ukraine.” 
Biden too referred to this ‘effort’ in his piece for the Post. Saudi Arabia “is now working with my experts to help stabilise oil markets with other OPEC producers,” he wrote. He acknowledged that “many disagree with my decision to travel to Saudi Arabia”, adding that “my views on human rights are clear and long-standing, and fundamental freedoms are always on the agenda when I travel abroad, as they will be during this trip, just as they will be in Israel and the West Bank”. 
In the piece, the US president also mentioned the Saudi journalist of Washington Post Jamal Khashoggi whose murder in 2018 strained his ties with Riyadh, pointing out that he had sanctioned the Saudi forces involved in the killing and banned visas for anyone found harassing dissidents abroad. 
He also referred to his decision to release a US intelligence report on the murder, but did not say if he will raise the issue in his meetings with the Saudis during his visit. 
US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who is accompanying the president, also issued a statement stressing that this visit was not just to Saudi Arabia as Biden would also visit Israel and the West Bank “to consult with Israeli, Palestinian, Gulf and regional partners on a range of priorities”. 
The priorities, he said, included “deepening US ties across the region, regional security, support for a two-state solution, and countering shared threats, including those posed by Iran”. 
In Jeddah, the president will attend “the Summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council along with Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan to discuss integration efforts to support regional stability and prosperity as well as other shared interests”. 
But the US media continued to point out that Biden “is expected to meet the crown prince during his trip” and he will not raise the Khashoggi murder in the meeting. The New York Times recalled that as a candidate, President Biden vowed to punish the kingdom for the brutal assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. But now he wants to rebuild relations as he seeks to lower gas prices and isolate Russia. 
The newspaper also recalled that during the campaign Biden called Saudi Arabia a ‘pariah state’ but his visit would end Riyadh’s ‘pariah status’. 
Other media outlets noted that Biden was now citing Saudi Arabia’s “courageous leadership” as one of the reasons for his decision to re-engage the kingdom. They credited ‘harsh realities’ for this dramatic shift in Biden’s rhetoric, adding that Biden now “seems to be practicing a form of the maxim, keep your friends close and your enemies closer”. 
“Whichever MbS is, the result is a major PR win for the Saudi crown prince,” Prof Kissane wrote. 
Media reports noted that “this U-turn” was not just about Saudi oil, but also about regional politics — mainly Washington’s concerns about Iran’s nuclear programme. The reports noted that Biden was part of the Obama administration that signed the nuclear deal with Iran in 2015. 
Former US president Donald Trump withdrew from the deal, but Biden and his advisers have pushed to resuscitate it. According to these reports, this policy alarmed Saudi Arabia, which has been lobbying with Israel, Egypt, Turkey and others to prevent Washington from doing so. The reports claimed that this issue would figure prominently in the Jeddah meeting.
