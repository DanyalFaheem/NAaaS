KARACHI/PESHAWAR/QUETTA/GILGIT: Heavy rains and flash floods claimed at least 27 lives in various parts of the country on Sunday and Monday with many houses and villages submerged, power supply suspended, standing crops and infrastructure damaged and many remote areas cut off from the rest of the population after the dilapidated roads were either submerged or destroyed.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asked authorities to closely monitor measures taken in Sindh, Balochistan and south Punjab to cope with the impending threat of another spell of torrential rains.
In Karachi, as the police and rescue officials reported at least 10 deaths owing to heavy rains from Sunday night to Monday morning, people of the disaster-hit business capital woke up on Tuesday to suspended power supply in several areas and many localities still submerged.
While the first monsoon spell may have ended on Tuesday, the Met office warned a second one is set to begin tomorrow (Thursday) and can last for four days (till Sunday). It forecast “widespread heavy to very heavy rain-wind/thundershowers” across Sindh and Balochistan.
Data compiled by the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and Sindh police suggested 49 people had died in the province, including 31 in Karachi alone, in the weeklong monsoon spell from July 4. Out of these, the police data collected from July 4 to 12 showed that 26 people were electrocuted, including 18 in Karachi, and the PDMA mentioned an additional nine coal miners who drowned when rainwater entered a coal mine in Jhimpir area of Thatta. The police also said five people had drowned, while four died in roof/wall collapse accidents in Karachi.
The maximum temperature in Karachi on Monday was recorded at 34.5 degrees Celsius. Although several major roads were mostly cleared by Tuesday morning after a joint nightlong operation by the civil and military organisations, many localities remained submerged and a number of localities, mainly in the south district, complained of suspended power supply even after 24 hours. In the wee hours of Monday, the power breakdown also caused cellular service suspension in the south district.
The city’s sole power utility, K-Electric, cited flooding as the reason behind a delay in power supply restoration. By Tuesday evening, it claimed to have restored supply “to most parts of the city”.
“Just spoke to CM Syed Murad Ali Shah,” tweeted Prime Minister Sharif. “Deeply saddened by the tragic losses due to torrential rains in Karachi. I am confident that the Sindh government will rise to the occasion and bring life back to normal under the able leadership of CM Sindh. [I] Have offered to extend every possible support.”

 





 
The Sindh CM, on the other hand, sounded satisfied with his team’s performance when he interacted with the media at the CM House on Monday evening, and said the “unprecedented record rainfall” was beyond the city’s drainage system.
“The city has witnessed an unprecedented record rainfall of 136 milimetres or five inches within 12 hours (8pm Sunday to 8am Monday) and then after a brief break it started again till 11am,” he said. “Our storm water disposal system is not designed for such a heavy downpour.”
The Met office reported on Sunday night the city received up to 106.6mm of rain that intensified on Monday morning to 126.6mm.
Later, the armed forces moved in to assist the civil administration on Monday. Pakistan Navy Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief operations continued throughout the three days of Eidul Azha in different towns of Karachi. The navy assisted the Sindh PDMA by rescuing locals stranded in flooded homes, shifting them to safer locations and draining flood water with their own sources. The army, too, was active in relief work. As many as 388 dewatering teams of the army, Pakistan Rangers, Frontier Works Organisation and National Logistics Cell cleared the water accumulated on roads and inside buildings.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Over in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, at least six people were killed in Swabi, Mardan, South Waziristan and Bajaur districts and 12 others wounded as many houses collapsed after heavy rains lashed several districts, said the PDMA on Tuesday. The torrential rains also triggered flash floods in different areas, damaging standing crops and infrastructure. Swabi, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank, Nowshera and Malakand were the worst affected.  
A rescue and relief operation was under way in the affected areas.
A woman and two children died in Zaida, Marghuz, Thandakoi and Jhanda villages of Swabi district. Seven others were wounded when residential quarters collapsed. Three people died in Mardan, South Waziristan and Bajaur districts.
According to an official statement, 154 tents, 16 iron beds, 115 hygiene kits, 118 kitchen sets and other items had been distributed among the affected families.
Balochistan
Six people died and dozens of houses collapsed throughout Sunday and Monday across Balochistan, while many areas were cut off from the district headquarters due to submerging of roads in Lasbela, Kharan, Dera Bugti and other districts.
While monsoon rains were continuing for the last 10 days, Lasbela district suffered immense damage over the last three days as over a dozen villages in the Winder area of the district were submerged with the seasonal Winder river overflowing and entering houses, rendering hundreds of people stranded.
“Over 200 houses have completely washed away in the flash flood after the Winder river overflew,” Lasbela Deputy Commissioner Iftikhar Bugti told Dawn, adding that with the help of the navy around 500 stranded people had been rescued and families left homeless shifted to government buildings.
The Quetta-Karachi highway also remained closed for traffic due to overflowing of the Winder river. Flood water also affected the Winder-Dudder road linking the zinc and lead mining project of a Chinese company “The project is fully safe and under way,” a senior official of the company told Dawn.
Rains were also reported in Quetta, Kalat, Mastung, Dera Bugti, Barkhan, Surab, Loralai, Kohlu Darbad, Chaman, Pishin and Qila Abdullah, however, no major damages were reported.
Gilgit-Baltistan
Five teenagers died during Eid holidays in Nagar and Shigar areas on Monday, while many areas across GB were cut off from each other after several link roads, bridges, electricity supply, properties across the region were damaged from the recent flooding caused by melting glaciers.  
The GB government claimed to have kicked off relief and rehabilitation activities. The floods triggered by melting glaciers blocked roads in remote areas of Ghizer, Shigar, Skardu, Ghanche, Hunza and Nagar, Diamer districts, cutting them off from each other with their residents facing problems accessing hospitals and food supplies.
Rising water levels in rivers and nullahs eroded thousands of kanals of cultivated land across GB. Meanwhile, scattered rain in the hilly areas on Monday reduced temperatures that minimised the threat of heavy melting of glaciers, rising nullahs and rivers.
According to a press release, GB Chief Minister Khalid Khurshid has directed authorities concerned to remain on high alert to deal with the post-flood situation.
More heavy rains forecast
The Punjab PDMA director general on Tuesday warned that according to the Met Department, monsoon winds from the Bay of Bengal are continuously entering the upper and central parts of the country and will create strong winds from July 13 (today) to 17.
Consequently, intermittent thundershowers (with isolated heavy falls) are expected in different parts of the country, including Lahore, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Sahiwal, Faisalabad, Multan, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan divisions between July 13 and 15, while Rawalpindi/Islamabad, Faisalabad, Lahore and Gujranwala will be likely affected by urban flooding on July 13 and 14.
There is a serious risk of flooding in local streams of the twin cities and Dera Ghazi Khan on July 13 and 14, while landslides are feared in Murree.
As per the instructions of Prime Minister Sharif, the district administrations should take concrete steps to protect the people and prevent possible losses. Arrangements for relocation of people to safe places should be completed, a plan devised for delivery of tents and food to the affected communities, medical and relief teams mobilised in the affected areas and immediate steps taken to prevent epidemics.
‘Remain vigilant’
Also on Tuesday, PM Sharif directed the federal and provincial governments to remain alert and vigilant in the wake of a fresh forecast of more heavy rainfall across the country. In a statement, the premier commended the National Disaster Management Authority for “extending complete support to the provincial governments and institutions on behalf of the Centre”.

1,PM Shehbaz seeks summary to slash fuel prices,PML-N-led govt has been increasing petroleum prices since the last week of May as it slashed fuel subsidies to unlock IMF funding.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif sou­ght a summary from fina­nce and petroleum ministries to suggest a reduction in petroleum prices in the wake of falling global crude oil rates and a few days ahead of Punjab by-elections. 
“I have ordered the ministries of petroleum and finance to pass on the reduction in the prices of POL [petroleum, oil and lubricant] products in the international market to people. They have faced economic difficulties and the relief is their right,” the premier tweeted late on Tuesday.  

 





 
The decision, according to Information Minister Mar­­r­iyum Aurangzeb, was made in a meeting chaired by the prime minister and att­ended by senior officials of the Oil and Gas Regula­tory Authority and other min­istries and departments. 
According to Reuters, global benchmark Brent crude plunged $7 to below $100 a barrel on Tuesday on the back of a strengthening dollar, demand-sapping Covid-19 curbs in top crude importer China, and rising fears of a global economic slowdown. 
A senior official of an oil marketing company told Dawn he expected a Rs15 and Rs30 per-litre decrease in petrol and high-speed diesel prices “if the government does not increase petroleum levy or impose GST on these fuels”.  
“But these are these are tentative numbers and the prices will be clear by Wednesday (today) evening,” he said. 
Finance Minister Miftah Ismail also said on Tuesday the summary to reduce petroleum prices would be forwarded to Prime Minister Sharif on Wednesday for necessary action.
“After receiving the summary from the petroleum division, we will try to send it to the PM House,” Mr Ismail told a private television channel, according to the state-run wire service APP. 
The premier sincerely wanted to give the benefits of low petroleum prices in the international market to people without any delay, the finance minister said.  
The PML-N-led coalition government has been increasing petroleum prices since the last week of May as it slashed fuel subsidies to unlock IMF funding. 
The prices of petrol, high-speed diesel, kerosene and light diesel oil have skyrocketed 66pc (or Rs99), 92pc (Rs132.39), 95pc (Rs111.95) and 80pc (Rs100.59) since May 26, when the government introduced the first of a series of fuel price hikes.

2,Imran declares upcoming polls ‘test of neutrality’ for powers that be,"Says ""Mr X"" is meeting Maryam, Hamza in Lahore to pave way for PML-N's victory in Punjab by-polls.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Tuesday warned the ‘powers that be’ that the only way to get out of the quagmire that the alleged US conspiracy against his government had landed Pakistan into would be to hold free and fair by-elections on July 17, which he termed their “first test” to prove neutrality. 
Addressing back-to-back rallies in Bhakkar and Layyah, the former prime minister claimed that the government led by PML-N cannot win by-elections without ‘massive rigging’. 
“They could only win elections through rigging and fear,” he told a charged crowd in Layyah and asked them to guard polling booths on the day of voting.
This is not the first time Mr Khan has hinted at alleged manipulation in the run-up to the by-elections on 20 seats in Punjab later this week. He has also accused the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of being in cahoots with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) in Punjab. 
“Mr X is in Lahore … we know what he has been up to,” Imran Khan again alluded to the mysterious person who is allegedly rigging elections on behalf of the PML-N. He added that ‘Mr X’ has been meeting Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shehbaz, whereas Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja also “goes and sits in their feet”. They are making efforts to pave way for the victory of the PML-N, the PTI chief alleged.
“I want to send a message to all Pakistanis and those who wield real power... these [PTI supporters] are the people who took to streets for the future of Pakistan… they don’t want to harm their country. The only option to undo the consequences of the conspiracy [against PTI government] is to conduct transparent polls,” Mr Khan said while addressing his supporters in Layyah. 
“If attempts are made to rig elections then I am sure Pakistan will face a [political] crisis like Sri Lanka… game will be out of your hands then,” he warned the establishment against possible fallout of rigged polls. Mr Khan said people who cared for Pakistan also wanted free and fair polls to be held and by-elections on July 17 will be “your first test” in this regard.
“I have asked my youth to monitor polling stations on the voting day,” he said, adding that on Sunday everybody will know where the nation stands.
Bhakkar speech
In his Bhakkar rally, the PTI chief made similar rigging allegations, referring to a ‘Mr Y’ who had been sent to Multan by ‘Mr X’ – based in Lahore – to manipulate the upcoming by-elections. “Mr X, I have been told that you have sent Mr Y to Multan to rig the by-election. Mr X and Mr Y, I challenge you that my nation will make you bite the dust and win the polls [on July 17] despite all attempts to manipulate them,” the ousted premier stated.
During the rally, the PTI chief also talked about PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal who was jeered at by a pro-PTI family a few days ago. The family subsequently apologised to the planning minister on Sunday. Mr Khan branded Mr Iqbal “shameless and coward” for “pressuring the family through agencies to tender an apology”. The ex-PM said he would continue calling Iqbal and his leaders “dacoits” as the “incumbent government had used its authority to get reprieve in Rs1.1 trillion corruption cases” by amending the NAB law.

3,"Free electricity scheme to resume after by-elections, says Maryam Nawaz","Calls Imran Khan ""enemy of Punjab"" for moving court against the scheme.","KARACHI: Criticising PTI Chairman Imran Khan for opposing the free electricity scheme announced by Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Shahbaz for lifeline consumers, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz Sharif, on Tuesday, promised that the scheme will be resumed after the July 17 by-polls. 
Addressing a rally in Jhang, Ms Sharif called the former prime minister an “enemy of Punjab” for going to court against the scheme. 
“Have you ever seen a public representative going to court against a relief extended to people?” she asked the participants. 
While reassuring people that the scheme will be resumed after the by-polls, Ms Sharif said she had requested CM Hamza to gradually extend the relief to consumers using 200 and 300 units per month. 

Calls Imran Khan ‘enemy of Punjab’ for moving court against the scheme

Hinting at a possible reduction in the prices of petroleum products, she told the gathering that on her way to Jhang, she had received a message from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that he will soon announce a relief “to alleviate the sufferings of the masses.” 
However, she blamed Mr Khan for the hike in the prices of petrol and diesel, adding that PM Shehbaz Sharif had to increase the prices due to the previous government’s agreement with the IMF. 
She said the PML-N-led government, by increasing the prices, saved the country from bankruptcy. 
Anticipating people’s anger at rising inflation Ms Maryam reassured that government has taken all the tough decisions and now “there will be good news every day”. 
Ms Maryam also criticised Mr Khan for being involved in electioneering in Punjab at a time when at least a dozen Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts were flooded due to torrential rains. 
“He should be asked about his responsibility towards KP. Yes, in other province there was US [backed] conspiracy, but there was none in KP. [Mr Khan should] go and serve the people there,” she said. 
Ms Maryam also responded to Mr Khan’s assertion that PML-N leaders Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif have already prepared their next generation to take over the party’s reins. 
“They [Nawaz and Shehbaz] have prepared their generations to serve the people. But what about you? If your politics ends today, your party would cease to exist.”

4,Two more Punjab ministers choose by-poll over portfolio,"Malik Ahmed Khan, Awais Leghari resign to lead campaigns for candidates backed by PML-N.","LAHORE: Alarmed by the ‘weak’ position of some of its candidates, the PML-N leadership has ‘sacrificed’ two more ministers to boost the party’s campaign for the July 17 by-polls on 20 seats of the provincial assembly.
Provincial law and finance ministers — Malik Ahmad Khan and Sardar Awais Leghari — tendered their resignations to Punjab chief minister on Tuesday citing ‘personal reasons’. However, the PML-N claimed both ministers resigned, as they had to take part in the by-poll campaign of the party-backed candidates.
Just a day before the Eidul Azha, federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Punjab Minister Salman Rafique had resigned to oversee the party campaign in PA-158, Lahore.
After the resignation of three Punjab ministers, Hamza’s cabinet has shrunk to five members, including two from its ally Pakistan Peoples Party. The PPP that announced support for the PML-N, however, did not follow suit despite the fact that its two ministers — Hasan Murtaza and Ali Haider Gilani — represented Jhang and Multan, respectively, where by-election will be held for three seats (PP-125, PP-127 and PP-217) out of the 20 Punjab Assembly seats on Sunday.

Malik Ahmed Khan, Awais Leghari to lead campaigns for candidates backed by PML-N; Sharifs warned of possible ‘revolt’ by local cadres

The PML-N believes Mr Leghari, former finance minister, could prove very effective in the election campaign in his hometown Dera Ghazi Khan, where the by-poll will be held for PP-288 seat. However, questions are being raised over the reason of Malik Ahmad Khan, who is from Kasur district, resignation.
The PML-N is backing 20 Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) dissidents who had voted for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s son Hamza in the election of the chief minister in April. The Election Commission had subsequently deseated them on defection. Most of the PML-N ticket holders and loyal activists of these 20 constituencies are not happy with the leadership for awarding tickets to the ‘turncoats’, thus making the position of such candidates weak.
A party insider confided to Dawn that the Sharifs had woken up to ‘reports by party men’ that the position of their party-backed candidates in some constituencies was ‘weak’ due to a kind of ‘revolt within the local party cadre against them’ and a prompt aid should be sent to them in the form of the trusted lieutenants who could manage to help the candidates. “These ex-ministers will not only ensure support for the ‘weak candidates’ within the party by luring the angry workers but also lead their campaigns,” he said.
These polls will not only decide who rules Punjab for another year or so – Hamza Shehbaz or Chaudhry Parvez Elahi (PTI-PMLQ joint candidate for the top provincial slot), but also determine the outcome of the next general elections. 
The Supreme Court has already announced re-election of the Punjab chief minister on July 22.
The PML-N-led coalition needs at least nine seats to achieve the 186-member majority in the assembly for Mr Hamza to survive as the CM, whereas Mr Elahi requires 13 more seats to add to his tally of 173 in the house in order to oust the junior Sharif.
The PML-N claims that it will bag most seats in the by-polls with Punjab being its stronghold, but resignations of four ministers, days ahead of the by-election, shows that the ruling party is not very confident in the face of the challenge posed by Imran Khan’s PTI in these constituencies. Mr Khan and PML-Q leader Parvez Elahi say their alliance would win all 20 seats and warn the ruling coalition of rigging the polls.
“Although PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz is vigorously campaigning for the party-backed candidates, the leadership thinks it also needs some other trustworthy faces than the ‘crowd puller (Maryam)’ to placate the concerns of its workers in these constituencies,” a PML- leader believed.

5,ECP probe into ‘vote buying’ by Multan candidate,Reports say PML-N nominee has been indulging in vote-buying activities by offering one motorcycle for each 20 votes.,"LAHORE: The Election Commission of Pakistan on Tuesday took notice of social media reports of vote-buying attempts by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidate and a car rally taken out by a Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) contestant without permission of the relevant authority for the by-election in the provincial assembly’s constituency PP-217, Multan-VII. 
District Monitoring Officer Haider Riaz directed an assistant commissioner and other monitoring team members to immediately investigate the reports that PML-N nominee Salman Naeem was indulging in vote-buying activities by offering one motorcycle for each 20 votes. “It has come to the notice of the undersigned through social media that contesting candidate Mr Salman Naeem is indulging in corrupt practices in the constituency PP-217, Multan-VII,” DMO Riaz said in a communiqué to the assistant commissioner and the monitoring officer for PP-217.
He quoted social media as saying that Mr Naeem was trying to solicit votes by offering one motorcycle for a promise of 20 votes. “It is to be noted that such a practice is regarded as corrupt practice and urgent inquiry in the matter is required,” he added.
DMO Riaz also issued a notice to TLP candidate for the same constituency PP-217, Zahid Hameed Gujjar, for taking out a car rally without permission from the authority concerned. The officer summoned Mr Gujjar for clarification on Wednesday (today), informing him that as per election code of conduct prior permission of the district administration is required for a candidate to take out rallies and/or hold public meetings.
Also, the DMO for Muzaffargarh took notice of firing in the air apparently by the supporters of a candidate in PP-273. 
The officer directed Muzaffargarh district police officer and deputy commissioner to arrest the suspects immediately and sought a detailed report from them.
