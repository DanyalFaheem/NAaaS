0,The dwindling market of sacrifices,"According to guesstimates, the size of the Eidul Azha economy this year is around Rs150 billion, down from about Rs170bn last year","The cattle market was relatively dull till the filing of this report two days before Eidul Azha. Traders were anxious keeping fingers crossed but many keen watchers believe that buyers will turn up in numbers large enough to sweep city mundis clean, keeping the prices from crashing despite rains in the end.
Till Friday, quoted prices were 40 to 50 per cent higher than last year but much depends on the hustling skills of buyers. In the absence of big players, there is no uniformity in quality, size and prices. The fragmentation of the livestock market in the country and the presence of countless small suppliers is supposed to work in favour of buyers but again many factors decide the worth of each deal.
Eroding buying power under hyperinflation in Pakistan must have shrunk the market somewhat and affected its composition with a greater number of people opting for ‘collective Qurbani’ options offered by an ever greater number of religious, civil and philanthropic entities. The high-value cattle breeders, however, may remain immune to general economic woes as their business is based on demand that is price inelastic. They might be a miniscule 3-5pc of the total Eid Qurbani customer’s base, but wealthy enthusiasts buy whatever animal they fancy and in as many numbers they want irrespective of the price tag.
Mostly cash-based transactions in cattle mundis make assessment and dissection of the market difficult. An intelligent estimate, however, rounds off the size of the Eidul Azha market at around Rs150 billion this year down from about Rs170bn last year, a shrinkage of about 10 to 12pc.

According to guesstimates, the size of the Eidul Azha economy this year is around Rs150 billion, down from about Rs170bn last year

The guestimate was worked taking into account Eid induced spike in bank withdrawals and remittances, activities of commercial entities and charities big and small offering schemes of sacrificial services, a spike in digital options, hide collection arrangements by relevant outfits, projections of animal skins collection by tanneries and leather industry and numbers of registered cattle heads in the government-supervised dedicated locations and their average price across the country.
Some readers might find these numbers absurdly high but people invested in the cattle trade and close watchers consider the figure very conservative.
Many cattle sellers converging in the biggest mundi of the country — Karachi, often come from afar with their stocks in search of good returns. These petty farmers or their local dealers are keen to complete the business and return home with proceeds as quickly as they can. The idea of returning back without selling all their animals is just not viable for them. They have a narrow window of a few days to assess the market and bag the deal even if the profit is less than their expectation.
The quality, the size of stock and marketing skills matter but much depends on lady luck that gets to decide their fortunes in the absence of any kind of price limits. Prices tend to be relatively high in Karachi owing to a bigger logistic component in the cost.
The situation of the Eid market varies with locations across Pakistan. In Punjab, the stronger familial ties of city dwellers with their pinds (villages) open up more possibilities. Besides, because of the rural-urban proximity in the biggest province, the component of logistic cost is relatively smaller so average prices are also comparatively lower.
People associated directly or indirectly with this annual market said the supply of animals to urban areas dropped this year by significantly more than 10pc, primarily owing to a fall in investment in cattle breeding for Eid for the fear of disease outbreak (Lumpy skin) etc.
“High inflation could pull up the nominal value of the Eid market and mask the real drop in animal trade but insiders know that the higher cost of cattle breeding/rearing and the greater health risk level posed limits on growth potential,” a CEO of a big company in the meat business said.
The Covid situation in 2020 and 2021 forced people, particularly the technology-savvy younger lot and overseas Pakistanis to switch to hassle-free online Qurbani options. Adjusting to the new normal, multiple relevant commercial and charitable organisations focus on an online presence. Today they offer multiple schemes with share prices quoted not just in local but also in foreign currencies of countries from where demand generates.
Leaders of the leather industry were focused on the preservation of hides on this occasion when roughly half a million animals are slaughtered over three days. The current wastage level is said to be a high 50pc.
“All it needs is government attention. We have forwarded suggestions at all levels in this regard but continue to watch precious raw material rot from the lack of basic care. If salt is applied on the skin immediately by butchers the rate of wastage can be controlled significantly,” Syed Shujaat Ali, a leading leather garment exporter pleaded.
“I have lost 10 years of progress in my business this year and am back to my 2012 level in sales. I can’t imagine how Eid markets can sustain at last year’s level in the current harsh economic environment when the survival of average households has become difficult,” Saqib Butt a leading player in the local frozen meat preparations market and exporter commented from Rawalpindi over the phone.
Rafique Bokhari, a successful businessman of Karachi, was not ready to give up hope and was confident that Eid will bring blessings. “Sales will pick up God willing. Countless rural families toil hard to raise cattle with the intent to capitalise on this once-a-year opportunity. They also have a right to all the happiness that money can buy,” he said.

"
1,Power sector’s blackhole,"With so many loopholes and governance problems, the government finds it convenient under external pressures to put an additional","With the government set to burden consumers with Rs893 billion electricity tariff rebasing during the current fiscal year, on top of fuel adjustments in tens of billions of rupees per month, one of the most crucial elements untouched by policymakers remains the high system losses and low recoveries.
Both elements put together entail a revenue shortfall of about Rs750bn. This stems from roughly 17 per cent technical losses and about 10pc short recoveries against billing, where a 1pc loss translates into Rs28bn. Unless this elephant in the room is tamed, the circular debt which is at about Rs2.5 trillion will not go away.
On top of these well-documented shortcomings, there are a lot of inefficiencies some of which have been highlighted by Rafique A Shaikh, the incumbent member of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), in the latest note on monthly fuel price adjustments.
He has highlighted consistent non-compliance of regulatory orders on governance issues in the power sector by the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) — the organisation that acts as a market operator on behalf of distribution companies and generation companies in matters relating to tariff approvals and financial settlements among producers and distributors.

With so many loopholes and governance problems, the government finds it convenient under external pressures to put an additional burden on consumers, crippling business activities and making the industry uncompetitive to its peers

The Nepra member has pointed out that the power system operator (National Transmission & Dispatch Company — NTDC) is required by law to report to the market operator (CPPA) and the regulator (Nepra) within 24 hours, the dispatch of generation plants out of merit order along with the reason. The CPPA has to then analyse the financial impact of deviation from merit order and take it up for regulatory review at the time of monthly fuel cost adjustments (FCA). This is not happening despite regulatory orders.
This non-compliance is a major impediment in identifying the weak links and fixing them. Finally, Nepra has now initiated, through a third party, a comprehensive assessment of the system operator for the past three years. While the process to carry out the audit of CPPA is in process, the CPPA is not at liberty to disobey regulatory orders; the failure of CPPA appears to be a deliberate attempt of non-cooperation to fix power sector issues.
As part of the FCA hearing for April 2022, it was noted that the inclusion of power plants in the merit order list on natural gas fuel that was not available for 2-3years was misleading and hence ordered that these should be excluded. This has also not been complied with. Likewise, there are several plants that either have no valid generation license or are not available for operation but are allowed to continue by the CPPA for monthly fuel adjustment.
The FCA for May 2022 involved a financial impact of Rs113bn, an additional burden on consumers. Under the scheme of law, this adjustment should have been done within the first seven days of June 2022 for its recovery within that month. In terms of the time value of money, the delay in the processing of this adjustment ultimately affects the electricity consumers or the taxpayers.
As if that was not enough, the amount claimed on account of the previous adjustment is more than Rs6.5bn. This has not been audited for which period this amount pertained, although apex court judgements and regulatory decisions required that previous claims, if any, be submitted as early as possible.
Another factor with additional financial impact worth billions of rupees per month is the Partial Load Adjustment Charges (PLAC) — Rs4bn for May 2022 for example — with a claim that PLAC was either due to no demand in the system or constraints in the transmission and distribution system although there was massive load shedding in May.
This meant the demand was there and hence the only reason for PLAC was system constraints. More ironically, most of the PLAC was on account of the three most efficient RLNG (regassified liquefied natural gas)power plants with 61pc plus efficiency. The cost, nevertheless, is borne by the consumers.
In the wake of high load demand in the system and ongoing electricity shortfall in the country, these LNG-based plants’ capacity utilisation ranged between 72pc and 87pc although their full utilisation could have minimised load shedding with cheaper fuel on one hand and avoided Rs3.14bn in part-load claims.
On the other hand, Genco-II has been the worst performer for the past many years, causing billions of rupees of losses to the power sector. The 747MW Guddu Power Plant is one of the cheapest power plants because of cheap local dedicated gas but it has been running at part load since February 2021 after damage to its one gas turbine.
The average energy purchase price for the plant in May 2022 stood at Rs6.58 per unit. Due to the low utilisation of the Guddu-747 power plant, the equivalent electricity was generated through costlier power plants with an additional loss of Rs6.06bn. “The total loss due to low utilisation of Guddu-747 from February 2021 till May 2022 remained more than around Rs53bn,” explained Mr Shaikh and has suggested a forensic inquiry to determine the exact losses in the matter. Similar was the situation with Guddu’s combined cycle units.
Also, the average RLNG allocated to the power sector in May 2022 was 765 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) against a demand of 845mmcfd that resulted in adverse financial impacts and load shedding, affecting the financial health of the power sector negatively.
With so many loopholes and governance problems in the power sector, the government finds it convenient under external pressures to put an additional burden on consumers, crippling business activities and making the industry uncompetitive to its peers.

2,Changing fortunes of lending startups,Expanding access to credit is a huge problem to solve but cracking it requires some groundedness in the fundamentals of finance.,"WIRED’s Steven Levy, one of the finest writers to bless the world of tech journalism, wrote last week about how the phrase “Gradually and then suddenly” from an Ernest Hemmingway novel has gone viral in articles and op-eds to describe everything from political bankruptcy to crypto downturns.
At the risk of being clichéd, I too will seek refuge in that phrase for it aptly summarises the unravelling of the economy and the monetary policy over the last year. Before that, politicians and technocrats alike were claiming that the growth was sustainable, or inflation was on track to fall in place in the middle-term range.
A year later, inflation has breached 21 per cent and the policy rate sits at 15pc as all talk of stabilisation or recovery washes away like roads in the rains. But our focus today is not macro for people far more qualified have dissected and analysed it in much greater detail. What interests me is how the same phrase explains the changing fortunes of lending startups.
During the capital frenzy of a now bygone era, everyone had become obsessed with credit: payment wallets built their entire valuations on the hope of someday making money off loans. Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) became all the hype by giving credit cards a venture capital brush while running outrageous non-performing loans as e-commerce players also tried to enter the race.

Expanding access to credit is a huge problem to solve but cracking it requires some groundedness in the fundamentals of finance, beyond the global fundraising environment

Globally, funding to digital lending players shot up 220pc to $20.5 billion in 2021, according to CBInsights. In Pakistan too, this vertical has garnered interest as a number of startups have launched credit products, obviously including fintechs. Four business-to-business e-commerce companies are also in the race as are a couple of AgriTechs.
Specifically among fintech startups, nine licensed players — ranging from loan sharks (sorry, I mean nano lenders) to housing finance — are doing some sort of lending, either directly or via a partnership. Of these, seven have a combined 10 disclosed rounds worth almost $50 million, ignoring Finja’s deals before 2020 as it didn’t have a license at the time.
However, restricting our lens to just fintechs doesn’t reveal the extent of interest in the space. According to Data Darbar, startups with credit products have raised over $272m across 24 unique rounds since Tez’s seed investment in October 2018. Just to clarify, many of the players are not exclusively into lending, such as B2B e-commerce or AgriTech apps with BNPL offerings. Therefore, only a share of the funding will be utilised for lending though we don’t know the allocation.
In a country where access to formal loans is a privilege, we were told these solutions would disrupt their respective industries. Generally, lending requires two things: a low cost of funds and a good credit model.
The first one wasn’t really something startups were banking on, yet at least, for most of the disclosed rounds were equity deals. And as per finance 101 conventions, the cost of equity is more than that of debt, for the latter entails higher risk. Even the supposedly cheaper debt would be at least a few percentage points above the Karachi interbank offer rate, which is over 13pc for the shortest tenor.
Without getting too technical, most startups were still building their lending portfolios using equity money, which is supposed to be more expensive. That means in order to recover costs, the loan’s charges to customers should also be higher.
Of course, as a young company one has to bite that bitter pill since the money is required to train the algorithm which then, in theory, helps make better credit decisions. The second part is a function of quality data such as spending patterns, frequency of orders of kiryana etc, which comes with scale and recurring customers among other things. Something that most players were still working on.
Offering financing solutions as a sort of user acquisition strategy was part and parcel of the wisdom from the good times when money came cheap globally. Now the market has changed gears and the central banks are jacking up rates, which means the required return on equity should also rise. That’s a bad omen for startups in general but some fintechs are particularly vulnerable. According to Tellimer Research, “most business models are likely to suffer, particularly certain lending businesses such as Buy Now Pay Later and small and medium enterprise financing.”
That reckoning has already come for BNPL startups where major players have seen their stock prices crash while the industry’s poster boy Klarna — once the highest-valued private fintech in Europe at $45 billion — is now down to $6.5bn in one year. Pakistan’s own QisstPay pivoted barely a couple of months after raising $15m in September 2021 amid reports of holding back merchants’ payments.
As an emerging market with short boom and bust cycles and a disappointing private sector credit offtake, lending is even harder to crack in Pakistan. Unless of course, it’s digital loan sharks charging exorbitant rates and harassing people while enjoying full impunity from Google, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, State Bank and the telecom regulators alike.
“I think both the opportunity is immense, as is the challenge. They’re also tied to each other. There’s little incentive to set up the infrastructure to lend to the private sector when you can just lend to the sovereign. On the other hand, Habib Bank Limited’s market cap isn’t even a billion dollars. For a country the size of Pakistan (and the potential to expand into adjacent markets), there could easily be a billion-dollar bank, if not two or three,” says Ozair Ali, a former investor in emerging markets.
“There are obviously a lot of risks that come with this. International markets can be jittery (as we’ve seen), politicians and regulators can be unpredictable, and startups can fail despite all of that for any number of reasons. I would also say that Pakistan isn’t an outlier or an exception in a macroeconomic sense in most dimensions, given that it is very much a lower-middle-income country,” he adds.
By all measures, expanding access to credit is a huge problem to solve but cracking it requires some groundedness in the fundamentals of finance, beyond the global fundraising environment.

3,Accelerating financial inclusion,"Having a bank account, though an indispensable part of the narrative, is not the whole story — having access to basic products...","


 
Access to basic utilities is considered the right of every citizen, however, the definition of basic utilities has changed over the years. We have moved ahead from the days when the word utility was synonymous with electricity, water and gas. In today’s world, the internet has also become a necessity rather than a luxury as the lack of connectivity can limit your access to education, health, finance and other life-enhancing services.
Yet, a lot of people tend to overlook the right to access basic financial services when presenting the case for the fundamental rights of a citizen. The primitive techniques used by the financially excluded to manage their finances become a hurdle for them not only to grow their wealth but also to manage basic tasks that, to an average urban middle-class person, are menial.
In Pakistan, the road to financial inclusion is a long one and although we have taken huge steps in the past decade, the challenges ahead are massive, to say the least. Digital financial services have been a catalyst in paving the way for the masses to readily adopt financial services in recent times.
However, for many, the term financial inclusion is just having a bank account. Though this is an indispensable part of the narrative, it is not the whole story. What financial inclusion means is having access to basic financial products including loans, savings and money transfer services.

Having a bank account, though an indispensable part of the narrative, is not the whole story — having access to basic products such as loans, savings and money transfer services is essential to increase inclusion

As per the World Bank’s estimate, Pakistan is in the lower echelons when it comes to financial inclusion globally. This is not without a reason. The country has a massive literacy problem that prevents the adoption of financial services. Furthermore, the overall lack of documentation and limited avenues add to the woes of the situation.
In the recent past, increased adoption of digital financial services is an encouraging sign for those pushing for greater financial inclusion in the country. As per the State Bank of Pakistan’s latest report, branchless banking accounts reached 85 million by March 2022, growing at a rate of approximately 22 per cent year on year.
This is an impressive figure given the fact that conventional banks have only 66m accounts registered with more than 16,700 branches operated by 44 organisations.
The reason why digital financial services have been such a popular product is the inherent convenience, both for the customers and operating entities. If the comparison is to be drawn from a customer’s perspective, digital financial services save them the hassle and time to travel to their nearest branch for basic tasks like paying a bill or receiving a remittance.
The inconvenience increases many folds if we consider that a huge chunk of the financially excluded lives in the rural part of the country where branches of conventional banks are limited. None­theless, the branchless banking model has somewhat reduced this inconvenience with more than 586,000 branchless banking agents spread across the country.
The delivery channel also makes sense from the business point of view. As per the Pakistan Microfinance Network, the operational cost forms 22pc of the gross loan portfolio of the sector thus single-handedly driving up the cost of borrowing for the final consumer and acting as a deterrent for the adoption of loan products.
Therefore, the efficacy of digital financial services in controlling cost increases as it doesn’t incur overheads which the brick-and-mortar operations bring with them. It is also interesting that unlike the products of microfinance which are focused on the financially deprived, mobile money offerings are used across the board.
However, the growth of digital finance and the perks of financial inclusion associated with it have a direct correlation to the progress that is made on the digital front. Pakistan still lingers behind many developing countries when it comes to mobile broadband penetration.
The 51pc penetration is still on the lower side. Further, 97pc of broadband users access the service through their mobile phones.
Therefore, to accelerate financial inclusion and for poverty alleviation, universal broadband access is pivotal.
The first step towards this would be an effective loan recovery mechanism or credit scoring model enabling the telecom companies and other third parties, including microcredit providers, in offering smartphones in easy instalments to facilitate the purchase of smartphones among low-income groups. In addition to this, the reduction of taxation on digital services and ancillary equipment like basic smartphones can fuel the uptake of financial services further.

4,The limited blessing of monsoons,"Despite rains and melting snow and glaciers, Mangla Lake remains unfilled, causing deep concern to Punjab.","Last week has been a mixed blessing for Pakistan as far as its water supplies are concerned. Within the week, the country came out of severe shortages of over 50 per cent, which had assumed proportions of an existential threat. By the time this piece was written last Thursday, Pakistan had climbed out of its shortages ditch and was delivering water 10pc more than what was demanded by the Indus arm to cover dry river bed losses. All provinces were getting water with zero shortages.
It all happened as mercury started rising in the northern areas causing snow and glaciers to melt. With it, the monsoon season began as well: country-wide rains started and humid conditions followed that pushed down irrigation demand.
Both these factors changed the water picture of the country. During the last week of June, Pakistan was receiving only 170,000 cusecs of water with both dams almost empty. However, by the start of July things started looking up and by July 7, when these lines were written, national supplies had touched 462,900 cusecs — beating all three benchmark averages of the last year (261,200 cusecs), last five years (339,400 cusecs) and ten years (384,900 cusecs). Its storages were able to cumulate 1.85 million acre-feet (MAF) of water. This was the blessed part of last week’s water story.
The other part, however, is still as miserable as it was before. Both major dams are still facing huge deficits caused by meagre supplies during May and June. Of the two, the condition is worse at Mangla Dam, which faces bleak prospects.

Despite rains and melting snow and glaciers, Mangla Lake remains unfilled, causing deep concern to Punjab which depends on it for its late Kharif and the entire Rabi season

Riding mighty Indus, fed by massive glacier melt, Tarbela Lake has every chance of recouping its losses. It is a late riser and has almost assured supplies for July and August. Last Thursday, though it was still 50 feet (1,452 feet, with 1.23maf water) below the planned level (1,501 feet, holding 3.32maf) and was only 21pc filled, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) was still hopeful that the dam will be filled if temperatures hold in upper parts of Pakistan.
The Mangla Lake, however, is the real area for concern that is ringing alarm bells, both in Irsa and Punjab. Punjab’s dependence on it during the late Kharif and the entire Rabi season is absolute. It covers 13m acres spread across 10 districts of central Punjab that cannot be served from any other source.
Conventional wisdom and the filling criteria of it dictate that if the lake is not filled up to 80pc by June 30, its filling chances get bleak. By July 7, the Mangla Lake stood at 1,115 feet: only 9pc filled — holding 0.68maf against a total capacity of 7.3maf.
Punjab’s irrigation officials explain their fears: “the chance of Mangla Lake filling 80pc is now gone. If the current river flows hold and there is no dip in Jehlum flows for the rest of the season, the lake can be filled up to 30pc only.
By Irsa’s calculations, the lake should have touched 1,223 feet (against the optimum level of 1,242 feet) by now, holding 5.89maf water if the dam had any chance of getting filled. During the Rabi season, Mangla is the only safety valve for Punjab. With it standing empty, the country, especially Punjab, will be facing the highest shortages of 50pc since the signing of the Water Accord in the early nineties. The last record of worst shortage was 48pc during 2001-02, says an official, summing up calculations and fears.
Irsa however, is still hoping against the hope and praying. “The Mangla catchment normally receives two to three spells of rains during late monsoon months that contribute up to 350,000 acre feet of water each, supplying roughly one million acre feet of water. Should that happen this year as well, the authority hopes the lake will touch 1,179 feet — with 4.5maf water.”
Without ruling out the psychological benefits of hopes and prayers, Punjab officials insist: “Jehlum River supplied routine water but with River Chenab’s flows dipping low, the entire plan went haywire. River Chenab went over 70,000 cusecs on July 1 and has been consistent with flows — enabling Irsa to hold some flows at Mangla. If Chenab dips again, no amount of water can be held in Mangla Lake even if Irsa’s hopes and prayers are answered.”
Caught between provincial and federal hopes and planning are farmers, who think that “climate change has robbed both the parent (agriculture) as well as the sub-sector (irrigation) of historical certainty. Conventional wisdom and planning about the weather, rains, snow and glacial melt are gone.
Both wet and dry cycles are getting extreme and so are water shortages and supplies. Each and every step of agriculture cycles — from sowing to harvesting, from seeds to machines — now needs fresh planning. Agriculture has historically been anchored in nature — because it is an outdoor activity and now Mother Nature is changing its ways, says Muhammad Ramzan, a research associate in the pesticides business.
Abad Khan, a farmer from Central Punjab, thinks that water mining will certainly increase but the cost of production for farmers will multiply many folds. “With diesel prices shooting through the roof and electricity supplies becoming uncertain in rural areas, water scarcity will hit crops at all stages of their development in more than one way.
The cropping sector is already in deep crisis with fertiliser prices climbing almost daily. Prices of output are capped because of political reasons. Now, if water becomes scarce and farmers have to pump it at an even higher cost, the situation will worsen for farmers and farming. If Mother Nature does not come to rescue with timely rains, and that too at regular intervals, the situation is going to deteriorate at a quicker pace than what many expect, he warns.

7,Why the hike in fuel prices is a good thing,Subsidies are adored by the public without understanding the consequences.,"How does artificially keeping the petrol prices at Rs150 per litre affect our economy? Let’s break it down into the simplest of terms.
Pakistan doesn’t have oil wells so obviously it has to import. At the time of writing this article, crude oil stood at almost $111/barrel. Meanwhile, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has put a huge strain on global supplies. Sanctions on Russia coupled with the reluctance of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to increase oil production has curtailed output levels.
Taking into account the cost of import, petroleum levy, dealer margins, refinery costs and exchange rate fluctuations, petrol price should be around Rs300 per litre or more but the price before the series of hikes was about half that at Rs150 per litre. This is where government subsidies come into play.
Subsidies are adored by the public without understanding the consequences, which is that they add severely to the increasing government expenditures. Tax collection in Pakistan is still below par so the gap between expenditure and revenue explodes as a result.

Every citizen in Zimbabwe was a trillionaire at one point because of how worthless its currency had become — without the increase in petrol prices, Pakistan could have walked on the same path

The government then has to borrow locally and make frequent interest payments from tax revenue which leaves no funds for developmental projects, growth-related investments or job creation which stagnates the economy. Since the government controls the money supply you may be wondering why it can’t just print more money to pay off its debt or make interest payments.
That shouldn’t be a problem then. The government should keep on giving subsidies from tax money and accumulate a higher national debt and then just print money to write it off.
Germany did that after World War I. It led to hyperinflation which made the German currency absolutely worthless. Zimbabwe did that just recently. The inflation was so disastrous they had to introduce a 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollar note which could buy as little as a chicken burger. Every citizen in Zimbabwe was a trillionaire.
The explanation is that when you print too much money, there is too much money circulating in the system but the output of goods and services is the same. Everybody will have a lot of money, and everyone will be spending a lot of money. Increased supply of currency and limited resources will cause prices to rise drastically and exponentially decrease the purchasing power or the value of the currency.
We need to understand that in economics there are no solutions, only trade-offs. There is either a short-term gain at long-term costs, or long-term gains that cause difficulties in the short turn.
Pakistan could either pursue a contractional fiscal policy: decrease government spending through the elimination of subsidies and increase taxes that would keep tabs on inflation by reducing disposable incomes. Or, the other option is to adopt a short-term policy to appease voters and put inflation on the backburner by opting for an expansionary fiscal policy: increase government spending, of which subsidies are a major constituent, and introduce tax cuts that would allow growth but exacerbate the already precarious state of inflation.
Unfortunately, Sri Lanka chose to do the latter. The domestic and foreign earnings of Sri Lanka took a huge tumble in the wake of Covid-19. To stimulate its plummeting growth rates, the government decided to run huge fiscal deficits.
Their public debt-to-GDP ratio worsened to 119 per cent, meanwhile, wages and price controls became the cornerstone of their economic decisions, months before the inevitable default. Inflation caused as a result of the deficit spending devalued their currency miserably against the US dollar which subsequently led to the drainage of foreign reserves to artificially keep the currency afloat. This proved to be the final nail in the coffin. Pakistan must take the long-term route towards economic prosperity to avoid walking on thin ice.
The inflation caused by subsiding petrol at the Rs150 level would have led to an inflation tax which is a kind of penalty on the cash you hold as the rate of inflation rises. Every rupee you earn and save would be worth less than what it used to be because our currency’s worth would have depreciated.
Inflation tax is not apparent or visible at the surface but it eats away at your money like a termite. Buying petrol at Rs249 per litre allows some preservation of the purchasing power of your money. That’s the beauty of economics.

8,Structural reforms hamstrung by stagnant productivity,The key issue facing Pakistan’s political economy is to equitably balance individual/group interests with overall collective...,"Independent Pakistani economists have recently called for setting new priorities for public policies to pull the economy out of multiple crises. Now an international development lender has identified ‘productivity stagnation’ which, it considers, is contributing to the country’s slow structural transformation.
“Pakistan’s economic growth has been stunted by the inability to mobilise all its talents and resources and allocate them to productive uses,” says a World Bank (WB) study.
The slow structural transformation is also symptomatic of low productivity of growth and low-quality job creation. The transformation process had accelerated more recently but a supply constraint — low labour force participation — may reduce the scope for further acceleration, the WB noted in its latest report ‘Pakistan’s Country Memorandum’.
The country’s growth prospects, the report adds, are directly associated with the ability of its firms to grow large and productive over time so that they create good job opportunities for the working-age population.

The key issue facing Pakistan’s political economy is to equitably balance individual/group interests with overall collective interests

No doubt the upscaling of firms’ operations may help boost exports but one may argue, given the current phase of economic growth, that benefits a few and not many. Neither all the country’s talents nor all of its resources can be harnessed for economic progress by firms alone. It is the entire society that has to be entrusted with the task of pushing forward the wheels of economic progress and equitably share the benefits accruing from economic growth.
But the greatest barrier is the absence of citizen-based democracy that is badly needed to redistribute rights and responsibilities widely for socio-economic development.
Political parties and their leaders — averse to the empowered representative third tier of government — appear to be keen to enlist the support of the apparently politically neutral establishment rather than consolidate their political position through grassroots participatory democracy.
The key issue facing Pakistan’s political economy is to equitably balance individual/group interests with overall collective interests. The imbalance between the individual and collective interests results in serious consequences.
In 1991, the Soviet Union’s economy suffered badly because individual interests were suppressed and the so-called collective interest prevailed while centralisation worked there at the cost of democracy. In Pakistan, we are still suffering from the legacy of a mixed economy with huge leftover loss-making state-owned enterprises to be run by common taxpayers’ money.
Often both foreign and domestic markets are rigged, and exorbitant profits are also made solely based on demand and supply positions with no consideration for production costs. The latest regional example is Afghanistan’s decision to raise duty on coal from $90 to $200 per tonne on substantial demand from Pakistan following an increase in oil, gas and foodstuff as a result of the Ukraine war.
In 2005, Pakistan’s exporters accounted for 0.15 per cent of the global exports. In 2019 they amounted to only 0.12pc. This, the WB report argues, is suggestive of relative productivity stagnation and relative low scope for future productivity growth.
Only a couple of years back, Afghanistan was the third-largest destination for exports of Pakistani products. Now the value of imports from that country far exceeds our export earnings.
In the first eleven months of this fiscal year, there was a marked improvement in the country’s export of merchandise and services to a record of $38 billion owing to a global hike in commodity prices and free fall of the rupee. But the trade deficit widened further with imports soaring to$80.51bn owing to higher costs of imported goods. Pakistan is more strongly linked with global markets because of its huge imports and foreign debts than its export earnings.
In the last one and a half months ending July 2, interest rate hikes, rupee volatility, skyrocketing fuel prices, higher gas and power tariffs etc have raised the cost of production of various goods by around 15pc, says the President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers and Industry Irfan Iqbal Sheikh. He said it would be hard to compete with regional countries in the export market.
The share in low growth of investment and exports are associated with productivity stagnation, says the WB report and adds, this also shows at the firm level with many firms not investing enough even to replace their capital depreciation. They do not grow large (or ‘wise’) as they grow old. That indicates an underwhelming of Pakistani firms in the demanding global market.
Factors identified in the report contributing to low investment include frequent macroeconomic instability that creates an uncertain environment, the financial sector’s limited capital being channelled to the government, regulatory complexity and policy inconsistencies deterring investment and the lack of quality infrastructure and well-functioning complementary services needed to stimulate and crowd in private investment.
Inflation had soared to 21.32pc in June which the industry leaders described as ‘alarming’. The monthly economic update for June and the outlook released by the Economic Affairs Wing of the Ministry of Finance have warned that the State Bank’s demand management policy was unlikely to be successful in the face of supply-side constraints and higher international commodity prices and may further erode income levels.
Overcoming productivity stagnation through the mobilisation of all the country’s human talents and indigenous resources is the only way forward for sustained economic growth. Initial priority should be set for food security, the building of big as well as small dams, increasing reliance on the exploitation of domestic coal or oil reserves and focusing on renewable energies and upgrading human skills.
No less important, the export-oriented manufacturing sector needs to look at options available for investment in import substitution with fears of a recession haunting the global market, making the export outlook a bit blurred.

9,The Russian price Pakistan is paying,We need to consider multiple options to prepare for higher gas prices in winter as well as negotiate long-term contracts.,"According to a recent liquefied natural gas (LNG) report (2020-21) published by the State Bank of Pakistan, Pakistan has a 15-year take-or-pay contract with Qatar as well as some private suppliers in Italy.
This contractual purchase makes up 87 per cent of Pakistan’s LNG imports while the remaining 13pc are spot purchases. Hence, Pakistan is bound to purchase 87pc due to the contract or else pay the penalty; the government can find good deals for the remaining 13pc only.
According to the Ministry of Energy and the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority projections, Pakistan’s natural gas supply will only meet 22.3pc of market demand by 2030. The import of LNG has managed to decrease the country’s overall power generation costs by approximately Rs234 billion between 2016-17 and 2019-20.
Amid the Russian-Ukraine war, Europe has planned to ban Russian oil and gas. Banning Russian petroleum means the supply of LNG in the EU, the UK and the US became restricted. This isn’t the first time the term “energy security” has been tossed around.

Keeping global politics in view, we need to consider multiple options to prepare for higher gas prices in winter as well as negotiate long-term contracts

In 2004, Russia invaded Georgia. Then again in 2014, Russia invaded and annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. The idea of banning cheap Russian petro products was tabled but was not acted upon. Possibly, the price of Russian energy supplies was considered too competitive for them to act upon the scope of energy security then. But not this time because Russia entered Europe’s backyard.
In response to rising demand, Qatar recently announced plans to raise its LNG generation capacity by 64pc by 2024 in order to capitalise on newly found gas supplies. Other natural gas producing countries, notably Canada, Mozambique, and other West African countries, also have declared similar development ambitions.
It seems the magnitude of potential LNG consumption will keep rising in the relatively close to near term (assuming natural gas production volumes and price policies stay stable). So far this year, Europe’s import volumes have increased by about 50pc compared to the same period last year, with no signs of a steady decline. Germany and the Netherlands are speeding up the development of floating import docks, with the first ones expected to open within the next six months.
Once LNG was a cheap alternative source of power for Pakistan. But now, given the EU’s, UK’s and USA’s newfound love for LNG compared to cheap Russian petro products, it is no longer the case. Recently, for continuous power supply during the Eid holidays, the state spent roughly $100 million for a single LNG cargo from the spot market.
“The government is considering using Residual Fuel Oil (RFO)-based and coal-based power generation as alternatives,” said Syed Zakria Ali Shah, Joint Secretary and focal person to the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division). “Some developments have taken place regarding importing coal from Afghanistan and the Cabinet has also given approvals recently.”
Among alternate options, Pakistan is in talks with Iran to import gas. The EU is also considering purchasing gas from Iran instead of Russia, making Iran a viable option for Pakistan.
Keeping the political and global implications aside, if Europe becomes an importer of Iranian Gas, its price will see a drastic increase. Hence, Pakistan should seek to enter a contract for a longer duration (ie 5-10 years) for the import of gas from Iran and strategically play its cards keeping in view the geopolitics.
“LNG is only going to get more expensive, but that’s largely in the spot market,” said Ammar Habib Khan, Chief Risk Officer at Karandaaz Pakistan. “We should try to get as many long-term contracts we can, they are still in the range of 11-13pc of crude price.”
Renewable energy, though the talk of the town, has always had a problem with its unpredictability. Only when enough sunlight is available, or when the wind blows hard enough to move turbine blades, can power be generated.
The technology for storing energy generated by renewable energy has developed over the years. This has been fueled by the rapid expansion of mostly wind and solar producing capacity, which has driven renewable energy prices down to the point where they are now competitive with coal and natural gas, making them viable options for utilities.
In the short run, Pakistan has no other choice but to bear inflation. However, we need to plan ahead for winter as well, as demand for gas increases in winter due to higher heating requirements in the EU and the US, thereby resulting in increased prices. Summers is generally a slow season, but not this year. We need to plan in advance for the winter, and for the next 5 years.

A vendor washes a sheep that is for sale in Soumbedioune, west of Dakar, Senegal, last week. Food prices in Senegal continue to rise, due to speculation by traders and the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine. During Eidul Azha, Muslims sacrifice sheep to show their devotion to God, and families buy one or more for the occasion. But the price of mutton is not the only one to go up, that of onions, one of the main ingredients of Senegalese cuisine, is just as high.—AFP

 
Bollywood’s big competitor
Bollywood has a serious rival now in India — and it’s bigger, louder and making more money than its prolific Hindi-language cousin. A new genre of epic, big-budget, over-the-top action flicks shot in regional languages is coming out of South India, some of them served with a dollop of toxic masculinity and gory violence. They’re a stark contrast to Bollywood’s glitzy dance moves and opulent wedding scenes, and they’re drawing millions of viewers to theatres. Movie makers in the south are increasingly dominating the country’s $24bn media and entertainment market, and in some cases, making their mark beyond India. Though shot in languages like Telugu and Kannada, they are drawing millions of viewers to theatres screening dubbed versions and to streaming platforms carrying subtitles. For Bollywood, that’s bad news. Consultancy Ormax Media estimates that the Telugu-language film industry — known as Tollywood — earned about $212 million last year, eclipsing the $197 million made by Bollywood, which has long been based in India’s business centre, Mumbai.

Russia’s long war victory?
Ukraine won the short war. Mobile and resourceful, its troops inflicted terrible losses and confounded Russian plans to take Kyiv. Now comes the long war. It will drain weapons, lives and money until one side loses the will to fight on. A long war suits Russia. Both sides are using huge amounts of ammunition, but Russia has vastly more. The Russian economy is much larger than Ukraine’s and in far better shape. In pursuit of victory, Mr Putin is willing to commit war crimes and impose grievous suffering on his own people. However, the long war does not have to be fought on Mr Putin’s terms. The Russian advance is slow and costly. With NATO-calibre weapons, fresh tactics and enough financial aid, Ukraine has every chance of forcing Russia’s armies to cede territory. Even though the struggle will be hard, Ukraine can demonstrate the futility of Vladimir Putin’s campaign and emerge as a democratic, Westward-looking state. To do so it needs enduring support and that, alas, is still in doubt.

Can bailouts save crypto?
A recent tumble in the price of Bitcoin, Ether and other tokens has unravelled a complex chain of stablecoins, lending platforms and trading firms that are blowing up simultaneously. What was once a virtuous circle of locked-up tokens yielding interest that would be reinvested ad infinitum is now a vicious one, as margin calls and liquidations take place at algorithmic speed. The next phase features bailouts, as the big players atop the ecosystem of crypto-speculation — billionaire-run exchanges — step in to try to stem the panic and restore trust. Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of FTX Trading Ltd., has extended a $250m credit line to lending platform BlockFi Inc. He clearly has deep pockets, but his wealth is tied up almost entirely in crypto. And while FTX’s $1 billion-a-year in revenue carries huge weight in crypto-land, in terms of credit and counterparty risk this exchange is nothing like a regulated Wall Street firm.

The secret to being a better manager
If people on your team are quitting, not performing, or seem disengaged — what are you supposed to do? 1) Take the lead: Not everyone on your team will be able to articulate exactly what they need to feel creative, engaged, or challenged. Most of us aren’t aware that our needs aren’t being met until someone else draws our attention to them. Set the example and approach these discussions with vulnerability. 2) Probe and explore: Our actions are typically motivated by a unique combination of our physical, emotional, and environmental needs. Ask your team members if they’re taking care of themselves. Do they feel appreciated for their work contributions? Are they happy with the facilities? 3) Take action: Depending on what you’re hearing from your team, you might advocate to senior leadership for a new meditation or nap room at the office, gym membership stipends, or prioritising more mental-health conversations among team members.

11,The dreaded inflation numbers,A tight monetary policy takes too long to dampen demand and bring stability to prices which is the primary aim of monetary,"The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has raised its key policy rate again — this time by 125 basis points to 15 per cent. Meanwhile, the central bank has linked the interest rates on Export Finance Scheme (EFS) and Long-term Finance Facility (LTFF) to its policy rate “to strengthen monetary policy transmission.”
Effective monetary policy transmission — or markets behaving in line with the monetary policy decisions — has remained a challenge. When despite the tightening of interest rates inflation does not come down to targeted levels within a specified period, the central bank knows what’s wrong.
Apart from several other reasons, one thing that creates this situation is that inflationary expectations continue to remain in place. Companies factor in future inflation in their total cost calculations and continue to raise the prices of their products. And markets expecting inflation to remain strong despite monetary tightening behave accordingly: they remain engaged in high activity instead of showing signs of a slowdown.
The end result is that a tight monetary policy takes too long to dampen demand and bring stability to prices which is the primary aim of monetary tightening.

A tight monetary policy takes too long to dampen demand and bring stability to prices which is the primary aim of monetary tightening

With the central bank’s decision to link future lending under EFS and LTFF with its policy rate, the SBP has signalled to firms that in future they would get concessional finance from banks under these and similar schemes but the extent of concession would be limited. The central bank has announced that now it would incentivise exporters through the EFS and LTTF by offering only a discount of 500bps relative to the policy rate.
This means that eligible borrowers would now be able to borrow from banks under these schemes at 10pc till the time the policy rate remains at 15pc. This, obviously, is a good move. Offering too large a concession to companies makes little sense because when they borrow at nominal rates even during a tight interest rate regime, they continue to produce and invest in near-future business expansion. And that frustrates the basic purpose of monetary tightening ie containing inflation through dampening the aggregate demand, discouraging spending and promoting savings.
During the last fiscal year that ended in June, the SBP raised its policy rates five times to take it from 7pc in June 2021 to 13.75 in May 2022 — a cumulative increase of 650bps. Despite that headline inflation more than doubled from 9.7pc in June 2021 to 21.3pc in June 2022. Average inflation for the last fiscal year July-June 2021-22 also rose to 12.2pc from 8.9pc in July-June 2020-21.
The SBP admits in its latest monetary policy statement that the sharp increase in June 2022 inflation was broad-based — with energy, food and core inflation all rising significantly. Food inflation in June was recorded at 24pc in urban areas and 27pc in rural areas. An even more disturbing fact is that in June 2022 Wholesale Price Index — a measure of inflation at the wholesale level — showed a 38.9pc increase over a year.
These numbers are mind-boggling and hide behind them countless stories of human deprivation, hunger, starvation, chilling experiences of rising poverty and falling real incomes. Headline inflation of 21.3pc in June 2022 means a fall of about a quarter of purchasing power within a year. A family that earns Rs100,000 in June 2022 could buy goods and services that were worth only Rs78,700 in June 2021.
The SBP keeps offering reasons for inflation rising too fast throughout the last fiscal year and for hitting a 14-year high level in June. We all know about it now — higher global fuel oil prices, withdrawal of subsidies from energy products at home, stronger-than-expected post-Covid recovery of the Pakistan economy, rupee depreciation, food supply shocks etc.
However, as genuine these reasons may be, they can only satisfy the inquisitive minds of the students of economics but cannot calm the agitating minds of the tens of millions of financially poor people who cannot brave 15-20pc inflation anymore.
But bad news for them, in particular, and for all Pakistanis in general is that inflation isn’t going to come down in the near future. The SBP says that “despite the dampening effect of fiscal and monetary tightening on demand-pull inflation, inflation is likely to remain elevated around current levels for much of FY23 due to the large supply shocks associated with the necessary reversal of fuel and electricity subsidies.” It warns bluntly that inflation in this fiscal year starting July is forecasted at around 18-20pc.
What makes this warning even scarier is that the SBP says even “this baseline outlook is subject to significant uncertainty, with risks arising from the path of global commodity prices, the domestic fiscal policy stance and the exchange rate.”
Regardless of how global commodity prices will behave in the future, the risks associated with the possible loosening of fiscal policy and further rupee depreciation seem real. The rupee that lost 30pc of its value against the US dollar in FY22 may lose a bit more value in FY23 because no impactful improvement in the external sector can take place within a year, more so in the backdrop of an exceptionally large trade deficit of $48.2 billion in FY22.

12,An IMF-directed decision,The hike in interest rates will significantly increase the debt burden of the government and the costs of its servicing but it.,"The latest shock delivered by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) by raising the costs of borrowing to 15 per cent, the highest since 2008, in an attempt to cool the economy and tackle 13-year high inflation has spawned a debate because of its potential impact on businesses, future investments, exports and government debt. Consequently, the discount rate is now at 16pc, the highest since July 1998.
In addition to boosting its benchmark policy rate, the bank has increased the costs of the subsidised export refinance and long-term loans for machinery by 2.5pc and 3pc to 10pc. The bank has already linked the interest rate on these loans to its policy rate to strengthen monetary policy transmission while continuing to incentivise exports by offering a discount of 500 basis points relative to the policy rate. At the start of 2022, the export refinance rate was 3pc and Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) was at 5pc.
Most of the financial sector and other stakeholders were already anticipating a hike in the face of persistently high global energy prices, the abrupt ending of fuel subsidies and the need to control demand after the SBP said in its last policy statement the economy had rebounded much more strongly than anticipated.
“This combined action continues the monetary tightening underway since last September aimed at ensuring a soft landing of the economy amid very high growth in the last two years, multi-year high inflation, record imports, as well as an exceptionally challenging and uncertain global environment,” the SBP says. Besides, the action should help cool economic activity, prevent a de-anchoring of inflation expectations and support the rupee, it added.

The hike in interest rates will significantly increase the debt burden of the government and the costs of its servicing but it cannot control supply shock driven inflation

Against this challenging backdrop, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted the importance of strong, timely and credible policy actions to moderate domestic demand, prevent compounding of inflationary pressures and reduce risks to external stability.
Many analysts and businessmen suspect that the SBP decision is driven mainly by the consideration to meet the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions rather than just targeting what Bloomberg has recorded as Asia’s second-fastest inflation, questioning its utility in containing imported inflation caused by elevated global energy and food prices. Not only that the bank has raised its policy rate it has also kept its options of boosting the rates in its next MPC meeting scheduled for August as well.
The SBP expects the deal with the IMF to close very very soon, unlocking additional funding from external sources and ensuring that Pakistan’s external financing requirements are met in 2022-23. “The pressures on rupee will also moderate then and SBP foreign exchange reserves would also resume their upward trajectory,” the SBP says.
The latest rate hike takes the total increase to 525bps so far this year. “The goal of this decision is to moderate demand pressures, anchor inflation expectations and stabilise the rupee,” says Fahad Rauf, head of research at Ismail Iqbal Securities.
“I think this is an IMF-directed decision. There is no forward guidance as such, which means that the SBP wants to keep the option open for further hikes. Although this should be the last adjustment agreed with IMF.” In his view, the boost in the costs of borrowing will hurt working capital funding for exporters while also discouraging new investments in machinery.
“How fair is it for the SBP to delay import of parts, thwarting operations of industry and to slam it with a higher policy rate? How fair is it for Finance Minister Miftah Ismail to super tax industry to save Pakistan from defaulting and then find the provinces not according with IMF conditions?” asks the Pakistan Business Council (PBC), a body representing major Pakistani and foreign corporations, through a tweet.
With the economy slowing down and the impact of fiscal measures like a reversal in energy subsidies yet to be reflected in economic indicators, Mr Rauf argues that the SBP has probably gone a little bit far with tightening looking at past numbers on different industries.
“These numbers will be very different in the coming months. The boost in the rates (at this stage) is bad as the supply shock driven inflation cannot be controlled through interest rates.
“Interestingly, SBP agrees that there is a dampening effect on demand-pull inflation but still targets to chase supply shock driven inflation readings from the reversal of energy subsidies. The hike in interest rates will only raise the borrowing costs for businesses, especially exporters. The investment will be discouraged as LTFF rate is also enhanced.”
The SBP expects inflation to remain elevated at current levels of 18-20pc in 2022-23 while dropping to the target range of 5-7pc by the end of 2023-24, mainly due to the normalisation of commodity prices, base effect and tight policies. Also, the economic growth rate this fiscal year is expected to come down to 3pc from 4pc on account of monetary tightening and fiscal consolidation.
“With non-food non-energy inflation at 11.5pc, a policy rate increase is unjustified. Food and energy cost inflation is itself a demand depressant. The policy rate increase could lead to recession and unemployment. The decision to raise the policy rate to 15pc will hurt the government, the formal private sector and exporters, also suffering from the gas shortage. It will do nothing to stem cost-push inflation or imports. Wake up — recession and unemployment are the real risks,” the PBC warns.
Asif Ali Qureshi, CEO of Optimus Capital Management, says the increase in interest rates will significantly increase the debt burden of the government and the costs of its servicing. “Almost 80pc of government’s Rs29 trillion debt at the end of May this year was either T-bills or floating rate bonds that reprice quickly. So the government will be impacted the most from a further increase in interest rate,” he contends.

18,Depositors left cashless on Eid,"Banks were closed from July 9-12, leaving no chance for clients to get cash if they needed it for any emergency.","KARACHI: Millions of Pakistanis were left cashless during the Eidul Azha holidays as thousands of automated teller machines (ATMs) across the country ran out of cash.
Banks were closed from July 9-12, leaving no chance for clients to get cash if they needed it for any emergency. Most of the ATMs were out of cash the very next day of the banking holiday, leading to problems for depositors—mostly the salaried class and those who stayed away from online banking.
Bank clients moved from one ATM to another looking for much needed cash, but were flashed with messages including “Link down” and “ATM out of cash”. This scenario is repeated every year during Eid holidays and it seems neither the banks nor the State Bank of Pakistan are doing anything to facilitate the card holders. The ATM card holders are the biggest in number among the bank’s clients.
There is a common complaint that banks do not maintain their ATMs with cash and proper care. It makes it more difficult for the cardholders to get money if they need it.
The number of ATMs has been increasing each year while the latest technology is introduced to digitise banking transactions. However, the ATM technology is working poorly and adding to depositor’s misery.
In the first two or three days of each month, ATMs go out of cash or do not work in most places.

19,Reserves fall as external debt servicing rises,The increasing size in each quarter indicates the government has been borrowing dollars at higher commercial rates.,"KARACHI: Pakistan could face a serious problem as its foreign exchange reserves fast depleting amid rising external debt servicing.
The country’s external debt servicing rose to $10.886 billion in the first three quarters of 2021-22 compared to $13.38bn in the entire FY21.
It was just $1.653bn in 1QFY22 against $3.51bn in the first quarter of 2020-21. However, the debt servicing jumped to $4.357bn in 2QFY22 and further to $4.875bn in 3QFY22.
The country has been facing a serious threat from its external front as the State Bank of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves fell to single digits despite a $2.3bn inflow from China late last month.
The increasing size of the external debt servicing in each quarter indicates the government has been borrowing dollars at higher commercial rates to meet its foreign debt repayment obligations. 
The PML-N-led coalition didn’t disclose the rate at which it had borrowed $2.3bn from China. Initially, Beijing had agreed to roll over the syndicated loans before the ouster of the PTI government. However, the Shehbaz administration had to wait for two months to secure the Chinese loan.
The financial sector and other stakeholders of the economy are still not satisfied with the hidden cost of the Chinese loan. The market is full of speculations that Chinese loans were taken at a very high rate. 
Finance Minister Miftah Ismail has been assuring Pakistanis that the release of the $1bn tranche is expected in a few days but three months have gone without a satisfactory reply from the IMF. Bankers believe that the fund is dictating the government like Washington to do more.
Since the IMF has stopped funding the country is not getting project funding from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.
A senior analyst said that the Chinese knew that Pakistan was unable to return to the international debt market and the IMF was not in a hurry to help Islamabad. This was the reason for Chinese lent the money at a very high rate. 
Pakistan has been paying debt servicing through commercial borrowing which means more external debt servicing in the next financial year. The two governments in FY22 could not control the influx of huge imports totalling $80bn creating a large current account deficit (CAD).
So far the CAD in 11MFY22 reached $15.199bn compared to just $1.183bn in the same period of last fiscal year. The huge CAD is alone enough to understand the external weakness of the economy.
Despite record remittances and exports, the country is unable to get dollars from the international debt market.

20,Crypto trading: Gulf exchange seeks entry into Pakistan,Data reveals Pakistan booked profits of over $604 million in crypto trading during 2021.,"KARACHI: Bahrain-based Rain Financial, a trading platform for cryptocurrencies, is persuading local regulators to issue a legal framework for the formalisation of crypto trading in Pakistan.
Speaking to Dawn in a recent interview, Rain Financial Country General Manager Zeeshan Ahmed said the trading in crypto assets — digital currencies in which transactions are verified and recorded by a decentralised system — currently exists in a regulatory “no man’s land”.
“There’s no law that declares crypto illegal. Have the authorities frowned upon crypto? Yes. But issuing a statement is one thing and translating it into a law is another,” he said.
Former central bank governor Dr Reza Baqir said in March the risks of using cryptocurrencies outstripped benefits. Earlier, the central bank issued a formal notice advising the general public to be cautious of, and refrain from, trading cryptocurrencies.
“Negotiations are taking place. These are large-impact decisions involving lots of ideas and proposals,” Mr Ahmed said, expressing hope that the authorities will realise the benefits of formalising an activity that’s already going on outside of the regulatory ambit.
According to data platform website Chainalysis, Pakistanis booked profits of more than $604 million in crypto trading during 2021. Pakistan is also among the top-ranking countries on the Global Crypto Adoption Index. This is despite the fact that the central bank doesn’t recognise cryptocurrencies as legal tender and, as such, hasn’t licensed any exchange to facilitate their trading.
Yet Pakistanis trade digital coins on crypto exchanges like Binance in peer-to-peer transactions. In simple words, buyers and sellers agree to trade coins on the exchange’s app, which leads to the same assets going into an escrow/frozen account. The buyer then transfers money to the seller within a short time window and produces the proof of payment to the trading platform to gain possession. Alternatively, one can use a hundi/hawala channel to buy or sell coins on a crypto exchange. The unregulated structure of trading means the government gets zero tax on any capital gains booked by investors.
“We believe in regularised, licensed platforms. When we want to move into a market, we first engage the regulator and show it the value-add and benefits (of cryptocurrencies). Unregulated markets like Pakistan face capital flight and risks to individuals and institutions,” said Mr Ahmed.
Rain Financial was incorporated in the sandbox of the central bank of Bahrain in 2017 as a crypto asset company. The federal monetary authority issued a crypto policy framework in 2018 and the company received its licence in 2019.
Mr Ahmed said the exchange is a major crypto trading platform in the markets it already operates in. The estimated volume of crypto trading in 2021 was close to $100 billion. “Our share was $2bn. A regional player currently, we’re poised to become a global one,” he said.
Crypto enthusiasts present digital currencies as a reliable medium of exchange, store of value, hedge against inflation, and a safe investment in the event of a catastrophe — attributes that have conspicuously been missing from the 10,000-plus cryptocurrencies that currently exist.
Rain Financial’s bid to enter the Pakistani market couldn’t have come at a less opportune time. As much as $2 trillion has been wiped out of the combined market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies over the last six months. The crash is so big that China’s Blockchain-based Service Network, a government-linked initiative to promote the commercial adoption of blockchain technology, has called cryptocurrencies the biggest Ponzi scheme in the history of humankind.
Mr Ahmed said momentary setbacks shouldn’t be construed as the final verdict of history. The ongoing evolution of cryptocurrencies, in his view, is as consequential an event as the industrial revolution.
“This volatility looks excessive in the short term, but it isn’t. The global (crypto) adoption (rate) is only seven per cent,” he said, noting that volatility will come down in the long run.
Mr Ahmed expects Pakistan’s will be a high-volume, low-transaction market for Rain Financial once the regulators allow formal trading of cryptocurrencies. Around 2m Pakistanis have so far downloaded the apps of crypto exchanges. The number will likely go up four times once the authorities grant legal cover to cryptocurrencies, he said.
“Within one year (of trade formalisation), I expect that 70-80m Pakistanis will be trading $7-10 worth of crypto assets a month each,” he said.

21,FMCG companies post robust earnings,Manufacturers have frequently reduced per-unit weight while jacking up prices of their goods.,"KARACHI: Sales and profits of food and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies have gone up substantially since 2019 despite Covid-19 and ever-increasing fuel costs, global freight charges and taxation.
The financial accounts of listed companies do not mention quantities of goods sold. As such, higher revenues may well be an outcome of frequent price hikes. Manufacturers have been reducing the per-unit quantity/weight of their goods while jacking up the prices frequently.
Sales of Unilever Pakistan Food Ltd for the calendar year 2021 soared to Rs 19.8 billion, up from Rs15.5bn in 2020. Its net profit stood at Rs5.17bn in 2021, up from Rs3.8bn a year ago. Sales in the January-March quarter climbed to Rs6.55bn from Rs5bn a year ago while net profit soared to Rs1.8bn from Rs1.45bn in the same quarter of 2021.
FrieslandCampina Engro Pakistan Ltd registered sales of Rs52bn in 2021 from the preceding year’s Rs44bn. Its net profit stood at Rs1.8bn against Rs176 million in 2020. Sales in the latest quarter surged to Rs14bn from Rs11.5bn a year ago. Quarterly profit for the period stood at Rs664m versus Rs547m in the year-ago period.

Manufacturers have frequently reduced per-unit weight while jacking up prices of their goods

Sales of Colgate Palmolive Pakistan Ltd in the year ending on June 30, 2021 stood at Rs67bn compared to Rs57.8bn in the preceding year. Its net profit surged to Rs5.6bn from Rs4.8bn over the same period.
Sales of National Foods Ltd for the nine months ending on March 31, 2022 grew to Rs33bn from Rs25.5bn in the year-ago period. Its net profit was Rs2.21bn in the latest nine months versus Rs1.56bn in the comparable period of the preceding fiscal year.
Gross sales of Ismail Industries Ltd for the nine months ending on March 31, 2022 improved to Rs49bn versus Rs35bn in the same period of 2020-21. Its net profit grew to Rs1.9bn from Rs1.5bn in the same period.
Bata Pakistan Ltd recorded a net turnover of Rs14bn in 2021, up from Rs11.7bn in 2020. Its net profit remained Rs546m, up from a loss after tax of Rs627m in 2020.
Nestle Pakistan Ltd has planned an investment of Rs3bn in 2022 to increase its operational reliability and capacity. It invested Rs2.6bn in expansion projects in 2021. The company grew its sales by 12.2pc per cent to Rs133.3bn in 2021 despite the challenges caused by the pandemic. Its net profit soared 43pc to Rs12.7bn in 2021.
Financial results of the textile sector also remained upbeat owing to local sales and exports. Net profit of Sapphire Textile Mills Ltd increased to Rs10bn in the first nine months of 2021-22 from Rs5bn reported in the comparable period of the preceding fiscal year.
Nine-month earnings of Gul Ahmed Textile Mills Ltd surged to Rs6.1bn in July-March, up from Rs3.6bn a year ago.
Pak Kuwait Investment Company Head of Research Samiullah Tariq said impressive financial results are reflective of population growth, increased awareness about branded/packaged items, rising urbanisation and a high GDP growth rate.
He said no alternative is available for food items as people cannot stop consuming them irrespective of their prices. When asked as to why companies refrain from giving any details of quantities with sales in their financial results, he said they fear that consumers would evaluate the price factor and the costs of goods sold easily. Besides, there are also competition concerns, he added.
In June, the consumer price index hit a 14-year high of 21.3pc.

22,STZA blamed for disturbing investments in IT sector,ISLAMABAD: Both the Ministry of Information Technology (MoIT) and the Board of Investment (BoI) have conveyed their...,"ISLAMABAD: Both the Ministry of Information Technology (MoIT) and the Board of Investment (BoI) have conveyed their concerns to the government that the Special Technology Zone Authority (STZA) was disturbing investments and interfering in their functions.  
The MoIT and BoI have lodged different complaints with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif stating that the STZA was interfering in their domain and confusing investors by offering different incentives for the same service.  
Sources in the MoIT confirmed that Minister for Information Technology Syed Aminul Haq directly told the prime minister that the STZA was offering incentives to the existing players in the IT and telecom field, and for the same business.  
“The IT ministry took several years to develop base for the freelancers and implement a comprehensive mobile sets manufacturing policy,” said a senior official of the MoIT. “But since its establishment around eight months back the STZA has been inviting the IT experts and manufacturing units etc in their zones offering higher incentives – but this leads to confusion as a result nobody is a gainer.”  
Responding to a question, Aminul Haq acknowledged that he had some concerns and said duplication of functions had to be avoided at all levels.  
Similarly, the BoI too had forwarded a request to PM Sharif stating that harmonisation of the STZA law and BoI function was essential.  
“The investment promotion agency of the country was BoI, but out of its 22 functions 18 were in the STZA law too,” said a senior official of the BoI, adding: “The issue is when foreign investors arrive and investment opportunities are offered in economic zones etc the STZA offer higher incentives to same investors and it has happened several times in the past few months.” 
The prime minister has directed the complaints to Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal for addressing the issue. The minister recently held a meeting with the BoI and STZA and directed them to remove all bottlenecks and develop synergy amongst themselves to attract investments.  
The minister said that there was a need to develop synergy between the BoI and STAZ to attract more investors in the country. 
The meeting, attended by STZA CEO Amer Hashmi, BoI Additional Secretary Khashihur Rehman, the executive director and other officials, noted that the STZA came into existence in October 2021 under an Act of Parliament and was being operated under the Cabinet Division. 
The key objective of STZA is to boost Pakistan’s Knowledge Economy through the development of a technology ecosystem by leveraging the Triple Helix Model of Innovation. “There should be clarity on existing laws between STZA and Special Industrial Economic Zones SIEZs,” Ahsan Iqbal said.

23,Airlift shuts down operations in Pakistan,"Firm already shut down its operations in second-tier cities like Faisalabad, Hyderabad and Peshawar a couple of months back.","KARACHI: Quick commerce startup Airlift is shutting down permanently, online publication Deal Street Asia reported late on Tuesday.
Airlift was initially a bus service that later pivoted to the last-mile delivery segment. It raised $85 million last year in the largest funding round by any local startup.
The firm shut down its operations in second-tier cities like Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Hyderabad and Peshawar a couple of months back. It also sacked almost one-third of its employees to reduce the salary bill.
According to startup data portal Crunchbase, the company had raised a total of $109.2m in six rounds, with Future Positive and Moving Capital among its most recent investors.
The start-up ecosystem in Pakistan has been in turmoil for the last couple of months with a number of prominent players announcing service suspensions, rollbacks and layoffs.
Ride-hailing service Careem recently suspended its food delivery service, citing shifting economic conditions. App-based bus service Swvl also suspended its services in Karachi, Lahore Islamabad and Faisalabad last month because of the “global economic downturn”.
Freight management start-up Truck It In referred to the “global economic uncertainty” when it “recalibrated” its strategy recently and moved some of its staffers to “solve other challenges”.
Startups are struggling to find new funding for rapid customer acquisition. Venture capitalists aren’t willing to write blank cheques anymore to help startups acquire new customers at a heavy price. Investors are asking entrepreneurs to hit early breakevens instead of focusing solely on revenue mobilisation.
No wonder startups raised a total of $103.8 million in 22 deals in the April-June quarter, down almost 40 per cent from the preceding quarter when the flows amounted to $173m.

24,"Euro drops to dollar parity, oil plunges",Oil prices down on concerns of wider recession as central banks hike interest rates.,"LONDON: The euro struck parity with the dollar for the first time in nearly 20 years on Tuesday as a cut in Russian gas supplies to Europe heightened fears of a recession in the eurozone.
The European single currency hit exactly one dollar — its lowest level since December 2002 — before bouncing back to as high as $1.0070.
Oil prices plunged on concerns of a wider recession as central banks hike interest rates to fight decades-high inflation, with both main contracts falling back under $100 per barrel at one point.
Global benchmark Brent crude tumbled to below $100 a barrel on Tuesday due to a stronger dollar, demand-sapping  Covid-19 curbs in top crude importer China and fears of a global  economic slowdown. 
Brent crude futures were down by $7.62, or 7.1pc, at $99.48 a barrel by 11:04 a.m. ET (1504 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude was down $7.69, or 7.3pc, at $96.42. 
While European stocks initially moved lower, they rallied in afternoon trading to finish higher. Wall Street’s main stock indices were also up in late morning trading.
“Rising inflation, stalling economic growth, and more recently fears that Russia could cut gas supplies have pulled the euro lower,” said Fiona Cincotta at City Index.
“The nail in the coffin today was dire data showing that economic confidence in Germany fell to a decade low,” she added.
Russian energy giant Gazprom on Monday began 10 days of maintenance on its Nord Stream 1 pipeline — with Germany and other European countries watching anxiously to see if the gas comes back on.
“The gas crisis has really spooked markets over the eurozone economy,” Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson told AFP.
Oil and gas prices have rocketed this year after economies reopened from Covid lockdowns and following the invasion of Ukraine by major energy producer Russia, which raised concerns whether supplies will be adequate.

25,Exporters question ITI train viability amid massive delays,"No trader has so far booked any consignment for the 7th train as they have ""lost trust"".","LAHORE: The Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul freight train operation, which has been resumed in December 2021 after a pause of around a decade, appears to be slowing down as none of the exporters has so far booked any consignment for the 7th train despite a lapse of over 30 days.
The massive delay in the arrival of the trains in Turkey, damage caused to goods en-route, quarrels among the freight forwarders on charges, lack of ownership allegedly on the part of Pakistan Railways (PR) and other administrative and technical issues are the reasons behind slowing down of the ITI train operation, Dawn has learnt.
“What will you do when your goods, which are supposed to reach Turkey within 17 days or so under a commitment, take much more time to reach the destination safely. That is why the composition of the 7th ITI train has not been made so far due to the low interest of the traders despite passing over 30 days,” a source privy to the development deplored while talking to Dawn.
“It shows that the business community has no more trust in the ITI train operation,” he added.

No trader has so far booked any consignment for the 7th train

The first ITI train carrying goods (mainly pink salt) had reached Turkey within 13 days -- a couple of days before its actual arrival schedule. Similarly, the second train carrying 550 tonnes of load (soapstone and other goods) moved from Azakhel dry port on Dec 28. It also reached Turkey on Jan 17 after which the loading of the third train started. And that also moved to Turkey during the last week of January this year. It, despite the harsh cold weather, reached its destination during the third week of February with a delay of around 10 days.
“But the real problem occurred when the 4th ITI train carrying various high-value goods in six containers left for Turkey during the first week of March. It first remained stuck at Taftan railways station within Pakistani territory due to customs clearance and quarrel between Pakistani and Turkish freight forwarders over share in the charges received from the exporters then at Zahedan. And finally, it reached the destination on May 21 after a delay of around two months,” he said.
About the 5th train, the source said, it was also delayed due to an accident near a station in Balochistan. The accident not only caused damage amounting to Rs4-Rs5 million to the goods but also delayed their arrival in Turkey for almost 45 days. “As on July 10, this train was about to reach Kapikoy (entrance gate of Turkey). Similarly, the 6th train is currently in Zahedan and waiting to be transferred to the Turkish standard gauge wagons,” the official said.
He said in such a [lopsided] train operation, who would bother to send goods to Turkey. And this is why the composition of the 7th train is yet to be made due to no booking of goods,” he added.
