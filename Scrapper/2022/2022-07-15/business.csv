0,Govt delivers its first cut in fuel prices,ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced a per-litre reduction of Rs18 to 40 in fuel prices on Thursday...,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced a per-litre reduction of Rs18 to 40 in fuel prices on Thursday with immediate effect for the next fortnight, i.e. until July 31.
In his address to the nation on Thursday, the prime minister said that as promised he was passing on to the people each paisa of price reduction in the international markets and announced a Rs18.50 per litre cut in the price of petrol and Rs40.54 per litre in that of high-speed diesel (HSD).
Separately, the finance ministry in a statement also announced a per-litre cut of Rs33.81 and Rs34.71 in kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) prices, respectively. 
The government did not change the rate of petroleum development levy (PDL) that stood at Rs10 per litre on petrol and Rs5 each on the other three products. 
Under the decision, the ex-depot price of petrol has now been lowered to Rs230.24 per litre from Rs248.74, down by Rs18.50 (or 7.4pc). 
The new rates of HSD, kerosene and LDO now stood at Rs236, Rs196.45 and Rs191.44, respectively.  
Under a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the government has to gradually increase PDL on petroleum products to a maximum of Rs50 per litre to collect Rs855bn during the current fiscal year. This is the first time the PML-N-led coalition government is reducing petroleum prices after it came to power about three months ago.
Between May 26 and July 1, the petrol price skyrocketed by 66pc (or Rs99 per litre) and the HSD price went up by 92pc (132.39). Likewise, kerosene jumped by 95pc (Rs111.95) and LDO by 80pc (Rs100.59) per litre during the period.
In his address, the prime minister said the coalition government came to power when inflation was at its peak and global oil prices were sky-high, but the previous government disregarded the agreement with the IMF it had itself signed. 
While bowing out, the PTI government laid landmines for the upcoming government to trap it before it could settle down and suddenly announced fuel subsidies for which there was no money in the kitty, he said.
On the other hand, the PTI government did not take the benefit of lowest-ever gas prices in the international market when the commodity could have been secured through long-term contracts at about $5 per unit, the premier said, adding that the price for this criminal negligence was being paid by the nation at present in the shape of high energy prices.
Mr Sharif said he had promised the nation that he would never mislead them, and with a heavy heart decided to increase oil prices because of the international market. This obviously burdened the common people but there was no other option except to take tough decisions, he said.
The prime minister said that global oil prices were now declining swiftly and he had been blessed to pass on its relief to the people. He also promised to pass on future price reductions to citizens. 
Referring to an IMF agreement for reviving its programme, the prime minister said many modern economies had graduated from Fund programmes 25 to 30 years ago with sheer hard work and commitment and were now among the great nations. 
He said the government would earnestly implement the IMF programme and would like this to be the last programme because self-reliance was the only path for nations to stand on their feet and earn respect among the comity of nations.
“But this is not an easy path,” he said, adding that this would require a lot of hard work, commitment and trust in Almighty Allah. The prime minister said the coalition government, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and all other leaders of the coalition partners would take Pakistan to new heights of development and stability with unity, commitment, equanimity and sincere efforts.
The prime minister said Pakistan would have to learn lessons from past mistakes like those in the shape of Neelum-Jhelum project which was completed at a cost of $5bn because of over 20 years of delays instead of its completion envisaged in $1bn. 
Similar was the case with a 1,250-megawatt, LNG-based power project launched by Nawaz Sharif which should have been completed two years ago but was still not operational.
The one option is to waste public money and time and the other path is to work diligently and keep moving up the ladder. He said the government would now focus over the next 14 months on three key sectors — agriculture, information technology and exports — and come up with detailed policies for quantum jump in these areas within the next couple of weeks.

1,Hyder­­­­­abad Chamber of Commerce and Industry for enhanced business hours,Says businessmen will face bankruptcy if curbs on timings are not lifted.,"HYDERABAD: The Hyder­­­­­abad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) on Thursday urged the Sindh government to lift business hours restrictions, stressing that trade and businesses are nearing bankruptcy amid rising power prices and depreciating rupee. 
In a statement, HCCI President Adeel Siddiqui said, “Businessmen and traders are following the business restrictions schedule of the Sindh government as desired amid high electricity, petrol and gas tariffs. If curbs on business timings are not lifted, then businessmen would face bankruptcy and, consequently, the government would not be able to meet its revenue collection targets.”
The HCCI president stated that crude oil prices, which had been rising in the international market, are now lower in the international market and hence making the balance of payment easier.
Due to the water shortage in the river system, hydropower plants were not functioning properly. He said with recent rainfall cycles, these power plants would, however, now start producing electricity and this would cover the gap in demand and supply of electricity.
He urged the government to facilitate the business community so that Pakistan could progress, adding that the same business community had stood with the government in difficult times. Now, he said, it was the government’s turn to understand the traders’ and business community’s issues.
He  appealed to the prime minister and provincial chief minister to lift restrictions on timings so that businessmen could work comfortably, which was even otherwise their fundamental right. He said it was necessary for economic stability that the government should increase exports and encourage foreign investment in the private sector.

2,Banks’ advances rise sharply in FY22,Investments increase by 27pc to Rs17.419tr.,"KARACHI: Banks’ advances witnessed a significant increase of 21 per cent in the outgoing fiscal year (FY22), reflecting the higher economic growth during the year ended on June 30. 
The latest data issued by the State Bank on Thursday showed that total advances reached Rs10.886 trillion by the end of FY22 from Rs8.996tr in FY21, an increase of Rs1.889tr or 21pc. 
The financial year, which saw an economic growth of 6pc, noted a very high growth in advances by both conventional and Islamic banks, with the advances by the private sector increasing by 142.5 per cent. 
The conventional and Islamic banks collectively made advances of Rs1443 billion, compared to Rs595bn in FY21. This was a vital change and could produce a good impact even for FY23. Though FY21 also witnessed a growth rate of about 6pc, banks’ advances were much less than that of FY22. 

Investments increase by 27pc to Rs17.419tr

Bankers said the partial reason for higher advances in FY22 was cost of doing business which had increased significantly for all sectors of the economy. 
Inflation in June stood at 21.3pc, indicating the future trend and justifying higher borrowing by the private sector. 
Banks’ advance to deposit ratio rose to 48pc in FY22, compared to 45pc a year ago. Bankers believed it was a good sign for the economy. 
Banks’ investments in FY22 rose by Rs3.677tr to Rs17.419tr, an increase of 27pc. Banks invested about Rs13.742tn in FY21. 
The bankers maintained that most of these investments were made in risk-free and high-yielding government bonds like treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds. 
The auction of T-bills on Wednesday showed that the benchmark rate was 15.84pc, which was too high to attract investments, while the banks were eager to park maximum liquidity in the papers. 
The bids for T-bills amounted to Rs1500bn while the government raised Rs506bn, reflecting banks’ trend for investment. 
Banks’ deposits in FY22 increased by 15pc to Rs22.81tr from Rs19.796tr last year, an all-time high. In terms of amount, the deposits increased by Rs3.014tr in a year. 
The bankers saw several reasons for this increase, including record remittances, increasing interest rate which now stands at 15pc and tight restrictions on buying dollars from the open market. 
The general public traditionally used to buy dollars for savings, but the government made it practically impossible to buy dollars from exchange companies. A lot of documents are required to buy dollars.

3,"PBC seeks exemption for import of instruments, spares",PBC Chief Executive Ehsan Malik writes letter to SBP Acting Governor Dr Murtaza Syed.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Business Council (PBC) on Thursday said that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) should exempt the essential industries from the condition of prior permission from the central bank for the import of spares and instruments.
In a letter to SBP acting governor Dr Murtaza Syed on Thursday, PBC chief executive Ehsan Malik said that inordinate delays in receiving permission from the SBP’s Foreign Exchange Operations Department are causing difficulties to the manufacturers in operating their existing plant and machinery.
The PBC, comprising the country’s largest manufacturers and exporters, suggested that the essential industries like food, agriculture, fertilizer, or pharmaceuticals or those with active export orders be exempted from complying with the prior permission in respect of spares and instruments.
It also said that other sectors should also be allowed to import spares and instruments worth $100,000 in a three-month period under the same exemption.
The letter said that the authorities should also clarify on the period for which they would not be allowed to import the components required for production without prior permission and the time it would take to process such applications so that they could plan production and continue deployment of labour.
Otherwise, it cautions, the disruption of production would negatively affect the tax revenue, cash flow, and borrowing costs and the associated risk of loan impairment of the banking sector.

4,"World stocks, oil  drop on fresh inflation spikes","Eurozone inflation will end the year at 7.6pc, much higher than previously forecast, EU says.","LONDON: Stock markets mostly retreated on Thursday as fresh evidence of runaway global inflation ramped up expectations of more aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks, while disappointing earnings revived recession fears.
That sent the dollar rising, helping push oil prices sharply lower and the euro briefly below $1.00.
Eurozone inflation will end the year at 7.6 per cent, much higher than previously forecast, the EU said on Thursday.
The prediction comes one day after US inflation came in at a blistering 9.1pc last month, the highest level for more than 40 years, as the Ukraine war fuelled energy prices.
US producer prices rose by a faster-than-expected 1.1pc in June from the previous month, data released Thursday showed.
Market watchers are now wondering whether the Federal Reserve could hike US borrowing costs by a full percentage point at a scheduled policy meeting this month.
One Fed policymaker said publicly Thursday he would support such a hike if economic data comes in stronger than expected. The central bank in June unveiled its first 75 basis-point rise in three decades and is one of dozens to hike rates.
Singapore and the Philippines became the latest to tighten policy Thurs­day, a day after Canada, New Zealand, Chile and South Korea announced hikes.
The US inflation reading followed last week’s news of a surprise spike in jobs creation, which suggested the world’s top economy was withstanding the rate hikes, giving the Fed more room for further increases.
“Stubbornly high inflation increases the risk that the (Fed) continues to hike aggressively and triggers a recession,” said Kristina Clifton at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, adding that belief was picking up momentum on trading floors.Growing fears of a global recession sent oil prices tumbling, with the main US contract, WTI, losing more than five percent at one point.
The Fed’s drive to tighten monetary policy continues to send the dollar higher, and Wednesday it finally rose above parity with the euro for the first time since late 2002, before falling again.

ICI Pakistan will continue to hold about 24.5pc of the company’s shares after the completion of the proposed transaction.
“As the owners of the Morinaga brand know-how to manufacture the products along with its superior research and development facilities, Morinaga Milk is well equipped to accelerate the growth of (NutriCo Morinaga),” the company said in a regulatory filing.
