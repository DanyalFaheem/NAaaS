0,Defence bill limits US role in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan,"Leads to closure of detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, limits the use of US weapons in Yemen.","WASHINGTON: The US Congress passed the national defence bill for 2023 this week that will effectively end the delivery of US humanitarian aid and currency to Afgha­nistan using Defence Department resources.
It also closes the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and limits the use of US weapons in Yemen. The House Appropriations Committee approved the fiscal year 2023 defence bill earlier this week on a 32-26 vote.
The bill provides total funding of $761.681 billion, an increase of $32.207 billion above 2022.
Democratic lawmakers, however, have introduced a number of amendments to the bill, aiming to limit military support to Saudi Arabia, one of the largest purchasers of US weapons. The measures would establish boun­daries on the use of US weapons in Yemen’s civil war and would highlight Congress’s concern over broader human rights concerns.

Detention facility at Guantanamo Bay closed

One of the measures also mentions the 2018 killing at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul of Saudi journalist and The Washi­ngton Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
But the bill also underlines American lawmakers’ support for a long-term US engagement in Ukraine to undo the Russian occupation. The security assistance to Ukraine includes resources for training, equipment, weapons, supplies, services, salaries and stipends, and intelligence support to the Ukra­inian military and national security forces.
Before the final vote on the bill, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Muslim Democrat from Minnesota, introduced an eleventh-hour amendment seeking to prevent a collapse of US humanitarian aid to millions of Afghans.
The amendment came in response to language in the military spending bill that prohibits Defence Department funds from being used to “transport currency or other items of value to the Taliban, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, or any subsidiary, agent, or instrumentality of either the Taliban or the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.”
This would effectively halt American aid to the war-torn country. It will also block US Defence Department planes from transporting nearly any good — including food and lifesaving medical supplies — to Afghanistan, where tens of millions of people currently face starvation and medicine shortages.
The Defence Department provides security and logistics support for aid flights and facilitates the transportation of currency to Afghanistan. The new law would complicate the process of returning about $3.5 billion of Afghan assets that Washington intends to release.
Congresswoman Omar’s amendment would have granted President Biden the ability to waive the prohibition on using Defence Department funding to transport aid if he recognised a pressing humanitarian need or if doing so would further the national interests of the US. The proposed amendment, however, was rejected.
While Ilham Omar’s effort failed, other Democrats are hopeful that they would be able to constrain the Biden administration’s ability to send weapons and enter security agreements with Saudi Arabia even as President Biden tries to strengthen ties with the country.
“An American resident, a columnist for The Washington Post, and my constituent was — at the direction of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia — brutally murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, a little over three years ago,” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) told The Hill newspaper while explaining why he was trying to limit US involvement with Riyadh.

1,Rajapaksa’s resignation ‘finally received’,Demonstrators start to leave several state buildings they had earlier occupied,"

NEW DELHI: Police detain demonstrators during a protest in solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka, outside its embassy, on Thursday.—AFP

 
COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s president submitted his resignation shortly after reaching Singapore on Thursday, the parliamentary speaker’s office said, days after the head of state fled protests triggered by his country’s worst-ever economic crisis.
Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s emailed resignation would be examined before a formal announcement — expected on Friday — is made, the speaker’s spokesman Indunil Yapa said.
Rajapaksa fled Sri Lanka on Wednesday, after protesters overran his palace on the weekend, heading first to the Maldives and then Singapore.
“The authenticity and the legality of the e-mail will have to be checked out” before being formally accepted, Yapa said. Rajapaksa would be the first president to resign since Sri Lanka adopted a presidential system of government in 1978.

Demonstrators start to leave several state buildings they had earlier occupied

A small but jubilant crowd, some waving the national flag, danced and chanted in celebration outside the presidential secretariat as news of the resignation broke.
Under Sri Lanka’s constitution, Prime Minister Ranil Wickre­mesinghe — whose resignation is also being demanded by protesters — would automatically become acting president until parliament can appoint a successor.
Rajapaksa, his wife Ioma and their two bodyguards arrived in Singapore from Male on board a Saudi airline flight. As president, Rajapaksa enjoyed immunity from arrest, and he is understood to have wanted to go abroad before stepping down to avoid the possibility of being detained.
The former Maldivian president Mohamed Nasheed is believed to have played a behind-the-scenes role in getting him out of the country, and said Rajapaksa feared he would be killed if he remained.
“I believe the President would not have resigned if he were still in Sri Lanka, and fearful of losing his life,” Nasheed tweeted.
Singapore’s foreign ministry confirmed Rajapaksa had been allowed to enter the city-state for a “private visit”, adding: “He has not asked for asylum and neither has he been granted any asylum.”
He is expected to look to stay in Singapore for some time, according to Sri Lankan security sources, before potentially moving to the United Arab Emirates.
In Colombo, demonstrators earlier left several of the emblematic state buildings they had taken over in recent days, after Wickre­mesinghe instructed security forces to restore order and declared a state of emergency.
“We are peacefully withdrawing from the Presidential Palace, the Presidential Secretariat and the Prime Minister’s Office with immediate effect, but will continue our struggle,” said a spokeswoman for the protesters.
Witnesses saw dozens of activists leave Wickremesinghe’s office as armed police and security forces moved in. The capital was put under curfew and armoured personnel carriers patrolled some areas.
Hundreds of thousands of people had visited the PM’s compound since it was opened to the public, after he fled and his security guards backed down. By Thursday afternoon, the gates were closed with armed guards posted both inside and outside.
Police said a soldier and a constable were injured in overnight clashes with protesters outside the national parliament as security forces beat back an attempt to storm the legislature.
The military and the police were issued with fresh orders on Thursday to firmly put down any violence, and warned troublemakers they were “legitimately empowered to exercise their force”.

2,Pakistan reports 12th polio case this year,All 12 cases this year have been reported from KP’s North Waziristan district.,"ISLAMABAD: The country reported its 12th case of polio this year as North Waziristan continues to be a hotbed of the virus.
The victim — a 21-month-old boy who had the onset of paralysis on June 18 — belongs to Union Council 2 of Mir Ali area, a health ministry official said.
The child has been paralysed in the right leg, according to preliminary investigations.
All the 12 cases this year have been reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan tribal district, with nine of them detected from Mir Ali alone.
However, other areas also remain vulnerable. “KP’s southern districts, namely North and South Waziristan, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Tank and Lakki Marwat, are at the highest risk of wild poliovirus transmission,” the official said.
“Bannu also reported two positive environmental sam­ples between April and May this year, confirming that ongoing poliovirus trans­mission is not limited to North Waziristan,” he said.
KP Special Assistant on Information Muhammad Ali Saif has said the provincial government was committed to eradicating the crippling disease.
In a statement issued on Thursday, he said the provincial government was working to make the province polio-free.

3,Saudi mindset shows signs of shift towards Israel,Biden’s trip to Middle East fuels speculation around possible normalisation of ties with Israel.,"

DESPITE growing business and security contacts, analysts say any immediate gains are likely to be more incremental than the US-brokered Abraham Accords.—AFP

 
RIYADH: Israeli journalist Yoav Limor did not know what to expect when he travelled with a colleague this month to Saudi Arabia, a country long notorious for promoting anti-Israel sentiment in textbooks and in sermons by some imams.
They were in for “a pleasant surprise”, he wrote in a subsequent column for the Israel Hayom newspaper, as Saudi market vendors and taxi drivers mostly greeted them with curiosity rather than disdain.
“Some smiled and shook their head in disbelief or worry. Others were curious and struck up a conversation,” wrote Limor, adding that “no one made us feel unwelcome”.
US President Joe Biden’s trip to the Middle East, which began on Wednesday, has fuelled speculation of a possible breakthrough in normalising ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which does not recognise the Jewish state.

Biden’s trip to Middle East fuels speculation around possible ‘normalisation’ of ties with Israel

The kingdom has repeatedly said it would stick to the decades-old Arab League position of not establishing official ties with Israel until the conflict with the Palestinians is resolved.
Analysts stress that despite growing behind-the-scenes business and security contacts, any immediate gains are likely to be more incremental than the US-brokered Abraham Accords which created ties between Israel and two of the kingdom’s neighbours, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
Yet the experience of Limor, who qualified for a tourist visa because he holds a non-Israeli passport, hints at changes in Saudi public opinion that officials hope could one day lay the groundwork for a formal bilateral relationship.
US officials say it shows meaningful progress towa­rds the kind of deal that would, for Israel, represent the ultimate diplomatic prize.
“For too many decades, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was a great exporter of Jew-hatred,” said Deborah Lipstadt, Washing­ton’s special envoy to combat anti-Semitism, in a speech this month after visiting the kingdom in June.
“But what I found is something quite different, something that has changed there dramatically in the last few years.”
Potential ally
Signs of that transformation appeared well before the Abraham Accords pushed by the Trump administration, which Riyadh has so far refused to join.
Saudi textbooks once denigrated Jews and other non-Muslims by depicting them as animals and asserted that “disobedience is the characteristic of the Jews”. But they have been undergoing revisions for years, as documented by the Israeli nonprofit group IMPACT-SE which monitors textbook content.
At this point, anti-Jewish material has been “largely removed, which is greatly to be admired”, the group said in a June report.
The Saudi education ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the textbooks.
Anti-Israeli speech by imams is also “generally rare”, and the Islamic affairs ministry has encouraged a “rejection of bigotry”, the US State Department said in its latest human rights report on Saudi Arabia.
Mohammed al-Issa, a Saudi cleric who heads the Muslim World League, won praise from Israel in January 2020 after he travelled to Poland for events marking 75 years since liberation of the Nazi death camp Auschwitz.
King Salman hosted Jerusalem-based rabbi David Rosen the following month, and during Ramazan that year the Saudi-controlled MBC network aired a television show in which a character brushed aside the taboo of doing business with Israel.
Further examples have crop­ped up since the Abraham Acco­rds were unveiled in August 2020.
Israeli drivers participated in the January 2021 Dakar Rally in Saudi Arabia, and the Arab News, the kingdom’s main English-language daily, has published Israeli opinion writers.
In a sign that the Saudi leadership may no longer fear a fierce backlash to eventual normalisation, state media in March quoted Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler, descri­bing Israel as a “potential ally”.
Public opinion
What impact these moves have had on public opinion can be difficult to gauge in an absolute monarchy which places strict limits on political expression.
There is little chance of Riyadh shifting its focus to ties with Israel “while ignoring the Palestinian issue”, nor is that something ordinary Saudis would want, said Mohammed Alyahya, a fellow at the Belfer Centre at Harvard University.
“The public sentiment has changed, but I don’t think it’s changed in such a way that people don’t care about Palestine anymore, or people don’t hold Israel to account for crimes it commits,” Alyahya said.
The kingdom’s internal dynamics are different from those of its neighbours, said Brian Katulis of the Middle East Institute in Washington.
“I don’t see a broad wellspring of more openness that you see in places like the Emirates that are much smaller, where you can do sort of interfaith things and have a synagogue. I think that’s slower to happen in a place like Saudi Arabia right now,” Katulis said.
Saudi officials have been tight-lipped on potential outcomes from Biden’s visit and did not respond to a request for comment on possible agreements concerning Israel. Whatever emerges — like allowing direct flights from Israel to Saudi Arabia for Muslim pilgrims — is likely to stop well short of full normalisation.
That may be all many Saudis can stomach for now.
“It is impossible for me to go to Israel one day. I do not like them,” said Abo Rashed, an auto parts salesman in the capital who referred to Israelis as “occupiers”.
“But the government knows better. They will choose whatever is best for the people and the country.”

4,NAB won’t share information about ongoing inquiries,Decision taken in light of amendments made by present coalition govt to accountability law.,"ISLAMABAD: The Nati­onal Accountability Bureau on Thursday decided not to share with media information about ongoing inquiries and investigations in the light of amendments made by the present coalition government to the accountability law through the NAB (Second Amendment) Act 2022.
NAB also constituted a special committee to review the pending inquiries and investigations before the bureau, besides deciding to close over a dozen investigations due to lack of evidence.
The decisions were taken at a meeting of the NAB Executive Board, the highest consultative forum of the bureau. The meeting was presided over by acting NAB chairman Zahir Shah, according to an official handout.
The special committee, headed by the director general NAB headquarters, will submit a preliminary report on continuing or closing or referring the cases to the relevant department as per the law. The report will be presented before the executive board for further review and approval.
Taking a significant step, the NAB officials also decided not to share with media the details of authorised inquiries and investigations in compliance with the amended law.
“NAB is a people-friendly institution. It believes in preserving the self-esteem of every individual,” said the handout in an apparent reference to the criticism by the politicians and bureaucrats that NAB is used by those in power for political victimisation and character-assassination of the opponents.
The NAB executive board decided to close a number of inquiries and investigations due to lack of court worthy and incrementing evidence. The board authorised closing inquiries against the administration of Benazir Income Support Progra­mme, officers/officials of Karakoram International University (Gilgit-Baltis­tan), Barrister Sheikh Abid Waheed, former managing director of Pakistan Baitul Maal; retired Major Syed Khalid Amin Shah, chief security officer of the Peshawar Development Authority (PDA); Saleem Hassan Wattoo, former director general of PDA; Amin Vance, former CCPO Lahore; Zulfikar Ghuman, DG Sports Board, Punjab; Muhammad Ramzan Awan, former secretary of local government department, Sindh; retired Professor Dr Azam Hussain Yousfani, vice chancellor of People University of Medical and Health Sciences for Women, Shaheed Benazirabad; Akbar Durrani, former home secretary of Balochistan; officers/officials and contractors of the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority, and against Shahid Hussain Asad, former additional secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
The NAB executive board authorised filing of a reference against Meraj A. Syed, former chief hydrographer at the Gwadar Port Authority, and others for alleged misuse of authority and embezzlement of state funds amounting to Rs794 million.

5,Rishi Sunak clears second hurdle on road to UK PM office,Bookmaker favourite Mordaunt emerges as darling of Tory grassroots members.,"

THE wealthy Sunak faces questions over his family’s tax affairs.—Reuters

 
LONDON: Former finance minister Rishi Sunak came out on top in the latest round of voting on Thursday by Conservative MPs to decide Britain’s next prime minister, followed by bookmaker favourite Penny Mordaunt.
Mordaunt earlier came under blistering attack after she surged in the race to succeed Boris Johnson, as another long-shot candidate for leader was eliminated.
The little-known Mordaunt, a committed Brexiteer who was briefly Britain’s first woman defence secretary before she was demoted to less senior roles, has emerged as the darling of Tory grassroots members.
In the second round of voting by Conservative MPs, the Royal Navy reservist again came a strong second with 83 votes, behind former finance minister Sunak with 101. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss — the favoured candidate of Johnson loyalists — was third with 64, after formally launching her campaign with vows of tax cuts and a smaller state.

Promising “an aspiration nation”, Truss said she would be ready “from day one” to fix the enfeebled UK economy and take on Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine.
Attorney General Suella Braverman was eliminated from the race after coming last, with the five remaining candidates proceeding to the next round of voting by Tory MPs on Monday.
Polls point to Mordaunt beating Sunak, Truss and the others comfortably, once the party members decide between the final two candidates in the coming weeks.
But Mordaunt was savaged by her former boss in the Brexit ministry, David Frost, who called her unfit for office. And she is barely known nationally.
A poll of more than 2,200 adults by Savanta ComRes said only 11 per cent could identify Mordaunt from her photograph, and only 16pc of Conservative voters. Two respondents thought she was the singer Adele.
Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, after his elimination on Wednesday, threw his support behind Sunak, whose resignation from the cabinet last week helped spark a ministerial revolt against Johnson after months of scandal.
Drawing a pointed contrast to Johnson, Hunt said the former chancellor of the exchequer was “one of the most decent, straight people with the highest standards of integrity” in politics.
But the wealthy Sunak faces questions about his family’s tax affairs and his prior decision to retain US residency. And he is opposed to immediate tax cuts to confront a post-pandemic cost-of-living crisis, stressing the need instead for fiscal responsibility.
“I don’t judge people by their bank accounts, I judge them by their character,” Sunak told BBC radio. “And I think people can judge me by my actions over the past couple of years,” he said, pointing to the economic support he designed as chancellor during the pandemic.
Mordaunt, a junior trade minister who is relatively untainted by the scandals of Johnson’s premiership, has come up the middle between Truss and Sunak with a campaign strong on patriotic themes.
But the Daily Mail took aim at her stance on transgender people, one of Britain’s “culture war” debates that has energised the party’s right-wing. Mordaunt was “telling lies” after previously supporting transgender women in the role of equalities minister, only to take a harder line at her campaign launch this week, the newspaper quoted a Truss ally as saying.
