1,Suspect killed during ‘encounter’,ISLAMABAD: Police claimed on Thursday that a suspect was killed during an encounter hours after his accomplices were...,"ISLAMABAD: Police claimed on Thursday that a suspect was killed during an encounter hours after his accomplices were able to get him freed from police custody.
Two encounters took place in Golra and Bhara Kahu after an eight-hour interval. The suspect killed in the encounter was arrested in connection with the murder of a delivery boy on June 5, police said.
According to the first information report (FIR), the suspect had told police that he along with his accomplices injured a man in F-9 Park and later threw the weapon used in the crime in a nullah in E-11.
The suspect said he would take them to the spot (in E-11) to get it, the FIR stated. However, when a police team accompanied by the suspect went there, four persons who had disembarked from a white vehicle appeared there and opened fire on them. This led to the first encounter. The persons were able to get the handcuffed suspect freed. According to the FIR, the encounter took place at 7:10pm on Wednesday.
Another FIR, registered at Bhara Kahu police station, stated that four persons appeared at Kiani Road and attacked a police team comprising the station house officer (SHO) and seven other policemen. The attackers escaped from the spot, the FIR stated, adding later the body of a 30-year-old man was found when the police checked the area.
This man was killed by the firing of his own accomplices, it said, adding a Kalashnikov was also found near the body. The deceased was mentioned as unidentified in the FIR.
According to a police spokesman, the suspect who was set free by his accomplice in E-11 was the one killed in the encounter at Bhara Kahu. He said the suspect had been in police custody for the last three to four days.
He said the police chief in a press conference said that the suspect involved in the murder of the food delivery boy was killed during a police encounter, adding on June 5 the suspect along with his accomplices had shot dead Qasim Awan, a 25-year-old graduate from Lahore University of Management Sciences (Lums) and an employee of Food Panda during a mugging attempt near F9 Park, Islamabad.
Raids and search operations were being conducted to arrest the other suspects.

2,CDA wants to get PTI govt’s decision on buffer zone cancelled,"On Sept 22, 2020, civic agency was directed to cancel allotment of plots where construction had not been started.","ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) board has decided to request the federal cabinet led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to undo a decision made by the previous cabinet of Imran Khan in 2020 regarding creating a buffer zone in the H sectors.
CDA officials said the H-series sectors were not a buffer zone of Islamabad rather it was the ‘I’ series that was the buffer between Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
The previous cabinet on Sept 22, 2020, had directed the CDA to cancel all allotted lands/plots where construction had not been started hitherto. 
In 2008, the then prime minister approved the reduction of the width of buffer zone (2,700 feet wide) comprising the northern half of H-11/2 to 1,000 feet so as to allot land for different institutional use.

On Sept 22, 2020, civic agency was directed to cancel allotment of plots where construction had not been started

The officials said that in light of the decision, plots in H-8, H-9, H-10, H-11, H-12 and H-16 were allotted for construction of the Central Engineering Lab, PWD Rest House, Wapda Hospital, Hindu Community Centre and Cremation Temple, Regional Training Institutions, Islamabad Traffic Police, Pakistan Institute of Development Economic, Air University, FAST University and several other government organisations.
The CDA board in May this year discussed the case following the 2020 decision of the federal cabinet. 
The CDA annulled all allotted plots where development had not yet started. Following this, the allottees approached the CDA requesting that either suitable plots of equivalent size be allotted to them or the plots allotted earlier be restored as the public institutions had already gotten their projects approved through relevant forums.
The board was told that since the CDA had no land bank of un-allotted plots in the acquired sectors of the H-series, neither the allotment of alternative plots against the cancelled ones of the buffer zone/northern half could be made so far nor fresh requests from new applicant departments could be entertained.
Member Planning Naveed Ilahi told the board that the buffer zone was provided between Rawalpindi and Islamabad in the initial master plan of Islamabad because the boundary between the two cities was envisaged as Kashmir Highway/Srinagar Highway at that time. But in 1963, the limits of Islamabad were shifted to the south of I-series, so provision of a buffer along H-series was nothing but a lavish overspend of land. 
He requested the board to request the federal cabinet to undo the decision.
Sources said while agreeing with the member planning’s suggestion, the board decided to approach the cabinet led by Shehbaz Sharif with a request to review the previous decision. 
However, the board decided that massive tree plantation may be carried out in the vacant unalloted area to enhance its green character while walking tracks, parks may also be established for the public in the area.
“Yes, the board decided to request the cabinet to review the decision of 2020 regarding buffer zone. We are preparing a summary in this regard,” said a board member, requesting not to be named.
The CDA officials said following the previous cabinet’s decision, a number of allotees had filed court cases and requested the CDA not to cancel their plots. 
The officials said the area did not fall in the buffer zone as well.
They said buffer zones were neutral sites that separated two areas: Islamabad’s buffer zone separates the federal capital from Rawalpindi, adding the H series did not fall in the actual buffer zone of Islamabad at all.
They said under the original master plan, A to H sectors were part of Islamabad and J to O were to be developed by the Rawalpindi administration.
A buffer zone was earmarked in the H sectors to separate the two cities but in 1963 it was decided that Islamabad would consist of A to I sectors instead of H sectors. Because of this, the twin cities were divided by I.J. Principal Road not by H series. Therefore, they said there was no question of a buffer zone in H series.
The officials said the spirit of the buffer zone in H-16 and its adjoining sectors had already diminished in the 70s when the CDA allotted land for government buildings there. 
They said the federal cabinet in 2020 without knowing the actual status of the buffer zone had directed the CDA to cancel all the allotted plots in the area.

4,First ‘rain retreat’ at Taxila stupa after ages,"Thailand’s chief monk says Buddhist delegation to visit religious sites in Taxila, Takht Bhai.","TAXILA: For the first time in Pakistan’s history, a group of Buddhist monks along with their disciples gathered at Dharmarajika stupa in Taxila for the annual ‘rain retreat’ (vassa).
According to Britannica Encyclopedia, vassa is the monastic retreat observed primarily in Buddhist communities in Southeast Asia during the three-month monsoon period each year. 
A 26-member group led by Mr Arayawangso, chief monk of Thailand, and comprising six months and 20 disciples performed the ritual at the stupa in Taxila. The Dharmarajika stupa is the largest and most sacred of all the stupas constructed by Kushan dynasty in the 2nd century. It also contained fragments of Buddha’s bones. 
The Thai monks also participated in the turning of the Dharma wheel at the stupa. The ritual was performed to commemorate the first sermon and establishment of Buddhism. This event is celebrated in India, Nepal and Bhutan every year but for the first time ever the Buddhist monks came to Pakistan to perform the service.

Thailand’s chief monk says Buddhist delegation to visit religious sites in Taxila, Takht Bhai

Similarly, various rituals were performed and a sermon was delivered at the end of the ceremony which was broadcasted live in 32 countries in addition to the Pojhariphunchai monastery in Thailand.
Later, a function was held at the Taxila Museum in honour of the Buddhist monks. Addressing on the occasion, Mr Arayawangso said that event was performed to commemorate the perpetuation of the “Dharma wheel” in this world for the benefit and happiness of all beings.
He said that about 150 monks and disciples would subsequently join the delegation to take part in various monastic practices at important Buddhist sites in Pakistan, especially in Taxila and Takht Bhai. 
He said that the event was streamed live to invite the followers of Buddhism to visit Pakistan and explore its potential. According to the distinguished monk, he inaugurated the “bell of peace” in Taxila and Peshawar during his visit to Pakistan in 2019 and also wrote a short book, in English and Thai, to teach his followers about the importance of Gandhara in the Buddhist world. 
He said that he was visiting Pakistan at the invitation of the Punjab tourism department and added that his visit coincided with the 70th anniversary of the Thai-Pak diplomatic relations.
Gandhara Art and Culture Association Secretary-General Dr Kyo Soon Park said that Most Venerable Arayawangso was the first “Dhamma ambassador” in this endeavour. He was hopeful that as a result of the visit, the global communities will have a better understanding of Buddhist sites in Pakistan, especially stupas and monasteries.
Thai Ambassador Chakkrid Krachaiwong said that the history of Taxila was almost 2,000 years old and that it was taught in their textbooks. “It is an immense pleasure for us that we are part of the team preserving this heritage.”

5,PARC without full time chairman,ISLAMABAD:The country’s apex agricultural research institution is currently in deep crisis as it has no full time...,"ISLAMABAD:The country’s apex agricultural research institution is currently in deep crisis as it has no full time head which has led to slowing down of action required to mitigate the impact of climate change on the agricultural sector. 
The slow pace of research at National Agricultural Research Council (NARC) and the absence of decision-making in Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC) have become a source of grave concern among scientists and they are of the view that if the government does not pay attention to these matters, further research on important crops could be jeopardised.
According to sources in PARC, after Dr Azeem Khan left the post of chairman of the council in October 2021, the government failed to fill the post with any agricultural scientist.
The Ministry of National Food Security and Research advertised the post and sought applications but could not finalise its recommendations for the prime minister.
Acting charge of PARC was given to Dr Ghulam Mohammad Ali after the departure of Dr Khan, however, Dr Ali has also retired, and PARC is currently without a full-time chairman.No significant achievement in research has been achieved over the past one year due to the current human resource crisis in PARC and NARC, sources in the PARC said, adding four important divisions dealing with animal sciences, plant sciences, natural resources and social sciences have no full-time directors, and junior scientists are managing these divisions.
The board of governors which is the overall decision-making body of PARC, responsible for the control, direction and superintendence of the affairs of the council, remains incomplete, they said, adding that there is not a single grade 20 official available in the council who can take charge of policy decisions. 
Most grade 19 officials have additional charge of various divisions and research establishments whereas the fact that there is no functioning board of governors has led to all matters related to research, planning, coordination, budget and policy formulation being put on hold.
NARC, which currently consists of 14 research institutes, is without a full-time director general. 
Due to this, sources said, research activities have been drastically affected.

The IHC on Jan 11, 2022, issued the directives for demarcation of the boundaries within 60 days.
Speaking to Dawn, a senior officer of the CDA said a committee had already been formed which had started its work.
He said records of the ICT revenue department, CDA and Rawalpindi were being collected as Rawalpindi still had the record of some revenue estate in Islamabad which had been acquired by the federal government when the capital was developed.
“The committee has been working to complete the task as soon as possible,” the officer said.
Earlier, on March 1, CDA Member Planning Naveed Illahi notified a five-member committee for carrying out the demarcation.
According to the notification, the director environment (regional) of the CDA was made the focal person/convener of the committee with the additional deputy commissioner revenue ICT, the deputy commissioner CDA, representatives of the defence ministry and the Survey of Pakistan as its members.
According to a copy of the IHC judgement: “The respective secretaries of the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Interior and the chairman CDA shall jointly conduct a survey and demarcate the unharmed area of the notified national park.
“The survey and demarcation shall be completed within 60 days from the date of this order. They will ensure that no activity or construction is allowed within the notified national park as mandated under MLR-82, the CDA Ordinance 1960 and regulations made thereunder the Islamabad Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management Ordinance 1979, and the Islamabad Preservation of Landscape Ordinance 1966.”
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah on Jan 11 had also directed the civic agency to seal the sprawling naval golf course located in the Margalla Hills National Park area and, unless an environmentally-friendly use can be found for it, ordered its demolition within four weeks.
The court had also rejected the military’s claim on over 8,000 acres of the national park and ordered the CDA to seal Monal Restaurant set up in the national park area.
It also asked the defence ministry to ensure that the amount received as rent was deposited in the exchequer.
The court directed the defence secretary to ascertain which officials were responsible for the construction of the golf course while the CDA chairman was ordered to probe the construction of Monal and other restaurants on national park land.
After building Monal Restaurant, the CDA had leased it out for 15 years which expired last year. However, a few years before the expiry of the lease, the lessee started paying the rent to the military, which stated that the land where Monal was constructed belonged to them on the basis of a notification from year 1912.
Following the IHC order, CDA and the ICT administration had sealed Monal, which was, however, de-sealed later on the directives of the Supreme Court.

“After the detailed judgment, President Arif Alvi should resign as he violated the constitution by dissolving the National Assembly favouring PTI chief Imran Khan,” said PPP Secretary General Nayyar Hussain Bukhari in a statement.
He said that after the detailed judgment of the Supreme Court, it had been proved that the PTI chief was a violator of the constitution and he should be tried under Article 6 of the constitution.
He said the detailed judgement would render Imran Khan disqualified.
“The violators of the constitution will face the music,” he said.
He said the oath of the speaker and deputy speaker was in the interest of the parliament and constitution but they acted more loyal to Imran Khan and tried to give benefit to him instead of constitution.
He said Arif Alvi, Imran Khan, Asad Qaiser and Qasim Suri had been found violators of Article 5 of the Constitution. 
The verdict authored by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial said that by dismissing the no-confidence motion against Imran Khan, the then deputy speaker Qasim Suri prima facie breached his constitutional duty.
Justice Bandial said April 3 ruling failed to qualify for protection of the internal proceedings of parliament under Article 69(1) as it was “not the outcome of a vote in the National Assembly instead it was a unilateral decision.”
Justice Bandial observed that the controversial action by the deputy speaker triggered a chain of events, the most concerning aspect of which was that it allowed the then PM to claim the constitutionally repugnant outcome of avoiding the no-trust motion without a vote by the assembly.

“We want to tell the world about the vehicles driven here in the past that will help create a soft image of the country. Older cars are an asset just as buildings are a national asset. Old cars were not made on computers, they were designed with ideas in mind,” he said. “The book will be read not only in Pakistan but also in other countries,” he said.
In reply to a question, Mr Ikram said it took around six months to complete the book. “There are about 10 vintage cars in Islamabad which are considered as an ancient asset,” he said.
