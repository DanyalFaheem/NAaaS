• Subject to IMF board’s approval, Pakistan expects to receive $1.18bn tranche
• Under revised target, govt must deliver primary budget surplus of 0.4pc of GDP
• Fund says Pakistan stands at challenging economic juncture, govt should be ready to take any additional measures
• Immediate priority is to stabilise economy through budget implementation, continued adherence to a market-determined exchange rate and proactive monetary policy
ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced a staff-level agreement with Pakistan on Thursday that will not only help resume the suspended loan programme and pave the way for a $1.18 billion disbursement but is also expected to alleviate Sri Lanka-like default fears — at least in the short term — and unlock funding from other multilateral lenders like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
In a statement, the IMF said the agreement — which is still subject to its board approval — will bring to $4.2bn the amount disbursed under an extended fund facility (EFF) that could increase to $7bn and stretch until June next year.
The financial lifeline would be crucial for Pakistan’s economy buckling under pressure from a global price shock in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war and declining foreign exchange reserves, among other factors.
Under the revised target given by the Fund’s team, the authorities would have to deliver a primary budget surplus of 0.4 per cent of GDP (or about Rs310bn) against 0.2pc of GDP (Rs153bn) envisaged in the federal budget approved by the parliament on June 29.
That would mean the government would have to finance all its expenditures, excluding debt servicing, through its own revenues and yet spare a buffer of about Rs310bn by making further fiscal adjustments of about Rs155bn through additional revenue measures, expenditure cuts or both.
On top of this, the Fund has also made it binding on the authorities to “stand ready to take any additional measures necessary to meet programme objectives, given the elevated uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets”.
Likewise, the government has also given a commitment to ensure timely implementation of power tariff rebasing, as already determined by the power regulator, along with quarterly and monthly adjustments to rein in rising circular debt, which the IMF estimated to have increased by Rs850bn last fiscal year ending June 30.
The authorities would improve and consolidate anti-corruption laws and efforts as committed under the original 2019 agreement and then made a structural benchmark for end-December 2021, and then revised to end-June 2022 in January this year by former finance minister Shaukat Tarin.
The IMF highlighted that “high international prices and a delayed policy action worsened Pakistan’s fiscal and external positions in FY22, led to significant exchange rate depreciation, and eroded foreign reserves”.
Therefore, the immediate priority was to stabilise the economy through the steadfast implementation of the recently approved budget for the ongoing fiscal year, continued adherence to a market-determined exchange rate, and a proactive and prudent monetary policy, it said.
At the same time, the two sides have also agreed to accelerate structural reforms, particularly the performance of public sector entities.
An original $6bn bailout package was signed by former prime minister Imran Khan in 2019, but repeatedly stalled when his government reneged on subsidy agreements and failed to significantly improve tax collection.
The new agreement follows months of deeply unpopular belt-tightening by the government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which took power in April and has effectively eliminated fuel subsidies and introduced new measures to broaden the tax base.
Finance Minister Miftah Ismail welcomed the IMF’s statement and the prime minister, fellow ministers, secretaries and the finance division in reaching the agreement with IMF.
In return, Mr Sharif congratulated the finance and foreign ministers and their teams for reviving the fund programme. “The agreement with the Fund has set the stage to bring the country out of economic difficulties,” the premier said in a tweet.
On the other hand, former PTI finance minister Shaukat Tarin taunted the government for reviving the IMF programme for which the incumbents had been criticising the PTI government. He said the government had agreed to more stringent conditions than those committed by PTI.
Officials said the IMF executive board meeting would be convened in the second half of August to approve the staff-level agreement and disbursement of $1.18bn funds to Pakistan.
This would enable the government in the meanwhile to implement remaining measures in the pipeline, such as energy tariff adjustments already approved by the Economic Coordination Committee of the cabinet and further increasing the petroleum development levy by the end of the current month.
At the conclusion of the discussion, IMF’s mission chief to Pakistan Nathan Porter said that subject to board approval, “about $1.177bn (SDR 894 million) will become available [to Pakistan], bringing total disbursements under the program to about $4.2bn”.
“Additionally, in order to support programme implementation and meet the higher financing needs in FY23, as well as catalyse additional financing, the IMF Board will consider an extension of the EFF until end-June 2023 and an augmentation of access by SDR720 million that will bring the total access under the EFF to about $7bn,” he said.
Noting that Pakistan was at a challenging economic juncture, Mr Porter said, “A difficult external environment combined with procyclical domestic policies fuelled domestic demand to unsustainable levels. The resultant economic overheating led to large fiscal and external deficits in FY22, contributed to rising inflation, and eroded reserve buffers.”
He said the policy priorities under the agreement would include steadfast implementation of the FY23 budget to reduce large borrowing needs by targeting an underlying primary surplus of 0.4pc of GDP, underpinned by current spending restraint and broad revenue mobilisation efforts focused particularly on higher-income taxpayers.
Mr Porter said the development spending would be protected, and fiscal space would be created for expanding social support schemes. “The provinces have agreed to support the federal government’s efforts to reach the fiscal targets, and Memoranda of Understanding have been signed by each provincial government to this effect,” he added.
He noted that on the back of weak implementation of the previously agreed plan, the power sector circular debt (CD) flow was expected to grow significantly to about Rs850bn in FY22, overshooting programme targets, threatening the power sector’s viability, and leading to frequent power outages.
“The authorities are committed to resuming reforms including, critically, the timely adjustment of power tariff including for the delayed annual rebasing and quarterly adjustments, to improve the situation in the power sector and limit load shedding,” he said.
The SBP will adopt a proactive monetary policy to guide inflation to more moderate levels. Headline inflation exceeded 20pc in June, hurting particularly the most vulnerable. In this regard, the IMF appreciated the recent monetary policy increase “as necessary and appropriate” and emphasised that “monetary policy will need to be geared towards ensuring that inflation is brought steadily down to the medium term objective of 5-7pc”.
In this regard, to enhance monetary policy transmission, the rates of the two major refinancing schemes EFS and LTFF (which have over recent months been raised by 700 bps and 500 bps, respectively) will continue to be linked to the policy rate. Greater exchange rate flexibility will help cushion activity and rebuild reserves to more prudent levels.
The Fund also appreciated BISP support of Rs14,000 per family to eight million families and Rs2,000 per family to 8.6m as ‘Sasta Fuel Sasta Diesel’ and welcomed the increase in BISP allocation to Rs364bn from Rs250bn.

1,Calls for calm as ethnic strife threatens peace in Sindh,Ethnic tensions follow killing of man at hotel in Hyderabad; several attacks on hotels owned by Pashtuns reported in province.,"KARACHI: As ethnic tensions flared up in several Sindh districts following the killing of 35-year-old Bilal Kaka at a hotel in Hyderabad a couple of days ago, leaders from across the political spectrum unanimously called for calm, urging people not to let rogue elements disturb the social harmony of the province.
The calls came as several incidents of violence were reported in the province on Thursday, where shops and hotels owned by Pashtuns were attacked and forcefully closed, allegedly by Sindhi nationalists.
On Thursday, several political parties, including JI, MQM-Pakistan, Awami National Party, and nationalist leaders Jalal Mehmood Shah and Ayaz Latif Palijo issued statements, urging both Sindhis and Pashtuns — the two groups at the heart of these tensions — to demonstrate restraint. They also demanded the government take prompt action to defuse the tensions.
In a bid to prevent the law and order situation from deteriorating further, Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon contacted Qaumi Awami Tehreek President Ayaz Latif Palijo and Sindh ANP President Shahi Syed, urging them to play a positive role to allay the ethnic strife.
Mr Memon said that an accused has been arrested in connection with the murder while the remaining will be arrested soon. He assured that those involved in ransacking of properties will also be brought to justice.
He urged the two leaders to issue a joint statement urging calm and requesting people to maintain harmony.
Following the contact, Mr Syed and Mr Palijo, issued a statement denouncing the elements disturbing the peace and harmony of the province.
Separately, Mr Syed also contacted Karachi police chief Javed Odho, expressing concerns over the law and order situation in the city.
Mr Odho assured that the life and property of every person will be protected and no one would be allowed to take law in their hands.
In a separate press conference, ANP Hyderabad district president Javed Khan, central vice president Anwar Zaib Khan, district general secretary Mohammad Amin and Kamal Khan expressed regret over Mr Kaka’s death. They expressed sympathy with bereaved family members and demanded a transparent inquiry.
They said that the killing has been portrayed as an incident of ethnic strife, while the issue has been blown out of proportion on social media.
MQM-Pakistan also expressed concerns over the tense law and order situation in the province.
In a statement, MQM-P’s coordination committee said the killing of a man has been used to instigate disharmony and pit two ethnicities against each other.
While condemning violence, the statement added that all ethnicities should be free to do business all over the country.
The targeting of people on the basis of language and ID cards will weaken the foundations of the country, reads the statement.
The Jamaat-i-Islami, while condemning the incident, demanded the provincial government to arrest the accused and bring the motives behind the killing to the light.
The Awami Workers Party (AWP) also condemned the murder and called for action against the police, who they claimed “stood idly while the man was brutally murdered”.
In a statement on Thursday, AWP federal president Yusuf Masti Khan, federal general secretary Bakhshal Thalho, Sindh president Zia Bhatti and Sindh general secretary Mir Hassan Sirewal demanded compensation and a formal apology to victim’s family.
Sindh United Party Chairman Jalal Mehmood Shah said Sindhis consider Pashtuns their brothers and they have no objection to their businesses in the province.
Later, Mr Shah also addressed a press conference at Buriro House in Bhan Syedabad area where he urged protesters to refrain from victimising the Pashtun population in the province.
He also urged the Pashtuns “to respect Sindhis and avoid amicably resolve the issues”.
Two injured in retaliatory attacks
Meanwhile, hotels and shops owned by Pashtuns were attacked and forcefully shut in Dadu, Sehwan, Khairpur Nathan Shah, Kotri and Jamshoro.
Armed men on motorbikes attacked three hotels in Kotri. In retaliation, the owners pelted stones leaving two men, identified as Uzair Soomro and Sadaqat Ali, injured. A heavy police contingent reached the spot and shifted the injured to Kotri’s District Headquarters Hospital.
Police have also claimed the arrest of seven activists of nationalist parties in Dadu who were forcefully closing the shops.
In the Sakrand area, activists of nationalist parties blocked a section of N5 National Highway at Noonari CNG station Thursday night following reports of disturbances and maltreatment of families by miscreants at Karachi’s Sohrab Goth area.
The protest led to long queues of vehicles including buses and heavy vehicles.
Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz-Bashir (JSQM-B) leader Dr Niaz Kalani told Dawn that such protests would also be held in Moro, Ubauro and other areas.
Pashtuns make up a large majority of drivers who drive trucks and goods carriers, moving cargo from ports in Karachi to other parts of the country. A large number of these trucks move on highways in Sindh to enter Punjab and travel further north towards Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Protesters also managed to block roads in Moro. However, a swift police action, led by Moro DSP, dispersed the protesters. Subsequently, traffic was also restored.
Minister visits victim’s family
Sindh Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro visited Kaka’s family in Matiari’s Faqir Mohammad Kaka village on Thursday and expressed grief over his death.
The minister assured the family of swift justice, adding that the culprits would be brought to justice.
Separately, Sindh Chief Murad Ali Shah also took notice of the killing and the tensions that followed it.
While ordering police to immediately arrest those involved in the killings, he sought detailed reports from Karachi and Hyderabad police over the incidents of violence.
Abdul Moiz Malik in Karachi, Qurban Ali Khushik in Dadu and Mohammad Hussain Khan in Hyderabad also contributed to this report.

2,"Ex-CJPs ‘unwilling to probe conspiracy’, says law minister","Says two former CJPs declined offer to head commission for probe, citing reasons that Imran will never accept its findings.","ISLAMABAD: Describing the July 13 Supreme Court verdict on the National Assembly deputy speaker’s ruling as landmark and historic, Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar disclosed on Thursday that two former chief justices of Pakistan declined the offer to head the commission of inquiry on foreign conspiracy, citing reasons that PTI chairman Imran Khan will never accept its findings.
The law minister, who was speaking at the PID Auditorium along with Adviser to the Prime Minister on Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Qamar Zaman Kaira, said the apex court’s judgement on the deputy speaker’s ruling on the no-trust motion against former prime minister Imran Khan has effectively buried for all times to come the narrative built on the ‘threat letter’ which PTI claimed had resulted in the regime change with the help of foreign powers.
The law minister said the government owned the letter written by his former counterpart Fawad Chaudhry to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial with a plea to form a commission and hold an inquiry on the threat letter.
“We are ready to cooperate with the court in case it decides to constitute the commission since we own the letter,” said the law minister but hastened to add that the Supreme Court itself held in the judgement that it did not find seriousness in the allegations besides the court opted not to get itself involved in it for being a political question especially when the former government provided no evidence before the court to substantiate the allegations.
Mr Kaira, meanwhile, said the court judgement has established that PTI’s narrative of foreign conspiracy was in fact a plot against the people of Pakistan and its democratic institution. He, however, extended an olive branch to Imran Khan by stating that though he may continue public meetings against the present government or try to dislodge it through democratic means by moving a similar vote of no-confidence but should consider joining the mainstream politics instead of continue to malign and attack institutions or inculcate politics of hatred and chaos.
Mr Kaira also asked the PTI chairman to name any judge of his choice so that a proper inquiry commission could be constituted so he may not have any excuse but to accept the findings of the probe.
He reminded that the National Security Committee (NSC) had rejected the conspiracy narrative besides the apex court judgement also exposed the veracity of the foreign conspiracy theory.
On invoking Article 6 (high treason) as suggested by one of the Supreme Court judges, Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel, Azam Tarar conceded that the constitution was clearly trampled upon by killing the no-confidence motion, still it was a very serious matter and the entire parliament than an individual should come out with a clear approach how to deal with it as suggested by the judge.
Mr Kaira regretted that the PTI chief always paint his opponents as traitors only to create confusion in the society and anarchy in the country, adding Imran Khan should come out with a solid evidence on the conspiracy theory.
Indeed, the four-year term of Imran Khan proved a disaster for the country as he miserably failed to fulfil even the single promise he made with the people he said, adding the present government was left with no option but to opt for difficult decisions like jacking up the petroleum and energy prices only to avoid and save the country from default or becoming a second example after Sri Lanka because Imran Khan chose not to pay the price for the welfare of the country.
Explaining different features of the Supreme Court ruling, the law minister said, Imran Khan showed undue haste in extending advice to the president for dissolving the National Assembly, the moment the deputy speaker set aside the no-confidence motion against the then prime minister in bad faith also regretting that the president also did not apply his mind in dissolving the National Assembly instantly.
Heaping praises at the Supreme Court for its judgement, the law minister said the court had once again played its role in strengthening the democratic norms and the rule of law in the country.
Azam Tarar emphasised that the July 13 judgement was an unanimous verdict of five Supreme Court judges though two judges added their additional note by observing that Article 5 of the constitution which commands loyalty to State was violated.
The law minister also wondered why the former premier kept silent for 20 days from March 7 when the cipher reached the country until March 27, adding the judgement had also ruled that no-evidence was provided to establish that foreign hands were behind his ouster from the government. This issue was also deliberated during the NSC meeting and brushed aside for not being a grave national security issue.
He was of the view that if the previous government believed that the matter was very serious then it should have tabled it before the parliament to discuss and probe the cipher in an in-camera House proceeding.
Meanwhile, in a separate development, the law minister chaired a meeting of Cabinet Sub-Committee on Missing Persons and reiterated the commitment to submit committee’s recommendations to the cabinet in four to five weeks.
The meeting was also attended by Human Rights Minister Riaz Hussain Pirzada, Maritime Affairs Minister Faisal Sabzwari, Science and Technology Minister Agha Hassan Baloch and senior officials of the law and interior.
Chairperson of the Defence of Human Rights Pakistan Amna Masood Janjua also attended the meeting on special invitation and put forward her suggestions to the committee to resolve the issue of missing persons.
The law minister said other stakeholders would also be invited to attend the forthcoming meetings of the committee and present their suggestions. Representatives of Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and Bar Associations would also be invited to attend the next meeting, he added.

3,Establishment too comfortable making political decisions: Fawad,"• PTI leader calls SC detailed order more of a ‘political decision’, says it’s not judges’ job to ‘bring conflicts into politics’","

FAWAD Chaudhry

 
• PTI leader calls SC detailed order more of a ‘political decision’, says it’s not judges’ job to ‘bring conflicts into politics’
• Interior minister says all those mentioned in apex court order will be tried under Article 6
LAHORE / ISLAMABAD: Following the Supreme Court’s detailed judgement on the former National Assembly deputy speaker’s controversial ruling of April 3 on the no-trust move against Imran Khan, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Fawad Chaudhry called it more of a ‘political decision’, and took an unprecedented dig at the establishment, saying it was becoming more prone to and regularly taking such political decisions.
On the other hand, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah announced that action under Article 6 — that dealt with treason — would be taken against those found by the SC to have ‘defrauded’ the Constitution and breached a ‘sacred trust’ through the controversial ruling.
Speaking to the media in Lahore on Thursday, former minister Chaudhry said the Supreme Court had itself decided not to get into a debate on the cipher from the Pakistan mission in the US that was allegedly behind sending Imran Khan’s previous government home. He demanded a commission be constituted to investigate all the matters surrounding the document and toppling of the PTI government.
He stressed the apex court should have investigated all the documents, including the cipher, that were in the possession of the chief justice of Pakistan in a sealed packet — sent to him with the previous cabinet’s approval. “The CJP should have shared the cipher with the judges, who wrote in the judgement that the documents were not presented to them. The attorney generals continued requesting for discussing the cipher, but the judges refused,” he added.
He further said the judges could have also sought the National Security Commi­ttee meeting minutes. “People know well why the Supreme Court wanted to observe restraint and avoid a debate on the cipher,” Mr Chaudhry observed, adding former US national security adviser John Bolton had admitted the US conducted “regime change” operations in the world.
Referring to the additional note of one of the judges who wrote Thursday’s detailed order, Mr Chaudhry said it had no legal value, but the opinion revealed no one could be spared a trial under Article 6. “There will be more necks to try and hang than the rope available,” he remarked.
Stressing that it was not judges’ job to bring any conflicts into politics, Mr Chaudhry observed it would be the worst thing if they were on a mission to do so. “Let political decisions be taken in the political arena,” he suggested.
The PTI leader also questioned the timing of the detailed judgement – just three days before the by-elections in Punjab – which could have been delayed as it had been for four months.
He confidently claimed the PTI would form the next government with a two-thirds majority and get this controversial Supreme Court judgement quashed. A “properly represented parliament” would decide whether Article 6 should be applied on a violation of Article 69. “What is the punishment if a judge violates the Constitution,” he questioned.
He further said the nation was now ready for revolution and the powers that be needed to decide whether they would allow it through votes or want to head towards a Sri Lanka-like situation.
Mr Chaudhry said PTI chairman Imran Khan would conclude the Punjab by-election campaign by addressing mass public meetings in the four constituencies of Lahore on Friday (today).
‘Fraud with Constitution’


RANA Sanaullah

 
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah claimed the Supreme Court judgement setting aside former deputy speaker Qasim Suri’s ruling clearly held that President Arif Alvi, former PM Khan, former speaker and deputy speaker and former law minister violated the Constitution and breached a sacred trust. He said there was no bigger crime than defrauding the Constitution, adding that work on trying all the characters mentioned in the order under Article 6 had already started.
“Action must be taken when a serious charge of isolating the Constitution is proven against anybody.”
Asked about the views of the PML-N’s coalition partners on the matter, the minister said the issue would be discussed in a cabinet meeting on Friday (today). “In my personal view, however, the federal government and parliament have no room to avoid action.”
He demanded President Alvi step down after the apex court verdict. He also said the National Assembly speaker was now bound to submit disqualification references against lawmakers, who violated the Constitution, to the Election Commission of Pakistan. “The ECP then must de-seat those lawmakers.”
To a question whether former premier Imran could be arrested in the days to come, the minister said the cabinet must take a decision about it and “government departments will act according”. He further claimed it had been proved Mr Khan put the country’s interests at stake for power and personal gains.
Meanwhile, Rana Sana had on Tuesday announced a string of questionable measures of police cases, arrests, blocking of identity cards and passports of those PTI supporters who heckled anyone, especially PML-N workers and leaders. In a series of tweets, he had asked people to make videos instead of taking law into their hands if they encountered any “crazy” followers of former premier Imran Khan in public, and either post it to the FIA’s cyber crime director, send it through Whatsapp or upload it on social media tagging the FIA. This, he claimed, was to ensure citizens’ right to freedom of movement under Article 15.
In a related development, PML-N Senator Dr Afnanullah Khan submitted a resolution with the Senate Secretariat urging the government initiate impeachment proceedings against President Alvi, reported Dawn.com.
“The Supreme Court in its recent historic detailed judgement outlines that Imran Khan, Arif Alvi, Qasim Suri and Fawad Chaudhry blatantly transgressed the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan when they didn’t allow the voting on the no-confidence motion,” the resolution, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, read.
It added there must be “severe consequences for this blatant transgression and the law must take its course”. Therefore, the Senate should immediately initiate Article 6 proceedings against the officials, the resolution added.

4,Authorities across country brace for ‘rain disaster’,"Met warns of ""strong weather activity"" in Karachi, Balochistan, Arabian Sea; Balochistan marooned as flash floods block highways.","

Lasbela: Heavy monsoon rains and flash floods washed away the road and bridge between Dureji and Hub, suspending traffic and cutting off Dureji from other parts of the district.—Dawn

 
• Met warns of ‘strong weather activity’ over Karachi, Balochistan, Arabian Sea
• Balochistan marooned after flash floods block highways, wash away roads
• PM announces Rs1m for victim families, relieved that dams are still secure
• Four killed in KP, GB in rain-related incidents
QUETTA/ GILGIT / PESHAWAR: Disaster management authorities are bracing for another spell of torrential rains, particularly in Sindh and Balochistan, in anticipation of a “vigorous monsoon” as rain lashed parts of Balochistan, triggering another wave of flash floods in the southwestern province on Thursday.
The alert issued by the National Disaster Management Authority was prompted by a statement issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), which predicted “strong weather activity” over the next three days in Karachi, Hub Dam catchment areas (which encompasses parts of Balochistan), and the Arabian Sea.
The current spell of monsoon rains, which has claimed over 160 lives since it started earlier this month, also resulted in four more deaths on Thursday — three in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and one in Gilgit-Baltistan.
In GB, one person was killed and 13 others — residents of Swat — were injured after a van reportedly skidded off a slippery road near Babusar Pass, whereas in Lakki Marwat and Mansehra districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, three people drowned, as per the rescue officials.
Balochistan marooned
At the time of filing, reports from Balochistan painted a bleak picture as the northern and central parts of the province suffered infrastructural damages due to the heavy downpour.
Many towns and cities of the province remained cut off from Quetta and other district headquarters due to flooding. The rain also disconnected Balochistan from Punjab and Sindh as the highway linking Sukkur with Quetta and Dera Ghazi Khan (Punjab) with Loralai remained closed due to the rain.
As a precautionary measure, local authorities closed the highway linking Quetta with Sukkur after Bolan, Nari and other rivers overflowed and damaged the highway near Bolan.
“We have decided to close the road for overnight travelling as floodwater damaged the highway at different points,” Mansoor Qazi, Sibi deputy commissioner said. The DC said the floodwater from the Nari River was heading towards villages in the area.
Editorial: Rain disaster
He said the villages were being evacuated in the face of potential flooding due to the overflowing of the Nari River. The irrigation officials said that the catchment areas of Nari, Bolan and other seasonal rivers were receiving heavy monsoon rains in Harnai, Ziarat, Duki and Sanjavi towns.
Similarly, Dera Bugti and Kohlu areas were also receiving heavy rains which flooded the Lehri River and seasonal streams.



 
The traffic between Balochistan and Punjab was also badly affected due to heavy downpour in Loralai and Dera Ghazi Khan (Punjab). The tourists who went to Fort Munro were still stuck due to the heavy rain that suspended traffic between Barkhan, Musakhail and Dera Ghazi Khan. At the filing of this report, the officials said that efforts were underway to rescue the tourists stranded in the area.
Rainfall was also reported in Harnai, Ziarat, Muslim Bagh, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Zhob, Karez Qamardddin and Danasar areas of Sherani and Zhob districts.
Officials said that the traffic was also suspended between Harnai and Quetta as the road linking the area with the provincial capital was washed away at different points. The traffic was also affected on Zhob-Dera Ismail Khan Road.
However, no loss of life was reported in Balochistan until the filing of this report.
NDMA urges vigilance
In its advisory, NDMA specifically mentioned the management of Hub Dam – the third largest dam in Pakistan situated at least 50km away from Karachi – and advised the authorities to ensure “safe discharge of water” and to accommodate additional inflow of water from the catchment areas -- Dadu district, Khirthar National Park, Saruna, Dureji and the Shah Noorani area in Balochistan -- likely to receive torrential rainfall.
It advised departments to remain vigilant to ensure timely evacuation of “at-risk population downstream in case of any emergency”. It also warned the fisher folk of Sindh and Balochistan to avoid the open sea for the time being.
PM’s package
Similarly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered the NDMA chairperson to increase the presence of officials in the flood-hit areas of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as he promised Rs1 million to the families of the people killed as a result of rainfall after a joint survey. He ordered the acting chief of NDMA to immediately reach Quetta and support the provincial government to rehabilitate the flood affectees.
Calling for coordinated efforts between the federal and provincial governments, he warned there would be no room for complacency. The premier said all dams were “safe and secure and the situation was being monitored” round the clock.
Separately, in a statement, the Punjab PDMA warned that the rain spell will continue for the next four days. It said the system started weakening in upper parts of the province and getting reinforced in south Punjab. In the next hours, rains will lash central to south Punjab and Sindh, it added.
