There were four PTI defector MPAs from Faisalabad division who voted for chief minister election to Hamza Shehbaz but three of them were deseated -- Faisalabad PP-97 MPA Haji Ajmal Cheema, Jhang PP-125 MPA Faisal Hayat Jabboana and Jhang PP-127 MPA Mehr Muhammad Aslam Bharwana.  
The fourth defector was Toba Tek Singh PP-118 MPA Bilal Asghar Warraich who escaped deseating because he had won the by-election held after the 2018 general elections. Like three other deseated MPAs, he had also won as an independent candidate but despite joining the PTI he was not enrolled as party member due to which he not only exists as an MPA but presently also enjoying the portfolio of a provincial minister.
In the by-election to be held on July 17, the same winners and runners-up of the 2018 general election are again main contestants.  
In all three constituencies, PTI candidates blame the PML-N for using state machinery and funds for its candidates, however, the Nawaz League leadership refutes their allegations.  
PP-97, Faisalabad: The constituency consists of two tehsils -- Chak Jhumra and Faisalabad.  
A tough fight is expected between Haji Ajmal Cheema of the PML-N and Ali Afzal Sahi of the PTI  as both belong to the same Jat clan. 
In 2018, Haji Ajmal Cheema had secured 42,405 votes as an independent candidate while Ali Afzal Sahi remained runner up with 37,973 votes.  
Azad Ali Tabassam, who was a PML-N candidate in 2018 and remained on third position with 35,141 votes, has now withdrawn his candidature in favour of Cheema. 
Tariq Mahmood Bajwa was a PPP candidate in 2018 but managed 2,000 votes only. Now he is an independent candidate having some better position than 2018.
A new development is that Jamaat-i-Islami has now fielded its candidate, Ali Ahmad Goraya, who is the grandson (daughter’s son) of the late spiritual personality Sufi Barkat Ali and it is expected that he may affect PML-N vote bank.
Meanwhile, PML-N Vice-President Maryam Nawaz has no schedule to address a public meeting for her party candidate in PP-97, however, Imran Khan will address a gathering at Chak Jhumra on Friday (today).  
Both the main contestants are hopeful of their win, but political observers opine that the PTI is in a slightly better position.
PP-125, Jhang: This constituency consists of entire Athara Hazari tehsil and some area of Jhang tehsil. 
In the by-polls, PML-N’s Faisal Hayat Jabboana and PTI’s Mian Azam Chela are the main contestants. 
In 2018, Jabboana had won this seat by getting 51,050 votes and joined the PTI. The runner-up was PTI’s Azam Chela who scored 38,699 votes. The PPP has not fielded its candidate this time.  
Both Maryam and Imran had addressed big gatherings at Jhang and 18 Hazari. 
This time a former PML-N MPA, Iftikhar Khan Baloch (father-in-law of Hina Rabbani Khar’s younger brother PPP MNA from Muzaffargarh Malik Ghulam Raza Rabbani Khar) is also an independent candidate.  
All three of the contestants are former MPAs, elected on multiple occasions from this constituency or some areas falling in this constituency.  
Azam Chela, Faisal Jabboana and Iftikhar Baloch have support of their clans.  
Political observers say no doubt a real contest is between Azam Chela and Faisal Hayat Jabboana, but Iftikhar Baloch can also make a dent in the vote bank of the PML-N.
PP-127, Jhang: This constituency consists of the areas falling in the precincts of Mochiwala and Saddar police stations of Jhang. 
Main contestants are the same of 2018 election including winner Mehr Aslam Bharwana (now PML-N candidate) and Mehr Nawaz Bharwana.  
In 2018, Aslam Bharwana had obtained 27,353 votes as an independent candidate and runner-up Nawaz Bharwana had scored 26,765 votes on PTI ticket. The winning margin was of just 600 votes.
There is again a clash between traditional rivals -- Bharwanas of Satiana and Bharwanas of Mukhiana areas of Jhang.  
After winning the 2018 election, Aslam Bharwana had joined the PTI and was made a minister in the Buzdar cabinet. Both of them remained members of the provincial assembly thrice each.  
A large number of devotees of the shrines of Sial Sharif and Shah Jewna reside in this constituency.  
Faisal Saleh Hayat, the caretaker (sajada nashin) of Shah Jewna, is supporting Aslam Bharwana while Pir Qasim Sialvi is with Nawaz Bharwana.
Rah-i-Haq party’s MPA Muawiya Azam is supporting Aslam Bharwana while a former federal minister Sheikh Waqas Akram who joined the PTI on Wednesday in the presence of Imran Khan in his Athara Hazari public meeting has also started supporting PTI hopeful Nawaz Bharwana in PP-127. He had already announced support to PTI’s Azam Chela in PP-125.

Pooja Devi, 12, a resident of Rehmat Colony, went missing from outside her house a day before Eid. Her parents tried their best to find a clue to the missing daughter but failed and approached police.  
Officials at the B-Division police told the family that Pooja had been sent to Darul Amaan but declined to share any details. Later, Pooja’s father took up the matter with Hindu elder Guru Sukh Dev Jee who, with the help of activists Nosheen Mirza and Farhan Aamir, filed an application in court.

As the bench resumed its hearing, Advocate General of Punjab (AGP) Shahzad Shaukat said notices had not been served on the respondents.
At this, the bench issued fresh notices to the ECP and PTI’s MPA Sibtain Khan, also opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly.  
The bench directed the assembly secretary to ensure service of the notice to the respondent MPA.
The division bench comprising Justice Shahid Karim and Justice Anwaar Hussain adjourned further hearing till July 18.
A single bench had allowed a petition of the PTI and ordered the ECP to issue a notification about the new MPAs on the reserved seats following the disqualification of 25 MPAs over defection during the election of Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz.
The order of the single bench has also been complied with by the ECP.
The appeal of the PML-N argues that the impugned judgement by the single bench is a violation of articles 106(3)(c) and 224(6) of the Constitution. It says the reserved seats in the provincial assembly are allotted based on the number of general seats secured by each political party.
It argues that once fresh election/by-poll for the general seats have taken place, only then can the quota of the reserved seats be recalculated and the vacant reserved seats be filled to truly reflect the strength of the political parties through proportional representation. 
The appeal asks the court to set aside the decision passed by the single bench.

11,Considerable drop in one-wheelie fatalities,Police get surety bonds from parents of wheelie-doers; act against mechanics who alter bikes,"LAHORE: The fatality rate in one-wheelie-related accidents has considerably dropped in the provincial capital after the Lahore police adopted a ‘novel’ approach to do away with the menace.
For the first time, the police identified 1,617 ‘notorious’ motorbike mechanics and 952 habitual wheelie-doers of the city, visited their residences, held meetings with their parents and obtained from them surety bonds to stop them from the risky sport.
It took the police months to complete the exhausting task of engaging hundreds of families.
The police identified workshops which used to make alteration in bikes to drive them on front wheel while maintaining a speed of over 80 km per hour. Most of them were operating in McLeod Road, Naulakha, Rajgarh, Garhi Shahu, Saddar, Islampura, Icchra, Walton Road, etc.

Police get surety bonds from parents of wheelie-doers; act against mechanics who alter bikes

Several groups of wheelie-doers were playing dangerous stunts on the roads, risking lives of others too.
A senior police officer said a ‘top’ wheelie-doer of the city known as “Ustad Butt” used to perform stunts while carrying his two-year-old son.
He said the deaths due to the one-wheelie accidents had become a permanent feature of the annual festivals including Chand Raats, Eid days, Independence Day and New Year celebration.
For the last few years, the fatality rate of the young citizens in the zigzag driving, speeding and other bike-related accidents was recorded nearly 2pc during the annual festivals and on every weekend in Lahore.
Lahore police Operations DIG Sohail Chaudhry and City Traffic Officer Muntazir Mehdi put their heads together to address the issue, worked on various options/proposals and implemented them to bring about a permanent solution.
They assigned various tasks to the divisional SPs of the city to play an effective and decisive role in this regard.
A report of the Lahore police based on the data obtained from the accident and emergency departments of public sector hospitals of the city and from Rescue 1122 suggested that this mortality rate of one-wheeling has now dropped to below 1pc.
“For the first time not a single [wheelie-doer] death was reported during the Eidul Azha,” Lahore Operations DIG retired Capt Sohail Chaudhry told Dawn,
Even no rally of one-wheelers was reported in any part of the city, he said adding that the reason was that Lahore police acted in a different way to curb the menace on a permanent basis.
“With the efforts of divisional SPs, we identified 1,617 motorbike mechanics and 952 one-wheelers of the city”, he said adding that the police teams raided and tightened noose around them.
He said the police approached the elders of the mechanics and the one-wheelers, held meetings and obtained from them surety bonds that they would discontinue the illegal practice.
They were given an ultimate warning that the police would lodge cases against the elders of the children if they were found involved in the risky activity.
Of the total 925 one-wheelers, he said, 225 were living in City division, 216 in Saddar, 1,182 in Cantt, 150 in Civil Lines, 64 in Iqbal Town and 115 in Model Town divisions, the DIG said.
Similarly, 229 motorbike workshops were pointed out in Civil Lines division, 366 in Cantt, 258 in Civil Lines, 298 in Saddar, 165 in Iqbal Town, and 301 in Model Town divisions.
Lahore CTO Muntazir Mehdi said with the efforts of the police, the overall everyday motorbike fatality rate has dropped to below 1pc in the city.
Quoting some reports, he said, most motorbike-related fatal accidents and deaths were occurring at midnight starting from 11:30pm to 5am daily.
One of the major reasons was that the traffic wardens, safe city authority and Tepa used to close down traffic signals at that time.
“We held meetings with all of them and decided that the traffic signals would be kept operational at midnight,” he said.
The months-long practice has brought about a considerable relief as the recent reports unveiled that the bike-related mortality dropped and this was also confirmed by the medical superintendents of the government hospitals of Lahore when the traffic police visited them and obtained data, the Lahore CTO said.

12,By-polls to set political direction of country: PPP,LAHORE: PPP leader Syed Hassan Murtaza says the July 17 by-polls will set the political direction of the country....,"LAHORE: PPP leader Syed Hassan Murtaza says the July 17 by-polls will set the political direction of the country.  
He, along with PML-N leaders, was speaking at a press conference here on Thursday.  
Chiding the previous government, he alleged that the four-year PTI rule was the era of nepotism, price-hike and of a new narrative and if the allied parties had not ousted the government through a no-confidence motion, the country would have witnessed some tragedy.  
He said the PPP, the PML-N and other parties joined hands in the larger national interest to save the country from an irreparable damage. He said the people suffered owing to chaos and inflation in the country during the PTI rule as Imran Khan misled the masses in the name of providing jobs to 10 million people, while the unemployment graph hit its peak during that time.  
Murtaza said that had the PPP and the PML-N not taken the timely decision of bringing a no-confidence motion against the PTI government, the country could have seen a tragedy. He lauded Nazeer Chohan and other members of the Punjab Assembly, who rebelled against their party (PTI) in a show of patriotism and political vision and sided with the PPP-N League alliance.  
The PPP leader said they fully supported the PML-N candidates in the July 17 by-polls and claimed that more than two-thirds of the 20 seats would be won by the alliance.  
PML-N city acting president Khwaja Nazir thanked PPP leaders Asif Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto as well as the provincial leaders for their unconditional support for the candidates in the by-polls. He said the detailed judgement of the Supreme Court on the National Assembly deputy speaker’s ruling released a day ago stamped the ineptness of the past rulers.  
PPP Lahore president Aslam Gill said the party was actively supporting the PML-N candidates in the four constituencies of the provincial capital where by-elections were being held.
Mr Chohan, who is a candidate in the PP-167, lauded the PPP for raising the ‘Long Live Pakistan slogan’ after the assassination of party chairperson Benazir Bhutto in 2007. He said former president Asif Zardari deserved credit for forging an alliance of the political parties ready to save the country.
He said he and other colleagues abandoned the PTI because its leader Imran Khan was sowing seeds of hatred.

After remaining closed for two years because of Covid pandemic, the puppetry performances would be revived in a renovated hall with new light arrangements, the officials said.  
Before Covid, the puppetry performances were held once a week on Sundays. However, they said, the visitors would complain that the puppet theatre had lost its charm because of repetition of stories and same old puppet characters.  
Taking the audiences’ feedback seriously, the Lahore Arts Council (LAC) Executive Director Ms Farhat Jabeen decided to revamp the hall and add some colour to the performances, they said.  
They said the LAC was contacting different puppeteers to have a new team that would come up with fresh themes and ideas.  
They said since long no new puppet had been designed to meet the requirements of some 18 stories recorded by Shoaib Hashmi and Salman Shahid to stage shows in the past. 
At present the theatre has just over a dozen puppets which are also not in a good shape, they regretted.
Known TV actor Samina Ahmad had floated the idea of the Alhamra puppet theatre in 1984 when she was a programme manager at the LAC. It was back in 1972 when she got an opportunity to work with puppets in the popular television show Akar Bakkar, directed by Shoaib Hashmi, meat to educate and entertain children.
Ms Saleema Hashmi, who was teaching at the National College of Arts in those days sent some students who voluntarily crafted the puppets for Alhamra and the theatre became popular soon.
The Alhamra Puppet Theatre was formally launched in 1986 in Alhamra basement. Initially, a new puppet performance would be staged after every two months.  
It was decided that in the absence of local content, children’s stories should be adapted from all over the world. Shoaib Hashmi agreed to adapt the famous tale of Hansel and Gretel and it was named ‘Gin Kay Teen Sunehri Baal’.
The popular productions of the Alhamra Puppet Theater include ‘Jadoo Ka Drakhat’, ‘Ali Baba Chalis Chor’, ‘Aa Chiri Kha Chiri’, ‘Chunoo Munoo’, ‘Chalak Khargosh’, ‘Chandi Ki Chabi’, ‘Kuchhwa aur Khargosh’ and ‘Joota Jin’.
Executive Director Ms Jabeen said: “We are upgrading the puppet theatre with the help of different puppeteers and shall introduce new stories and puppets after its reopening”.  
Khurram Naveel, an official of Alhamra, who has been assigned the task to revive the puppet theatre said, “We are striving hard to revive the puppet theatre that had been closed because of Covid. In this regard, we are working on different story projects and introduction of new puppets”.
