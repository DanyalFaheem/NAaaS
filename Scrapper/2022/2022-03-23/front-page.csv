• Wang Yi says China wants to collaborate with Muslim states    
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday urged unity among Muslim countries for protecting their interests in a divided world as he rued the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s (OIC) failures on Kashmir and Palestine disputes and Muslim leaders’ infirm stance on Islamophobia and extremism.
The prime minister, addressing the inaugural session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers’ 48th meeting at Parliament House in Islamabad, noted that a new cold war had already begun, which would leave the world split in blocs. “Unless we are united, unless we take a united stand, we will be nowhere,” he cautioned.
This year’s CFM is being held under the theme of “Partnering for Unity, Justice and Development”. Member states participating in the conference would review the progress made by the 57-member organisation on the resolutions previously adopted by the council and deliberate on the challenges confronting them and the Muslim world in general. 
Besides the long-standing Palestine and Kashmir disputes, the war in Yemen, the dire humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and a Rohingya refugee crisis, other major issues affecting the Muslim countries include Islamophobia, extremism, poverty, economic instability and disparity, and gender inequality.
A divided house
Mr Khan said India and Israel were committing “war crimes” in Kashmir and Palestine with impunity because they think Muslim countries were too “ineffective” to stand up to their actions. “We have failed both the Palestinians and the people of Kashmir. I am sad to say that we have been able to make no impact at all. They don’t take us seriously. We are a divided house. 
“We are 1.5 billion people, and yet our voice to stop this blatant injustice is insignificant,” the prime minister said, adding that this dismal situation was despite the fact that international law and UN resolutions backed their rights.
The prime minister said he was not asking the member states to alter their foreign policies, rather he only wanted them to forge “unity on core issues” of the Muslim world.
Talking about the resolution adopted by UN General Assembly declaring March 15 as the International Day to Combat Islamophobia, PM Khan said the world had at least acknowledged that Islamophobia was a reality and needed to be dealt with.
He, however, regretted that though the phenomenon had been growing in the West since 9/11, the Muslim countries did nothing to check this wrong narrative.
Mr Khan said that instead of taking a stand on the issue, the leaders of Muslim countries started hiding behind the façade of moderation. In this regard, he lashed out at ex-president Pervez Musharraf for claiming to start ‘enlightened moderation’. “Enlightened moderation was a term to appease those who were relating terrorism to Islam,” he believed.
Ukraine crisis
On Russia-Ukraine war, the prime minister asked the OIC and China to mediate an end to the conflict.
“May I suggest that the OIC during its discussions think about how we can mediate, how we can bring about a ceasefire, how we can try and put an end to the conflict,” he said.
While expressing concern over the raging war, Mr Khan warned its continuation could have “great consequences for the rest of the world”. He contended that countries maintaining a “nonpartisan” position were well placed for undertaking the mediation.
The PM also used the forum to reiterate Pakistan’s call for the world to engage with the Taliban government in Afghanistan as the surest way for ending terrorism threat from the war-devastated country.
“After 40 years of conflict, finally there is no conflict going on. The only danger now to Afghanistan is through the sanctions and non-recognition. They might end up having a humanitarian crisis,” he cautioned the Muslim world.
“I say this because the stable Afghanistan is the only way. I repeat, it’s the only way we are going to be able to stop international terrorism from Afghan soil. No other country is going to be able to do it,” he said, adding that the Muslim world would have to take stand.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi urged the OIC to prepare itself for dealing with contemporary challenges and conflicts in the Ummah.
“Pakistan stands ready to play its part as a bridge-builder in promoting regional and OIC-driven solutions to these conflicts and disputes,” he maintained.
Partnership with Muslim world
He proposed a comprehensive strategy for development of Muslim countries encompassing vaccine equity, increased development financing, comprehensive debt relief and restructuring, expanded ODA, redistribution of at least half of the unutilised special drawing rights (SDRs) to developing countries, provision of the promised climate finance, accelerated climate action, and action against illicit financial flows.
“Underdevelopment, poverty, and corruption remain serious threats to the future security and stability of our societies. In an era of economic and financial unpredictability, development partnerships among OIC member states would be of vital importance,” he said.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who was participating in the meeting as a special guest, said his country wanted to build partnership with Muslim countries for solidarity, development, security and civilization in the turbulent and transforming world.
He proposed enhanced communication between the two sides. In this respect, he emphasized adherence to principles of mutual respect and mutual trust, accommodating each other’s core concerns, collaboration for the realisation of common development, learning from each other and safeguarding the diversity of civilizations in the world.
Saudi FM reaffirms support 
Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan reaffirmed Kingdom’s support for Palestine and Kashmir disputes.
“Saudi Arabia affirms the centrality of the Palestine cause and it supports all the international efforts at reviving the peace process among the conflicting parties and the return to direct negotiations to settle all the outstanding issues between the two parties,” he said.
He also expressed support for the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and international community’s efforts for a just solution to the dispute.

1,ECP to ‘proceed against PM Imran’ if no response received,ECP also advises PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari not to attend the planned public rally to be held today in Malakand.,"PESHAWAR: The Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan on Tuesday served a second notice on Prime Minister Imran Khan to explain his position on the allegation of violating the code of conduct for the second phase of local body elections in 18 districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
The notice was issued by District Monitoring Officer of Malakand Ziaur Rehman through the prime minister’s secretary. 
The first notice was issued to the prime minister by Malakand’s DMO on March 20 when Mr Khan allegedly violated the code of conduct by addressing a rally in Malakand district, where elections would be held on March 31. 
In the first notice, the DMO urged PM Khan to appear in person or through his counsel before him on March 22 to explain his position.  
“In continuation of this office notice issued on March 20, you were required to appear in person or through counsel before the undersigned today on 22, 3, 2022, to explain your position regarding violation of code of conduct. However, despite service of notice, you have failed to do so.” 
In the second notice issued on Tuesday, the prime minister has once again been urged to appear before the DMO on March 24. “In case failure for the second time it will be presumed that you have nothing in defence and your case would be decided in your absence under relevant law, rules and available record,” reads the second notice. 
It is worth mentioning that the DMO of Swat has also imposed a fine of Rs50,000 each on PM Khan, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, federal Minister for Communication Murad Saeed, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan and provincial ministers Dr Amjad and Muhibullah Khan on March 21 for violating the Election Commission of Pakistan’s code of conduct by holding a public gathering in Swat on March 16. 
The Malakand’s DMO has also served second notices to federal ministers Murad Saeed and Syed Ali Haider Zaidi and provincial minister Shakeel Khan for addressing the public rally in Malakand along with the prime minister. 
They were issued first notices on March 20, but none of them appeared before the DMO in person or through council. 
Bilawal warned
The Malakand’s DMO has also advised Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari not to attend the planned public rally to be held on March 23. 
In the advisory issued to the PPP chairman the DMO said it had come in his knowledge from social media that he would address a congregation in Dargai tehsil of Malakand district on March 23. 
“Keeping in view the code of conduct for local body elections, you are advised not to attend/participate in any congregation or to do any action that is against the code of conduct and directive issued by the ECP failing which necessary action as per law will be initiated,” reads the advisory.

2,PM Imran purposely delayed COAS extension: Shehbaz,"Claims PTI, not opposition, behind anti-army campaign on social media.","ISLAMABAD: Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif believes Prime Minister Imran Khan had knowingly tried to delay the extension in the tenure of the army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, and has claimed that while his party always respected the military, the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) was behind a social media campaign targeting the armed forces.
In an interview with Adil Shahzeb of DawnNews, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president recalled that when PM Khan tried to extend the army chief’s tenure, the notification had to be redrafted three times. 
While Mr Sharif admitted he had no solid information to back up his claims, it was his considered opinion that PM Khan intentionally tried to make the process of extension ‘controversial’. 

Claims PTI, not opposition, behind anti-army campaign on social media

“The matter eventually went to the Supreme Court… in the past, army chiefs have been awarded extensions in service… all they had to do was copy-paste [from the previous summary]. No, this was all done as a deception, it was a fraud perpetrated by Imran Khan Niazi. He wanted to delay it, make a controversy out of it,” the opposition leader said. 
He said that free and fair elections were the first rung of the ladder to prosperity, adding that all institutions should operate within their respective jurisdiction. “A consultative process is different from interference,” he remarked. 
Separately, while addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Mr Sharif forcefully refuted the allegations that his party was behind an ongoing social media campaign against the army.
Instead, he accused the ruling PTI of maligning the armed forces, saying that video clips featuring PM Khan and his party members speaking out against the institution were available on YouTube.
Accompanied with senior party leaders at the news conference, the PML-N president said a video clip of a PTI MNA had recently surfaced where she could be heard “spewing venom” against the Pakistan Army.
Mr Sharif said that one could watch videos on YouTube that featured Mr Khan using the “derogatory” language against the army. “Nawaz Sharif never talked like this,” he added.
The opposition leader claimed that General Bajwa had, on several occasions during their interactions, categorically stated that Nawaz Sharif while he was the prime minister had always respected him. 
He also quoted the army chief as saying that whenever he had asked the ex-premier to do something for the army or provide funds, he never refused.
Talking about the corruption allegations against the Sharif family, the opposition leader hailed the apology made by Broadsheet chief Kaveh Moussavi. He said it had not only vindicated Nawaz Sharif and his family, but also dealt a “resounding slap on the face of PM Imran Khan and his politically-inspired witch-hunt in the name of accountability.”

3,MQM sees no reason to stay in coalition,"Final decision by govt ally ‘just a matter of time’, claims Fazl","KARACHI:  The Mutta­hida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Tuesday broke the  silence surrounding the challenges the party has been facing despite  sharing power with the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in the federal  government, after a visit of the leadership of the opposition  Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) to its Bahadurabad headquarters.
While  the PTI-led government ally expressed an ‘understanding’ with the  opposition, as pressure mounted on Prime Minister Imran Khan following  the submission of their no-trust motion against him, the MQM-P stayed  away from a formal announcement of its decision. The party regretted  that the ruling party had failed to give it a reason to remain part of the coalition.
The opposition, despite its back-to-back meetings with the  ruling coalition partner, has so far failed to receive the final nod from  the Muttahida leadership that continued to insist it would come up with  a final decision ‘soon’ in the larger interest of the party and the  people of Pakistan, but the Tuesday round of talks was different in that  PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman told a joint presser that the MQM-P was  no more an ally of the Imran government and its formal announcement was  just a matter of a day or two.

Final decision by govt ally ‘just a matter of time’, claims Fazl

The Maulana, who is also chief of  his own faction of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-Fazl), also told the  media, without being corrected by MQM-P convener Dr Khalid Maqbool  Siddiqi, the Muttahida and the opposition were in complete harmony on  all the issues discussed during the meeting.
During the visit to  Bahadurabad, the PDM convener and senior leaders of the JUI-F met the  Muttahida convener and other leaders of the ruling coalition party.
After  almost an hour-long discussion when the two sides faced the media they  sounded convinced about their mutual understanding on issues  confronting the country. While sharing details of the discussion,  the PDM and MQM-P vowed to “stay in touch” on agreed grounds.
“In  current situation we have found ourselves [MQM-P] in complete  understanding with him [PDM convener],” said MQM-P convener Dr Khalid  Maqbool Siddiqi while talking to reporters following the meeting.
“We  are pleased that you [PDM convener] are here to guide us and listen to  us. We would definitely take advantage of your experience and make  decisions in line with your guidance. But here are a few things which  the people of Pakistan and political forces need to understand,” Dr  Siddiqi opened up.
The MQM-P convener explained how no political  space was left for his party during the past 15 years despite “our  honest effort to become part of the national mainstream”.
He  referred to the closed party offices, criminal cases against its workers  and their enforced disappearance, which had a combined effect on the  party and became a huge challenge for it to decide about the future of  the ruling alliance.
“Even the opposition parties don’t even meet the experiences which we do despite being part of the government,” Dr Siddiqi said.
“Your  offices are not closed or demolished but ours are. Your workers are not  missing but ours more than 100 are. When we became part of this [PTI]  government, we had some hope but after more than three years, it appears  that we have not been provided a reason for this partnership.”
The  PDM chief was neither clarified nor corrected by the MQM-P leaders when  he said the two sides had “complete harmony” over almost all issues and  it was only a matter of time when the MQM-P would come up with an  announcement of its decision.
“I am returning [after meeting MQM  leaders] with complete satisfaction,” Maulana Fazl said. “The MQM-P may  take a day or two to announce its formal decision but let me tell you  that the allies of the government are no longer its allies. We are not  just in harmony rather in complete harmony [with MQM-P]. And this  government has lost the confidence of not only its allies but also every  other Pakistani.
“Those filled with evils from head to toe are  calling themselves as the propagators of the good. These are the  elements which make us confident about the definite success of the  no-trust resolution.”

5,"Parents can’t ‘kidnap’ own children, rules LHC",Judge observes that a father taking away his own child from the custody of a mother cannot be saddled with criminal liability.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has ruled that a husband and wife cannot prosecute each other on the charge of kidnapping their own minor children.
“The police authorities have no jurisdiction to interfere with a matter purely of family nature, especially relating to the custody of minors between their parents,” Justice Ali Zia Bajwa observed, allowing a petition of a man challenging an order of a district and sessions court.
The lower court had directed the police to register a criminal case against Majeed Ahmad on the complaint of Shaista Bibi on charges of kidnapping their minor daughter.
A counsel for the petitioner argued before the court that a father, being a natural and lawful guardian, cannot be termed a kidnapper of his own child. The order of the sessions court to the police to register a criminal case against the petitioner be set aside as being illegal and unlawful, he maintained.
In the instant case, both parties admitted before the court that subsequent to the impugned order, the minor girl was handed over to her mother. Litigation between the parents for permanent custody of the child is also pending before a guardian court.
In his verdict on Tuesday, Justice Zia observed that the petitioner is the real father of the minor, and under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961, as in almost every other legal system, the father is the natural guardian of the person and property of his minor child.
He observed that a mother and other female relatives of a minor, however, have been given certain rights of custody, known as “hizanat”, according to the standard textbooks, under the “Hanafi law”. Hizanat means the father is not entitled to the physical custody of a male child until he attains the age of seven years and of a female child until puberty.
During the period the child remains in the custody of the mother or other female relatives, the father is exclusively responsible to provide appropriate maintenance, he added. 
He said the Supreme Court, in a number of cases, had treated the father as the natural guardian of his minor child.
The judge further observed that the offence of kidnapping was punishable under Section 363 of the Pakistan Penal Code, but a father being the legal guardian of his minor child under “Muhammadan Law” could not, in any case, take or entice away his own minor child.
He maintained that the principle of dual guardianship of a minor is by itself not repugnant to Islamic law or the law of the land. Under this concept, the guardianship of the father does not cease while the minor is in the custody of the mother, as there is nothing in the law to prevent the mother from agitating her right of hizanat when the minor is with the father.
However, a father, being the lawful guardian, taking away his own child from the custody of a mother cannot be saddled with criminal liability and charged for an offence of kidnapping, the judge observed. Allowing the petition of the father, the judge set aside the decision of the sessions court.
