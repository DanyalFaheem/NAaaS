1,Ex-SHO facing trial in Arshad Pappu murder case gunned down,"""We have set up an investigation team comprising officials from the Anti-Violent Crime Cell and SSU,"" says DIG south.","KARACHI: A former police inspector — who was dismissed from service and facing trial in a 2013 Arshad Pappu murder case — and his relative were shot dead in a targeted attack in Saddar on Tuesday, officials and witnesses said. 
This is the second such incident after December 2021 when a police officer, who was also dismissed from service due to his alleged involvement in the Pappu murder case, faced the similar fate. 
The double murder occurred around 11am on Tuesday when former Kalakot SHO Chand Khan Niazi and his relative Abdul Rehman was returning home on a motorcycle after attending court proceedings in the Arshad Pappu murder case in which Niazi along with Lyari gangster Uzair Baloch was an accused but released on bail. 
When they reached Raja Ghazanfar Ali Khan Road in Saddar, assailants riding on a motorbike intercepted them and one of them fired multiple shots. 

Around three months ago, former SHO Javed Baloch was targeted in similar style

CCTV footage of the incident showed that two apparently young attackers on a motorbike got close to the two-wheeler of the victims and the pillion passenger pulled out a pistol and fired shots at the pillion rider Abdul Rehman. 
“He was shot in the head. He fell and died on the spot. Chand Niazi, who was riding the motorbike, sped away and turned into a narrow lane. However, he was chased by the gunman, who fired multiple shots that hit Niazi on the head and shoulder. He fell and died while being taken to hospital. The gunman returned to his aide waiting on the bike and escaped,” said an official. 
The officials said that the assailant used a 9mm pistol and the police found more than a dozen spent bullet casings from the crime scene. 
They didn’t rule out the possibility of the ex-officer’s past links with the Lyari gang warfare as the possible motive for the targeted attack.
Links with Lyari gangsters in focus
“It would be a little early to reach any conclusion, but apparently the murder seems to be linked with the past case of one of the victims [Chand Niazi]. We have set up an investigation team comprising officials from the Anti-Violent Crime Cell and Special Investigation Unit,” said DIG-South Sharjeel Kharal. 
Former SHO Niazi, former SHO Javed Baloch, then inspector Yousuf Baloch and others were accused in the triple murder case of Arshad Pappu, his brother Yasir Arafat and their confidant Juma Shera, who were killed in March 2013. 
The police claimed that the accused had killed them at the behest of Uzair Baloch, the chief of the banned Peoples Aman Committee, who along with PPP MNA Shahjehan Baloch, is also nominated in the case. 
On Dec 31, 2021, Javed Baloch and his friend Muhammad Mussadiq were shot dead in a similar targeted attack in a Soldier Bazaar locality. 
Hearing adjourned
Earlier, an ATC summoned a former investigating officer of the Arshad Pappu murder case for recording his testimony on April 5.
Uzair Baloch, the alleged Lyari kingpin, along with seven others has been charged with murdering rival Arshad Pappu, his brother Arafat and an aide Jumma Shera in the Kalakot neighbourhood in 2013.
On Tuesday, ATC-X judge, who is conducting the trial in the judicial complex inside the central prison, was set to record testimony of a prosecution witness, Inspector Abid Ansari. However, the current IO, Inspector Yameen Gujjar, was called absent and the court adjourned the hearing till April 5.
Earlier, Uzair Baloch, Zubair and Zakir were produced from prison while Shah Jahan, Abdul Rehman, Akram, Yousuf and former SHO Inspector Chand Niazi appeared on bail.

3,"KWSB asked to ensure 9MGD water supply to DHA, SHC told",The CBC tells court that currently it is receiving an average of 4.6MGD and requested the KWSB to supply 9MGD as agreed.,"KARACHI: The Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC) on Tuesday informed the Sindh High Court that it had asked the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to ensure provision of allocated quota of nine million gallons of water daily to it.
The CBC submitted that currently it was receiving an average of 4.6MGD and requested the KWSB to supply 9MGD as agreed between the utility and the Defence Housing Authority (DHA). 
When a two-judge bench headed by Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi took up a set of petitions filed by residents against additional levy and inadequate facility of potable water in DHA and Clifton, the counsel for DHA and CBC sought time to file comments. 
However, the lawyer for CBC submitted a copy of the letter sent to the KWSB chief asking for supply of agreed quota of 9MGD. 
The letter stated that the CBC had enhanced the pumping capacity and already capable to pump bulk supply by 12MGD in normal condition, and requested KWSB to ensure allocated quantity of water so that the residents of CBC and DHA might not suffer from the acute shortage of water. 
The CBC also produced details of water bowsers being provided to one of the petitioners in compliance with an earlier court order. 
Former attorney general Anwar Mansoor Khan, who is one of the petitioners, filed a bill of Rs9,000 issued by the CBC and DHA claiming service charges for supply of water through bowser.
The bench adjourned the hearing till April 11, and restrained the CBC and DHA from claiming any water supply charges from Mr Khan till the next date.
Around 95 residents of DHA and CBC filed three petitions in the SHC stating that they had been paying annual water levy, but the respondents had failed to provide adequate facility of water to them and charging additional amount against each water bowser.
They submitted that they had regularly been paying requisite taxes, including the annual water tax and were entitled to be granted utility of water, but sufficient water was not being provided despite receiving additional charges.
The petitioners pleaded to declare the additional charges against each water bowser as illegal and unlawful as well as contemptuous of the apex court orders, and sought restraining order against levying and collecting additional charges for supply of tankers.

4,"Call for making mental health body effective as depression, addiction reach alarming levels",KARACHI: Financial hardships triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic have had a profound negative impact on the masses in...,"KARACHI: Financial hardships triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic have had a profound negative impact on the masses in Sindh. Estimates suggest that 40 per cent population in the province suffers from stress and depression whereas suicidal tendencies prevail among 25pc people. 
These points were raised by speakers at a roundtable discussion ‘Current Mental Health Challenges’ held on Monday. 
They also highlighted gaps in the mental health act and said unless the amendments submitted to the government in 2019 were approved and the Sindh Mental Health Authority (SMHA) was empowered to inspect institutions and implement its standards and rules, the mental health body currently restricted to an advisory role would remain ineffective. 
The event organised by the SMHA attracted a large number of experts both from the public and private sectors. 
Highlighting the gravity of the issue, SMHA chairman Senator Dr Karim Ahmed Khuwaja said: “We don’t want to raise an alarm but a disaster is in the making. This has happened due to the financial crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, which is still continuing.” 
Last year, he shared, the mental health authority in collaboration with several institutions conducted a study in Sindh’s urban and rural areas, which showed high levels of stress and depression and suicidal tendencies in the general population. 
“The study revealed that financial constraints have significantly affected diet diversity as a big number of people have completely stopped eating meat, even lentils, and are relying solely on vegetarian food.” 
About challenges to the SMHA, Dr Khuwaja said there was a dire need to increase the number of psychiatrists in the province, which currently stood at 140, and launch a massive training programme for all caregivers and amend the law to include psychologists’ role in mental health wellbeing. 
Sindh Inspector General of Police Mushtaq Mahar was of the opinion that society was already experiencing a “disaster” but was in denial. “Children in high [elite] schools are getting hooked to cocaine and those studying at other schools are addicted to ice [crystal meth]. But, institutions are not willing to accept this reality. This is a blunder with far-reaching implications.” 
There was, he pointed out, a direct link between psychological disorders and street crimes, most of which involved individuals who got into drugs out of frustration stemming from unemployment. 
Advocate Riaz Hussain Baloch, principal of Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Law College, Malir, regretted that the SMHA was more an advisory body than a regulatory one under the act. 
“I suggest that its functions be reviewed and all psychiatry departments in universities, prisons and hospitals brought under it. Unless the authority is legally empowered, it would remain ineffective.”
Prof Unaiza Niaz underscored the need for reviving cultural values, promoting communication, tolerance and politeness in society. 
Speakers also included Dr Amjad Siraj Memon, acting vice chancellor of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Lyari University, and Nuzhat Shirin, chairperson of the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women.

5,Heer Soho set to become first-ever woman tribal head in Sindh,Heer Soho had quit MQM in 2018 to join PPP and got a Sindh Assembly seat reserved for women.,"THATTA: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) member of Sindh Assembly Heer Ismail Soho is going to become the first-ever woman chieftain of any tribe or clan in Sindh, heralding a paradigm shift in the province’s rigid feudal mindset and the male-dominated society. 
Astonishingly enough, her installation as the tribal head has been endorsed by a clergy and spiritual leader, Saen Hafiz Ghulam Muhammad Soho Mehmoodi Qadri, who wields considerable influence in the tribe and has also great respect in the religious and political quarters in several southern districts.
PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari had chosen him as the Nikah registrar for the marriage of his daughter, Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari.
The decision to install Heer Soho as the successor of Comrade Ghulam Muhammad Soho was taken at a recent meeting of top Soho elders presided over by the spiritual leader. 
Comrade Soho died some time ago in his ancestral town of Mirpur Bathoro in Sujawal district. The elders decided to hold the traditional turban-tying ceremony in the town but did not announce a date. 
Sources privy to the meeting said Hafiz Soho would perform the first round of turban-tying and other Soho elders would perform one round each to complete the tribal custom.
A large number of Soho tribesmen and members of the subtribes are expected to attend the ceremony.
Heer Soho is an active political figure. She was first given a reserved seat for women in the Sindh assembly by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) in 2002.
She contested for the NA-238 Thatta-II seat in 2008 on the same party’s ticket but lost to Ayaz Shah Shirazi. In the 2013 elections, she contested for PS-85 Thatta-II seat again on an MQM ticket but lost to Amir Haider Shah Shirazi. 
She left Muttahida in 2018 to join PPP and got a Sindh Assembly seat reserved for women.

Eyewitness to the incident and other people present there expressed extreme anger on unchecked movement of the heavy vehicles, which go around despite a ban imposed on their movement during the daytime.  
It was in the morning when the driver of the heavy vehicle while overtaking another vehicle near Awami Markaz hit a motorcycle from the back and ran over the two-wheeler.  
The deadly incident left all three riders — the man and his two daughters — crushed to death on the spot.  
The deceased were identified as 39-year-old Zaheeruddin, 12-year-old Shija Zaheer and nine-year-old Batool Zaheer.  
A resident of Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Zaheer left home to drop his daughters to school on main Korangi Expressway as per his daily routine. 
The incident sparked extreme anger among the local residents, road users and people who witnessed the incident.  
They forced the driver to stop the vehicle and nabbed him before handing him to police.  
The driver of the concrete mixer was identified as Zafar, who was later formally booked and arrested.  
The strong reaction from the people on spot and later videos shared over the social media of the deadly incident attracted immediate reaction from the police authorities. DIG traffic Ahmed Nawaz Cheema suspended the section officer of Tipu Sultan traffic police.  
“The traffic officials have also been issued directives to ensure implementation of the ban on the movement of heavy vehicles during school hours between 7am and 9am and then from 5pm and 7pm in the evening,” said an official.

8,"I never faced prejudice in Sindh, says Iftikhar Arif",Arts Council celebrates noted poet’s 79th birthday...,"KARACHI: Distinguished Urdu poet Iftikhar Husain Arif is these days visiting Karachi from Islamabad to participate in a couple of mushairas. On Monday evening, the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi, celebrated with enthusiasm his 79th birthday on its premises. The poet was requested to sit in a sofa on stage in front of a big number of his admirers who had come to listen to his poetry. 
The event, moderated by Dr Huma Mir, began with a lovely little period of half an hour or so when four young musicians associated with the council’s music academy appeared on stage and sang Arif’s famous ghazals. 
The small concert kicked off with Tum se bichhad ker zindah hain sung by Sameer, originally sung by Mohammad Ali Shehki. The new thing that the young man did was that he experimented with the tempo of the tune. However, he mixed up some words and phrased. 
The most pleasant surprise was received in the shape of M Zubair singing with a great deal of control and melodiousness the ghazal Honay ko kya hua nahin hai. It was a pleasant surprise because he had attempted to do something immortalised by the Malika-i-Mausiqui, Roshan Ara Begum. He is a gifted singer. 

Arts Council celebrates noted poet’s 79th birthday

Then came Munib singing Khwab ki tarha bikhar janey ko ji chahta hai, another nice effort. Finally, the youngsters played an original composition of Arif’s ghazal Sitaron se bhara yeh aasmaan kaisa lagey ga sung by Mustafa. Given that they didn’t have much time to set the words to music and were asked to do so just the day before, the tune was heartwarming. 
After the songs, Arif cut his birthday cake. 
That being said, it was the poet who dazzled the audience in the real sense; first, with his remarkable eloquence as he went down memory lane telling his life stories, and then by reciting some of his well-known verses. 
Touching upon the composition that Zubair sang, he narrated the story that once while working in Karachi his telephone operator told him that there’s a call made by a woman from Lalamusa for him. He replied he didn’t know any woman in Lalamusa. It turned out that it was the inimitable classical singer Roshan Ara Begum, who had sung his ghazal at a programme produced by Khwaja Najmul Hasan. Similarly, some years later, Marghub Siddiqui, a TV producer, made Shehki sing Tum se bichhad ker zinda hain. 
Arif said Karachi is dear to him. At the age of 21, he came to the Sindh capital from Lucknow. He never in his life ever had to face any kind of prejudice in Sindh. “I spent a long time in Karachi and never met a single person who was prejudiced against me.” 
After his address, Arif read his couplets and verses that the attendees thoroughly enjoyed. Two of them were: 
Jaisa hun waisa kyun hun samjha sakta tha main
Tum ne pucchha to hota batla sakta tha main
Aasuda rehney ki khwahish maar gai warna
Aagey aur buhat aagey tak ja sakta tha main
[If you had asked, which you never did,
I could’ve told you why I am the way I am
I could’ve gone way ahead in life
But this longing for material wellbeing…] 
Earlier, Mubin Mirza shed light on the Arif’s poetic prowess and the council’s president Ahmed Shah welcomed the guests.

9,Excitement fills the air as Qalandar devotees resume dhamal after two-year hiatus,DADU: The atmosphere is unusually charged with emotions as hundreds of devotees sway in hypnotic trance to the...,"DADU: The atmosphere is unusually charged with emotions as hundreds of devotees sway in hypnotic trance to the captivating beat of Naghara (drums) to perform dhamal, a devotional dance, in an expression of love and respect for their saint, Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, on Tuesday.
Dervishes clad in long robes, wearing beads, bracelets and coloured headbands twirl faster and faster to the music of bells, gongs, cymbals and horns until, with a final deafening scream they run wildly through the doors of the shrine to the courtyard beyond.
It was the first day of the three-day 770th urs celebrations of the saint in Sehwan Sharif, but what made the occasion more special this year was the fact that it was being celebrated after about two years hiatus due to a variety of reasons, Covid restrictions being one the major reasons. 
The small and dusty town, located to the north-west of Hyderabad, was jolted awake with the noise of thousands of devotees as they made their way to the shrine. The administration estimates at least 2.5 million people from all over Pakistan will attend the urs this year. 
For many, the dance is not just a means to express one’s love and reverence for the saint but also a way to thank him for one’s wishes that come true. “I have vowed to Lal Shahbaz if my son comes back, I will come here to perform the dhamal,” said Ms Farzana, one of the devotees. 
Her son vanished without a trace two years ago and she believed if she kept praying for the saint’s intercession, her son would surely come back one day. “I have been coming here for the past 20 months, asking Qalandar that I may get to see my son again,” she said. 
Hussain Bux, a dhamal participant, said: “Sindh is a place where Hindus, Christians and people of other religions used to live together in peace. Muslims must stand up to extremists and show them that there were also people who cared about their heritage and traditions, such as visiting shrines,” he said. 
Saima Rind, 54, said that she took part in dhamal almost every day as she lived in Sehwan. When she heard about the bomb blast on Feb 16, 2017, she was shaken like everybody else but it did not deter her from visiting to the shrine. “The shrine is supposed to be a place where anybody could go any time without any fear. Terrorist attacks can’t stop people like me to visit the shrine,” she said. 
Ghulam Rasool Shahani said the basic reason he persisted with his ritualistic visits to the shrine was to “…reclaim the space, which has been taken over by these extremist forces all over Pakistan, especially in Sindh, which used to be a land of peace and love”. 
Abdul Rahim, a devotee who rushed to the shrine after he heard the explosion and witnessed the scene, said he performed dhamal as usually after evening prayers even on that fateful day five years ago. 
Najaf Hussain, 50, said the devotees would never quit dhamal. “I may rather die than quit dhamal,” he said and wished that he would have been there and died in the blast. 
Sultana Baloch said that she had regularly been coming for a month to perform the dhamal and would be doing the devotional dance till the fulfillment of her wish. “I have prayed for a son as I have seven daughters. I hope Lal Shahbaz will listen to my supplications and my wishes will come true soon,” she said. 
At least 90 people were killed and over 300 injured when a suicide bomber struck in the midst of devotees busy in dhamal at the shrine’s courtyard.
