Construction firm was supposed to complete work in December last year 
Various options being considered to expedite the project, CDA officer says

ISLAMABAD: Capital Development Authority (CDA) has issued a notice to the contractor who was awarded the Korang Bridge expansion project on Islamabad Expressway.
The contractor stopped work on the project a couple of months ago on the ground that price of construction material had increased. As per the PC-I, the project was supposed to be completed in December 2021, but the contractor missed the deadline.
Sources said a four-month extension till April this year was granted to the construction company but it stopped the work a couple of months ago.
“Yes, we have issued a 14-day notice to the contractor, warning him to restart work and complete it as soon as possible, otherwise be ready to pay liquidated damages (LD),” a CDA officer said.
“This project should have been completed in December, but the construction firm missed the deadline by claiming that the project was delayed due to late shifting of utility service. Then, we provided him an extra four months to complete the project, but could not get a positive response,” the officer said, adding that as a last resort, the CDA could go for re-tendering process to get the remaining work completed.
Sources said around 50pc work on this project was pending which meant many more months were required for its completion.
The expressway is one of the busiest roads in the city which catered to both local and heavy traffic, particularly travelling to and from Lahore. The road is an important link between Punjab, Azad Kashmir, the northern areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
During the last two decades, a number of housing societies had come up along the expressway which contributed to an increase in traffic load. Every day, thousands of people use this road to drop their children to schools in the main city or go to their workplaces.
From Faisal Mosque to Koral, it has been widened, but people face a major bottleneck at Korang Bridge, where all of a sudden, the four-lane road converges into two, causing a major traffic jam. To remove this gridlock, the CDA awarded the said contract for widening of the bridge.
It is relevant to note here that the construction company was also awarded the Rawal Dam Interchange project worth Rs1.1 billion, which was supposed to be completed in October this year.
There were also rumours that the contractor had left the project halfway, however, a CDA officer said: “I do agree, the work is highly slow, but the contract was not terminated and with slow pace, the work is in progress,” he said, claiming that this week, work was stopped because of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) foreign ministers’ conference.
The officer said around 50pc work on this project was still pending, adding that the contractor had been saying that due to increase in the price of construction material, particularly steel, his buying capacity was badly affected.
“We are mulling various options for expediting the project,” the officer said.
“We will have to take a decision to decide the fate of the project. One thing is clear, we will get this project completed at the earliest and we can also go for re-tendering, if the need arises,” the officer said.

1,PPMA extends deadline for nationwide strike,ISLAMABAD: After getting an assurance from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) over refund of 17pc General Sales Tax...,"ISLAMABAD: After getting an assurance from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) over refund of 17pc General Sales Tax (GST) being charged from the pharma industry on the import of raw material, Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) has decided to extend deadline for nationwide strike.
The government had levied 17pc GST in the last mini budget .
PPMA had given an ultimatum on March 17 that it would close around 600 pharma production units across the country next week.
However, on Tuesday, the association Chairman Qazi Mohammad Mansoor Dilawar said the FBR had promised to refund the levy. 
While chairing a meeting of the association, he made it clear that the PPMA would be go on strike if the commitment made by the FBR was not honoured within next five days.
He warned that a nationwide strike by the pharma industry would lead to shortage of medicines but the government would be responsible for the sufferings of the people.
He told a large number of association’s members who attended the meeting that following the ultimatum of going on strike given at a press conference last week, the FBR contacted the association and once again promised to refund GST on purchase of raw material but sought more time for it. 
In the last meeting with FBR, all multinational pharmaceutical companies representing 97pc of the pharma industry of Pakistan presented a unified stance, he said.
FBR has not fulfilled its promise it made to PPMA’s as yet as the industry has been paying sales tax on all purchases of raw materials/active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) since Jan 16, he said.
The association chairman Mansoor Dilawar, however, regretted that no headway appears to have been made as neither any notification nor any press release to this effect had so far been issued by the FBR.
The association has urged the government to resolve the matter at the earliest.
Later, talking to mediapersons, member of the PPMA’s Central Executive Committee Usman Shaukat said the FBR continues to give a runaround to the pharma industry and now they were seeking more time saying that an amendment in the law would be required.
Referring to the multiple challenges facing the industry, he said most of the raw material was imported and any increase in dollar rates adversely affected the cost of the local manufacturers. 
“The levy of GST on import of raw material is something indigestible,” he remarked.
Earlier, on Marach 17, the association chairman Dilawar had said the prices of a number of materials such as bottles, aluminium and impulse glass, as well as electricity and gas rates were continuously rising and the government also imposed sales tax on them.
“Moreover, the government has imposed sales tax on services of contractors and consultants. “Unfortunately, there is also a huge tax on import of machinery and pharmaceutical plants. Now a tax has been imposed on import of raw material which is not being reimbursed despite committed by the government,” he had regretted.

2,AJK president urges OIC to impose economic sanctions on India,Suggests that the Muslim body should set up humanitarian aid for Kashmiris.,"ISLAMABAD: President Azad Jammu and Kashmir Barrister Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry on Tuesday urged the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries to impose economic sanctions on India and boycott its products.
Addressing a special meeting of the Kashmir Contact Group of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) at Parliament House here he asked the OIC to help stop oppression and barbarism in occupied Kashmir and sought to redouble efforts for settlement of lingering Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
He also suggested that the Muslim body should set up a humanitarian aid for Kashmiris.
He said that over the past 70 years India has been remorselessly violating the UN resolutions on Kashmir and denying Kashmiris of their inalienable right to self-determination.
The AJK president said that owing to India’s continual denial to grant Kashmiris their birth right, the issue of Kashmir has been hanging over for the past seven decades.
“Dozens of the UN resolutions have been passed in this regard but India has been consistently violating these resolutions and denying Kashmiris of their right to self-determination,” he said adding that in brazen violation of the UN resolution the Indian government had changed the special status of the occupied Kashmir on Aug 5, 2019.
Since then, he said: “Indian authorities have issued fake domiciles to 4.2 million non-state Hindus to change the proportion of population there.” 
Granting state subject rights to non-Kashmiris and nefarious designs to change the region’s demography, he said, was a flagrant violation of the UN resolutions.
He said the UN Commission on Human Rights had submitted a report on human rights violations in 2018, which mentioned widespread human rights violations committed by India forces.
He lamented that the human rights violations were still rampant in occupied territory.
He said the OIC should play its role for the release of political leaders and youth who have been arrested before and after Aug 5, 2019 and left to rot in jails far away from their homes.
On the occasion, the APHC representative Syed Faiz Naqshbandi and Ghulam Mohammad Safi briefed the OIC delegations about the prevailing political and human rights situation in the occupied Kashmir. 
They also presented a memorandum to OIC secretary general.
The meeting was also addressed by Foreign Minister of Pakistan Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Foreign Ministers of other Islamic countries.
The Kashmir Contact Group was chaired by Secretary General OIC Hussain Ibrahim Taha.
Staff correspondent from Muzaffarabad adds: Kashmiri activists staged a rally here on Tuesday to highlight their demand for right to self-determination.
They also urged the ongoing 48th council of foreign ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to condemn India’s unlawful moves in occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
The rally, organised by Jammu Kashmir Pasban-i-Hurriyat, an organisation of post 1989 migrants from occupied Kashmir, was held at Burhan Wani Chowk, with its participants holding a banner and placards inscribed with slogans highlighting their demands. They were also chanting slogans like “Wake up OIC, wake up.”

In a statement, MWM Secretary General Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said the OIC foreign ministers’ conference had to take serious note of issues faced by the Muslims across the world.
He said participants of the conference should learn from the unified stance taken by the western countries against Russia in the recent Ukrainian crisis.
He said the meeting could only be meaningful if its fruits reach the oppressed who were suffering from state suppression and the occupiers had the backing of global colonial powers.
“In the face of barbarism faced by the Muslims across the world, the OIC can effectively demonstrate its transparency and fairness by raising its voice effectively,” he added.
The MWM, a coalition partner of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Punjab, had suggested that the best opportunity for the government was to take a firm stand in support of the Kashmiri people and eradicate the propaganda against them.
“This opportunity should be used to convey a strong voice for the oppressed people of Kashmir, and a unanimous resolution should be passed which reflected the aspirations of the Kashmiri people,” Allama Abbas said.
He also congratulated the nation on the occasion of Pakistan Day, and said all Pakistanis should be proud of the fact that it was the only country in modern history to be created in the name of Islam and the first to be established on ideological grounds.
“The acquisition of Pakistan was not just for a piece of land but for the establishment of an Islamic state that is independent in its decisions,” the MWM chief said.

This was pointed out by Senate Defence Committee Chairman Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed on Tuesday as he spoke to participants of a webinar hosted by the Pakistan-China Institute (PCI) titled ‘Whole Process People’s Democracy: Understanding the Chinese System’. The event coincided with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s participation in the meeting.
Senator Mushahid said the Chinese foreign minister’s participation was made possible because of the close coordination between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The Chinese foreign minister’s participation was, moreover, a recognition of China’s longstanding relationship and support to the Muslim world.
In the context of changing geopolitics, Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed said China was emerging as a key player in the Muslim world and this role was being enhanced due to its ties with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
He lauded the strategic shift in Saudi Arabia’s policies, both domestic and foreign, especially liberalisation and opening up in Saudi society, economy, culture, plus policies curbing religious extremism and promotion of women’s rights, as well as improvement in Saudi Arabia’s relations with Iran and Turkey.
Senator Mushahid saw the emergence of a “strategic triangle” between Pakistan, China and Saudi Arabia, could play a pivotal role in strengthening unity, economic development and connectivity in the Muslim world.
He attributed Riyadh’s strategic shift in the Saudi foreign policy to Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) and recalled that Saudi Arabia and China were discussing the sale of oil in Chinese currency, instead of the US dollar. President Xi is likely to visit Saudi Arabia later this year.
Speaking on the occasion, former ambassador to China Masood Khalid, who served in Beijing for six years, said China had developed its own model of law-based state governance, adopting global best practices, in which democracy entailed prosperity and a consultative process.

6,Delhi’s irresponsible attitude could lead to nuclear escalation: speakers,"Nuclear expert Dr Naeem Salik says India's explanation for the Mian Channu missile incident was a ""fabricated story"".","ISLAMABAD: Voicing concern about India’s missile incident, experts on Tuesday said New Delhi’s irresponsible attitude could lead to nuclear escalation in the already fraught security environment in South Asia.
Speaking at a seminar at the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS) Islamabad, nuclear expert Dr Naeem Salik contended that the March 9 incident of an Indian missile landing in Mian Channu had highlighted the dangers of nuclear escalation.
He said India’s explanation that the missile was accidentally launched during routine maintenance was a “fabricated story” and urged the international community to look deeper into the incident.
Dr Salik said the incident had exposed the credibility of the BrahMos missile.
CISS Executive Director Ali Sarwar Naqvi noted that stability and peace in South Asia remained a core strategic interest of Pakistan.
Balochistan Think Tank Network (BTTN) Executive Director Dr Zafar Khan said it was unprecedented that a nuclear state had fired a nuclear-capable missile on to the territory of another nuclear weapon state, claiming that it was an accident. Only Pakistan’s pragmatism has saved the region from a disaster, he added.
Dr Asma Shakir Khawaja, an academic, argued that the incident reflected a profound level of incompetence in handling of sensitive weapons among Indian forces.
This incapacity to handle advanced weapon systems, along with multiple cases of nuclear theft in India, constitute irresponsible behaviour that endangered regional as well as global security, Dr Khawaja said.
She questioned India’s commitment towards existing confidence-building measures with Pakistan, as it chose not to timely share details of the accidental launch.
“This could have led to escalation of the crisis to a nuclear level,” she added.
Other speakers emphasised that the missile incident spoke of India’s irresponsible nuclear behaviour.
While some countries continue to praise India’s nuclear programme and its command and control system, the incident has busted this myth, they added.
Warning about indications that nuclear thinking in India was in the hands of extremist elements, speakers cautioned against ignoring the possibility of India’s nuclear weapons falling into the hands of rogue elements. This fear, they asserted, had been compounded in the aftermath of a ‘Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) driven aggressive and strategic mindset’ dominating the security establishment.
In this hostile strategic environment, they said, the onus of responsibility to maintain strategic stability laid on Pakistan and it remained committed towards achieving this objective.

7,Training programme launched for Pindi division healthcare professionals,Exercise aims to lessen burden on three main hospitals in garrison city,"RAWALPINDI: The Punjab government has launched a training programme for healthcare professionals of district and tehsil-level hospitals in Rawalpindi division to enhance their skill and capacity in order to manage complicated patients at periphery-level hospital rather than referring them to Rawalpindi hospitals.
Rawalpindi Medical University (RMU) Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Mohammad Umar told Dawn that the university would supervise this programme.
“This is a unique model which links the primary healthcare facilities with tertiary care teaching hospitals and will ultimately lessen the burden on three main hospitals in the garrison city,” he said.
Dr Umar said as part of training the RMU would provide human resource to supervise complicated surgeries and other operations performed by doctors of district and tehsil headquarters hospitals of Mianwali, Chakwal and Attock districts.

Exercise aims to lessen burden on three main hospitals in garrison city

“The training will increase their skill and capacity to manage more patients at periphery-level hospital rather than referring them to Rawalpindi hospitals,” he said.
“This will help the local population to get treatment and surgeries at their doorstep. It will also reduce the burden on RMU-allied hospitals which are already short of beds to accommodate patients,” he said.
Moreover, the vice chancellor said by this model, the RMU would train specialists at DHQ and THQ hospitals through telemedicine as well as face-to-face sessions at RMU.
“This will enhance their capacity to manage complicated patients in their own hospitals,” he said.
This model will start university residency programme at DHQ hospitals.
The specialists at these hospitals will complete their essential workshops at RMU and will be certified supervisors or co-supervisors as per requirement of the university.
The postgraduate trainees will be rotated in DHQ hospitals after their initial training period in RMU-allied hospitals. During this rotation trainees will have the experience of treating community-based health issues.
RMU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Mohammad Umar and team comprising Prof Dr Lubna (gynaecology), Prof Dr Rai Asghar (pediatrics), Prof Dr Naveed Malik (surgery), Prof Bushra (medicine), and many others visited DHQ Hospital Mianwali, THQ Hospital Kalabagh, THQ Hospital Isa Khel, THQ Hospital Kallar Kahar and RHC Dullah and did the situational analysis of these healthcare facilities.
According to the RMU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Mohammad Umar, the team prepared a plan to hold extended medical camp in these hospitals.
RMU team comprising doctors of all specialities held camps at RHC Dullah and THQ Hospital Kalabagh.
In these two camps, thousands of patients were treated and patients were referred to RMU-allied hospitals for surgeries and other relevant treatment not available in THQ hospitals.
“This programme is well perceived by health professionals as well as the general public at large. A link has been developed between radiology, nephrology and surgery departments of RMU and Tehsil Headquarters (THQ) Hospital Kallar Kahar.
It has improved on-line system of CT scan and other imaging diagnostics. This linkage will be further extended to other THQ hospitals and district headquarters hospitals of Mianwali,” he said.
