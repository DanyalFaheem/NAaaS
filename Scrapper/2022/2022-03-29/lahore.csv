0,750-foot tall skyscrapers allowed in LCBD,LAHORE:  Following an advanced aeronautical study by the Civil Aviation  Authority (CAA) in collaboration with the...,"LAHORE:  Following an advanced aeronautical study by the Civil Aviation  Authority (CAA) in collaboration with the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), the  construction of skyscrapers to 750-foot high has been allowed in the  high-rise building zone of the Lahore Central Business District (LCBD).
The  LCBD Development Authority (LCBDDA) has also been informed about the  accord of approval for 750ft height in CBD’s Lahore Prime — the area  designated for the high-rises.
The Lahore Prime consists of 12  mixed commercial plots and out of these, five plots were auctioned in  September 2021 with the approval of 500 ft height. An advanced  aeronautical study was conducted by the CAA with the support of the PAF.  In this advanced level study, all the possibilities and constraints  were deeply researched and analyzed for practical implementation of  skyscrapers to be built in CBD Punjab.
The CAA has ensured the protocols of safe flight operations while giving the provision for 750ft construction height.
“The  approval of 750ft height is the epitome of grandeur in real estate and  rather extraordinary in the construction sector,” said CEO Imran Amin in  a statement on Monday.
Lahore Prime’s five mixed commercial plots  were auctioned on the FAR (Floor Area Ratio) 1:18-1:24 with the  proposed approved height of 500 ft. As the height has now been allowed  to be taken to 750ft, the bidders may revise their project designs from  500 to 750 feet, making them a part of history in reforming the skyline  of Lahore.
The CBD Punjab, according to him, has come to another  step closer to the dream of Prime Minister Imran Khan of giving Pakistan  its first business district.
“I would like to show my profound  gratitude to the management of the CAA and the PAF for providing their  professional support and taking swift action on the request of the CBD  Punjab for the 750 ft height provision”. 
The provision is a  gateway to architectural masterpieces and iconic buildings. The business  community will avail all the pros of the extra height provision like  more sellable area for commercial purposes, construction advancement and  provision of the helipad. 
“Every step of the CBD Punjab is  strengthening the oath of the authority to work for the betterment and  economic development of Pakistan. The approach of the CBD Punjab has  washed out all the myths and fears of economic instability and brushed  up the image of Pakistan on the world economic map,” Mr Amin said.

1,Draft Master Plan of Lahore Division-2050: 3.6m of 12.6m additional population to stay out of city district,The plan envisages housing and accommodation of around 9m people within the administrative boundaries of Lahore city district.,"LAHORE: Projecting an addition of 12.6 million in the existing population of the provincial metropolitan in the next 28 years, the Draft Master Plan of Lahore Division-2050, envisages housing and accommodation of around nine million people within the administrative boundaries of Lahore city district and the  remaining 3.6m outside it, Dawn has learnt.
“The planning policies adopted for the preparation of master plan propose to accommodate approximately nine million people (of the total 12.6 million projected population) within administrative boundaries of Lahore district, while allowing very limited horizontal expansion adjacent to existing urban areas. Since any further adjustment of population will affect green area of Lahore district, the remaining 3.6 million people, as per the plan, will be accommodated outside the administrative boundary of Lahore district on the northern side,” reads the draft master plan, which will be presented for approval before the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) governing body in an upcoming meeting. 
It states that since the future development in Lahore and the districts of Kasur, Nankana Sahib and Sheikhupura will be in accordance with the policies of the government at national and provincial level, the LDA, in principle, has approved the proposed planning policies/scenarios subject to the condition that all further actions will be taken as per law, rules and policy in vogue and in consultation with all stakeholders. 
It says that in the light of sub-rule 5 (a) of LDA Master Plan Rules 2014, detail land-use survey was conducted using high-resolution satellite images and filed visits. Sample household surveys using questionnaires were conducted throughout the Lahore division to get updated information about demography, housing, social services, environment and transport etc.  
For transport sector, earlier studies, especially those conducted by JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) were reviewed and different types of surveys, including manual classified counts, roadside interviews/cordon surveys, journey time/speed surveys, road inventory surveys, public transport user interview survey, passenger interview surveys, parking studies etc were conducted.  
For environment analysis, pre and post-monsoon data was collected using primary surveys and was also reviewed in the light of secondary data from relevant departments.  
Census data from Pakistan Bureau of Statistics was studied to project future population up to 2050, and after analysis of past trend, migration, reduced fertility rate, it was projected that population of Lahore division will be 37.71 million, including 25 million of Lahore alone. 
The plan envisages creation of jobs, boosting economic growth considering importance of Lahore as Punjab’s financial and economic hub. In terms of achieving a balanced economy, the key strategic objectives of economic development identified and being pursued in the master plan focus on the 6 E’s -- emboldening SMEs and entrepreneurship, enabling the circular economy, encouraging private investors, enhancing infrastructure reliability, engaging with and supporting local opportunities and empowering youth, women and people with disabilities. 
Using modern concept of neighbourhood planning, it proposes more uniform distribution of facilities to improve access for all residents and to reduce the need to travel, thereby reducing traffic congestion. The approaches adopted for zoning include densification and mixed used development along structure plan roads that identifies that many of the residential areas of Lahore district, particularly towards the south, have low population densities and the master plan has identified broad areas where densities can be increased without a reduction in quality of life for residents.  It proposes a buffer zone of nearly 500m adjacent to each structure road context and existing building, like institutional, social facilities, graveyards and parks within which commercial, business and apartment buildings are permitted, with different percentages according to a location. On some roads, like the Canal Road or sections of The Mall, only public-realm interventions are recommended without any densification measures. The 500m buffer zoneis based on a walking distance to reach the bus lines and stations which are planned to be implemented along the main structure roads, to enhance mobility and provide accessibility to alternative modes of transit to private cars. 
It proposes zoning of informal areas into neighbourhoods comprising around 10,000 people. These neighbourhoods will form the basis for the provision of community facilities, commercial activity and services to meet the day-to-day needs of residents. Improvements will also be made in access points to facilitate integration with neighbouring areas and improve residents’ ability to access employment and higher-level services, and reorganise/relocate unauthorised commercial activities. 
The draft mentions that Transit Oriented Development (TOD) principles are being applied to a number of the main stations along the Orange Line as the same increases the density of development within 500m of these stations by permitting additional height and promoting mixed used schemes. TOD also identifies way to improve the streets around the station to encourage walking and increase the attractiveness of using public transport. As other metro lines are constructed, the plan provides for stations to be identified that are suitable for TOD.  
A pilot project has been identified at Thokar Niaz Baig, for which a conceptual design plan and guidelines have been developed, illustrating how an area around a main metro or BRT station can be restructured.  
Matters to be addressed through regeneration, according to the draft master plan, include high unemployment, low-income households, ownership concerns/conflicts, urgent needs (health/security/well-being), living conditions, dilapidated buildings, lack of infrastructure and utilities, low quality public realm, slum conditions, informal/uncontrolled growth, safety concerns (environmental and structural) etc.

An additional district and sessions judge of Arifwala had handed down 15-year imprisonment to Zafar Iqbal under section 376 (offense of rape) and three-year jail term under section 382 (offence of theft) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
As per the prosecution story, the appellant committed rape on the complainant and also took away Rs2,500 from the box lying in the room of the complainant.
Allowing the appeal of the convict, Justice Sardar Ahmad Naeem observes that the prosecution has not explained why the victim was medically examined after three days.
He notes that the last worn clothes of the victim were not produced before the medical officer or secured during the investigation.
The judge observes that the medico-legal report suggested that the swabs were dispatched to the chemical examiner and the opinion of the medical officer was subject to the result of the said swabs, but neither the report of the chemical examiner was available on record nor taken during the investigation. 
The judge further observes that benefit of the doubt, if found in the prosecution case, the accused shall be held entitled to the benefit. He says the golden rule of benefit is initially a rule of prudence which cannot be ignored, while dispensing justice in accordance with law.
“It is based on the maxim that it is better to acquit 10 guilty persons rather than to convict one innocent person,” Justice Sheikh observes in his verdict. He maintains that for acquittal of the accused in an offense, how so heinous it may be, only a single doubt in the prosecution evidence is sufficient.  
The judge set aside the conviction of the appellants and acquitted him.

Earlier, Additional Advocate General Akhtar Javed argued before the court that the PSCA was not issuing e-challan, but just assisting the traffic police in monitoring the violations by motorists on roads.
He said the law authorised the traffic police personnel to issue a fine ticket in the name of the vehicle’s owner. He asked the court to dismiss the petition.
After hearing the arguments, Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh reserved the verdict.
Previously, a counsel for the petitioner, Falak Sher, pleaded that the PSCA could only use its cameras to check speed of the vehicles plying on roads to use it as an evidence for manual challans.  
He said the judicial magistrates concerned had the jurisdiction to impose fine or exonerate a motorist facing a charge after holding a summary trial.
He contended that the traffic police or the PSCA had no power to recover fines for e-challan from the vehicle owners. He pointed out that the authority had been issuing e-challans without any legal cover.
He asked the court to set aside the act of the authority as unlawful and restrain it from recovering the fine amount from motorists.
During the last hearings, the judge had questioned the legality of the e-challan issued to an owner of a vehicle for violation of traffic rules by its driver.

17,"140,440 ‘still missed children’ put a question mark over anti-polio strategy in Punjab",The issue of the “ still missed children” has been a prime concern for the World Health Organisation.,"LAHORE: During the recent province-wide anti-polio drive, Punjab has reported a significant number of 140,440 children who missed the vaccine dose, out of the targetted 2.2 million, putting a question mark on the efficacy of the polio eradication strategy being pursued by the government.
These “still missed children” could not be traced and vaccinated during the Feb-March polio vaccination campaign under the National Immunisation Days (NIDs) 2022.
The campaign was launched in all 36 districts of Punjab by fielding 150,000 polio workers, including area-in-charges, district and union council supervisors, mobile, fixed and transit teams members.
The issue of the “ still missed children” has been a prime concern for the World Health Organisation (WHO) as medical experts believe that an unvaccinated child poses a risk of transferring the crippling disease to other children in his surroundings.
The WHO director general in a meeting of the Emergency Committee held in February this year under the International Health Regulations (2005) on the international spread of polio virus also expressed his serious concern over the ‘still missed children’ in Pakistan.
The medical and public health experts say that all the environmental samples collected in Punjab have been found negative for the last eight months. They link this progress to the ban imposed on the public movement by Punjab government during the five waves of Covid-19 in the country.
However, the officials say that the next few months are crucial in this regard because along with relaxation in other Covid protocols, the ban on the public movement has also been relaxed, allowing people to travel freely from one district and region to others.
The Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) Punjab, acknowledging the efforts of the polio teams, also expressed concern at the alarming number of the ‘still missed children’.
The EOC says the estimated number of the under-five-year target children for February-March 2022 campaign was 2.2 million.
“The [vaccination] coverage in all districts was 95 per cent and a total of 140,440 of target children are still missed after 5-day campaign which accounts 0.64pc of total children,” reads a report of the EOC Punjab.  
It says the percentage of “still missed children” was below 0.75 in 29 out of the 36 total districts of the province.
“The still missed children’s percentage was above 0.75pc in seven districts, including Rawalpindi (1.6), Lahore (1.31) and Sheikhupura (1.0),” the report says.
The report says a total of 106 “lots” in eight priority districts were selected where lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) activity was conducted. As per WHO sampling standards, a lot comprises 8-10 randomly-picked households and one child each is sampled from these houses.  
“The overall pass rate was 84pc for the province. It was reported 90pc in six out of eight districts, including Lahore and Rajanpur,” the report reads.
The NID was preceded by a meeting of Provincial Task Force on Polio Eradication (PTF) which was chaired by Punjab Chief Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal.  
Punjab Health Secretary Imran Sikandar Baloch briefed the chief secretary on the campaign’s preparedness and the results.
ECO Punjab Coordinator Syeda Ramalla says the programme will focus on the “still missed children” by establishing health camps across the province.
“We are also improving coordination with the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) to access these children”, she says.
Ramalla says there are multiple factors that create hindrances in reaching out  to the 100 percent target children. One of the prime factors, she says,  has been the frequent movement of the population. The seasonal movement  has also been a major issue in inoculation of the target population, she adds.
In many cases, she says, the children move out of the provincial boundaries, rendering them ‘not available’.
Despite all odds, the programme is trying to cover maximum number of children to achieve the required percentage, she says.

19,Project to give tablets to students partially successful,The govt had formed a team to evaluate the project.,"LAHORE: The Punjab School Education Department’s (SED) project of “Distribution of tablet PCs (with e-Textbooks)” has been found [somewhat] mismanaged and partially successful by an inquiry committee.
The Punjab government formed a team of the Directorate General Monitoring and Evaluation to evaluate the project.
The project titled “Distribution of tablet PCs (with e-textbooks) to public school students” was introduced in 2017-18 with the objectives of “enable and encourage self-paced learning through interesting content, help at-risk learners access content at any time and provide a basis for regular, timely and effective information sharing”.  
The project cost was revised to Rs36.247 million from Rs 56.52m due to variation in the scope. The project was completed at a cost of Rs28.855m with the actual gestation period of 26 months.  
The concept of a portable computer was introduced in classrooms for several years resulting in adopting different teaching styles and equipment. The teachers were using the Notebook PC to gather and use a far greater range of materials in the classroom with little distraction. The introduction of the touchscreen tablet PC has brought another dimension to the way technology can be used in classroom.
The tablet PC allowed teachers to deliver lessons, using a number of different stimuli to engage the students in learning. The tablet PC was setting up the entire syllabi in electronic workbooks so that students could access coursework and complete the required tasks effortlessly.  
Under the project, 2,550 tablet PCs were distributed in 30 schools, 10 each from north, south and central regions in three selected districts.  
The tablets were given to students from grade VI to IX in 24 schools (1,920 PCs). In the remaining six schools, 480 tablets were used by students within schools. In addition, 120 tablet PCs were given to science teachers in selected schools, 30 to headmasters for reporting and monitoring data.  
The report’s major observations include: above average students perform better through the use of E-Learn content but no change was observed in the improvement of average and below average students.
Some other observations were also made - most of the tablets PCs were found broken, regular assessments were not planned and taken between the baseline and end-line assessment test and details of training and trainees were not shared. The tablets were not locked to use for educational purpose alone. Content of another project “E-Learn” was used in this plan. Content for this project was not developed and only tablets were distributed and teachers were trained in selected schools.
The observation also includes that the department would need to justify the requirement of human resource on this project and expenditure of Rs 9.7m. The distribution of tablets to public schools is not a cost-effective solution in countries like Pakistan where millions of students are not attending schools. Also this intervention is not efficient in terms of making a significant effect on the performance of the students. The project highlighted that it is early to scale up this kind of intervention at mass level.
The committee also recommended that the tablets should be locked so that students could use it for educational purpose alone; secondly, the tablets should be handed over to students with proper covers and instructed to handle carefully, digital classrooms should be developed making it cost effective and efficient from learning point of view.
