• Elahi could find ‘saving Imran’ difficult; ‘Q’ inroads in Punjab may help his cause    
LAHORE: Just minutes after the joint opposition’s no-confidence motion was moved in the National Assembly, Prime Minister Imran Khan played his ‘trump card’ by luring PML-Q Punjab president Chaudhry Parvez Elahi to his side with the much-sought after Punjab’s chief ministership.
This single offer has helped PM Khan not only protect his party’s rule in Punjab from his arch-rivals, the PML-N and PPP, but also field the PML-Q to collaborate with other allied parties and disgruntled MNAs to save Imran Khan in the National Assembly.
Just a day ago, the ruling PTI appeared to be losing the political battle. PM Khan concluded his long speech at the Parade Ground on Sunday, alleging hatching of an international conspiracy against his government and some elements in Pakistan being used against him through foreign funding.
Editorial: PM Imran's speech indicates he has come to terms with the likely outcome of the no-trust move
The surprising sacrifice of Usman Buzdar as the chief minister — whom the PM continued to protect through thick and thin and called him ‘Wasim Akram Plus’ — as the clock started ticking for voting on the no-confidence motion against the premier, is being seen as the right move. Still many politicians believe this ‘trump card’ has been revealed quite late, leaving little time for PM Khan to manoeuvre and keep his position intact.
“Seeking Buzdar’s resignation at the eleventh hour is a move a little too late because Mr Khan’s new confidant, Parvez Elahi, has been left with very little time to campaign and persuade the PTI’s disgruntled elements as well as the allied parties, who publicly parted ways with the ruling coalition,” a senior PTI leader said.
“If Mr Khan had made this smart move some two weeks ago, Parvez Elahi had all the guts and skills to persuade and bring back more than the required disgruntled MNAs into the ruling coalition fold,” he added.
Even when there was no clear commitment between the PTI and the PML-Q, Mr Elahi had told a government team, comprising Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Defence Minister Pervaiz Khattak, visiting his residence that they should placate the allied parties, BAP and MQM, by fulfilling all commitments made with them instead of hoodwinking them and offering mere ‘lollipops’. For the PML-Q’s support, Elahi had asked the delegation to make a public announcement of his candidature for the Punjab chief minister.
Since Elahi has only seven days till the final vote count in the National Assembly against the prime minister, PM Khan is banking on his nominee to help him defeat the opposition on the D-Day of no-confidence motion – expected on April 4. Mr Elahi immediately got down to work as he led a high-powered delegation to meet the MQM-P leaders at Parliament Lodges.
Playing in relatively uncertain conditions, a political observer said, Mr Elahi might face a difficulty in saving Imran Khan, but he would be able to make strong inroads in Punjab and enjoy the remaining tenure for himself as well as win a big slice of the pie in the next general elections.
While the PML-Q camp is happy to get the lucrative offer from the government, some in the Chaudhry family are not happy with going with the PTI, and their discussions over the issue continued till late in the night. The family members celebrating are looking at Mr Elahi’s election in the Punjab Assembly as early as possible. Sources say Elahi also contacted Jehangir Tareen in the UK and sought his group’s support for his election as the CM. If the Tareen group — comprising around 18 MPAs — decides to put its weight behind the opposition, it wouldn’t be an easy sailing for Elahi, the sources added.
On the Punjab front, Mr Elahi’s nomination as the chief minister has dashed the hopes of the joint opposition — PML-N and PPP — of getting the no-confidence motion against Usman Buzdar passed in the provincial assembly, and left them no room to elect a CM of their own. The opposition was exceedingly confident of dislodging the PTI government in Punjab, as it was boasting of having many more votes than the 186 needed to remove the chief minister.
Mr Elahi already enjoys strong relations with several MPAs — from the PML-N, PTI and the Tareen group — to protect his position in Punjab. He seems unfazed about his election as the chief minister as he knows could muster the support of more than the required MPAs just like he did during his election as the assembly speaker.
“The Chaudhrys of Gujrat enjoy a certain stature and strength to bring many politicians around them on just one call,” senior politicians in Punjab believe.
In the Punjab Assembly, the PTI has 183 MPAs on its side and PML-Q carries 10 votes. The opposition PML-N has 161 votes and PPP seven. The Rah-i-Haq Party has one vote and there are four independents now after a fifth, Jugnu Mohsin, joined the PML-N recently.
The prime minister’s offer of the chief minister’s office to the PML-Q has other connotations as well, believe PTI members. They say Mr Elahi would not only try to crush the PML-N, but may also strengthen his party enough in the next one-and-a-half years to even shatter the PTI in the province. Since many politicians were brought into the PTI fold from various parties ahead of the 2018 general elections, they could be returning to where they had come from, including Law Minister Basharat Raja and Chaudhry Zaheeruddin back to the PML-Q, for the next elections.
Though PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari continued pushing PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif to offer the Punjab chief ministership to Parvez Elahi to secure his election as the prime minister, but a dispute within the Sharif family did not allow him to make the bold decision.
Several days after Shehbaz had visited the Chaudhrys at their Lahore residence, PML-Q president Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain had claimed to have posed some questions to the PML-N president but never got a response.

1,No-trust resolution against Imran ‘on the table’,ISLAMABAD: The capital on Monday witnessed dramatic political events as within...,"• Deputy speaker allows motion, puts off debate until 31st
• BAP, PML-Q’s Cheema join opposition
• MQM to decide in a day or two   
ISLAMABAD: The capital on Monday witnessed dramatic political events as within an hour of the formal tabling of the no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan in the National Assembly by Leader of the Opposition Shehbaz Sharif, the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) threw its weight behind the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) while the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) crossed over to the opposition, thus making the political situation more perplexed. 
The decision by the leaders of two major allies of the ruling PTI, however, caused a rift within the parties. PML-Q’s Tariq Bashir Cheema categorically announced his support for the opposition whereas the absence of Zubaida Jalal from a joint press conference of the BAP lawmakers with the opposition leaders was noticed by the reporters who were told by the opposition members that she was unhappy over the leadership’s decision and might vote for Imran Khan in the assembly. 
The PML-Q’s decision to continue to be a part of the ruling coalition at the Centre and in Punjab came after PM Khan directly offered the office of Punjab chief minister to Chaudhry Parvez Elahi. 
With numbers game in the assembly now tilting a little in favour of the opposition, the undecided seven-member Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and over a dozen dissidents within the PTI have now acquired a central role in deciding the fate of the no-confidence resolution. 
MQM-P leader Aminul Haq told a TV channel that his party would make its decision in a day or two after having further in-house consultations. 
On the other hand, dissident PTI MNA from Muzaffargarh Basit Bokhari claimed during a TV talk show that some 24 PTI members had decided to support the opposition’s vote of no-confidence and said Imran Khan would not be the country’s prime minister by April 4. 
Tabling of resolution 
National Assembly Deputy Spe­­aker Qasim Suri allowed Shehbaz Sharif to formally table the no-confidence resolution against the prime minister after 161 opposition members supported the motion for its presentation. 
Under the Constitution, a minimum of 20 per cent (69 members) of the total 342-member house is required to support the resolution for its admission and tabling. 
Some treasury members sitting on the back benches raised slogans against the opposition leadership when Mr Sharif was reading out the text of the resolution, which states: “This House is of the view that the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, has lost the confidence of the majority of the members of the National Assembly of Pakistan [and], therefore, he should cease to hold the office.” 
Soon after presentation of the resolution, the deputy speaker adjourned the sitting till March 31 for a “debate”. 
Under the Constitution, the speaker is now bound to put the resolution for a vote not before March 31 and not later than April 4. 
Talking to Dawn after adjournment of the sitting, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA Syed Naveed Qamar said they had been informed by the government side that the speaker would place the resolution before the house for a debate on March 31 and not for voting. He said it seemed that the government would delay the voting by April 4 in an effort to gain time to garner more support. 
Before allowing Shehbaz Sharif to table the resolution, the deputy speaker gave floor to Zain Qureshi to introduce the 26th Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2022 seeking creation of south Punjab province. The bill had been submitted by Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Friday. 
Cheema’s revolt 
Federal Minister for Housing Tariq Bashir Cheema resigned from the cabinet and the party office and vowed to cast his vote against the prime minister soon after Imran Khan offered the office of Punjab chief minister to Parvez Elahi, currently speaker of the provincial assembly, during a meeting at his Banigala residence. 
The meeting took place exactly at a time when the National Assembly was in session to take up the no-trust resolution. 
It may be recalled that Mr Elahi had met the leaders of both the PML-N and PPP on Sunday night and sought some more time for consultations. 
Later, talking to a private TV channel, Mr Cheema said he had always voted in line with the party over the past 18 years, but now he had decided to vote according to his “conscience”, stating that he could not vote for a person [Imran Khan] who had humiliated his party leadership again and again. 
Mr Cheema is also against the idea of creation of south Punjab province and has openly demanded formation of Bahawalpur province. 
BAP joins opposition camp 
The BAP’s decision to join the opposition benches was announced by the party’s parliamentary leader in the National Assembly Khalid Magsi during a hurriedly called news conference with four out of five party lawmakers in the presence of the top opposition leadership at a local hotel. 
Shehbaz Sharif, former president Asif Zardari, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman were also present during the news conference. 
Mr Magsi said his party had reached the conclusion to join the opposition after consultations. He said Balochistan had been ignored and the party wanted the province’s issues to be addressed which was why BAP had decided to support the opposition.  
Mr Magsi got upset when he was asked some nasty and direct questions by reporters about the party’s alleged association with the military establishment. 
“On whose instructions are you asking this question?” replied Mr Magsi when a reporter asked the former on whose instructions he had toppled the PML-N government in Balochistan in 2018. 
“Why are you scared? Why don’t you take the army’s name? Ask me whether I did it on the army’s instructions. And if I did it, so what? I did it. Is it a sin? Did I do it on the Indian army’s instructions? Do not ask pointed questions. If you will do it you will get answers in kind,” he went on saying. 
In response to a similar question if his party had decided to join the opposition’s camp on the instructions of the military establishment, Mr Magsi said: “When they [military establishment] are on the sidelines, you do not forgive them, and when they intervene even then you don’t forgive them.” 
Speaking on the occasion, Shehbaz Sharif challenged Imran Khan to present the letter which he had shown at Sunday’s public meeting as an evidence of the involvement of foreign hands in the no-confidence motion before parliament. He said if he found the evidence true, he would stand by Mr Khan. 
He said that soon after forming the government, they would make efforts to resolve the issues being faced by Balochistan. 
Asif Ali Zardari said that soon they would elect Shehbaz Sharif as the country’s prime minister and there would be ministers in the cabinet from Balochistan. 
Meanwhile, after successfully wooing the PML-Q to his side, Prime Minister Khan held a meeting with a delegation of the MQM-P. He also met some PTI MNAs and members of provincial assemblies from Sindh and Punjab.

2,"‘Terror outfits’ regrouping in Balochistan, NA told","In written reply to a query posed by a lawmaker, interior ministry says terror outfits are regrouping in Balochistan via Sistan.","ISLAMABAD: The interior ministry on Monday confirmed that anti-Pakistan terror outfits are regrouping in Balochistan via the Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchestan.
This was revealed in a written reply submitted to the National Assembly during the question hour in response to a query posed by PPP MNA Dr Shazia Sobia Aslam Soomro. She asked if it was true that “anti-Pakistan terror outfits are regrouping in Balochistan via Sistan, and if yes, details thereof along with action plan thereof, if any”.
In its response, the interior ministry stated: “Yes, anti-Pakistan terror outfits are regrouping in Balochistan via Sistan.” 
The response, attributed to Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, also mentioned the measures being taken by the government to mitigate this trend. 
According to the response placed before the National Assembly on Monday, the National Intelligence Co­ordi­nation Committee (NICC) has been institutionalised to integrate all federal and provincial intelligence grids for effective and timely countermeasures.
Effective border management and fencing along the western border would also stem this tide, the response added.
“Persistent intelligence-based operations are being undertaken to neutralise terror organisations,” the response stated, adding that operational capabilities of the counterterrorism apparatus were being enhanced.
The response also recalled recent government initiatives to engage disgruntle Baloch tribesmen for reconciliation, including special socio-economic development packages for mitigating extremist threats in Balochistan and KP, and addressing the most marginalised segment of society through the “Ehsaas Programme” along with engaging the youth in constructive activities. 
Banned terrorist organisations — including Baloch separatists, the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the self-styled Islamic State (IS) group — have recently intensified their activists in different areas of the province, carrying out terrorist attacks, bomb blasts and targeted killings.  
Since the beginning of the year, these groups have carried out at least seven major attacks, in which at least 22 people lost their lives, including security personnel. 
Two major attacks were carried out at the camps of Frontier Corps in Nushki and Panjgur on Feb 2 at the same time. The attackers were well equipped with the latest weapons and equipment.
Both sides suffered casualties during the attacks — nine security personnel, including an officer, lost their lives, whereas 20 attackers were killed by the security forces.

3,ECP stopped from acting against PM over poll code violations,ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) has restrained the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) from starting...,"ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) has restrained the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) from starting disqualification proceedings against Prime Minister Imran Khan for repeatedly violating the code of conduct in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s local bodies elections. 
The decision was announced by IHC Justice Amir Farooq on Monday while hearing a petition jointly filed by the prime minister and Planning Minister Asad Umar. 
The petition challenged the legality of the poll code issued by the ECP, under which the commission prohibited all parliamentarians holding public office from campaigning in the local bodies elections. 
Earlier this month, the ECP issued notices to Prime Minister Khan, KP Governor Shah Farman, Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, federal ministers Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Asad Umar and Murad Saeed, and others for violating the election code. 
The premier and Mr Umar later petitioned the high court against the ECP notices. 
During the hearing, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan argued that superior courts had already deliberated upon the issue of political parties headed by state functionaries and had barred the president and governors from holding the party position. 
The AGP, however, said the prime minister and the ministers held the executive positions and they were also active members of a political party. 
He pointed out that the ECP had issued notices to PM Khan almost on a daily basis despite the fact that the premier was not a candidate in the local body elections. 
Referring to the recently promulgated Presidential Ordinance on Elections Act, the AGP said the law had now allowed public office holders to canvass in the election. 
Justice Farooq inquired from the ECP’s counsel for reaching the conclusion that the presidential ordinance was not applicable in this scenario and how the commission amended the code of conduct. 
The ECP’s counsel said the commission had devised a code of conduct for free and fair elections. He said the prime minister and other ministers were using state machinery for political campaigns. 
The AGP argued that the premier was paying the expense of election campaigns from his own pocket. 
The premier was entitled to a necessary security protocol during travelling, he said, adding that public office holders could ask for reimbursement for using official resources during the campaigns. 
The attorney general argued that the election commission could disqualify the premier and ministers during a hearing on notices issued for poll code violations. 
The court, however, maintained a status quo in this matter. 
In the petition, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar raised the issue that under the Constitution, the ECP had to abide by the law of the land. 
He submitted that under Article 187-A of the Election Act 2017, all parliamentarians, including those who hold public offices, were entitled to address gatherings during the elections if they comply with the safeguards provided in the law, such as not to use public funds or declare any development projects, etc. 
The public office holders, according to Mr Zafar, were entitled to address people in gatherings, as it was part of their job. 
Barrister Zafar pointed out that under the election act, the ECP was entitled to make a code of conduct in consultation with political parties, but it was not entitled to amend, change, add or delete any provision. 
Only the parliament could change the provisions of the election act, or a court of law could declare a provision as being contrary to the Constitution, he said. 
The petition stated that the ECP was neither the parliament nor a court of law and therefore could not declare a provision of the Election Act 2017 to be contrary to the Constitution or to make it redundant. 
Barrister Zafar pointed out that in the case at hand, the ECP had acted as a legislature and a court by declaring Section 187-A of the election act as unconstitutional under the garb of amending para 16 in the code of conduct. 
After hearing both parties, the court ordered that the ECP should file a reply to the petition and directed that no adverse action should be taken against the prime minister or Asad Umar in the meantime regarding the code of conduct.

4,"With first wicket down, PDM vows to oust PM","PM is using ""religious card"" to save his regime, has lost the confidence of parliament and his own party: Maryam.","ISLAMABAD: In its tit-for-tat power show, held just a day after the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf held a large public meeting in the federal capital, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) on Monday renewed its pledge to topple the Imran government, noting that his first wicket — that of the Punjab chief minister — had already fallen.
The opposition show of power along the Srinagar Highway was addressed by PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz and leader of the opposition in Punjab Assembly Hamza Shehbaz and other leaders after their caravan, which had set off from Lahore on March 26, arrived two days later in Islamabad’s Sector H-9 where Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) supporters had set up camp.
The participants decided to remain at the same venue until the day of voting on the opposition’s no-trust motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, despite warnings from the interior minister against turning the opposition rally into a prolonged sit-in.
Addressing the crowd, PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz said PM Khan was using the ‘religious card’ to save his regime. She said the prime minister had sacrificed his main pillar in Punjab — Chief Minister Usman Buzdar — in order to save his own skin. 
“You pushed your most trustworthy man [Buzdar] into the water to save your own rule. We have not seen such an ungrateful man in our whole lives. He also sacrificed PTI leader Jehangir Tarin,” she reminded the crowd. 
About the letter that the PM had brandished the previous night, the PML-N leader said he had shown a fake letter, which even the interior minister was unaware of.
Ms Nawaz said the time had come to give final push to the prime minister, saying that no one would come to his rescue. 
She said PM Khan had already lost people’s confidence, which was also indicated by the ruling party’s defeat in 15 out of 16 by-elections in recent months. “Today he has also lost confidence of the parliament and his own party,” she added.
Ms Nawaz said the prime minister had no right to sit in the PM House and to decide to fate of the country. 
“I challenge you to have 172 MNAs with you on the voting day on no-trust motion,” she added.
Speaking on the occasion, Hamza Shehbaz said Mr Khan’s days in government were numbered, adding that he was yet to provide answers about the funding he and his party had received from abroad. 
“If we had taken kickbacks and commissions in the government contracts, we will apologise to the nation and will go home. But we have not committed money laundering. Now you have to answer about illegal foreign funding,” he added. 
“I want to say to my nation that politics and life will move on but if the crippling economy is hit by another jolt, the nuclear programme of the country might also be affected. If we do not throw Imran out today, Allah will ask us what you have done to provide relief to the poor who were worst affected by Imran’s faulty policies,” he added.
PPP leader Nayyar Bukhari said the Supreme Court had clearly said whatever its decision on the government’s reference, it will not affect the opposition’s no-trust motion. 
He claimed that under the Constitution, Chief Minister Usman Buzdar was supposed to submit his resignation to the Punjab governor, not the prime minister. 
Prominent among others who were present on the occasion were: JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Awami National Party (ANP) leader Mian Iftikhar, Aftab Sherpao, Mehmood Achakzai etc.
Addressing the crowd, Mr Iftikhar said the opposition would continue its struggle till the removal of the prime minister. He said insurgency and terrorism were again rising in the country due to lack of implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP). If the situation did not change, “Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan will face another wave of bomb blasts in the days to come,” he feared. 
Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai said will the opposition leadership would be able to put the country back on right track after Imran Khan’s oister.
He said a high level meeting should be called, which should be attended by represenatatives of the judiciary, army, media and other stakeholders, who will vow that all institutions will work under their own domain.
He also called on PML-N leader Shehbaz Sharif not to accept premiership of a country that had “no rule of law”.
The JUI-F security force, Ansarul Islam, was seen at the venue of the public meeting while heavy contingents of police were present on the highway. Interestingly, the local administration of Islamabad had not given any permission to the organisers for a sit-in.
