0,Absence of investigation officer in case against ‘serial rapist’ irks ATC,Police claim to have arrested the accused for sexually assaulting minor girls in Karachi's Malir district between 2015 and 2018,"KARACHI: Expressing its annoyance over failure of the investigating officer in producing witnesses, an antiterrorism court has directed the prosecution to bind down the IO to produce witnesses for recording their testimonies against a man allegedly involved in a series of rapes of minor girls.
Police claimed to have arrested the accused for kidnapping and sexually assaulting minor girls in different areas of Malir district between 2015 and 2018.
The ATC-X judge, who is conducting the trial in five identical cases in the judicial complex inside the central prison, took up the case for recording statements of the prosecution witnesses.
The accused was produced in custody, but his counsel Liaqat Hussain Khokhar and IO DSP Ali Hassan Shah were absent.
Since Jan 12, the judge has been directing the prosecution to bind down the IO to produce witness for recording their statements against the accused but to no avail.
Taking notice of such an attitude, the judge once again directed the prosecution to ask the IO to appear in court on April 6 and also produce the witnesses so that their testimonies could be recorded. 
According to the prosecution, the suspect was caught red-handed in the Sukkan area while allegedly trying to kidnap a minor girl with the intention to rape her.
It said though the child was not subjected to any sexual assault, on “suspicion” the police obtained the suspect’s DNA sample and sent it to a laboratory for cross-matching with those drawn from four minor girls who had earlier been subjected to a sexual assault but their cases had been pending trial since 2015.
The prosecutor had disclosed that the medical report revealed that the suspect’s sample had matched with those of the five children, who were victims of a sexual assault. 
Five cases were registered under Sections 363 (punishment for kidnapping) and 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 at Sukkan, Shah Latif and Quaidabad police stations.

1,Sindh set to import 1.9m doses of cattle vaccine after Drap approval,"Over 30,000 animals affected by lumpy skin disease across province; vaccination drive likely to begin later this week.","KARACHI: As the number of cattle suffering from lumpy skin disease crossed 30,000 on Monday with more than half of the cases reported in Karachi alone, the Sindh government finally placed the order for importing around two million doses of vaccines from Turkey at a cost of Rs500 million after getting permission from the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap).
Sources said that the Sindh government processed the whole exercise on a war footing basis to initiate vaccination by the end of current week and the latest development had lifted their hopes with regard to meeting the deadline. 
They said that a Punjab-based veterinary medicines and vaccines importing and marketing company had won the bid to supply the imported vaccine.
“We are importing 1.9 million doses of these vaccines through Punjab-based Huzaifa International,” Sindh Livestock and Fisheries Secretary Tameezuddin Khero told Dawn. “The provincial government has set aside Rs500 million for the vaccine import programme.” 

Over 30,000 animals affected by lumpy skin disease across province; vaccination drive likely to begin later this week

He said that it was mandatory to take permission from Drap for the import of any vaccines or veterinary medicines. “The good thing is our supplier got the approval on Saturday and the order is finally placed today [Monday]. Now all the focus is on transportation of the consignment.”
Cold chain management
The senior official said the vaccines required to be kept at a certain temperature while being transported from Turkey and for that purpose a cargo plane with cold chain equipment was being hired by the supplier.
With all the process in place, he said, the government was expecting the plane with consignment of 1.9m doses to land within the next few days.
A local vaccine importer said that the freeze-dried vaccine is stored usually at a refrigerator temperature, and for transport, the vaccine vials need to be kept at a stable temperature of 4 degrees centigrade to 8°C. During vaccination campaigns, he suggested, all such vaccines are believed to be sensitive to direct sunlight and, therefore, they should be kept in the shades. 
For vaccinating the cattle, the government has claimed to have made a “comprehensive plan”.
“We have already designed a detailed plan for distribution of these doses considering the number of cases in each district,” Mr Khero said. “Our provincial task force on LSD under livestock director general has completed its homework. So far most LSD cases are found in Karachi so definitely major focus of the programme will be here.
17,270 animals affected in Karachi
The outbreak of LSD in cows in a number of areas of Sindh and Punjab earlier this month caused much trepidation among dairy and cattle farmers. 
Though some farmers claim to have suffered major losses, the government data shows so far little more than 30,000 animals had contracted the infection. 
A latest report shared by the provincial task force on LSD suggested that by March 27, total 30,469 animals across the province were found with LSD.
“Among them 17,270 are in Karachi followed by 4,595 in Thatta, 983 in Badin, 950 in Thana Bhula Khan, 847 in Tando Muhammad Khan, 824 in Sanghar, 761 in Hyderabad, 705 in Khairpur, 611 in Kambar Shahdadkot, 565 Jamshoro, 356 in Sujawal, 333 in Larkana and other districts with less than 100 cases,” said an official.

3,"Centre doesn’t need Sindh’s permission to export its gas to other provinces, SHC told",Court terms petroleum secretary’s statement ‘surprising’ keeping in view Article 158 of the Constitution.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Monday directed the petroleum secretary to explain as to how the federal government was taking natural gas from Sindh without its consent to supply it to other provinces.
Petroleum Secretary Ali Raza Bhutta submitted before the SHC that the federal government did not need any permission from province of Sindh to take its natural gas.
He made this comment after the provincial authorities said that Sindh had never given any permission to the federation to take its gas.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha observed that the statement of the petroleum secretary was surprising in view of Article 158 of the Constitution.

Court terms petroleum secretary’s statement ‘surprising’ keeping in view Article 158 

On the previous hearing, the bench was informed that 15 per cent less gas was being provided to Sindh in order to accommodate other provinces. It had directed the petroleum secretary and Sindh energy secretary to appear along with relevant documentation about an agreement between the federation and province of Sindh.
When the bench took up for hearing a set of petitions seeking gasification of villages around exploration and production sites in Sindh on Monday, the Sindh chief secretary and energy secretary in their comments submitted that there was no agreement or permission signed by the Sindh government about “export of gas to other provinces”.
They maintained that on the contrary, the provincial authorities had time and again approached the federal government and the Council of Common Interest about shortage of natural gas in Sindh and violation of the Constitution.
They further submitted that Sindh was the largest gas producing province and under Article 158 of the Constitution, the areas/provinces producing natural gas had the first right over it.
However, the petroleum secretary contended that the federal government needed no permission to take gas from Sindh.
But, the bench in its order said that the official had not annexed any document or direction in writing which could legally support his claim.
“We find his statement to be rather surprising, keeping in view Article 158 of the Constitution, however, on the next date of hearing the Secretary Ministry of Petroleum shall file detailed response setting out legal basis in which the Federal Government is exporting gas from Province of Sindh without its consent along with any agreements / directions or documents which might support his claim in this regard prior to the next date of hearing with an advance copy to the Advocate General Sindh,” the court order said.
While adjourning the hearing till May 9, the bench also directed Mr Bhutta to ensure his presence in court on the next date.
The petroleum secretary and Sui Southern Gas Company managing director filed compliance reports in the light of earlier orders of the bench about gasification, approval of funds and establishment of educational institutions in the areas / villages located near gas fields in Sindh.
They submitted in the reports that the required funds had been released and now available with the National Bank of Pakistan.
The bench directed the SSGC chief to transfer the funds into the accounts of the company so that gasification of the villages as per the apex court order could be implemented. 
The bench suspended the show-cause notice earlier issued to the petroleum secretary for not releasing the funds.
Around 10 identical petitions were filed in SHC regarding non-provision of gas and welfare funds for the villagers located within five kilometres radius of each exploration and production site despite Supreme Court’s directives issued in December 2013.

4,Two’s company,Ullu Aur Billi is Urdu adaptation of Bill Manhoff’s play The Owl and the Pussycat,"KARACHI: In performing arts, the world of theatre, inarguably, is the most challenging one for the simple reason that it doesn’t allow the actors (I repeat: actors, not the backstage team) to make too many mistakes because there’s no chance of, or time for, recovery and redemption. 
And whenever a play, which has only a couple of characters, is staged, the challenge becomes manifold. Why? Answer: the two have to feed off each other’s energies and overlook, as soon as possible, not only your own goof-ups but your partner’s as well. 
The penultimate drama put up on Sunday evening by the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) at its ongoing Young Director Festival was Ullu Aur Billi an Urdu adaptation — by Saqib Khan and directed by Ansaar Mahar — of Bill Manhoff’s play The Owl and the Pussycat. It revolves around two characters, Sharafat Ali (Syed Qasim Shah) and Naina (Hani Taha).
As is often the case in a two-person story, Sharafat and Naina come from different, but not diametrically opposed, backgrounds. He teaches at a school and is an aspiring writer. She pretends to be a model and is actually a ‘call girl’. Now showbiz, even at a pretentious level, and writing (if the latter can be called a profession) are not distant cousins who live far from each other — they are, in a way, related. Therefore the romantic tension and the creative connection are there for the audience to feel.

Ullu Aur Billi is Urdu adaptation of Bill Manhoff’s play The Owl and the Pussycat

The action begins when Naina comes knocking heavily on Sharafat’s door because she’s been evicted from her apartment. Sharafat is initially reluctant because she is extremely garrulous, under-educated and doesn’t seem to have any filters when she speaks. He, at least initially, is a careful user of the Urdu language, since he’s a writer — the contrast between the uncouth and the unschooled is played out. After an exchange of heated and occasionally funny lines where Sharafat resists her presence at his place, and she falls for him, he takes a shine to her. But then, her profession keeps returning to haunt him.
Ullu Aur Billi works with a tried and tested idea reasonably well. It’s a good production. Syed Qasim Shah and Hani Taha do a nice job. Hani seems to have nervous energy in abundance. Energy it is, make no mistake. But once she’s able to get rid of the nervousness, she can do much better.
Also, the play could’ve been edited to tighten the structure. All said and done, it had the audience’s undivided attention, which is what counts in the real sense.

5,Book on violence against women in US launched,Author says purpose of book was to make people aware of what’s happening to South Asian women in US,"KARACHI: Aurat Foundation on Monday evening introduced the book Parkatey Parindey, an Urdu translation of Birds without Wings by Dr Annie Irshad to the media at the Karachi Press Club (KPC). 
Speaking on the occasion, Mahnaz Rahman said the foundation has had many press conferences on violence against women but the book is the first one in which those Pakistani girls and women are mentioned who face domestic violence not in Pakistan but in the United States. 
It is a big social issue. It was the author of the book, Ms Irshad, who got in touch with Sheema Kermani and her (Ms Rahman) and told them that about the stories in the book. They contain stories which are to do with the fact that when a man from abroad asks a Pakistani woman’s hand in marriage, it is generally thought that the rishta would be a good one. That’s not necessarily the case.
The translator of the book, Ghazala Fasih, said women, be they living in Asia or America, have to suffer the worst kind of violence. Dr Annie Irshad through her book has given voice to voiceless women. As per a demographic survey carried out in the US, every minute 20 men and women, mostly the latter, fall victim to violence; and one out of every four women has to bear the worst physical torture. 

Author says purpose of book was to make people aware of what’s happening to South Asian women in US

However, in American society, such an act is reported and action is taken against the perpetrator. In Pakistan, according to a 2018 survey, 28 per cent women face violence either from their life partners or relatives. There are countless incidents which don’t get reported. 
Ms Fasih said when she first met Dr Irshad, she had already written Birds without Wings. She wanted it to present it in the Urdu version. “I read the book and felt a shock. Even in a society like America where there is rule of law such horrible incidents take place. The author has quoted an incident that took place in Texas where an Asian woman became so affected by violence that she first killed her children and then committed suicide.”
Sheema Kermani said one and a half years back the author gave her the book to read. The first thing that struck her in the book was the abovementioned incident in which a woman killed her children and herself. It reminded her of the Greek tragedy, Medea. The incident led to the establishment of the shelter house, Daya. The stories in the book are painful and heart wrenching. We know that it’s happening in our society, but we don’t realise that it can happen in the US as well. So the commitment of the author and the organisation that she volunteered was important. 
“Not only was she working in that shelter and helping the women who were going through a tough time, but also wrote their stories. That commitment must be praised,” she said. 
Ms Kermani said the author has fictionalised nothing in the book. The problem with us is that our values are not changing. Values such as ‘once the girl gets married, only her dead body will come out of her husband’s place’ must change. “We need to finish those. New ideas must come forward.”
Dr Annie Irshad said the purpose of writing the book along with her sister Maria was clear: people should be aware of what’s happening to South Asian women in the US. 
A doctor by profession, the writer said she used to think that domestic violence only happened in Pakistan and girls would be safe in the US. What she saw in the US made her think that the mentality [of desis] is poorer than those who live in Pakistan. 
“I started working at the shelter home as a volunteer. The stories in the book cover four years, 2016 to 2020. During those years I counselled 50 clients but not a majority of them were comfortable with their stories being written,” she said and hoped that the book would reach a wider audience.

Mr Sheikh along with the then director-commercial Sameen Asghar and other key officers and private contractors was charged with corruption of Rs1.21bn in award of the contract of steels items at exorbitant rates.
Accountability Court-IV Judge Suresh Kumar pronounced his verdict reserved after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides.
The judge ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove the charge against the accused. He directed the prison authorities to release them forthwith, if their custody was not required in any other case.
Accused Badaruddin Akber Ali, Mehmood Ali Mehkri, Shah Nawaz Ishtiaq, Sarfaraz Hussain, Asif Bhagani, Muhammad Zafar Ali Khan, Dewan M Abu Obaida Farooqui, Ch. Jamal Abdul Nasir, Muhammad Hashim, Farooq Ahmed, Zubair Shaukat and Sikandar Ali Jatoi were among acquitted.
Special public prosecutor Dr Raja Muhammad Ali argued that an inquiry had transpired alleged corruption and corrupt practices of the PSM’s top management in collusion with dealers during the sales period of 2008-09.
He submitted that in November 2008 the prices of PSM products were reduced up to 35 per cent in comparison to local and international market, but when local and international market was at higher side the prices were not increased by the PSM and in this way a financial loss amounting to billions of rupees was caused to the exchequer.
He further stated that the top PSM management by abusing their official position with a common objective and criminal intention, fraudulently and dishonestly with ulterior motives caused pecuniary wrongful loss to the mills and corresponding wrongful gain to the directors/owners of private firms and others.
Advocates Shaukat Hayat and Shah Nawaz Dahri, who represented the accused, denied the allegations of the prosecution. They pleaded the court to acquit their clients of the false and fabricated allegations.

10,"Federal, Sindh officials to be impleaded in suit against forestland allotment",KARACHI: A senior civil judge of Ghotki on Monday ordered impleading the federal Environmental Protection Agency...,"KARACHI: A senior civil judge of Ghotki on Monday ordered impleading the federal Environmental Protection Agency secretary, Sindh chief secretary, forest secretary and chief conservator and Sindh Board of Revenue secretary as parties in a lawsuit against “illegal” allotment of hundreds of acres of Jahanpur forestlands in Ghotki taluka to influential persons for farming.
Judge Abdul Shakoor Kalhoro passed the order on a civil suit filed by Abdul Khalique and other private plaintiffs in respect of 1-17 acres of forest land in Deh Essawari of the taluka and also directed the federal and provincial authorities to submit comments about the status of the land in dispute showing official position of the forest land, as per direction of superior courts.
Deputy district attorney Javed Hussain Seelro contended that the land in question used to be a thick jungle by the name of Jahanpur forest, a reserved forest land, but the plaintiffs in the present suit had shown the land as purchased from one Mohammad Shareef Arain, who had in turn derived his title from one Mian Abdul Aziz, shown as original grantee of an area of 239-10 acres of land on the strength of a T.O form. But any such grant of the reserved forest land was a violation of Section 23 of the Forest Act, 1927, he argued.
The attorney contended that facts had been concealed from the court while presenting the plaint. The disputed land was part of the reserved forest declared by the Government Reserved Forest vide 1887 Bombay Government Gazette, he said.
He said the forest department had on purpose not been made party in the suit. “The forests in Sindh or Pakistan are an important natural resource and illegal deforestation on the basis of highly objectionable and illegal grants of forest land after bypassing the forest department has posed a serious threat to Pakistan and world’s biodiversity,” he said.  
“The reserved forest of Jahanpur in Ghotki was previously home to a great number of animals and plant species,” said the attorney, claiming that “when forests are logged and destroyed illegally in the wake of possession of the forest land by different local influential persons, animal and plant species are driven into extinction”.
“As large areas of forest are cleared away, allowing the exposed earth to wither and die and the habitats of innumerable species to be destroyed, the loss of forests has an immediate and direct effect on the lifestyle of the residents of Ghotki which has turned into a highly industrialised part of Sindh,” he said.
The attorney prayed that an opportunity be given to the forest department to defend the leftover lands of forest in Jahanpur and the revenue department or Guddu barrage authorities’ act of granting hundreds of acres of reserved forest of Jahanpur to influential persons under permanent tenure be declared illegal, mala fide, unconstitutional and a clear violation of the Forest Act, because the forest land could not be subjected to private ownership unless it was first reclassified as agricultural land and so released for alienation.
He said that illegal exploitation of natural resources like reserved forest land should be stopped and the courts should intervene in such cases. “It is necessary for the conservation of biodiversity and natural resources of Sindh,” he said. 
Such illegal grants of forest lands by Guddu barrage and revenue authorities had jeopardised all biome (an area classified according to the species that live in that location) conservation through questionable environmental policies whereby they disposed of the land with thick forest cover to a few influential persons, he added. 
The attorney submitted that over the past four decades the revenue and Guddu barrage authorities had violated the environmental legislation i.e. Forest Act, 1927, by removing vast areas from protection and encouraging overexploitation of natural resources, which would result in loss of biodiversity, reduction of forest cover, and increased pollution of soil and water in Ghotki.
He alleged that forest department officials were neglecting forest protection and conservation as a prime responsibility since earlier there was no effective regeneration policy about the protection of forest land. Most of the forest lands with trees cover were left bare and devoid of any plantation, leaving them at the mercy of nearby landowners who gradually took them over for agricultural purposes, he said.
“The practice of taking over state and forest land gradually changed from surreptitious to blatant; unfortunately revenue department had also been making unlawful allotment of land owned by the forest department and allowing its institutional use without forest department’s consent. 
He argued that the Supreme Court had issued certain directions to the Sindh government for cancellation of such illegal grants but for the reasons best known to them, neither the revenue authorities nor the forest department seemed interested in complying with the directions of the apex court to rectify the record of rights and retrieve the occupied forest land.

The Sukkur police using CRD (criminal record-identification device) identified one of them as Imran Bhayo, son of Umer Deen, a most wanted criminal carrying a head money of Rs10 million notified by Sindh government.
Giving details of the alleged encounter, a spokesman for the Sukkur police said that on a tip-off about movement of the gangsters within the limits of the Airport police station, SSP Sanghar Malik had on Sunday night ordered cordoning of different roads and the city’s entry/exit points. 
The spokesman said that at one such point, police signaled a Suzuki Mehran car to stop for checking but its driver broke the cordon and sped away. 
A police party chased the car and alerted all personnel manning check posts in the area. The car was intercepted on Kando Wahan link road but its occupants opened fire on police to escape arrest.
The spokesman said that a fierce gun battle ensued during which both car riders sustained fatal bullet wounds. 
According to the Sukkur police, Imran Bhayo was the ringleader of an interprovincial gang of car-lifters operating in Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab for long. He and his accompanying gangster, Mir Dost Bhayo, were wanted by police in dozens of cases of heinous crimes. 
“Initial checking of police record shows more than 60 such cases registered against them at various police stations of Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab,” he said, adding that more cases against them might surface in further checking.
The spokesman said that a Kalashnikov rifle, a pistol, ammunition, car-lifting gadgets, some police uniforms and fake number plates, besides the car they were riding, were seized from the dead gangsters.

A repeat of previous day’s uproar was witnessed when heirs and relatives of the deceased woman accused the duty doctors and paramedics of showing negligence in handling the case.  
Yasmeen Magsi, a resident of Arija Pherhi Wara, was brought to the hospital and admitted for delivery on Monday. She delivered a baby girl but her condition started deteriorating, her father, Ali Gul Magsi, said, adding that many pints of blood had to be provided for transfusion as she underwent three surgeries within 24 hours.
He alleged that the staff handling the case demonstrated negligence leading to her death. 
Shocked heirs and furious relatives held a noisy protest at the hospital demanding a fair probe into the alleged negligence. “Instead of satisfying us by giving any valid reason leading to her death, the staff resorted to issuing threats,” they deplored.
A team from the Sachal police station came to the hospital and ascertained facts about the episode.
The protesters left the hospital with the body only after they were assured that appropriate action would be taken against anyone found responsible for the woman’s death.
A day earlier, a similar protest was held and police had to restore law and order at the hospital when family members and relatives of another woman, Rahat Khatoon, died during delivery process. They held duty doctors responsible the death of the woman and one of her twin babies.
Zainul Abedin Chandio, husband of the deceased woman, accused the duty doctors of unnecessarily and negligently delaying the delivery process.

Talking to media at his office,  the top provincial bureaucrat, who is due to retire soon, said that after considerable improvement in the law and order situation due to Karachi Operation, another major challenge was lack of proper infrastructure in the provincial capital. 
He pointed out that there were at least six mass transit projects being jointly carried out by the Sindh and federal governments that would likely to be completed in eight to 10 years coupled with the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR). He expressed the hope that when those mass transit projects would be integrated with the KCR, the problem of commuting would be minimised. During the intervening period, the major project of water provision, K-IV, would also likely to be completed to provide drinking water facility to the increasing population of the city, he added. 
The chief secretary revealed that a restructuring plan of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) was also under way and hinted that under the proposed plan; chief executive officer or head of the water body might be selected from the private sector to run it in an effective manner. 
Answering a question, he said there might be fair share of criticism over continuity of the system or government in Sindh for the past 14 years, but there were also positive aspects. 
One of the important things was Thar coal project whose achievement became possible mainly because of continuation of the government in the province. The coal project development had led massive infrastructure uplift in the desert where even an airport facility had been provided. 
Another good thing to be noted was introduction of the ‘public-private partnership’ (PPP) mode whose first project had been the highway between Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas.
