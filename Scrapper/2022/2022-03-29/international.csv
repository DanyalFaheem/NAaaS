About a dozen labor unions that organised the strike want the government to provide universal social security coverage for workers in the vast unorganised sector, hike the minimum wage under a flagship employment guarantee programme and stop the privatisation of public-sector banks.
The strikers are also demanding that the government halt plans to sell state assets.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government says privatising some state-owned banks would overhaul the banking industry and that asset sales would help raise money to spur economic growth.
The strike had little impact in India’s capital, New Delhi, and the financial hub of Mumbai, but daily life was affected elsewhere, including southern Kerala, where the state government led by the opposition Communist Party of India backed the protest. In some states, demonstrators blocked highways and railroad tracks, affecting public transportation.
The All Indian Trade Union Congress, one of the country’s largest trade unions, said it expected more than 200 million formal and informal workers would join the strike, but the figure could not be independently verified.
The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, an important trade union affiliated with the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, said it wouldn’t participate in the strike, calling it politically motivated.
Essential services related to banking, transportation, railways and electricity were expected to be impacted in several states. A number of public-sector banks, including India’s largest lender, the state-run State Bank of India, said banking services may be affected because many employees were expected to join the strike.
India’s economy has bounced back after experiencing a major blow during the first two years of the pandemic. But many jobs have disappeared, with unemployment rising to 8pc in December.
Modi’s government grappled last year with huge farmer protests demanding the repeal of new agriculture laws it had billed as necessary reforms.
The protests by farmers, who feared the laws would dramatically reduce their incomes, forced Modi to make a rare retreat just ahead of crucial state elections that his party eventually won.

1,Biden sticks to suggestion Putin should step down,"""I was expressing moral outrage that I feel — I make no apologies for my personal feelings,"" he says.","WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden refused on Monday to back down on his weekend declaration in a major speech that Russian leader Vladimir Putin  “cannot stay in power” — arguing that he was voicing personal  “outrage.”  
“I’m not walking anything back... I want to make it clear, I wasn’t then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change. I was expressing moral outrage that I feel — I make no apologies for my personal feelings,” he told reporters at the White House.
Biden’s remark — delivered in Warsaw at the close of three days of marathon diplomacy on Saturday — was seen as a gaffe by Republicans and some independent analysts concerned over a president going off-script when dealing with such a combustible conflict.
Biden said he was not worried that it would ratchet up tensions with Putin over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, adding that he was  “talking to the Russian people, telling them what we thought.”  “I don’t care what he thinks,” Biden added.  “This is guy who goes to the beat of his own drummer and the idea that he is going to do something outrageous because I called him for what he was and what he’s doing, I think is just not rational.” Ukraine’s government says that as many as 10,000 people may have died since the start of Putin’s invasion more than a month ago.
Russian attacks near Kyiv have cut power to more than 80,000 homes, despite an apparent retreat in Moscow’s war aims to focus on eastern Ukraine.
Biden left the door open to further diplomacy with Putin, however, saying US agreement to a meeting would depend  “on what he wants to talk about.”  “The question is, is there something to meet on that would justify him being able to end this war and being able to rebuild Ukraine,” Biden told reporters.

2,Crisis-hit Sri Lanka in talks with India for $1.5bn credit,It is struggling to pay for imports after a 70pc drop in foreign exchange reserves in two years led to a currency devaluation.,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka has sought an additional credit line of $1.5 billion from India to import essentials, the island nation’s central bank governor said on Monday, amid its worst economic crisis in decades.
The country of 22 million people is struggling to pay for essential imports after a 70pc drop in foreign exchange reserves in two years led to a currency devaluation and efforts to seek help from global lenders. Fuel is in short supply, food prices are rocketing and protests have broken out as Sri Lanka’s government prepares for talks with the International Monetary Fund amid concerns over the country’s ability to pay back foreign debt.
The new line is on top of the $1 billion support extended by India to help pay for critical imports when Sri Lankan Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa travelled to New Delhi earlier this month. “There is a very close discussion continuing for an additional support of $1.5 billion (with India) by way of oil support as well as other essential goods support of credit terms,” Ajith Nivard Cabraal told an online event.
Cabraal’s comments followed a report that said the crisis-hit country was in talks with India for an additional credit line of $1 billion.
Delhi has indicated it would meet the request for the new line, to be used for importing items such as rice, wheat flour, pul­ses, su­g­ar and medicines, one sou­r­ce briefed on the matter said.

3,Deaths of generals expose Russia’s troubles in Ukraine,"According to Kyiv, seven Russian generals have been killed since the invasion was launched on Feb 24.","PARIS: The killing in action of several Russian generals and senior military figures in Ukraine has revealed the extent of the heavy losses and logistical problems encountered by Moscow’s invading army.
According to Kyiv, seven Russian generals have been killed since the invasion was launched on Feb 24, in what Western officials say would be an unusually high casualty rate among military top brass.
It is not possible to independently verify this figure and official Russian sources have so far confirmed only the death of one general and another senior naval commander.
According to the Ukraine defence ministry on Friday, the seventh Russian general to lose his life was Lieutenant General Yakov Rezantsev who was killed in fighting in Chornobaivka outside the southern city of Kherson.
“I would treat these numbers with a grain of salt,” said Colin Clarke, director of research at the New York-based research thank tank Soufan Centre.
“But whether it’s five or 15 generals, the fact that they are losing any generals at all demonstrates that Russian command-and-control is extremely weak and its lines of communication have been severed by Ukrainian military success,” he added.
In a post on Telegram, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s adviser Mykhailo Podoliak described an  “extraordinary” death rate among Russian generals and senior military figures.
“This is a sign of total unpreparedness of the army,” he said.  “All this, no doubt, demoralises the Russian army — they realise that their top leadership is completely incompetent”.
The weaknesses shown by the Russian army in Ukraine, in particular in intelligence, logistics and tactical errors, have forced military chiefs to go to the front lines, said a senior French military official, who asked not to be named.
“Orders may not have been well understood or received, units could be disobedient or there is a major problem with morale. All this could make the generals go to the front.”
Of the generals, only the death in action on Feb 28 of Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, deputy commander of Russia’s 41st Combined Arms Army, has been confirmed by official Russian sources.

5,Beyond the slap: five other talking points from Oscars,"HOLLYWOOD: With due respect to a historic best picture win for  “CODA,” only one talking point dominated...","HOLLYWOOD: With due respect to a historic best picture win for  “CODA,” only one talking point dominated Sun­day’s Oscars — Will Smith striking Chris Rock. That moment seems certain to launch endless memes, but here are five other talking points from the ceremony: 
Hosts return
The first Oscars with hosts since 2018 had a trio of women helming the show — Wanda Sykes, Amy Schumer and Regina Hall — who wasted no time compensating for recent humorless years.
Leonardo DiCaprio has  “done so much to fight climate change and leave behind a cleaner, greener planet for his girlfriends,” said Schumer, joking about his penchant for younger women.
‘Time is due’
Oscars producers had promised to highlight not just this year’s nominated films, but classic movies of the past.
These included a segment on the 50th anniversary of  “The Godfather” which brought Francis Ford Coppola, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro to the stage.
“The time is due that I do, because it was his participation and his decisions at the end that made it possible,” said Coppola. Uma Thurman and John Travolta performed their distinctive dance from  “Pulp Fiction,” before Samuel L Jackson withdrew the best actor envelope from the film’s mysterious glowing briefcase.
But others — such as a video montage of James Bond films, bizarrely introduced by sporting stars Shaun White, Tony Hawk, and Kelly Slater — fell flat.
Snyder’s Army
Another innovation intended to lure back viewers to the Oscars was two prizes voted on by the public via Twitter, including a  “fan favorite” film.
If producers had hoped last year’s smash hit  “Spider-Man: No Way Home” would win, they were left disappointed.
Branagh finally wins
His childhood-inspired  “Belfast” did not win best picture, but Kenneth Branagh finally won his first Oscar in eight nominations — across a record seven categories. Branagh won best original screenplay for his deeply personal black-and-white drama about the outbreak of violence in 1960s Northern Ireland, which forced him and his family to flee.
Liza Minnelli 
One of the night’s more touching moments came at its finale, as Lady Gaga accompanied Liza Minnelli, in a wheelchair, to announce the best picture winner.

6,Evacuation order issued after avalanche hits Anchorage,ANCHORAGE: Residents of a suburb of Anchorage in Alaska were ordered on Sunday to evacuate a mountainous area after...,"ANCHORAGE: Residents of a suburb of Anchorage in Alaska were ordered on Sunday to evacuate a mountainous area after one massive avalanche buried a road and another huge slide was considered imminent.
Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson issued the evacuation order, citing  “a grave and immediate threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens” in the affected area at Eagle River, on the city’s outskirts.
The avalanche roared down a mountainside shortly before midnight local time on Thursday covering the main road with a snow layer up to 80 feet deep. But only about half of the snow in the unstable slide zone was released then, and a secondary avalanche is considered certain, local officials said.
“If we have an uncontrolled release at an unknown time, that could result in the loss of life. We want to do everything we can to prevent that,” Anchorage Municipal Manager Amy Demboski said at a Sunday news conference. The avalanche cut off access to about 100 homes, some of which are now without power, Demboski said.
The evacuation of homes in the affected neighborhood and mitigation efforts that include placing explosives by helicopter to create a controlled avalanche are intended to make the area safer over the coming days, Demboski said.
Emergency responders have cut a small trail to those stranded residents and are running snowmobile shuttles, said Assistant Anchorage Fire Chief Alex Boyd, the incident commander.
There have been no injuries reported, said Corey Allen Young, Bronson’s spokesman, by email, and officials are assessing the extent of damage to houses.
While avalanches are common in the region’s Chugach Mountains, the size and location of this slide make it an unprecedented event, officials said.
“The size of this avalanche is massive. It has been described by avalanche experts as a once-in-a-hundred-year event,” Demboski said at the news conference.

7,Pandemic pushes 90m in Asia-Pacific into extreme poverty: report,"Over 150m and 170m live on less than $3.20 and $5.50 a day, respectively, due to the pandemic’s adverse impacts on livelihoods.","ISLAMABAD: Nearly 90 million people in Asia-Pacific region are likely to have been pushed into extreme poverty, and over 150m and 170m live on less than $3.20 and $5.50 a day, respectively, due to the pandemic’s adverse impacts on livelihoods — by way of falling incomes, remittances and consumption, says a new report released two years after Covid-19 that began spreading around the world.
The report, “Building Forward Together: Towards an Inclusive and Resilient Asia and the Pacific”, jointly released on Monday by the Asian Development Bank, UN Development Programme and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP), says the crisis has also widened and depended existing inequalities within and between countries.
To estimate the impact of Covid-19 on poverty and inequality, the World Bank, together with national statistics offices, conducted on phone surveys in 34 countries worldwide. 
All six countries in the sample from Asia and the Pacific reported higher income losses for the bottom 40 per cent than for the top 60pc of the population at the national level and in rural areas.
On average, Covid-19 induced extreme poverty in the 34 countries is estimated to have increased by 0.9 percentage points and income inequality, as measured by Gini coefficient, is estimated to have climbed 0.3 percentage points.
The report says the situation is even bleaker when indicators of multidimensional poverty are considered. At the global level, UNDP estimates that the impact of the pandemic on health, education and income will be equivalent to a loss of six years of gains in the Human Development Index, and may set poverty levels back nine years with an additional 490m people falling into multidimensional poor currently living in Asia and the Pacific.
With about half of the world’s 1.3 billion multidimensional poor currently living in Asia and the Pacific, it is estimated that the region will account for around 245m of the new multidimensional poor. 
Millions of them are children for whom falling into poverty often comes with lifelong adverse consequences for their development and opportunities.
In many countries across Asia and the Pacific, income inequality is high and in some inequality keeps rising. The fragmentation of the population by income levels differs greatly across the countries of the region. 
A significant share of the population lives in extreme poverty with income below $1.90 per day in several developing countries. 
In developed countries of the region, more than 80pc of people have an income of more than $20 a day. Covid-19 has left a legacy of increased inequality.

8,Taliban bar govt employees without beards from work,Sources say the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice is patrolling the entrances of govt offices.,"KABUL: Afghanistan’s Taliban has instructed all government employees to wear a beard and adhere to a dress code or risk being fired, three sources said, the latest of several new restrictions imposed by the hardline Islamist administration.
The sources said representatives from the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice were patrolling the entrances to government offices on Monday to check that employees were in compliance with the new rules.
Employees were being instructed not to shave their beards and to wear local clothing consisting of a long, loose top and trousers, and a hat or turban. They were also told to ensure they prayed at the correct times, two of the sources said.
Workers were told they would from now on be unable to enter offices and would eventually be fired if they did not meet the dress codes, the sources said. A spokesman for the public morality ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Last week, the Taliban banned women from taking flights without a male chaperone and failed to open girls’ schools as promised.
On Sunday it ordered parks to be segregated by sex, with women allowed to enter three days a week, and men the other four days, including the weekend, meaning even married couples and families cannot visit together.
The Taliban administration has drawn criticism at home and from Western governments for forcing its hardline interpretation of Islamic law onto all Afghans.
The Taliban say they will respect everyone’s rights in line with Islamic law and Afghan customs and that they have changed since their 1996-2001 rule, when they barred women from leaving the house without a male relative and forced men to grow beards.
Wednesday’s u-turn on girls’ schools led to protests from the international community, including the United States, which pulled out of planned meetings with Taliban officials in Qatar to discuss key economic issues.
The Taliban needs Western countries to lift sanctions that are crippling the Afghan economy.

An additional person died on the way to hospital, while another five were being treated for injuries, it later said.
Michoacan’s public security office said authorities were working to track down those responsible for the shooting at the venue, used for cockfighting, concerts and dancing.
Lopez Obrador said that the attack was  “a massacre by one group against another.” 
The perpetrators  “came and shot the attendees and unfortunately there were many deaths,” he told reporters.

10,Pakistan dealt well with Covid: UN,"According to a UN report, the cost of vaccinating 40pc of the population was 13.95pc of the country’s current health expenditure.","UNITED NATIONS: A UN report released on Monday places Pakistan among the countries that have done fairly well in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.
The analytical report, prepared by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), notes that on March 23, 2022, the cost of vaccinating 40 per cent of the population in Pakistan was 13.95pc of the country’s current health expenditure.
The UNDP placed this in the green zone of affordability, meaning that the country’s health system can deal with this extra burden. Pakistan’s Covid-19 risk index was 5.3, which was classified as high.
On March 23, the cost of vaccinating 40pc of the population in India was 8.65pc of the country’s current health expenditure and the Covid-19 risk index was 4.6, which was classified as medium.
In Pakistan, cured and/or expected vaccine supply in total doses as percentage of the population was 112.25pc. Vaccine doses received as a percentage of the population was 107.15pc.
In India, secured and/or expected vaccine supply in total doses as percentage of the population was 200.78pc. Vaccine doses received as a percentage of the population stood at 142.57pc.
Data from Unicef and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, shows that the average global cost per Covid-19 vaccine dose ranges between $2 – $40. The estimated distribution cost is $3.70 per person vaccinated with two doses, after accounting for vaccine wastage.
This represents a significant financial burden for low-income countries, where the average annual per capita health expenditure amounts to $41.
