0,ECP to publish final list of wards for LG polls on May 19,IHC had recently directed holding of elections on basis of law introduced by previous govt,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday said it would publish the final list of constituencies/wards in May for holding the local government (LG) elections in the federal capital.
On March 25, the ECP had issued the schedule for carrying out delimitation of the 50 union councils – 27 in rural and 23 in urban areas – in Islamabad.
According to the ECP, after completing various procedures, the final list will be published on May 19.
The ruling PTI wanted to hold the local government elections in Islamabad under a new law which has yet to be approved by the parliament.

IHC had recently directed holding of elections on basis of law introduced by previous govt

Under the proposed law, which was issued as a presidential ordinance, Islamabad will have 100 union councils and a directly-elected mayor. 
However, the government could not get approval of the ordinance from the parliament to make it an Act.
On the other hand, the term of the local government expired in February last year and since then elections have been due with no serious effort being made by the government to get the proposed Act passed from the parliament.
The law was tabled in the National Assembly and is currently being discussed in the standing committee concerned.
However, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) recently directed the government to hold the elections on the basis of the law introduced by the previous government which was an Act of parliament.
IHC Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani accepted identical petitions filed by Mazdoor Union of Capital Development Authority (CDA), CDA Officers Association and former union council chairman Sardar Mehtab against the promulgation of the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government Ordinance.
Through a short order, Justice Kayani announced that the petitions had been allowed. 
Under the ordinance, the local government elections in the federal capital have been proposed to be held in May this year. According to the petitioners, the ordinance was promulgated in violation of the spirit of Article 89 of the Constitution.
It may be mentioned here that the Supreme Court in a recent judgement ruled against the promulgation of excessive ordinances.
The apex court observed that “the president and provincial governors may promulgate ordinances but their power to promulgate ordinances is circumscribed by the Constitution. The president may only promulgate an ordinance in respect of any matter in the Federal Legislative List when neither the Senate nor the National Assembly is in session and can only do so when circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate action.”
During an earlier hearing of the case in February, Justice Kayani had asked how the ordinance was promulgated while the parliament was in session. 
The counsel for the federal government replied that the parliament session was prorogued on Nov 19 while the ordinance was promulgated on Nov 23.
He said since the ECP had set the deadline of Nov 25 for making a law on the local government, the law was promulgated through a presidential ordinance.

2,JUI-F supporters vow to stay in Islamabad till PM’s removal,JUI-F workers hint at moving towards the D-Chowk.,"ISLAMABAD: While a number of political developments were observed at the national level on Monday, workers of the opposition parties believed that the stage had been set and their leaders needed to give a last push to topple the government.
Workers of political parties, who reached Srinagar Highway to attend the public gathering on Monday, said the government had earned a bad repute because of price hike, unemployment and worsening economic conditions.
On the other hand, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) said its workers and supporters would stay at Srinagar Highway till the outcome of the no-confidence motion, indicating their plan to move to D-Chowk.
A worker of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Abdul Qadeer, who came from Rawlakot (AJK), told Dawn that there were 99pc chances of the government being removed through the no-trust move.
“I suggest to my leadership to push a little more as the government was on the verge of being toppled. Financial conditions of people and the country are continuously worsening. I am 40 years old and have never seen such a situation in the past,” he said.
“Though I have come here because of my family’s affiliation with the PML-N, being a transporter I can understand how much I have been affected during the last four years. Four years ago, Rs6,000 were required to change the engine oil of my vehicle but now it costs Rs14,000,” he said.
Mir Shah Nawaz Khetran, who belongs to the Balochistan National Party (Mengal) and came from Barkhan, said the situation was deteriorating across the country.
“Conditions in Balochistan are even worse. We have reached here to raise a voice against the law and order situation in the province,” he said, adding that Baloch students were insecure even in Islamabad as recently one of them went missing here.
“Sardar Akhtar Mengal has been making efforts for the rights of the province,” said Mr Khetran.
JUI-F worker Abdullah, who came from Shikarpur, said because of the policies of Prime Minister Imran Khan, people were left with no choice but commit suicide.
“I have never seen such poor financial conditions of people. We have decided to stay here and are ready to move towards D-Chowk on the call of Maulana Fazlur Rehman.” 
“We will not leave the city until the prime minister resigns or is removed through voting,” he added.
Maqbool Ahmed, a PML-N supporter from Shakargarh (Punjab), said it was unfortunate that differences among political leaders were rising.
“It is not good for society and I suggest that political leaders promote an environment of peace and harmony otherwise intolerance will increase,” he said.
Another worker of PML-N, Riaz Ahmed from Sindh, said it was unfortunate that the prime minister used abusive language against the leadership of his party and Maulana Rehman.
“Politicians should not use abusive language against one another as this encourages workers to do the same,” he added.

9,120 plots allotted to people affected by land acquisition in Islamabad's E-12,The dispute is related to compensation against land and built-up property.,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Monday allotted 120 more plots to people affected by land acquisition in sector E-12, paving the way for development of stalled sectors, which was launched back in 1989.
Over 4,000 people have been waiting to get possession of developed plots in E-12, but because of a dispute between CDA and villagers, they have been suffering. The dispute was related to compensation against land and built-up property (BuP).
Last year, a commission formed by Islamabad High Court (IHC), finally directed the CDA to resolve the issue with villagers and clear their compensations for getting possession of land for development, as payments had been made to the CDA in 1989 and despite the passage of 33 years, people were still waiting to get their developed plots.
The CDA’s Land and Estate Wing, through National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), allotted 120 plots of various sizes in E-12 and I-12. Earlier, in December, the CDA allotted 162 plots to people.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on CDA Affairs Ali Nawaz Awan attended the balloting ceremony as chief guest while CDA’s member planning Naveed Ilahi, Deputy Director General (Estate and Land) Afnan Alam and other officers were also present.
The special assistant said successive governments never paid heed towards resolving this issue, adding that the PTI however, provided relief to people in this regard.
“Without full scale development work, we cannot satisfy those that have been allotted plots as they were supposed to get possession of developed plots in 1990, one year after allotment,” said an official of CDA.
Last year, the CDA had started partial development work, which was slowed down later on.

11,Manual ready to prevent human-wildlife conflict on Margalla Hills,ISLAMABAD: A special public awareness manual has been prepared to educate locals and tourists who wish to venture...,"ISLAMABAD: A special public awareness manual has been prepared to educate locals and tourists who wish to venture into the ever rejuvenating Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP) in order to avert the risk of contact with the endangered common Asian leopard.
The manual has been prepared by senior member of Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) Z.B. Mirza. There has been no precedent of human-wildlife conflict in MHNP as the wildcat has a stable number of preys available in the natural environment. The wildcat has 62 different species of wildlife available to it which makes it the apex predator in the park.
However, according to the manual, in 2005 it killed six women in different incidents in areas falling under Ayubia National Park. The leopard is a nocturnal animal that hunts in the early hours of the night or during early mornings. It feeds mainly on barking deer, porcupines, wild boars, livestock animals, donkeys, monkeys, birds, kalij pheasant and so on. A detailed study of the women killed in different leopard attacks revealed that they were off to the jungle to collect wood during evening and early morning hours. 
The manual suggests that the people should avoid entering the jungle or forest area during early morning or evening as the leopard remains active in this duration. 
Local residents should keep a tubelight or bulb on at night, keep livestock including goats locked inside a safer place at night and should be accompanied by some individual for livestock rearing in the woods, it states.
Women and children should be forbidden to enter the jungle alone whereas the former should go in groups to collect wood. Moreover, individuals in the forest should talk loudly and in case of a group one of them should be placed to guard the surrounding. 
Individuals entering forests should keep a club with them and keep on talking in a loud voice, especially during evening and morning hours. In case of an encounter with the leopard in the wild, it is imperative for the individual to remain composed and patient instead of shouting and running in fear as this reaction will be similar to that of the leopard’s prey, the manual states, adding individuals should instead step backwards and leave the area slowly. 
If an individual hears growling sounds, he or she must avoid going into the jungle area, it states and adds that if a female leopard is spotted with her cubs then it is necessary to avoid entering or passing into that area. 
In case of a very close encounter with the leopard, individuals should clap with their hands and move their arms or shawl to create an impression that they are bigger in size than the wildcat. 
Pakistan Wildlife Foundation Vice President Safwan Ahmed said that internationally there were professional tourist guides entering into the leopard’s territory. Tourists are tagged with transmitters to get their real time location and are also sent into safe areas or zones in the forests. He said there was no population record of leopards earlier in the Margalla Hills National Park but recent studies had revealed a sizeable population of wildcats that needs to be managed wisely to avoid human-wildlife contact.
