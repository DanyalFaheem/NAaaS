0,Sacking of refugee commissionerate’s two officers ordered over harassment,"The two officers have also been fined Rs500,000 and told to pay the amount to the women they harassed.","PESHAWAR: Federal anti-harassment ombudsperson Kashmala Tariq has found two officers of the Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees (CAR) guilty of sexually harassing two women colleagues and ordered their removal from service.
She also fined them Rs500,000 each and ordered the payment of that amount to the two harassed women.
The ombudsperson directed the competent authority to implement the orders within a week and update her about it.

Ombudsperson also fines them Rs0.5m each, orders the payment of amount to complainants

She held a hearing on internet calling service Skype after receiving a joint harassment complaint of the two women against the CAR chief finance officer and a project director.
The complainants had alleged that the accused were sexually harassing them and that they were being ‘victimised’ on one pretext or the other on refusal to ‘bow down to the illicit demands’ of the two.
Initially, the complaint was heard by provincial anti-harassment ombudsperson Rukhshanda Naz, who recorded the evidence of both parties. The case was referred to the federal anti-harassment ombudsperson on Oct 4, 2021, as the CAR falls in the domain of the federal government.
Ms Kashmala ruled: “From the evidence led by the complainants thefactumof sexual harassment at the hands of the accused stands duly proved. The witnesses produced by the complainants have corroborated the charge of the complainants.”
She added that there was no such solid and concrete evidence on part of the accused to suggest that the complainants filed their cases against them due to any previous enmity, grudge or animosity.
“In absence of the said factors, it is not convincing to believe that the complainants could have filed false complaints against their male colleagues after putting their dignity and reputation at risk. It is a matter of common sense that no woman takes the risk of filing false complaints of sexual harassment against a male colleague in the organisation because such a complaint in the long run is detrimental to her own modesty, integrity and reputation,” she said in a four-page judgement.
The ombudsperson said putting all evidence of the parties available in the file in juxtaposition, she found it to be safer to hold that the harassment complaint of the complainants stands proved as against the accused who have been in dominant position to misuse their authority to exploit, comparatively, weaker and junior women complainants.
She added that the complainants had also filed applications against the accused to the Commissioner Afghan Refugees, but as he had close relations with ‘senior officers like accused’, he paid no attention to the complaints.
Ms Kashmala expressed displeasure over the role of the commissioner and said the commissioner had failed to perform his duty in accordance with the provisions of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010.
“He [Commissioner Afghan Refugees] appears to have taken the matter casually rather non-seriously. For his above conduct, the officer deserves to be conveyed the displeasure of this forum with direction to constitute proper inquiry committee in the office to probe such like harassment cases,” she declared.
The ombudsperson directed the commissioner to install CCTV cameras on the premises and outside to monitor activities of the employees as well as display the code of conduct under the law on conspicuous places of the premises to ensure that every employee can go through it.
She observed that the commissioner was the head of the organisation and in that capacity, it was his duty to take all measures to maintain the office discipline and conducive environment for working women.
“He [commissioner] was also required to make temporary arrangements in the office so that the complainants and the accused did not remain in the same place during the course of inquiry in the matter,” she said.

4,"Transgender persons resent violence, demand protection",Threaten sit-in in Islamabad after three days,"PESHAWAR: Transgender persons have expressed concern about the growing incidents of violence against on their community members and demanded of the government to take tangible steps for their protection.
Transgender Association Khyber Pakhtunkhwa president Arzoo Khan told reporters at the Peshawar Press Club on Monday that the province had recorded five cases of violence against her community during the last 10 days.
She warned that if the culprits were not arrested in three days, transgender persons would stage a protest sit-in at D Chowk in Islamabad.
Arzoo said that two transgender persons died after being injured by attackers in Mansehra and Mardan but the police made no arrest.
She called for the early punishment of the accused and protection of her community. “The government made tall claims about the protection of public life and property but failed to do so,” she said.

Threaten sit-in in Islamabad after three days

The association leader said that many transgender persons had lost life and suffered injuries during the acts of violence in the last few years, but the relevant police didn’t act against the culprits.
She condemned such attacks in the province and said that mostly influential people subjected transgender persons to violence and therefore, the police didn’t act against the former.
Arzoo insisted that the accused held innocent transgender persons hostage for hours, and deprived them of cash, mobile phones and other valuables.
“We held protest demonstrations after every incident of violence against our community members and called for the registration of cases against culprits, but to no avail. In many cases, the criminals get off scot-free,” she said.
The association leader also said transgender persons conveyed their complaints about life threats to the relevant authorities but the people were so influential that no one bothered to take action against them.
She said the province had around 50,000 transgender persons but many of them didn’t disclose their identity due to family restrictions and lack of security.

6,KP CM ridicules opposition over ‘planned’ no-confidence move against him,Says members of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly are Imran Khan's soldiers and will not change loyalties.,"SHANGLA: Chief Minister Mahmood Khan has said that the claim of opposition parties to table no-confidence motion against him as they have two-third majority in the provincial assembly is not less than a joke.
He was addressing a public meeting in Chakesar on Monday. Provincial Minister Shaukat Yousafzai, former provincial minister Abdul Munim Khan, candidate for tehsil chairman slot Akhtar Ali Chitan and others also addressed the gathering.
The chief minister said that the members of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly were soldiers of Imran Khan and they would neither change loyalties. The zealous people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa always stood by Imran Khan and would continue to do so, he added.

Mahmood says former rulers deceived people

He said that participation of a large number of people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the Islamabad rally was a lesson for the opposition that the province was a stronghold of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf.
The chief minister said that opposition parties were trying to de-seat a prime minister, who always spoke of national dignity and independence. He said that Imran Khan was the only prime minister, who gave the country an independent foreign policy and made it clear to world powers that friendship would be based only on basis of equality.
He said that prime minister raised the issue of Kashmir at international level in an unprecedented manner. “Imran Khan has become an effective voice of Islam and Muslims at all international forums,” he added.
The chief minister said that JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman had remained the chairman of Kashmir committee for 18 years but never raised a voice for the people of Kashmir. His party had ruled the province for five years in the name of Islam but didn’t do anything for Islam, he said.
He said that former rulers of the province only deceived people through various slogans. Some ruled in the name of Islam, some in the name of bread and cloth and some in the name of Pakhtuns, but they did nothing for the welfare of people, he said.
He said that government was utilising each penny for the welfare of people. “PTI government has introduced stipends for prayer leaders and scholarships for seminary students while solarisation of mosques is being carried out,” he added.
Mr Khan said that Sehat Sahulat Card scheme was extended to entire population of the province, which was another milestone achievement of the government. He said that food cards would be introduced for providing food items to deserving families at discounted rates while education cards would also be launched in the next budget.
He said that in the past no one planned to make the country self-sufficient in agriculture whereas in the present tenure 10 dams were being constructed.

He was addressing a rally held at Nishat Chowk in Mingora in connection with the election campaign of JI candidate for Babuzai city council Mohammad Amin Khan. JI district emir Hamidul Haq, Mohammad Amin Khan and a large number of people from different walks of life attended the rally.
The JI chief said that for the first time in the history of country, prime minister openly violated law by participating in election rallies for his party candidates despite warning and imposition of fine on him by Election Commission of Pakistan.
“Despite barring from participating in election campaign, the prime minister is participating in election rallies to seek votes for his party candidates, which is an open violation,” he said.
He said that not only prime minister violated law but his party workers also committed the violation. “Thousands of vehicles of the PTI workers, who went to Islamabad to attend a rally, did not pay toll tax at any toll plaza. They not only violated law but also inflicted heavy losses on the country exchequer,” he said.
Mr Siraj criticised the foreign policy of the government. “PTI not only disappointed Pakistanis but also betrayed the people of Kashmir and graves of thousands of Kashmiris,” he said.
He said that Imran Khan knew nothing about the state of Madina. He said that use of foul language against the leaders of other parties showed his ignorance about the state of Madina. “Imran Khan can do nothing except insulting others,” he added. 
The JI chief said that those, who claimed to change the country, did nothing for the country and for its people except announcing schemes about provision of chicken and eggs. “Even the chicken and eggs have been given to the PTI workers and not to the poor people,” he said. He added that the PTI government was surrounded by mafias.
He said that it was high time to get rid of the PTI candidates and elect honest and competent people in the second phase of local bodies’ elections. “The time has come when Imran Khan will ask as to why he has been ousted,” he added.

11,Edwardians get applause for staging classic play,Around 25 students show their acting skills,"PESHAWAR: English dramatics society of the historic Edwardes College Peshawar staged a classic theatre play here on Monday and enthralled the audience with sunning performance.
Students, faculty members and theatre buffs watched the performance, filled with action, suspense and thrill and responded with occasional handclaps and silence as the play rolled on towards just end.
The play “The Count of Monte Cristo” by Alexandre Dumas was staged at the main hall of the college. Around 25 students performed in the classic play and acclaimed thunderous applause from the jam-packed hall.
Laiba Tahir, played ‘Mercedes’ in the play and stole the show. Other Edwardians, who performed protagonists and antagonist, included Adam Minto as Edmond Dantes, Aizazul Haq as Fernand Mondego and Hamza as Albert.

Around 25 students show their acting skills 

Opening the play, Prof Nasir Iqbal said that after rounds of rehearsals spread over four months his team of young actors was able to present the classic adventurous tale of the count’s revenge, wronged by those whom he trusted and loved.
He said that stage adaptation of a classic tale by students, who had either no or very little experience of theatrical performance, was really never wracking job but the cooperation of college administration and parents made it possible.
“We selected this classic story because its contents -- jealously, betrayal, romance, hope and revenge -- are still relevant. Our students have a very good taste for reading classics and, therefore, take up theatrical performance as cathartic exercise,” said Prof Nasir.
The live stage performance was 15th in the run under the supervision and direction of the English dramatics society of the college where students are trained to present live performance on the stage.
Prof Shahid Amin, an old Edwardian, told this scribe that he enjoyed the play as it reminded him of his good old days when he used to be part of the live show. 
He added that young Edwardians proved their mettle and such performances registered a lasting impact on the students.
Breshna, a student of English department at University of Peshawar, said that Edwardes College truly lived up to its golden traditions as the performance of stage adaption acted out by young actors showed it through their professional skills.
