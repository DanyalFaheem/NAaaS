0,Ball in IMF’s court as Pakistan completes talks,"Miftah says Fund going through ""internal approval processes""; insists no more outstanding issues between both sides.","• Miftah says Fund going through ‘internal approval processes’
• Insists no more outstanding issues between both sides
ISLAMABAD: From Pakistan’s perspective, talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are complete, and it is just the internal process of the crisis lender, which would come out with a formal announcement on the successful completion of the seventh and eighth quarterly reviews of a stalled loan programme.
“Our talks with the IMF are complete and they are now going through their internal approval process,” Finance Minister Miftah Ismail told Dawn, adding that the announcement should now come from the Fund.
He said the IMF had given the Memorandum of Economic and Fiscal Policies (MEFP) to Islamabad, which had been responded to. “The IMF accepted some of the changes we proposed and did not agree on many others. After discussions, finally, we have given our consent to an MEFP acceptable to the IMF,” he said, adding that there were no more outstanding issues between the two sides.
The IMF’s resident representative in Islamabad, Esther Perez Ruiz did not respond to requests for comment.
Pakistan entered the IMF programme in 2019, but only half the funds have been disbursed to date as Islamabad has struggled to keep targets on track.
The last disbursement was in February and the next tranche was to follow a review in March, but the government of ousted prime minister Imran Khan introduced costly fuel price caps, which threw fiscal targets and the programme off track.
The new coalition government has removed the price caps, with petrol and diesel prices going up by as much as 66pc and 92pc in over a month.
Sources said Pakistan had now accepted, completed or set in motion all conditionalities and prior actions set by the IMF, and some of them would remain under implementation as usual as per the schedule of structural benchmarks.
The authorities expect a formal announcement from the IMF about the staff­-level agreement anytime to be followed by its approval by the executive board early next month along with the disbursement of funds.
Read: Up the IMF creek
The sources said the IMF dialogue this time had been tougher than usual and its staff repeatedly raised queries on settled issues. Apparently, Pakistan had become a rolling stone between the policies of the two biggest shareholders — the United States and China.
On June 21, Pakistan’s authorities and the IMF staff mission reached an understanding on the current fiscal year’s federal budget to revive the stalled loan programme after authorities committed to generating Rs436 billion more taxes and gradually increasing the petroleum levy to Rs50 per litre.
As a result, the IMF staff in a statement acknowledged that important progress had been made over the federal budget. Based on this, Pakistan provided written commitment from the provinces to provide Rs750bn in cash surplus to the Centre to contain fiscal deficit within 4.9pc of GDP and help generate a Rs152bn primary fiscal surplus.
Pakistan is now also required to increase the electricity tariff by Rs7.91 per unit besides direct pass-through of monthly fuel cost adjustments in a timely manner.
The revised MEFP is based on budgetary measures approved by the parliament envisaging over Rs1.716 trillion (2.2pc of GDP) of fiscal adjustment, mostly through taxation, including a 10pc super tax on 13 large industries and personal income tax covering monthly incomes above Rs50,000.
This is on top of a fixed tax regime for sectors like retailers, traders, jewellers, builders, restaurants, automobile and property dealers and so on.
This is the biggest fiscal adjustment in a single year that would help turn about Rs1.6tr primary deficit — the difference between revenues and expenditures excluding interest payments — during the current fiscal year into a Rs152bn surplus next year.
Under the structural benchmarks, the government started imposing the petroleum development levy from July 1 at the rate of Rs10 per litre on petrol and Rs5 per litre on high-speed diesel and other products. The levy will now keep going up at the rate of Rs5 per month to a maximum of Rs50.
The electricity rates would be notified to go up by Rs3.50 per unit in July and August each and about Re1 per unit in the September-October billing cycle.
Under the revised MEFP, the 39-month IMF loan programme will be extended by one year to September 2023 and enhanced in size to $7bn instead of the $6bn original size, of which $3bn has been disbursed so far.
Officials said the toughest part of the stabilisation measures had been completed. Pakistan was now out of the default threat but would have to tread a responsible taxation and expenditure path to ensure fiscal and monetary targets throughout the programme period. Any missteps could reverse the hard-earned gains, they said.
While the government had already introduced Rs1.25tr worth of fiscal adjustment in its original budget presented in the National Assembly on June 10, this was not acceptable to the IMF staff. The government then took additional taxation measures of about Rs466bn on June 24 to reach an understanding with the Fund for a bailout necessary in the face of a balance-of-payments crisis.

1,GHQ has no legal status to own state land: IHC,• Detailed order says institutions’ urge to act as a ‘state within the state’ is obvious • CDA directed to ensure demarcation...,"• Detailed order says institutions’ urge to act as a ‘state within the state’ is obvious
• CDA directed to ensure demarcation of allotted land
ISLAMABAD: In a deta­iled order in the Margalla Hills National Park case, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday declared that neither the Remount, Veterinary and Farms (RVF) directorate of the army nor the General Headquarters (GHQ) have legal status under the Constitution or the law to own state land.
Land is allocated for the use of the branches of the armed forces and it is managed and retained in accordance with the scheme of the governing law and, that too, by the entities and public functionaries designated thereunder, explained the strongly worded judgement by IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah.
“The RVF Directorate nor the GHQ can own or acquire nor manage land given for its use otherwise than as provided under the Constitution and the aforementioned laws. The land is allocated by the federal government for a particular and declared use of the branches of the armed forces. The land remains the ownership of the federal government or the provincial government, as the case may be. It has been explicitly declared in the aforementioned laws that the nature or character of the land allocated for the use of the armed forces cannot be changed without the express permission of the federal government. More­over, after the land is no more used for the purpose for which it had been allocated then it would revert to the federal government or the provincial government, as the case may be.
“The Pakistan Army nor any other branch of the armed forces can claim the ownership of the land allocated by the federal government for its use. Likewise, it cannot claim any compensation in the eventuality of reversion of the allocated land when it is no more used for the allotted purpose. In any case the GHQ nor RVF Directorate has a locus standi to bypass the designated civilian authorities who are responsible to deal with and manage lands.”
The detailed order came over six months after the IHC had issued a short order on the petitions moved by Prof Zahid Baig Mirza, an expert in the field of biodiversity, habitats and ecosystem, and area residents who had invited court’s attention towards the ‘lack of will’ to protect the natural assets.
The IHC, in its Jan 11 short order, had directed the CDA to seal the Monal Restaurant; take control of the Margalla Greens Golf Club built on the encroached land; and declared the military’s claim to 8,602 acres of Margalla Hills National Park ‘illegal’. However, the Supreme Court on March 8 suspended the IHC judgement regarding the sealing and taking over possession of the Monal Restaurant.
The entire E-10 sector was allotted for the use of Pakistan Army and according to the petitioners living in a village situated outside the allotted sector that the army had encroached upon the notified area of the Margalla Hills, the IHC noted in its detailed order.
While construction work in the allotted sector has recently been undertaken, the CDA chairman apprised the court that possession of the entire allotted sector had not been taken over due to some outstanding land acquisition disputes, which was being resolved, and thereafter the allotted land would be demarcated.
On the other hand, the defence secretary also undertook on behalf of the Surveyor General of Pakistan that the notified area outside the land allotted for the use of the Pakistan Army would be demarcated so that there was no encroachment in the protected area.
The IHC asserted that no activity whatsoever could be undertaken outside the demarcated area of E-10 sector and any such activity would be illegal and unauthorised encroachment on state land, exposing the officials to disciplinary and criminal proceedings, inter alia, under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Act and the CDA Ordinance 1960.
Referring to the Remount, Veterinary and Farms (RVF) Directorate, an internal office of the General Headquarters (GHQ) of the Pakistan Army that had claimed ownership of 8,602 acres of the integral land inside the Margalla Hills, which according to them was allocated by the Punjab government through a notification of April 23, 1910 for the use of production of ‘hay’ for the animals of the army, the IHC observed that neither RVF directorate nor GHQ was vested with any authority to claim the ownership, because the status of the 8,602 acres had ceased as an area allocated for the use of growing hay for the animals of the army after the promulgation of the CDA Ordinance 1960 and, more particularly the Wildlife Ordinance of 1979.
Thus, the court declared, the claim of ownership of the 8,602 acres of land in the notified area of the Margalla Hills by the GHQ or RVF directorate was illegal, without lawful authority and in violation of the scheme of the concerned laws.
The IHC noted that the laws were being flagrantly violated by institutions in disregard to the scheme contemplated under the Constitution, and the “urge of state institutions to act as a state within the state was obvious” from this development. Yet the authorities entrusted with statutory powers to guard against violations seemed to be ‘helpless or complacent’, the judgement regretted, adding the acts and stance of the RVF directorate and GHQ had profound consequences for the rule of law.
“They acted on their own and while doing so they have seriously undermined the rule of law in derogation to their declared functions under the Constitution,” the court order stated, adding the sanctity of the protected and preserved notified area of the Margalla Hills had been desecrated.
According to the judgment, the IHC expected that the federal government would fulfill its obligation to inquire into the matter and hold those accountable who chose to take the law into their hands by desecrating the sanctity of the protected and preserved notified area of the Margalla Hills and thus violating the guaranteed rights of not only the present but future generations as well.

2,PTI wants 16 defectors barred from contesting Punjab by-elections,Party asks ECP to ensure election results aren’t notified till decision on plea.,"• Party asks ECP to ensure election results aren’t notified till decision on plea
• Omar Ayub files another petition, alleges officials interfering in polls at behest of govt
• Marriyum Aurangzeb says rigging allegations a confession of Imran’s defeat
ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Wednesday moved the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) seeking a bar on 16 of its 20 de-seated defectors from contesting the upcoming by-polls in Punjab scheduled for Sunday (July 17).
All 20 former PTI lawmakers in the Punjab Assembly, who had been de-seated for defecting in favour of Hamza Shehbaz in the election for the chief minister, are now contesting the by-polls from their respective constituencies on PML-N tickets.
“The party tickets, by PML-N, have been given to these defectors as a reward for their participation in a conspiracy which succeeded due to their unholy, immoral and unlawful defection,” the petition filed through Advocate Faisal Fareed stated. After being declared guilty of defection, these former lawmakers were “judicially stigmatised and cannot contest the elections”.
It further said the respondents, under Article 5 of the Constitution, were to ensure that their personal and official conduct met the best standards of democratic norms and integrity of their office in the provincial assembly.
“They contumaciously violated the same and caused the downfall of their own government in Punjab. They, without any scruples, violated their party oath as well as the oath taken under Article 65 read with Article 127 along with their oath taken as contained in the Third Schedule to the Constitution,” it read. “As per… Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, the respondents are not eligible to contest or to be elected as a member of the Punjab assembly in the scheduled elections to be held on July 17. They are most certainly disqualified for the same.”
The ECP had to ensure that those who did not meet the criteria of Articles 62 and 63 were not allowed to contest elections and their disqualification was enforced as per the commission’s own order/judgement. The petition sought the ECP to debar the respondents from taking part in the upcoming by-polls and, as an interim measure, issue instructions to all concerned not to notify the poll results till a decision on the petition.
In a related development, former federal minister and PTI Additional Secretary General Omar Ayub Khan filed yet another petition with the ECP alleging pre-poll rigging in the Punjab by-polls and sought the commission take remedial measures.
“…the way things are in Punjab, no free, fair, transparent, or impartial elections can be held. Even after the election date was announced as 17-07-22, developmental work has been announced in various constituencies, which is a clear violation of Section 181 of the Elections Act of 2017,” it read.
It alleged that officials, on the instructions of the government, were interfering in the upcoming elections. “A prime example is of the Rajanpur deputy commissioner (DC), who can be seen campaigning for PML-N candidates, which is a clear violation of both ethics and Section 187 of the Elections Act of 2017,” the petition further stated, while purported pictures of the DC’s activities were annexed with the plea.
It alleged that similarly in Jhang, Dr Ghias Gill had been posted as the district police chief clearly for pre-poll rigging; previously, former PTI MNAs Sahibzada Muhammad Mehboob Sultan and Sahibzada Ameer Sultan – from NA-114 and NA-116, respectively -- had moved a privilege motion against him in the National Assembly, and he held a grudge against the party.
Mr Khan further alleged in his petition that in PP-07, the ruling party candidate, Raja Sagheer Ahmed, was offering bribes to voters to influence them, in clear violation of sections 167 and 168 of the Elections Act 2017 as well as constitutional provisions.
The PTI once again alleged that voters’ list had been altered and voters reshuffled in violation of the elections law. As an example, it cited the issuance of the final electoral roll in PP-140 Sheikhupura after announcement of the election schedule. The number of voters in the constituency had increased from 2,239 on May 20, 2018 to 5,573 on May 20, 2022.
“This sudden increase is ambiguous and casts serious doubts on the transparency of upcoming by-elections,” it stated.
The petitioner asked the ECP to address all the related petitions and remedy the issues prior to the polls to guarantee free, fair, transparent, and impartial elections.
‘Allegations a confession of defeat’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb on Wednesday claimed the PTI leadership’s allegations of rigging were, in fact, a confession of party chief Imran Khan’s defeat in the upcoming by-elections.
In a statement, she said former prime minister Imran Khan and his ministers not only openly violated the ECP rules while in power, but also threatened it. On the other hand, PML-N ministers resigned from their offices to abide by the rules, the state-owned APP reported.
The minister said by-elections were yet to be held, but Imran had already started mourning. “The ECP is actually being targeted by Imran Khan because of the foreign funding case,” she claimed.
Ms Aurangzeb said Mr Khan’s former ministers were caught red-handed distributing money during election campaigns, announcing development schemes and rigging the elections.

4,Rishi Sunak leads in first round of UK leadership contest,• Conservatives to move ‘no-confidence’ against own govt • Candidates invoke Thatcher’s legacy to woo Tory party members • Indians,"• Conservatives to move ‘no-confidence’ against own govt
• Candidates invoke Thatcher’s legacy to woo Tory party members
• Indians expecting first-ever ‘Brown’ British PM watch leadership contest with bated breath
LONDON: Rishi Sunak, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer under Boris Johnson, led the field of Conservative lawmakers bidding to become Britain’s next prime minister in the first ballot of Tory lawmakers on Wednesday, as the race narrowed to six with the elimination of two candidates.
Early frontrunner Sunak, who quit as finance minister last week to help trigger outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s downfall, topped the contest with 88 votes, followed by former defence minister Penny Mordaunt, on 67.
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss finished third with 50 Conservative lawmakers’ support.
The remaining candidates to meet the minimum 30-vote threshold were former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch, on 40, backbencher Tom Tugendhat, on 37, and Attorney General Suella Braverman, who scraped through with 32 votes.
However, former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, who finished runner-up to Johnson in the last contest in 2019, and newly appointed finance minister Nadhim Zahawi, were both eliminated after struggling to hit the threshold.
There will be no let-up to the contest, with another round of voting set for Thursday, as the ruling party tries to winnow the candidates list down to a final pair over the next week to then put to party members.
The battle has already been marked by infighting between the candidates, prompting the beaten Hunt to warn the remaining rivals that “smears & attacks may bring short term tactical gain but always backfire long term”.
‘No confidence’ in own govt
Johnson was forced last week to announce his resignation after a wave of ministerial resignations including by then finance minister Sunak.
It was a stunning fall from grace for a politician who secured a landslide election win in December 2019 and took the UK out of the European Union a month later, before the Covid pandemic struck.
Eight Conservative candidates had survived an initial cull Tuesday, with Sunak again topping the list ahead of Mordaunt.
While Johnson himself says he will stay above the fray, his remaining loyalists have not held back in rubbishing Sunak, and have been coalescing behind Truss.
Earlier on Wednesday, Johnson hinted the race could be curtailed to last days rather than weeks as he praised the “wonderful candidates”.
“I will be leaving soon with my head held high,” Johnson said at his penultimate session of Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons, following the spectacular collapse in cabinet support last week.
Under the election schedule, Johnson’s successor as Conservative leader is meant to be announced on September 5, as the party seeks to rebuild its popular support after he was felled by non-stop scandal.
But Johnson suggested the new leader could be elected “by acclamation” before next week, if the last two candidates agree a deal between them.
Leading contenders have already ruled that out, and Johnson’s press secretary told reporters that he was merely noting “uncertainty” about the race.
She added that the government was filing a Commons vote of confidence in itself, with a debate set for Monday, after rejecting an opposition Labour motion that was designed to evict Johnson sooner.
Labour leader Keir Starmer said Johnson was “totally deluded to the bitter end” but could take comfort in no longer having to follow the rules set for everyone else -- a biting reference to “Partygate” and other scandals.
In a sign of things to come, Starmer also set his sights on the Tory leadership contenders, including on the complicated tax affairs of wealthy frontrunner Sunak.
Thatcher’s endorsement
Although she has not been in power since 1990, the kind of economic challenges Britain is going through hark back to the days of Margaret Thatcher.
The UK is currently experiencing spiralling inflation, budget deficits, rising taxation, and industrial unrest that, while nowhere near the levels faced in the 1970s and 80s, have sparked headlines that Britain is once again entering a period of stagnation.
But the former Conservative prime minister has been a regular presence in this week’s contest to replace Boris Johnson as Britain’s next leader.
Rishi Sunak has said his economic vision amounts to “common sense Thatcherism” after he clashed with other contenders by refusing immediate tax cuts.
Junior trade minister Penny Mordaunt also said this week that, like Thatcher, she has been underestimated because she is a woman.
The candidates are vying for Thatcher’s legacy partly because they are trying to charm the exclusive 200,000 members of the Conservative Party who will select the next prime minister, rather the millions of voters as would normally happen in an election. Mostly white, ageing and male, they venerate Thatcher.
Ancestral ties
Half a world away from the political drama in London, many Indians are closely following the twists and turns of who replaces Boris Johnson as British prime minister, curious to see how two candidates with Indian ancestry fare.
Rishi Sunak, the bookmakers’ favourite to prevail, and Suella Braverman are campaigning for the Conservative party leadership and have made reference to the opportunities Britain gave members of minorities like them.
If either were to win the race for the premiership, they would be the first prime minister of Indian origin in the United Kingdom.
In both cases, their Indian families migrated to Britain in the 1960s in search of better lives. Britain ruled India for about 200 years before the South Asian country gained independence in 1947 after a prolonged freedom struggle.
There are around 1.4 million Indians in Britain, making them its single largest ethnic minority, and the two countries enjoy friendly relations. Bilateral trade stood at 21.5 billion pounds ($25.55 billion) in 2020-21.
Some Twitter users have run pictures of Sunak under the slogan “The Empire Strikes Back”, while Indian newspapers have covered the contest unusually closely.
Sunak, 42, is the son-in-law of Indian billionaire N. R. Narayana Murthy, founder of Indian outsourcing giant Infosys Ltd.

5,Top Trump-era official admits to ‘planning coups’,"In interview with CNN, Bolton claimed ex-president was ‘not smart enough’ to plan a coup properly","WASHINGTON: John Bolton, former US president Donald Trump’s national security adviser, has admitted that he was involved in planning coups in foreign countries.
Bolton made the stunning revelation during an interview with CNN anchor Jake Tapper while discussing the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol building by Trump’s supporters. The attack, he claimed, was not a “coup d’état against the US Constitution,” arguing that Trump was not smart enough to plan a coup properly.
Tapper pushed back, saying that “one doesn’t have to be brilliant to attempt a coup.”
“I disagree with that,” Bolton responded. “As somebody who has helped plan coup d’états, not here, but, you know, other places, it takes a lot of work. And that’s not what he did.”

In interview with CNN, Bolton claimed ex-president was ‘not smart enough’ to plan a coup properly

When Bolton continued to defend Trump, Tapper asked him to use his “expertise” on “planned coups” to elaborate. He also asked Bolton whether the coups he helped plan were successful.
Bolton — who also held previous roles in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush — initially said, “I’m not gonna get into the specifics.”
As Tapper insisted on having an answer, Bolton pointed out that in his recently released book, he wrote about the failed effort to overthrow Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in 2019. At that time, the Trump administration backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó.
This open admission alarmed US politicians, journalists and scholars, some of whom recalled Washington’s involvement in regime changes around the globe that started in the late 19th century.
Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Muslim Democrat from Minnesota, noted that Bolton had a long history of supporting such efforts. “Settle down, this is not an erasure of your work,” she said in a tweet.
Chris Murphy, US Senator from Connecticut, recalled that the coup Bolton referred to was a “total disaster”.
“In April 2019, we tried to organise a kind of coup, but it became a debacle. Guaidó got cold feet and the plan failed publicly and spectacularly, making America look foolish and weak.”
The US media noted that Bolton had a long history of advocating for coups and supporting regime change plots. “He advocated for a regime change in Iraq ahead of a war he helped orchestrate and said in 2018 that the United States should overthrow the government of Iran,” one of the reports pointed out.
Another report noted that in 2004, while Bolton was serving in the State Department, the US faced allegations of backing the overthrow of Haiti’s president. A former French ambassador told The New York Times this year that the US and France had “effectively orchestrated” the coup.
The media also recalled that since the 19th century, US administrations have engineered regime changes in many nations, using both overt and covert means. The US involvement was most prominent in Latin America, where it often brought down pro-Soviet regimes.
The US competition with the former Soviet Union for influence started soon after World War II and continued till the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990s. The war in Ukraine, which began in February this year, has revived this tug-of-war, as Russia tries to regain the powers it lost after the Soviet Union’s collapse.
Another media report pointed out that the US performed more than 80 interventions in foreign countries between 1948 and 2000.
These included the 1953 overthrow of the Mosaddegh government in Iran, involvement in the Vietnam War, and the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. The US is also believed to have backed the regime change in Egypt after the so-called Arab spring.
In a speech in July 2071, Bolton too talked about the failed US attempt to bring down the current Iranian government.
Henry Kissinger, US Secretary of State, from 1969 to 1977, defended these policies by emphasising the need for Washington to play a central role in world affairs.
He believed that instead allying with weak regimes, the United States should focus on building close ties with strong rulers, whether democratically elected or not. In 1970s, Kissinger backed a bloody military coup against a socialist regime in Chile.
