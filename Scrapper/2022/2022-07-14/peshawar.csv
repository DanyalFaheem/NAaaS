3,President appoints three additional judges to PHC,"Appointments subject to outcome of case pending with SC, says ministry.","PESHAWAR: President Dr Arif Alvi on Wednesday appointed three judicial officers as additional judges to the Peshawar High Court for a period of one year.
However, the appointment of Fazal Subhan, Shahid Khan and Khurshid Iqbal will be ‘subject to the final outcome of an appeal pending before the Supreme Court against a judgement of the high court ordering their appointment has been challenged by the government’, read a notification issued by the ministry of law and justice.
The appointments will take the number of high court judges to the sanctioned strength of 20. The judges’ tenure will begin the day they take oath of their offices.
The notification was issued to implement the high court’s judgement issued on May 10, 2022, setting aside the Jan 19 decision of the Parliamentary Committee for Appointment of Judges against confirming the recommendations of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) to elevate the three district and sessions judges as the court’s additional judges.

Appointments subject to outcome of case pending with SC, says ministry

While accepting three petitions, the court had ordered the federal government through the federal law secretary to immediately implement the Jan 5, 2022, recommendations of the JCP by notifying the appointment of district judges Fazal Subhan, Shahid Khan and Dr Khurshid Iqbal as additional judges.
However, the order was not implemented due to which a contempt petition was filed by one of the petitioners Naeem Ahmad Khattak requesting the court to proceed against the respondents including the federal law secretary for committing contempt of the high court.
A bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Abdul Shakoor will take up that contempt petition today (Thursday).
During the last hearing on July 7, the bench had given law secretary Raja Naeem Akbar the last chance to implement its judgement and warned that in case of failure to comply with its orders,he would face consequences provided under the law.
Advocate Ali Azeem Afridi has been representing the petitioner.
The petitioner said the high court had six vacancies of judges for which the chief justice, after consulting other judges and scrutinising the credentials of numerous candidates, recommended the names of the three district judges as well as three lawyers, including Kamran Hayat Miankhel, Mohammad Ijaz Khan and Mohammad Faheem Wali, for appointment as additional judges.
He said that the JCP in its meeting on Jan 5, 2022, re-examined the said nominations and after a threadbare discussion recommended the said six names including that of the three petitioners, with the majority of 10 to 2 with one member abstaining for appointment as additional judges.
The petitioner, however, contended that on Jan 19, the parliamentary committee did not confirm the appointment of the three judicial officers in light of the ‘principle of seniority’ and that their names were sent back to the JCP for reconsideration.
He added that acting upon the decision of the parliamentary committee, the federal government had not sent the names of three judicial officers to the president for issuance of notification of their appointment, whereas names of the remaining three recommended persons were notified as additional judges of the high court.
The petitioner said that the high court had set aside the said decision of the parliamentary committee and therefore, it was binding on the government to notify the said three judicial officers as additional judges.

4,KP health dept striving to improve routine immunisation,Official says coverage of routine immunisation has dropped from 80pc to 60pc.,"PESHAWAR: The health department is employing a new strategy to improve routine immunisation that was affected owing to polio vaccination and coronavirus-related activities in the province.
“Coverage of our routine immunisation has dropped from 80 per cent to 60 per cent due to the involvement of our staff in Covid-19 and polio vaccination. Now, we have conducted a complete review of all 36 districts to cope with the situation,” Dr Mohammad Arif Khan, the director of expanded programme on immunisation (EPI), told Dawn.
According to him, most of the EPI’s 3,500 technicians continue to remain engaged in Covid-19 vaccination and polio activities due to which the routine immunisation is likely to dip further. “We are employing a new strategy to improve the situation,” he added.
Dr Arif said that under the new arrangements, they segregated the EPI staff to be able to pay attention to the routine immunisation and continue polio and Covid-19 vaccination simultaneously.

Official says EPI staff remained busy in polio and Covid-19 vaccination

He said that the province had 61 per cent population fully inoculated against Covid-19 while the target was 90 per cent to ensure herd immunity against the virus as the pandemic was not over and all the people risked the virus. “At the same time, we also need to ensure that all the children get vaccine against poliomyelitis as the disease is endemic in the province,” he added.
He said that 1,100 fixed EPI centres were set up in the province where the children got jabs. “Over 80 per cent of our staff remains busy in Covid-19 and polio activities,” he added.
Dr Arif said that during the last 18 months, they were not able to accord attention to routine immunisation as the coronavirus was at peak. “However, we have decided to strengthen routine immunisation and safeguard children against 12 vaccine preventable ailments including poliomyelitis,” he added.
He said that most of their technicians and EPI district coordinators were completely involved in polio campaigns, right from preparation to the conclusion of every round and had no time to carry out outreach work for coverage of the routine immunisation of children. “Therefore, we have assigned special duties to EPI workers to continue their outreach activities at the union council level to ensure that the children are immunised,” he added.
Dr Arif said that the strategy included rationalisation of staff keeping in view the falling status of routine immunisation to save the situation from further deterioration. He said that staffers of EPI played important role in all sorts of vaccination due to their experience. “But we need to maintain proper coverage of routine immunisation in addition to polio and Covid-19,” he added.
He said that staffers would be deployed in low-performing union councils to reach to the children with zero doses and the defaulters to ensure their safety and enhance coverage.
“Vaccination is crucial for prevention of diseases and our latest strategy is aimed at continuing Covid-19, polio as well as routine immunisation. At the onset of Covid-19, our workers also visited hotspot areas and collected samples from the suspected people to be tested. The EPI has assumed great significance because it has to stay involved in all sorts of vaccination from polio to Covid-19 and routine,” said Dr Arif.
He said that alongside immunisation, they were also campaigning to scale up public awareness to strengthen polio and Covid-19 vaccination.

While ordering the production of two surety bonds of Rs80,000 each by the 19-year-old, the additional district and sessions judge directed the police not to arrest her.
The woman’s husband, who is the prime accused in the case, is behind bars and faces the charge of kidnapping her as well.
Initially, her mother had alleged that the main accused, his brother and parents had kidnapped her daughter in Peshawar’s Saddar area on Oct 13, 2020, to force her into marriage.
She had told police that she had left home to take her little children to school but found her daughter (petitioner) missing on return.
The police later booked the complainant’s daughter on ‘adultery’ charge for marrying the Christian prime accused. However, the accused claimed that he had converted to Islam ahead of the marriage.
Advocate Nauman Muhib Kakakhel appeared for the petitioner and contended that the charge against his client and her husband was baseless.
Referring to fatwas (edicts) issued by various schools of Islam, he insisted that after conversion of a non-Muslim man to Islam, a Muslim woman could marry him.
The lawyer insisted that the husband of the petitioner was Muslim and therefore, their marriage was lawful.
He also said that the nikkah (marriage) of his client and her husband was solemnised in accordance with the teachings of Islam.
The counsel said the husband of the petitioner changed his name after conversion to Islam, while their child, too, had a Muslim name.
He argued that his client’s husband was a convert to Islam, so he should be considered to be Muslim in line with the teaching of the Holy Quran and Hadees and that nobody could accused him of holding old faith, Christianity.
