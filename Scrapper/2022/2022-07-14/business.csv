0,"Dollar surpasses Rs210, near all-time high",The strength gained by the rupee after $2.3bn Chinese inflows has evaporated within a couple of weeks.,"KARACHI: The dollar jumped over one per cent against the rupee to cross the 210 mark in the interbank market on Wednesday as trading resumed after a gap of six days. 
According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the local currency lost Rs2.19, or 1.04pc, against the greenback to close at Rs210.1. 
The long Eid holidays depressed the local currency despite widespread media reports about a staff-level agreement with the Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF). 
After reaching a peak of Rs211.93 on June 22, the dollar started declining for a brief period and fell to a low of Rs204.56 on July 4. 
However, the strength gained by the rupee after $2.3 billion Chinese inflows has evaporated within a couple of weeks, as the dollar snapped the rupee’s rising streak and gained Rs2.38 in the interbank market on July 5, the first appreciation in the new fiscal year. Since then, the greenback has continued to rise.
“The dollar was traded at Rs210.10 in the inter-bank mainly on account of fears that the State Bank’s payment capacity has been declining,” said a currency dealer in the interbank market.
Reports circulating in the media suggested that Pakistan has reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF and a $1.2bn loan disbursement is expected in August. However, the news failed to have a positive impact on the currency market. 
The rupee has particularly depreciated in recent months owing to a worsening external account, which was in a deficit of over $15bn during the 11 months from July to May and may reach $18bn during the entire fiscal year.  
The final report about the current account deficit has not been released yet, whereas the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves stand at around $9.8bn.
Currency experts see no chance for a rise in the rupee’s value without any miracle as the hope for inflows is limited while the international debt market would not respond to any initiation for launching a bond to raise dollars. 
“The only hope is that the country’s import bill falls with the declining oil prices, but the government still needs to slash unnecessary imports,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market.
However, at the same time, the financial sector believes that the exports will decline since the government has increased the interest rate on the export finance scheme and long-term financing. The interest rate is now 10pc for them while the policy interest rate at 15pc.
“Another aspect is that global oil prices are declining because of low demand showing recession in the developed and developing economies, which means demand for exportable from countries like Pakistan will fall,” said Aamir Aziz, an exporter of readymade garments to Europe. He feared a drop in the country’s exports in the ongoing fiscal year.

1,Gas price hike to fuel inflation,Analyst says month-on-month reading of the consumer price index would increase up to one percentage point.,"KARACHI: The impact of the proposed gas price hike of up to 235 per cent on monthly headline inflation will be between 50 and 100 basis points.
Speaking to Dawn on Wednesday, Topline Securities Deputy Director of Research Umair Naseer said the month-on-month reading of the consumer price index (CPI) would increase up to one percentage point because of the revised gas prices if all other variables remained constant.
The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet has approved a rate increase ranging between 8pc and 235pc for domestic and industrial consumers of gas. After the formal approval by the federal cabinet, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority will notify the increase in gas prices.
The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics uses the weighted average gas prices for consumers to calculate the impact of any price revision on the CPI. With a 1pc weight in the CPI basket, headline inflation can go up by 50-100 basis points, Mr Naseer said.
The CPI surged 21.3pc on a year-on-year basis in June, the fastest pace since December 2008 when the global economy was in the middle of the second-worst financial crisis of the last 100 years. The CPI increased 6.3pc on a month-on-month basis, another multi-decade high.



 
The hike in gas rates will generate additional revenue ranging between Rs400 billion and Rs600bn for the two gas utility companies, said Mr Naseer in a research note to investors. It’ll also help contain the build-up in the gas circular debt, which has piled up to Rs1.5 trillion or roughly 2pc of GDP.
The weighted average selling price of gas in Pakistan is between $3 and $3.50 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu). However, the cost of gas is estimated to be $3.6-$4 per mmBtu. The differential is contributing to the cascade of unpaid subsidies on the balance sheets of gas companies.
“After the proposed increase, the weighted average gas price is estimated to increase by 46pc to $4.50 to $5 per mmBtu,” he said.
“The IMF has also been a key proponent of reducing the circular debt by increasing gas tariffs… We believe this, along with the rationalisation of the power tariff, will take Pakistan closer to the revival of the IMF programme,” he added.

2,US inflation hits new 40-year high,"US president admits his administration needs to ""make more progress, more quickly"" in taming prices.","WASHINGTON: US inflation surged to a fresh peak of 9.1 per cent in June, further squeezing American families and heaping pressure on President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings have taken a battering from the relentless rise in prices.
Government data released on Wednesday showed a sharp, faster-than-expected increase in the consumer price index compared to May driven by significant increases in gasoline prices. The 9.1pc CPI spike over the past 12 months to June was the fastest increase since November 1981, the Labour Department reported.
Energy contributed half of the monthly increase, as gasoline jumped 11.2pc last month and a staggering 59.9pc over the past year. Overall energy prices posted their biggest annual increase since April 1980.
While acknowledging the inflation rate was  “unacceptably high,” Biden argued that it was also  “out of date” as it did not reflect a clear drop in energy prices since mid-June. The recent price drop had provided  “important breathing room for American families. And, other commodities like wheat have fallen sharply since this report,” the president said in a statement.
Insisting that tackling inflation was the top priority, Biden admitted his administration needed  “to make more progress, more quickly, in getting price increases under control.”

3,Railways ministry to reverse right-of-way policy for telcos,"Operators, ISPs fear move will increase cost of business and deprive some people of internet.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Railways has decided to reverse a federal cabinet-approved policy governing the right of way (ROW) for installing telecom infrastructure, a decision that may increase the cost of internet cable installation in affected areas.
The Public and Private Right of Way Policy Directive 2020, approved by the federal cabinet, was binding on all the federal and provincial government institutions, including cantonment areas, railways, etc.
The policy states that “in case of public right of way, the public authority shall assess the right of way fee … on the basis of no profit, no loss” and it cannot “treat grant of permission to licensees for the use of the right of way as a means of commercial benefit of the right of way, imposition of tax or revenue generation.
Based on the directives of the federal government, the railway ministry approved its ROW policy in February for installing fibre-optic cables across railway tracks, which includes a fee structure for all operators without discrimination. 

Operators, ISPs fear move will increase cost of business and deprive some people of internet

However, Pakistan Railways has recently decided not only to reverse the ROW policy formulated by the railway ministry but also to ignore the directives set by the federal cabinet.
A senior railway official told Dawn the decision was recently made by Railways Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique on the grounds that the ROW policy and directive finalised by the former PTI government were causing significant losses to railways.
According to a copy of a letter available with Dawn, a meeting chaired by the railways minister held on June 13 at Pakistan Railways’ headquarters in Lahore discussed that “in order to get maximum revenue for Pakistan Railways, a competitive bidding amongst the operators/firms may be arranged”. 
In this regard, the railways secretary had constituted a committee to recommend amendments to the ROW policy and devise a mechanism of competitive bidding among the operators, it said.
Telecom operators and internet service providers have expressed serious reservations about the planned move and described it as a violation of the agreed law with all stakeholders.
“This has always been a serious issue in all sectors in Pakistan — there is no guarantee of policy consistency,” said a senior official of an internet service provider. 
“The letter has not been shared with us,” the official said. However, if the policy was reversed, the official said there would be only two ways ahead: “either all internet and telecom companies, including PTCL, Wateen, Nayatel and Multinet, pay very high charges to lay cables around railway areas or we do not offer facilities there.” 
It is expected that internet companies would challenge the railway ministry’s decision to auction the right of way instead of charging the prescribed fee in court, but it will delay the process of expanding fibre broadband penetration across the country, which offers the highest speed and reliable internet at low costs compared to mobile broadband.

4,"Growers reject urea price hike to Rs2,350",HYDERABAD: Sindh Chamber of Agriculture has rejected unilateral incre­ases in urea prices and accu­sed...,"HYDERABAD: Sindh Chamber of Agriculture has rejected unilateral incre­ases in urea prices and accu­sed manufacturers of passing on the burden of 10 per cent super tax to growers.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, vice-president Nabi Bux Sathio said the agriculture inputs have alre­ady become costlier manifold during the last few months and the urea manufacturers increased the per bag rate to Rs2,350 from Rs1,950 without any justification.
He said the level of loot and plunder of fertiliser companies could be gauged from the fact that the federal government imposed a 10pc super tax on total annual income while these companies increased the 20pc rate on each bag of urea.
Surprisingly, he said, the provincial and federal governments were hand in glove with urea manufacturing compa­nies for exploiting growers. 
Rejecting the anti-farmer decision of urea manufacturers, he urged the federal government to take serious notice of the illegal hike and get the urea price reverted to Rs1,950 per bag.

5,Petroleum prices likely to be cut by up to Rs40,PM Shehbaz has asked the Petroleum Division and Ogra to put up a formal summary in the regard.,"ISLAMABAD: The prices of petroleum products are estimated to decrease by up to Rs17-40 per litre for the next fortnight mai­nly because of lower international oil prices.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has already announced early this week to reduce petroleum prices to pass on the benefit of lower crude prices to the people and had asked the Petroleum Division and the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) to put up a formal summary in the regard.
Likewise, the ex-depot price of kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) would be cut by Rs30 and Rs32 per litre, respectively. The kerosene price would thus stand at about Rs200 per litre from Rs231 and that of LDO would be around Rs194 instead of Rs226 per litre.
Informed sources told Dawn that based on existing tax rates and import parity price, the ex-depot price of petrol would be down by Rs17 per litre and that of high-speed diesel (HSD) by about Rs40. 
With this cut, the petrol prices would come down to about Rs232 per litre from about Rs249 per litre at present while HSD price would also touch Rs235 per litre instead of Rs277.
These sources said the international price downfall was not only politically opportune for the sitting government ahead of by-elections in Punjab but could also provide a reasonable cushion to retain its small portion as a higher petroleum development levy (PDL), particularly on HSD, kerosene and LDO. At present, Rs5 per litre PDL is applicable on these three products compared to Rs10 per litre on petrol.
As such, these sources hinted that the government could increase PDL on HSD, kerosene and LDO by at least Rs5 per litre and still reduce the price of HSD by about Rs35 and those of kerosene and LDO by Rs25 per litre.
Under the deal with the International Monetary Fund, the government has to gradually increase PDL on products to a maximum of Rs50 per litre to collect Rs855bn during the current fiscal year. This is the first time the PMLN-led coalition government is reducing petroleum prices after it came to power about three months ago.
The petroleum levy had come to an end on March 1 price revision as international prices went up and the PTI government decided to not only reduce petroleum prices by Rs10 per litre but freeze it for the next four months i.e. until end-June 30. The PMLN-led coalition government had been increasing petroleum prices since May 15 under the IMF deal.
On June 30, the government revived PDL. The petrol prices have increased by 66pc to about Rs248.74 from Rs149.86 per litre bef­o­re May 26, showing an increase of Rs99 per litre
The ex-depot price of HSD had increased to Rs276.54 per litre on July 1, up by 92pc since May 26 from Rs144.15 per litre, up by 132.39 per litre. Likewise, the ex-depot price of kerosene had gone up to Rs230.26 per litre, up by 95pc since May 26 when it stood at Rs118.31, up by Rs111.95 per litre.
Similarly, the ex-depot price of LDO went up to Rs226.15 on July 1, up 80pc from Rs125.56 per litre on May 26, up by about Rs100.59 per litre.
The government has given an assurance to the IMF to gradually increase petroleum levy on all products by Rs5 per litre every month to a maximum of Rs50 per litre to achieve Rs855bn revenue target.

6,Global outlook has ‘darkened significantly’: IMF,"WASHINGTON: The global economic outlook has  “darkened significantly” and could deteriorate further, the IMF’s...","WASHINGTON: The global economic outlook has  “darkened significantly” and could deteriorate further, the IMF’s managing director said on Wednesday, citing Russia’s war in Ukraine and the rapid inflation it has caused, threatening widespread hunger and poverty.
The warning comes just months after the IMF already cut its global growth forecast for 2022 and 2023.
The Ukraine war hit as the world was struggling to recover from the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and has caused an acceleration of inflation that endangers the gains of the past two years.
The international crisis-lender is  “projecting a further downgrade to global growth” in 2022 and 2023, Kristalina Georgieva said in a blog post published ahead of the meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, scheduled for Friday and Saturday in Bali.
“It is going to be a tough 2022 — and possibly an even tougher 2023, with increased risk of recession,” she wrote.
