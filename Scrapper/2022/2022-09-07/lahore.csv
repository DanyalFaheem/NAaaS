0,ECP issues notice to Rana Sana over by-poll code breach,The body has also sought disciplinary action against the deputy medical superintendent of the Multan Cardiology Hospital.,"LAHORE: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has issued a notice to Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan for taking part in electioneering for PML-N candidate in Faisalabad by-poll Abid Sher Ali.
The body has also sought disciplinary action against the deputy medical superintendent of the Multan Cardiology Hospital for running the election campaign of PTI candidate Mehar Bano Qureshi.
The notice was issued by the district monitoring officer to Rana Sana on a complaint filed by a voter of National Assembly’s constituency NA-108, Faisalabad-VIII, where the by-polls are to be held on Sept 25.  
The complainant alleged that the interior minister took part in door-to-door campaign and corner meetings of Abid Sher Ali on Monday in violation of the Section-233 of the Elections Act 2017, which bars public office-holders from taking part in electioneering in any manner.  
Rana Sana was directed to appear before the monitoring officer as well as submit a written statement on Wednesday to clarify his position vis-à-vis the allegation.
Meanwhile, the Multan district monitoring officer issued a directive to the specialised healthcare and medical education, south Punjab secretary, for immediately suspending Dr Farhan, deputy medical superintendent of Multan Cardiology Hospital, for running door-to-door election campaign of PTI candidate for NA-157 Mehar Bano Qureshi, the daughter of ex-foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.
The secretary was also asked to initiate disciplinary action against Dr Farhan for misuse of his office as the election authority would never ignore any violation of the election code of conduct.

1,Rajanpur residents pine for flood-battered homes,"WHO, Unicef, Aga Khan Hospital to set up medical camps in flood-hit areas.","LAHORE / DERA GHAZI KHAN: Thousands of people in Rajanpur are struggling to return to their dilapidated houses for settling on a self-help basis after the floodwater starts receding.  
The roads and passages leading to their villages are still submerged by floodwater and the district administration has failed to clear the roads and restore broken linkages. There were seven hill torrents in Rajanpur’s Kaha, Chachar, Pitok, Sori Shumali, Kala Bagga Khosra, Sori Janobi and Zangi areas.  
These hill torrents were cause by heavy rains at Bambli, Jampur, Harand, Chatool, Lundi Saidan, Lalgarh, Meeranpur, Hajipur, Pull Dhundhi, Fazilpur city and several other small villages. As many as 12 people lost their lives while 3,192 were injured during the floods. Besides, 425 schools, 16 hospitals, one college, 318,423 acre crops and 28,646 houses were damaged in the floods.  
The government has established 27 relief camps, and 48 medical and 55 veterinary camps to provide support to the people while 564 teams are providing health facilities to the people. The district administration also distributed 16,685 tents, 48,122 ration bags, 1,430 mats, 6,866 bottles of drinking water, 2,000 mosquito nets and 5,583 daigs (of cooked food) among the flood-hit.  

WHO, Unicef, Aga Khan Hospital to set up medical camps in flood-hit areas

Most people complain that they have been left in the lurch and are unable to resettle and start a new life after the heavy floods. They say the government has also failed to repair the broken banks and dykes to prevent water from reaching their residential areas. Most people are returning homes on foot, saying they cannot live in tents and camps because the government is not facilitating them.  
They say thousands of people have not even tents and are living under the open sky and vulnerable to diseases due to mosquitoes. They say most of them are suffering from diarrhoea after living in the open for the last two to three weeks and they don’t even have medicines. 
They are returning homes in the hope of rebuilding these and fixing the damages on their own.  
Meanwhile, the district administration claims that it is surveying the areas to get exact figures of the damages and several teams have been sent for the purpose. The officials, it says, will approach every person and register him or her to address their grievances.
DERA GHAZI KHAN: Medical teams of the World Health Organization (WHO), Aga Khan Hospital (AKH) and Unicef will hold medical camps in the flood-affected areas of DG Khan and Rajanpur during the ongoing week, especially for the pregnant women and lactating mothers.  
DG Khan Chief Executive Officer (health) Dr Ateeq told Dawn that the health department has sought help from the three international organisations to cope with the post-flood ailments and to provide proper medical care to those affected by the calamity, specially the pregnant and lactating women.  
He said 25 teams of the WHO, Unicef and AKH would hold medical camps in as many union councils for at least one month. He added that two medical camps would be held in each UC per day.  
He said as per WHO criteria, eight percent of total flood-affected women are considered pregnant, as well as lactating mothers. An estimated number of 100,36 flood-affected women, including the pregnant and lactating ones, are being treated at the medical camps established in 40 flood-hit UCs by the government, he added. He said that vaccination counters had also been set up at every medical camp. 
The CEO said as many as 12 ambulances and 35 other vehicles being used by maternity supervisors, were ready to transport the flood-hit pregnant women to different health facilities.  
He said maternity services had been restored in private buildings in even the areas badly affected by flood, that include Yaru, Mangrotha, Narri, Triman and Sokarr.  
Dr Ateeq said the building of the Basic Health Unit (BHU) in Sokarr tehsil of Taunsa had been declared dangerous, adding that a new building would be constructed at a cost of Rs25 millions there.  
Meanwhile, he said, the Sokarr BHU had been made functional in a private building, where maternity services were available round the clock.  
He said some 30 health facilities had been hit by continuous downpour and hill torrents, including three BHUs, which had been completely damaged in Taunsa tehsil.
In DG Khan tehsil, he said, the health facilities at Mamoori, Loharwala, Yaru and Kot Mubarak were also badly affected by hill torrents, while maternity services, hygiene kits and food supplements were being provided to flood-affected women at 43 medical camps, including three mobile health units, by the district administration.

He is further designated as VC of the LDA under section 4-A(1) of the Act ibid in place of Mr Naeemul Haq,” reads the notification.

7,Workers in Punjab need brick kilns reignited after floods,More than 33 million people in Pakistan have been affected by the flooding.,"RAJANPUR: The brick kilns that dominate the small village of Aqilpur in Punjab now lie abandoned, furnaces extinguished by weeks of torrential rain that have caused the worst floods in the country’s history.  
Though the floods that engulfed Aqilpur and its surrounding fields have receded from the highs of a week ago, the kilns are still surrounded by water.  
Most of those who lived on-site — part of the country’s millions-strong workforce known as “daily wagers” because of their piecemeal salaries — abandoned their homes for higher, dry ground.  
“I come here daily on my bicycle and go from one kiln to another to look for work but find nothing,” said Muhammad Ayub, an itinerant labourer.  
Now, a road that runs through the village has become a kind of town square for the kiln workers, who find themselves both homeless and out of work.  
Ayub, 40, has a sick mother and an eight-year-old daughter to provide for. When his home was destroyed in the torrential rains that preceded the flood, he sent them to a relative’s house close to the village. But once the flood hit, his family was forced to take refuge at a makeshift campsite on higher ground outside the village.  
More than 33 million people in Pakistan have been affected by the flooding, brought on by record monsoon rains that have swamped a third of the country, causing at least 1,300 deaths. The floods have destroyed or badly damaged nearly two million homes or business premises, and for the rebuilding process to begin, kilns like those in Aqilpur will have to fire up again.
There are thousands of small brick factories and kilns scattered across much of Pakistan -- a vital supplier of building materials for the nation of 220 million. For now, mounds of bricks that should be making their way to building sites across the country lie partially submerged by floodwater.  
Ayub worked 12 hours a night making bricks, earning less than $3 (Rs600) a shift for his labours. He would spend the mornings working the fields surrounding the village, and was only able to sleep briefly in the afternoon before his shift began again.  
With the kilns shut down and the fields submerged, his daily wage is gone.  
“Where should a labourer go? he asked AFP.  
“Wherever the workers go to look for work, they come back empty-handed.” Daily wagers make up one of the poorest segments of Pakistan’s society and many in rural areas are exploited by unscrupulous large-scale farmers and factory owners who keep them in virtual servitude.  
The brickworks in particular are notorious for hiring child labour -- illegal under Pakistan law.  
One of the youngest among the 50 or so kiln workers camped near Aqilpur is Muhammad Ismail, who joined his father at the brickworks almost a year ago when he turned 12. He helped mould the clay that makes the bricks before they went into the furnace, hoping his labours would help his parents feed his six younger siblings.  
After fleeing their home in the flood, Ismail’s father had to borrow money to buy flour and other necessities for his family.
“But now we are in debt,” Ismail said.
“I have been searching for work with my father every day. We need to pay off our debt, but I’m losing hope.” It is not uncommon in parts of Pakistan for those who incur debt and fail to pay it back to be forced into bonded labour for years, as interest on the original sum keeps mounting.  
This debt can often be handed down from one generation to another.
The kiln workers of Aqilpur have petitioned the owner to spark up the furnaces so they can resume work, but Ayub thinks they are asking for the impossible.  
“The water collected here isn’t going to dry up for at least three months,” he said.
“And after the water dries, it will take another two or two-and-half months for the repairs.”

9,"14,000 representatives of student councils take oath",Elections were held early this month in public schools of all dists of S Punjab...,"LAHORE: Fourteen thousand elected representatives of student councils in public schools of 11 districts of south Punjab took oath on Tuesday. 
The main ceremony was held at the Government Boys Comprehensive Higher Secondary School, Multan, while other districts were connected through Zoom. 
South Punjab School Education Secretary Ehtasham Anwar administered the oath to the elected representatives of schools situated in urban areas of Multan. 
Under the oath, the elected representatives vowed to forget the bitterness of elections, take their opponents along, assist their teachers and work for the welfare of their fellow students. They also vowed to exhibit exemplary conduct and discipline to become role models for others. 

Elections were held early this month in public schools of all dists of S Punjab

Speaking on the occasion, Mr Anwar said unlike the unions where students with political inclinations participated, the criteria for student councils was such that only hardworking, capable and disciplined students could contest and get elected while they would operate under a disciplined and controlled environment and a serious violation could lead to their dissolution. 
The elections for student councils were held early this month in public schools of all districts of south Punjab. Around 11m students had cast their votes to elect office-bearers, including presidents, vice-presidents, general secretaries and class representatives in 4,538 elementary and high schools for boys and girls. 
The elections were organised on the pattern of general elections in the country and entailed nomination of candidates, election campaigns, use of ballots and casting of votes.  
The main objectives of the constitution of student councils include developing and nurturing leadership skills in the students as well as equipping them with life skills such as management, communication and public relations. The organisers claim that the entire exercise is likely to introduce and strengthen democratic values at the grassroots in a country whose record is far from satisfactory on this account. The responsibilities of the council representatives include becoming role models for other students by exhibiting the best discipline, performance, conduct and character to arrange co-curricular activities such as Bazm-e-Adab, speech/debate, poetry, essay writing, painting, and other such competitions. These leaders would also lead special initiatives such as promotion of book reading amongst the students, improvement of writing skills, green schools, guide/encourage others on how to access the online magazine, arrange sports activities in the school, ensure active participation by the students, assist the school administration in identifying the best athletes amongst them for representing school in competitions to help the school administration in maintaining discipline at the campus. 
The students assist the school administrations on special occasions such as parents day, annual functions. They are supposed to communicate the problems faced by the students to the school administration, convey the announcements by the school administration to the students, as and when needed and guide the new students.
