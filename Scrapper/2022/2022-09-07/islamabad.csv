6,AJK police to bring back expat driver who escaped after killing three persons,MUZAFFARABAD: Mirpur police on Tuesday said they would bring a teenage British national of Kashmiri origin to ...,"MUZAFFARABAD: Mirpur police on Tuesday said they would bring a teenage British national of Kashmiri origin to justice who reportedly fled Pakistan after killing three persons by his reckless driving.
At about 8:30pm on Thursday, a recklessly driving double cabin pickup (AVS-444) with 19-year-old dual nationality holder Ismail Arshad at the wheel, who was accompanied by his uncle Malik Sajid, had first collided on Mirpur bypass with two motorbikes coming from the opposite direction. It had then hit a parked car and crushed its owner and his friend sitting on a protection wall along the road, before finally falling into a ditch.
The crash left Kalimullah and his pillion rider Mohammad Waiz dead on the spot and Farmanullah, his pillion rider Shaukatullah, car owner Zainul Hassan and his colleague Malik Azhar critically injured.
Mr Azhar succumbed to his wounds in Divisional Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital Mirpur after a few hours while doctors had to amputate a leg of Farmanullah to save his life following which he was referred to Pims in Islamabad. Shaukatullah was still being treated in the DHQ Hospital Mirpur and was out of danger.
SSP Mirpur Raja Irfan Saleem told Dawn that while people who gathered at the accident site were busy removing the injured to hospital, Mr Sajid, who had also sustained injuries, called Ismail’s brother Haider who arrived on a bike and instantly removed both of them from the scene.
An FIR was registered at the City police station, wherein Mr Ismail and his uncle Mr Sajid were booked.
Since the act of the suspects had threatened the life of general public, section 6 of Anti-Terrorist Act was also added in the FIR afterwards, the SSP said.
He said the police took Mr Sajid into custody from the DHQ hospital where he was brought by his family for treatment, but by that time the principal accused (Ismail) along with his parents and two siblings left Mirpur for Islamabad, from where they flew out of Pakistan past midnight.
The SSP said police were gathering information about the current location of Mr Ismail, as there were unconfirmed reports that he had been denied entry by the UK immigration officials.
“We are in contact with the National Crime Agency of Pakistan for his extradition and soon he will be brought to justice,” he said.

9,"Toxic air kills over 128,000 Pakistanis every year",NGO calls for promotion of environment-friendly policies.,"ISLAMABAD: At least 128,000 deaths are reported in Pakistan every year as a result of air pollution and related sicknesses, said Fair Finance Pakistan, a non-government body working to mitigate the impacts of climate change, on the eve of World Clean Air Day.
Pakistan, alongside China and India, accounts for the highest deaths owing to air pollution as millions across the country are forced to breathe air that contains high levels of hazardous pollutants and particulate matter.
The NGO also launched an online campaign to raise public awareness and facilitate actions to improve air quality in the country.
Asim Jaffry, country programme lead, said: “There is a need to change the business model in Pakistan and elsewhere to ensure that business operations exercise responsibility especially the financial sector to ensure net zero carbon footprints, protect human life and the planet’s ecology.”

NGO calls for promotion of environment-friendly policies

He further said that ‘Clean Air Day’ aimed to raise awareness regarding the importance of clean air for health, for human economies and demonstrated the close link of air quality to other environmental and developmental challenges such as climate change.
It is worth mentioning that World Air Quality Index 2021 ranked Pakistan as the third most polluted country in the world, and its major cities, particularly Lahore, are regularly listed among the most toxic cities in the world.
The NGO stated that air pollution and climate change were closely linked as all major pollutants have an impact on the climate. As one of the countries on the frontline of the climate crisis, Pakistan faces grave consequences in failing to address climate change which has resulted in frequent adverse weather events, such as extreme temperatures, droughts and flooding.
The Twitter campaign calls on the policy circles, commercial banks, businesses and civil society to promote responsible investments in the country, promote sustainable transport, just transition towards renewable energy, crop and waste management, monitor air pollution, implement laws and deliver credible plans to reduce emissions from vehicles, power plants, construction and industry.
It builds on the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report recommendations for reduction in emissions of methane, black carbon and ground-level ozone alongside carbon dioxide to foster sustainable development by delivering better health, agricultural, economic and climate outcomes through improved air quality.
According to the World Health Organisation, 99pc of the world’s population is now breathing polluted air. Seven million people die each year due to air pollution, with 90pc of them residing in low- and middle-income countries.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) research showed air pollution knows no national borders and is strongly correlated to other global crises such as climate change, biodiversity loss, other forms of pollution, social and gender parity as well as economic development. 
The UN agency estimated when people were exposed to air pollution and extreme heat, their risk of death became 20pc higher.
Evidence shows dirty air hits the poor the most and disproportionately affects the most vulnerable, such as women, children, and the elderly. The World Bank reports one in every 10 people exposed to unsafe air pollution lives in extreme poverty.

Thanking the French ambassador for his country’s support, Ms Rehman said: “We appreciate France’s support in these tough times and would require assistance in the rehabilitation and relief process.”
“The devastation on ground is much more than we have ever encountered even in the 2010 floods. We have not seen a humanitarian disaster of such epic proportions. More than 5,700 kilometre portion of roads and 246 bridges have been severely damaged in the 81 calamity-hit regions, cutting communication lines making relief and rescue a herculean challenge,” she said.
The minister stressed the need to rebuild adaptive and resilient infrastructure.
“The country is now bracing for a health emergency due to water-borne diseases such as cholera and dengue,” she said, adding that health assistance was imperative due to fragility and vulnerability on ground as people were surviving under open skies, waiting for the government’s assistance.
“We need to provide tents and medics on a priority basis. Women’s health crisis is looming in the heart of affected areas with at least 650,000 pregnant women, of whom 73,000 are expected to deliver next month. The flood-affected areas are in dire need of maternal health services,” she said.
Mr Galey expressed solidarity with the people of Pakistan on the devastation caused by floods and assured the minister that full support would be provided by the French government.

Young Doctors Association (YDA) and the BBH administration held a meeting and decided to follow the security model of Holy Family Hospital (HFH) and Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology (RIC) to avoid attack on doctors in future.
BBH Medical Superintendent Dr Suhail Chaudhry and YDA BBH President Dr Humayun Warraich and other senior officials attended the meeting.
The meeting was briefed about an incident in which attendants of a patient beat up doctors at the Benazir Bhutto Hospital on Sunday.
The meeting decided that the concerned police station may be approached for the arrest of the culprits.
The YDA told the meeting that the role of the security guards was very poor because no security guard was there at the time of the incident. 
In order to avoid any untoward situation, it has been decided that smart and vigilant security guards will be deployed at strategic location, especially in the emergency department, and the number of guards will also be increased.
It was also recommended that the hospital administration should seek an explanation form the security company for poor performance of its guards. 
The role of police officials deployed in the hospital was also discouraging as none of them was there to take appropriate action.
However, in order to enhance/beef up the security arrangements for tackling such situation, it is recommended to approach the police authorities for transfer of all the police officials over alleged mismanagement/poor performance.
It was noticed with serious concern that instructions regarding observance of dress code/displaying of service card or name tag by the healthcare workers was not being followed.
However, it was decided that a letter shall be issued to all the concerned for observance of dress code/displaying of service card or name tag.
Young Doctors Association BBH President Dr Humayun Warraich told Dawn that they recommended the hospital administration to follow the security standard operating procedures of Holy Family Hospital and Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology. 
He said young doctors were working in shifts and their security was necessary so that they could provide better medical care to the patients. 
Mr Warraich said one-patient one-attendant policy was also necessary in the hospital to avoid such incidents.

Recalling the selfless sacrifices of armed forces, Mr Ashraf said on Tuesday that the month of September was commemorated to pay tribute to the armed forces. He said Mr Khan’s statement in a public gathering in Faisalabad was in contradiction and an insult to national fervour.
He said the armed forces had always stood up valiantly to defend and serve the nation, especially during the ongoing climate catastrophe. 
The NA speaker expressed disappointment over such “uncalled and unsolicited remarks” about the armed forces, adding that such statements were tantamount to inciting anarchy in the country.
Such statements remind us that whether it was the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme or visit of the Chinese president to Pakistan, he has always put the country’s interests at stake, the speaker said, adding that such statements would not only cause severe damage to the image of the armed forces within the country but also to its soft image internationally.
He said such a statement would discourage personnel of the armed forces while they support the nation as it faced the severe scourge of flash floods and torrential rains.
