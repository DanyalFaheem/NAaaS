PESHAWAR: In a bid to clarify his remarks about the appointment of the army chief that prompted widespread criticism, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Tuesday claimed that his rivals were “distorting” his statements to pit him against the military and the judiciary.
“My criticism of the Pakistan Army is constructive in nature,” the former prime minister told a charged crowd during a political gathering in Peshawar. “The army is mine… the country is mine… strong institutions are a guarantee for the stability of the country,” he said.
Mr Khan insisted his words were taken out of context and said that propaganda had been unleashed against his party and him to discredit them.
“What did I say wrong,” Imran Khan asked the crowd. “I only asked for the appointment of the army chief on the basis of merit,” he said, adding that merit-based appointments were mandatory to strengthen any institution.
“I talked about merit in the selection of the army chief…what did I say wrong,” the PTI chief asked, referring to the criticism levelled against him in light of his controversial remarks. “I had also said that Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari should not select the new army chief. Why did I say that…Nawaz Sharif is a convict… Should an absconder and a thief be allowed to select the army chief of Pakistan,” Mr Khan asked, rhetorically. He also referred to the Memogate affair and said Mr Zardari had asked the US through then Pakistan envoy Hussain Haqqani to “save his government from the army”.
“Are these the people who would select the army chief? Will we allow these crooks to make such important appointments,” the PTI chief asked.
He also raised his “third question” on the issue and asked whether those who came to power through an alleged foreign conspiracy should be allowed to choose the chief of army staff.
“I mentioned these things and they say Imran Khan is against the army,” the former premier said, questioning the treatment meted out to him.
He then went on to play the videos of the PDM leaders, particularly Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz, Asif Ali Zardari, and Maulana Fazlur Rehman, to show that those now part of the government had themselves criticised the army in the past.
“These people have the audacity to tell us that we are against the army,” Imran Khan said as he played several videos of the PDM leaders lashing out at the military. He also played one of his own old videos during the public meeting in which he was speaking in favour of the army.
“When the army is strong, the entire country is strong and we enjoy independence,” he said and alluded to the instability in the Muslim world.
‘Strong judiciary important’
The former prime minister said that he was not against the judiciary and added that he had launched a movement for the independence of the judiciary 26 years ago.
“No society can progress without the rule of law,” he said, adding that he had not allowed a single party worker to speak against the judiciary.
Speaking about his remarks regarding an Islamabad judge during a rally last month, Imran Khan said he did not mean to use “harsh language” against Judge Zeba Chaudhry.
According to the PTI chief, the treatment meted out to his chief aide Shahbaz Gill had prompted his criticism, but he could never think of “threatening a judge”.
Earlier in the day, the former prime minister bashed his opponents, saying that they were “deliberately distorting” his remarks about the future army chief’s appointment. “[I] am following intense propaganda launched by [the] PDM cabal of crooks against me. This stems from being petrified of PTI’s soaring popularity,” Mr Khan had tweeted.
The remarks by Mr Khan on Sunday invited flak from the military itself. The Inter-Services Public Relations had also issued a statement, saying that the army was “aghast at the defamatory and uncalled for statement about the senior leadership”.
Imran Khan had lashed out at the PPP and PML-N and said both parties were opposing snap elections, because they wanted to “appoint an army chief of their choice” in November to save their skin in corruption cases.
PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif were making all-out efforts to bring their “favourite” army chief after the retirement of the incumbent chief in November this year, he had alleged.

1,Police refusal to book Imran for ‘army bashing’ irks Lahore court,IHC orders PTI chief to join probe into alleged threats against Islamabad judge.,"LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: While a sessions court in Lahore sought reply from police on a petition challenging their refusal to book Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan for allegedly ‘ridiculing’ the army, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday asked the ex-premier to join the investigation against him over his alleged threats to a judge.
The sessions court sought a reply from SP investigation and additional district complaint officer by Sept 10 on a petition challenging police refusal to register a case against Mr Khan on the charge of ridiculing the institution of army in his recent power show in Faisalabad.
Ex-officio justice of peace and additional district and sessions judge Ghulam Hussain Bhinder was hearing the petition filed by one Sheikh Muzaffar Hussain, under Section 22-A and 22-B of the criminal procedure code.
The petitioner through a counsel contended that he filed an application with the Samanabad police for registration of a criminal case against the PTI chief for ‘scandalising’ senior army officers. He alleged that Mr Khan through his statement attempted to create a rift among the senior army officers and tried to portray them as ‘less patriotic’. He said the PTI chief’s act amounted to the offence of ‘sedition’ under the law, which was liable to be prosecuted following registration of a case.

IHC orders PTI chief to join probe into alleged threats against Islamabad judge

However, he said, the SHO flatly refused to act in accordance with law on the application of the petitioner without any legal justification. He argued that the police were legally bound to register a case against the accused person nominated in the application in accordance with the provision of Section 154 of the CrPC. He requested the court to order police to register a case against Mr Khan under relevant provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Probe into threats to judge
Meanwhile, the IHC asked the PTI chief to join the investigation in the case registered against him for allegedly hurling threats to an additional district and sessions judge and top officers of Islamabad police.
The IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz heard the petition seeking to quash the FIR against Mr Khan.
Barrister Salman Safdar, counsel for the PTI chief, argued before the court that the police incorporated some more section of law into the FIR.
On the court’s query, Advocate General for Islamabad Barrister Jahangir Khan Jadoon said police had not yet filed challan before the anti-terrorism court, as Mr Khan had not joined the investigation.
When the court asked if the investigation officer had ever tried to approach Mr Khan, the AG replied that the officer had served notice at his residence, but the IO was not given access to the PTI chief.
The court asked the counsel for Mr Khan to advise their client to join the investigation since the case is at the preliminary stage.
The chief justice remarked that the IO represented the state and in case of any lapse, the court were always there to watch over. He said this was a test case for the police itself, adding that the IO should scrap the FIR if the case was not made out.
The court asked the AG to inform the court in case the police would face any issue to access Mr Khan.
The bench, however, ordered the prosecution to submit the challan and adjourned hearing till Sept 15.

HYDERABAD / DADU: Although water levels in the Manchhar Lake and its connected waterways dropped slightly, water gushing out of the latest cuts made in the freshwater lake inundated the Indus Highway on Tuesday.
A bridge near the Sehwan toll plaza was damaged by the torrents, while a 30km stretch of the highway has been closed for traffic, officials said.
Motorway Police official Saqib Ahmer told Dawn that barriers had been installed on the road and commuters have been advised not to use this route.
Word of a fresh breach in the Main Nara Valley Drain (MNVD) at RD-10 on Tuesday may have come as ‘good news’ for the people of Dadu and Jamshoro, who could now look forward to a decline in water levels as the amount of discharge from the Manchhar Lake was starting to show signs of reduction.
According to Manchhar’s executive engineer Mahesh Kumar, the lake’s level was recorded at 123.25RL in morning, which first dropped to 123.2RL in the afternoon and then, with a marginal decline of 0.2, stood at 123RL by Tuesday night, he said.
Likewise, the MNVD recorded a drop of 3-4 inches, according to a senior Wapda officer.
“This 3-4 inch drop is nothing considering the heavy quantum of flows ending up in MNV, but at least the beginning of the end has started”, said Wapda’s Sukkur Chief Engineer (water) Naeem Qadir Mangi.
The currents from the breach at RD-10, reported to be a ‘man made’ cut, swept away three persons. However, they managed to save themselves and returned to the bank, as seen in a viral video.
Mr Mangi said that breach in RD-10 was largely due to the influx of water into MNVD over the past two days, which had started eroding the drain’s bank. This pressure finally tore through the bank after the lake refused to accept more water.
Sindh Special Secretary Irrigation Jamal Mangan told Dawn that water from the two cuts at Manchhar’s RD-14 and RD-52, as well as the breach in RD-10 of MNVD, would head for a location between Manchhar’s containing bank and the Indus Link.
He said the breach would decrease the scale of the threat to Dadu city.
“Now this water will accumulate in a pocket between Manchhar’s bank and the Indus Link. Once water in this pocket attains a level that is above the current level of the Indus, it will be allowed to enter the river through a controlled cut. Currently, Indus was having high flood level Kotri barrage upstream,” Mr Mangi said.
However, all is not well, as the flows from the lake have inundated the employees colony and lounge of Sehwan airport.
At the Aral Wah embankment, the final lifeline of Sehwan city and Bhan Syedabad towns, the water pressure has risen immensely.
The water is affecting villages in UCs Bubak, Arazi, Jaffarabad, Paka Channa and Wahur, while as many as 300 big and small villages in Sehwan taluka have been flooded by water from the Manchhar Lake.
Local MNA Sardar Sikandar Rahpoto told Dawn that the provincial government would try to ensure that Sehwan city was protected, and all out-was taking all efforts at embankments of Sehwan.

3,Power users to pay Rs3 more per unit after adjustment,New quarterly tariff adjustment of Rs3.39 per unit will remain in place from October to December.,"ISLAMABAD: The Nati­onal Electric Power Regu­latory Authority (Nepra) on Tuesday allowed ex-Wapda Distribution Companies (Discos) to charge Rs3.39 per unit to their consumers to mop up Rs95 billion in additional funds under the quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA) mechanism.
At a public hearing presided over by Nepra Chairman Tauseef H. Farooqui and attended by members Rafique Shaikh and Maqsood Anwar Khan, the regulator took up separate requests by 10 Discos seeking a combined additional QTA of Rs3.69 per unit for the fourth quarter (April – June) of fiscal year 2021-22.
The increase was sought on account of capacity charges, transmission char­ges, market operator fee, the impact of transmission and distribution losses on fuel cost adjustments and variable operation and maintenance charges for the fourth quarter, including impact of additional recovery on incremental sales.
The regulator allowed Rs3.39 tariff increase sought by the power companies and decided that this should be implemented with effect from Oct 1 so that an ongoing QTA of Rs3.21 per unit for the third quarter (January – March) comes to an end and is replaced by the new QTA. This would result in delayed recovery for Discos, but the consumer would feel an additional financial burden of just 18 paise per unit. The new QTA of Rs3.39 per unit would remain in place for three months _ from October to December.
The Nepra would formally notify its decision in a couple of days, but said the QTA would be applicable to all consumers of Discos, except those in the lifeline category. The subscribers of Karachi Electric will also be charged the national uniform tariff with application of Discos rate, although the KE’s QTA petition for over Rs14 per unit was cleared last week. It is usually adjusted against tariff differential subsidy provided through the federal budget.
The quarterly adjustment of about Rs95bn included an amount of about Rs55bn under capacity charges and about Rs35bn on account of impact of transmission and distribution losses on monthly FCAs and Rs14bn for use of system charges and market operator fee.
Reduction sought
On the other hand, reduction was sought on account of Rs8.3bn for impact of discounted rate on incremental sales and about Rs1.5bn under variable operation and maintenance cost _ thus a net addition of Rs95bn.
The demand for the highest quarterly adjustment _ Rs19.5bn_ came from Multan Electric Power Company (Mepco), followed by Rs17.8bn from Lahore Electric Supply Company, Rs12.274bn from Peshawar Electric Supply Company and Rs11.6bn from Faisalabad Electric Supply Company.
Gujranwala Electric Power Company’s QTA stood at Rs9.23bn, followed by Islamabad Electric Supply Company with Rs8.7bn, Hyderabad Electric Supply Company Rs5.3bn, Tribal Electric Supply Company Rs3.7bn, Quetta Electric Supply Company Rs3.2bn and Sukkur Electric Supply Company Rs2.99bn.
Under the tariff mechanism, changes in fuel cost are passed on to consumers only on monthly basis through automatic mechanism, while quarterly tariff adjustments on account of variation in power purchase price, capacity charges, variable operation and maintenance costs, use of system charges and including impact of transmission and distribution losses are built in the base tariff by the federal government.

4,Momentum of PTI’s campaign worries PML-N,"Insiders say Maryam being fielded on Nawaz’s orders to hold rallies ahead of by-polls on NA, PA seats.","LAHORE: Faced with the increasing momentum being generated by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) apparently has no choice but to turn to its supreme leader’s daughter and party vice president, Maryam Nawaz, to carry out much-needed canvassing ahead of upcoming polls on six national and provincial seats.
By-elections for the National Assembly’s NA-157 (Multan) seat is scheduled to be held on Sept 11, while for NA-108 (Faisalabad) and NA-118 (Nankana Sahib) on Sept 25. Similarly, the province’s PP-139 (Sheikhupura) and PP-241 (Bahawalnagar) constituencies go to by-polls on Sept 11, while polling in PP-209 (Khanewal) will be held on Oct 2.
After facing a humiliating defeat in the by-polls on 15 Punjab Assembly seats in July that cost the party the office of the chief minister, the PML-N leadership appears much less enthusiastic about spearheading the election campaign in these six constituencies.
The party candidates contesting for five of the six seats are said to be unhappy with the leadership for not holding any ‘grand’ rally led by a top party leader in their constituencies. They are of the view that they need their leadership to back them in order to put up a tough contest for the PTI chief owing to his rising popularity.

Insiders say Maryam being fielded on Nawaz’s orders to hold rallies ahead of by-polls on NA, PA seats

“On the complaint of the candidates, party Quaid Nawaz Sharif has asked his daughter Maryam to hold at least a few rallies ahead of the by-elections on the three NA and as many as Punjab Assembly seats,” a party insider said. Maryam, who led and addressed impressive rallies for the July 17 by-polls on 20 PA seats, has yet to express any interest in the upcoming elections, he said.
“So, on her father’s direction, she is likely to hold some rallies in these constituencies, starting from PP-241 on Thursday,” the insider said, adding former chief minister Hamza Shehbaz, who otherwise would look after several issues the party candidates faced in the by-polls, was keeping a low profile.
Speaking to Dawn, a PML-N leader from Punjab wondered why the party leadership had not shown any seriousness about the by-polls. “The PML-N cannot afford to lose these elections as a defeat will establish that Imran Khan is stronger than the 13-party ruling alliance. Imagine, in such a scenario, who will seek PML-N tickets in Punjab in the next general elections,” he questioned, and urged the leadership to spend all its energies into ensuring a victory.
A source also said the party leadership is apparently banking on Imran’s disqualification from courts in various cases, which it believes will impact other PTI candidates as well. Only that can be a blessing in disguise for the ruling coalition, which otherwise appears least interested in canvassing or enthusiastically contesting the by-polls.
Of the three NA seats up for grabs in Punjab, ousted premier Imran is contesting on the two (Faisalabad and Nankana Sahib) that fell vacant after the acceptance of resignations of PTI MNAs by the National Assembly speaker.
On NA-157 Multan, PTI vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi has fielded his daughter, Meher Bano Qureshi, against the ruling alliance candidate Ali Musa Gilani, a son of Senate opposition leader Yousuf Raza Gilani of the PPP. There are reports that the Gilani family wants Maryam Nawaz to hold a public meeting in this constituency ahead of the Sept 11 by-poll, though the PML-N leader has shown reluctance.
Meanwhile, Maryam continues to lash out at Mr Khan. “Imran’s stance about Pak is conditional. If the Army remains neutral, I will drag it through the mud, if courts do not legalise my crimes, I will blacken their faces, if ECP exposes the theft of foreign funding, I will attack their integrity. The curse has to be dealt with,” the PML-N vice president tweeted on Tuesday.
