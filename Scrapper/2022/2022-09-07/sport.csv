0,Asia Cup: Pakistan look to secure final berth with win over Afghanistan,Pakistan have won both their Twenty20 Internationals against Afghanistan.,"SHARJAH: Riding high on their thrilling victory over India, Pakistan will look to secure a spot in the Asia Cup final with a win over Afghanistan here on Wednesday. 
Pakistan’s triumph over India in their Super Four opener on Sunday avenged their defeat to their arch-rivals in the group stage and another victory over Afghanistan, smarting after their defeat to Sri Lanka, will put Babar Azam’s men in Sunday’s final with a game to spare after Sri Lanka’s win over India on Tuesday. 
Pakistan have won both their Twenty20 Internationals against Afghanistan and are buoyed by the return of pacer Shahnawaz Dahani, who sat out the India match after suffering from a side strain in Pakistan’s victory over Hong Kong in their final group game. 
More importantly, wicket-keeper Mohammad Rizwan — whose 71-run knock was key in the victory over India — is also doing fine after suffering from knee pain during his innings on Sunday.  
Rizwan underwent a precautionary MRI scan on Monday and has been cleared by the team management to keep his place both as an opener as well as behind the wickets. 
“Rizwan and Dahani are fine now,” Babar told reporters during a news conference on Tuesday. “I spoke to Rizwan earlier and he is feeling better.” 
With a full-strength squad to choose from, Pakistan head coach Saqlain Mushtaq is confident his side would be able to maintain their perfect record against Afghanistan. 
“Afghanistan are a good side and they have shown that from time to time, but we are confident to get a hat-trick of victories on Wednesday,” Saqlain told the PCB website. 
“The conditions in Sharjah will be suitable for spinners, but if a batter spends enough time in the middle, there will be a lot of runs on offer in the latter part of the innings with shorter boundaries.” 
Afghanistan, meanwhile, will be looking to regain their early form at the tournament when they beat both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the group stage to reach the Super Four. 
They will look to their spin trio of Rashid Khan, Mujib ur Rahman and captain Mohammad Nabi to disrupt Pakistan’s strong batting line-up on the more helpful Sharjah pitch. 
Victory for Afghanistan would throw the Super Four stage wide open with Pakistan then needing victory over Sri Lanka in their last match while it would also keep defending champions India in the mix. 
And it could well come down to net run rate if Pakistan lose both their last two matches starting Wednesday provided India win against Afghanistan in their last fixture. 
It therefore promises to be a cracker in Sharjah in a make or break match for both sides.

1,Bavuma back to lead SA at T20 World Cup,JOHANNESBURG: Temba Bavuma will captain South Africa at the International Cricket Council’s T20 World Cup in...,"JOHANNESBURG: Temba Bavuma will captain South Africa at the International Cricket Council’s T20 World Cup in Australia in October after recovering from an elbow injury.
Bavuma was injured during a T20 International in India in June and was forced to miss South Africa’s multi-format tour of England which ends next week. He made a return to action during a low-key T20 tournament currently being played in Namibia.
The squad announced by Cricket South Africa selection convener Victor Mpitsang on Tuesday includes explosive batsman Tristan Stubbs, 22, who hit eight sixes in scoring 72 off 28 balls against England in his first international innings in Bristol in July.
“He’s young, he’s exciting and he’s fearless and he plays the brand of cricket that (coach) Mark Boucher wants the team to play,” said Mpitsang.
There was no place, though, for Dewald Brevis, 19, who set a run-scoring record in the Under-19 World Cup in the West Indies in January. Brevis, nicknamed  “Baby AB” for his similarities to retired star AB de Villiers, has been signed up by T20 franchises in India, the Caribbean and South Africa - but has yet to play a first-class or List A match.
Middle order batsman Rassie van der Dussen was a notable omission.
Mpitsang said Van der Dussen needed six weeks to recover from a broken finger suffered in the second Test against England.
Bavuma, 32, was appointed South African white-ball captain in March 2021 — the first black African to lead the country — but critics have pointed out that his batting strike rate of 120.60 is lower than that of other specialist batsmen competing for a place in the starting line-up.
Mpitsang said Bavuma would open the batting at the World Cup and said it was  “difficult” to envisage a situation where Bavuma might not be in the playing eleven.
Mpitsang said the World Cup squad of 15 players as well as three travelling reserves for the global event would play in a three-match T20 series in India, starting on Sept 28. 
Squad: Temba Bavuma (captain), Quinton de Kock, Reeza  Hendricks, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, David  Miller, Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje, Wayne Parnell, Dwaine Pretorius,  Kagiso Rabada, Rilee Rossouw, Tabraiz Shamsi, Tristan Stubbs  Travelling  reserves: Bjorn Fortuin, Marco Jansen, Andile Phehlukwayo  
ODI squad v  India: Bavuma (captain), De Kock, Hendricks, Klaasen, Maharaj, Janneman  Malan, Markram, Miller, Ngidi, Nortje, Parnell, Phehlukwayo, Pretorius,  Rabada, Shamsi.

2,India close to Asia Cup exit after Sri Lanka defeat,DUBAI: Sri Lanka produced an impressive run chase to down India by six wickets on Tuesday and leave their opponents...,"DUBAI: Sri Lanka produced an impressive run chase to down India by six wickets on Tuesday and leave their opponents staring at an early exit from the Asia Cup.
If Pakistan beat Afghanistan on Wednesday, they will face Sri Lanka in Sunday’s final and knock out arch-rivals India in the process.
Half-centuries from openers Pathum Nissanka (52) and Kusal Mendis (57) gave Sri Lanka the perfect start to their chase of 174 in the Super Four game.
India hit back with a flurry of wickets, but Bhanuka Rajapaksa and captain Dasun Shanaka helped Sri Lanka get over the line, with two scrambled byes off the penultimate ball completing the job.
Rajapaksa, who hit 25 not out, and Shanaka, who made 33 not out, put on an unbeaten stand of 64 to leave the hopes of tournament favourites India hanging by a thread, after also losing their Super Four opener to Pakistan.
If Afghanistan do India a favour against Pakistan, Rohit Sharma’s men will still have to beat the Afghans on Thursday to have any chance of reaching the final.
Nissanka started cautiously before he hammered Arshdeep Singh for two fours and a six in an 18-run fifth over.
Mendis joined in the fun and cleared the fence three times, including with a brilliant shot over wide long-off against Ravichandran Ashwin.
Nissanka reached his fifty in 33 balls, but Indian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal broke the partnership and struck twice in one over.
Mendis also completed his fifty but Sri Lanka lost Danushka Gunathilaka for one off Ashwin.
Chahal then trapped Mendis lbw to put Sri Lanka in trouble at 110-4 from 14 overs.
But Rajapaksa and Shanaka dug them out of that hole with some inspired batting, leaving only seven needed from the final over.
With two still to get from two balls, Shanaka played and missed outside off stump, but wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant and bowler Arshdeep both failed with their run out attempts and the match finished on an overthrow.
Earlier, left-arm quick Dilshan Madushanka took 3-24 in India’s 173-8 after Rohit smashed 72 off 41 deliveries.
Rohit put on 97 with Suryakumar Yadav (34) after India lost two early wickets including Virat Kohli for nought.
Kohli, who struck form after an extended batting slump with two successive half-centuries in the tournament, walked back to stunned silence from a sparse crowd dominated by Indian fans.
Rohit hit back with a flurry of boundaries but his departure opened the door for Sri Lanka who took late wickets to keep the score down.
Shanaka and Chamika Karunaratne claimed two wickets each.

3,Nadal hints at extended break after US Open exit,Nadal is expecting his first child with wife Mery Perello later this year.,"NEW YORK: Frances Tiafoe produced one of the biggest upsets at the US Open after stunning 22-times Grand Slam champion Rafa Nadal in the fourth round on Monday while Carlos Alcaraz survived a five-set epic to reach a second successive quarter-final in a tie which finished at 02:23 a.m. Tuesday. 
Four-time champion Nadal lost 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the last-16 and admitted that he was unsure about his return to competitive tennis after Tiafoe not only condemned him to his earliest US Open exit since 2016 but also handed the Spaniard his first Grand Slam loss this year after the he withdrew from his Wimbledon semi-final with an injury. 
It was Nadal’s first tournament at Flushing Meadows since he lifted his fourth US Open title in 2019 and he arrived for the hardcourt major without much match practice and doubts hanging over his fitness. 
“I need to go back,” Nadal said, crediting his 24-year-old opponent for being the better player on the day. “I need to fix things, life, then I don’t know when I [am] going to come back. I [am] going to try to be ready mentally. When I feel that I will be ready to compete again, I will be there.” 
Nadal, who is expecting his first child with wife Mery Perello later this year, is scheduled to turn out for Team Europe during the Sept. 23-25 Laver Cup in London alongside his great rivals Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. 
“Now I have to go home, I have more important things than tennis to attend to,” he said. “Decisions will be made based on how everything goes in my personal life, which comes before my professional life. It’s been a bit difficult for a few months but I want to finish the year with something very important that is my first child.” 
Nadal has endured a rollercoaster year. His two Slam titles have taken him one clear of Novak Djokovic but his physical frailties have also returned to haunt him. 
Nadal suffered a stress fracture of the ribs in March before requiring daily pain-killing injections in his left foot to see him through to a 14th French Open title in June. Then his bid for a third Wimbledon crown was shattered by an abdominal injury. 
His defeat came just a day after world number one and defending champion Daniil Medvedev was knocked out by Nick Kyrgios. 
Tiafoe, 24, will face Andrey Rublev in the quarter-finals after the Russian shrugged off a rain delay to breeze past Cameron Norrie in straight sets. 
“I don’t know what to say, I’m so happy. He’s one of the greatest of all time and I played unbelievable tennis today,” said Tiafoe who had only previously reached one Slam quarter-final in Australia in 2019. 
Alcaraz, last year’s quarter-finalist, remained on course for another memorable run at Flushing Meadows after squeezing past 2014 champion Cilic 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 to set up a showdown against Jannik Sinner. 
Italian 11th seed Sinner also needed five sets to hold off unseeded Belarusian Ilya Ivashka 6-1, 5-7, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 in a gruelling match and reach his third Grand Slam quarter-final this season. 
Earlier, world number one Iga Swiatek recovered from a set and a break down to see off her 108th-ranked German opponent Jule Niemeier 2-6, 6-4, 6-0. 
Swiatek will take on in-form Jessica Pegula for a place in the semi-finals. 
Pegula became the second American woman to reach the last eight after brushing aside twice Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova 6-3, 6-2, before her compatriot Danielle Collins fell 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 to sixth seed Aryna Sabalenka. 
The Belarusian will face 2016 runner-up Karolina Pliskova who downed three-time finalist Victoria Azarenka 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2.

4,Pakistan to return with new identity at SAFF Women’s Championship,Pakistan’s eight-year hiatus from international football will come to an end on Wednesday.,"KARACHI: The wait is finally over.
Pakistan’s eight-year hiatus from international football will come to an end on Wednesday when they clash with India in their SAFF Women’s Championship opener at the Dasarath Stadium in Kathmandu. 
After years of political turmoil in the Pakistan Football Federation, the focus, for now at least, has shifted towards the field as a new crop of players look to define the women’s national side’s identity. 
The Pakistan squad does have eight players, who were part of the team when it last played an international fixture back in 2014, but the side which takes on India will still be a new-look one. 
While Pakistan have trained for just a month to prepare for the event, for assistant coach Walid Javaid Khan, the team is one of the best he has seen. 
“We have had only a month to train but honestly speaking, I’ve seen some of the women’s national teams of the past and I feel like this lot is undoubtedly one of the best squads,” Walid told Dawn from the Nepalese capital.
The squad is dominated by the presence of some promising home-grown players, but it will depend on the experience of captain Maria Khan and Nadia Khan, the only overseas members in the side. 
While midfielder Maria brings in experience of playing in the US and the UAE, forward Nadia is an established pro, who plays for the Doncaster Rovers Belles in the fourth tier of England’s women’s football pyramid. 
The 31-year-old Walid, who led Highlanders WFC to the quarter-finals of the 2021 National Women’s Championship last year, said the Pakistan dressing room was upbeat ahead of the tournament. 
“Everybody is motivated and the morale is very high and it’s the same with the coaches too,” he said. “We are really hopeful for some positive results.” 
Walid said Pakistan’s preference would be to keep the ball and play attacking football, but believed it was important to play according to the opponent. 
“We have few styles that we want to adopt but it’s definitely going to vary from team to team,” he said. “The way we want to play will obviously depend on how our opponents play.  
“Our [preferred] style is to keep the ball down, try to have passes, try to connect and mostly combination plays. You’ll surely see glimpses of our ideas on the field.” 
NEPAL MAKE WINNING START 
The tournament got underway on Tuesday with hosts Nepal opening their Group ‘B’ campaing with a 4-0 drubbing of Bhutan at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu. 
Sabitra Bhandari and Anita Basnet scored twice each as Bhutan’s miserable record of never having won a game at the tournament continued. 
Bhandari opened the scoring in the 12th minute but Nepal had to wait until halfway through the second-half to double their lead with Bhandari’s second. Basnet then scored in the 73rd and 85th to wrap up victory for her side.

CAIRNS: Cameron Green braved cramps to smash a career-best 89 not out and secure Australia’s nervy two-wicket victory against New Zealand in the opening One-day International in Cairns on Tuesday.
Chasing 233 for victory, Australia slumped to 44-5 before Green combined in a 158-run stand with Alex Carey, who made 85, to revive their chase.
The all-rounder smashed 10 fours and a six as Australia clinched the low-scoring contest with five overs to spare to go 1-0 up in the three-match series for the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy.
“It was an amazing effort in his 11th (ODI) game to play a match-winning knock,” Australia skipper Aaron Finch said of 23-year-old Green. 
Earlier, Glenn Maxwell claimed 4-52 to restrict New Zealand to 232-9 after home captain Finch elected to field.
Maxwell took a stunning one-handed catch at backward point to send back Martin Guptill in the fifth over before wreaking havoc with the ball.
Devon Conway (46), skipper Kane Williamson (45) and Tom Latham (43) missed their fifties but at 179-3 after 41 overs, New Zealand looked primed for a late assault.
Maxwell, who had dismissed Williamson just when the batsman was cutting loose, sent back Daryl Mitchell (26) and Latham in the same over and Josh Hazlewood grabbed three late order wickets to keep New Zealand under 250.
Australia found themselves early in a hole after the top half of their batting order was blown away inside 12 overs.
Trent Boult (4-40) trapped Finch lbw for five, prolonging the opener’s run drought which remains a major concern for Australia.
Boult went on to remove Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne in his successive overs before Matt Henry came up with a double strike, which included the wicket of David Warner (20).
Green and Carey dragged the hosts back into the contest with their positive batting and produced a record sixth-wicket partnership for Australia against New Zealand in ODIs.
“It ebbed and flowed. We weren’t able to get that extra breakthrough after they were five down early,” said Williamson as 
New Zealand’s 13-year drought in ODIs against the home team in Australia continued. 
Carey’s 99-ball blitz ended when he pulled Lockie Ferguson to mid-on leaving Australia needing 31 runs from 65 balls with four wickets in hand.
Maxwell and Mitchell Starc departed in successive overs and Green developed cramps and was seen hobbling towards the end of his knock.
Green and Adam Zampa, who made 13 not out, returned after a brief rain interruption and Australia triumphed when Ferguson, bowling the 46th over, sent down a wide delivery.
The second match is scheduled on Thursday.

6,South Africa’s top order challenged to do better in decisive England Test,LONDON: South Africa’s top order batters have to step up and get some big scores if they are to stand a chance of...,"LONDON: South Africa’s top order batters have to step up and get some big scores if they are to stand a chance of winning the three-Test series away against England, emerging batsman Keegan Petersen said on Tuesday.
The two countries are level at 1-1 after the opening two Tests, both of which were won by an innings and concluded inside three days.
They meet at The Oval from Thursday in the final Test of the series.
South African bowlers decimated England in the first Test at Lords but were put the sword in the second at Old Trafford where South Africa failed to score more than 200 runs in either innings.
“I think it’s quite obviously we need to get some hundreds up top, which hasn’t been the case for a while now,” said the 29-year-old Petersen, who made his Test debut last year and bats at number three for his country.
“I think the lower order have saved us a few times but I think it’s quite evident the batters have to step up now and get a couple of big scores. I think it’s all mental, its getting starts but then getting out that is a problem for us.”
There has been only one half century contribution from the top six in South Africa’s batting order in this series.
On the mental approach, Petersen said South Africa had to prepare for a tough challenge.
“At least try to fight through that dark period and that’s where you’re going have to challenge yourself mentally all the time,” he told a news conference at The Oval.
Petersen said he was hoping for a better contest between bat and ball after the first two Tests were dominated by strong bowing displays.
“I hope it pans out to be different because Id love to play for five days, I think that’s what the public wants to see,” he said.
“But I must say this is what we live for as cricketers; series decider, it’s going to be thrilling. There’s a lot on the line for both teams.”

8,"Malik helps CP get  off the mark, Aamer fires for Northern",RAWALPINDI: Veteran all-rounder Shoaib Maik starred with the bat and bagged a crucial wicket to help Central Punjab...,"RAWALPINDI: Veteran all-rounder Shoaib Maik starred with the bat and bagged a crucial wicket to help Central Punjab get off the mark in the ongoing National T20 Cup here at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Tuesday.
The 40-year-old smashed an unbeaten 54 off 33 balls to lift the Qasim Akram-led side to 188-5 before dismissing a dangerous-looking Saim Ayub as Central Punjab beat Sindh by 11 runs.
It was the 67-run partnership for the third wicket between Mohammad Faizan and Tayyab Tahir, though, that set the stage for Malik to fire after Central Punjab were left reeling at 11-2 by the third over after Sohail Khan ousted openers Mohammad Akhlaq and Abdullah Shafique.
Faizan struck four sixes and six fours in his 24-ball knock for 55 while Tayyab — the tournament’s top-scorer so far — added 33 off 28 in the blistering collaboration.
Malik walked in to bat after Sindh leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed broke the partnership, trapping Faizan lbw with Saim taking Tayyab’s wicket soon after.
The former Pakistan skipper was joined by Irfan Khan Niazi as Abrar returned to dismiss Qasim, who could manage only seven runs, with Central Punjab at 124-5 by the start of the 16th over.
Malik and Irfan — who hit four sixes in his 33 off 14 — then combined to plunder the Sindh bowlers for 64 runs in the last 29 balls of the innings.
Sindh might have chased down the total had another ex Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed got support from the other end. His team got off to a flying start but Saim’s wicket in the seventh over made the pursuit of the target challenging with Sindh at 2-62.
Saim’s dismissal followed by that of Saad Khan in the next over before Omair Bin Uousuf (37 off 29) and Danish Aziz depa­rted, leaving Sindh struggling at 122-5.
Sarfraz then made an unbeaten effort of 62 off 37 but the lack of enough contribution from Sindh’s middle-order batters let the team down, giving Central Punjab breathing space after four defeats. 
Later in the day, Aamer Jamal’s brilliance with bat and ball helped Northern edge Southern Punjab by five runs in a thriller.
Aamer hit an unbeaten 47 off 17 (four sixes and five fours) after coming in at number eight, taking Northern to 187-8. The score had notable contributions from skipper Umar Amin (52 off 42) and Mubasir Khan (34 off 18).
The trio’s knocks carried massive importance after they lost two wickets the first two overs before Umar arrived. 
Aamer returned with his medium pace to disrupt a high-flying Southern Punjab, whose cruising approach towards the total was being led by Zain Abbas (81 off 46) before Aamer got him, Sharoon Siraj and Zeeshan Ashraf in a space of just eight deliveries.
While Aamer returned figures of 3-27, the remaining Southern Punjab line-up was dealt with by pacer Zaman Khan (3-38) and Sohail Tanvir (2-39).
Scores in brief: 
CENTRAL PUNJAB 188-5 in 20 overs (Mohammad Faizan 55, Shoaib Malik 54 not out; Abrar Ahmed 2-34, Sohail Khan 2-55); SINDH 177-8 in 20 overs (Sarfaraz Ahmed 62 not out, Omair Bin Yousuf 37; Usama Mir 3-34)
NORTHERN 187-8 in 20 overs (Umar Amin 52, Aamir Jamal 47 not out; Sameen Gul 3-27); SOUTHERN PUNJAB 182 in 19.5 overs (Zain Abbas 81; Aamir Jamal 3-27).

The first recommendation of Longstaff’s 2018 review was for CA to set up an ethics commission to hold administrators, players and staff accountable to the  “ethical foundations for the game as played in Australia”.
CA, in its response to the review, said it supported the recommendation and would appoint an independent ethics commissioner with direct access to the chair and board.
Four years on, CA confirmed Longstaff in the role on Tuesday, saying his  “pivotal involvement” in the review made him an ideal candidate.
“The CA board and our state and territory colleagues are committed to improving governance structures in cricket and the ethics commissioner will provide a vital reference point for issues that impact CA and the game more broadly,” CA chair Lachlan Henderson said in a statement.
“Having led the 2018 review, Dr Longstaff has a detailed understanding of the challenges the game has faced and the progress that has been made in recent times.
“We look forward to working with him for the betterment of cricket.”  
CA has implemented most of the 42 recommendations contained in Longstaff’s 2018 review but the board has drawn criticism over its handling of a number of sensitive issues in recent years, ranging from player misconduct to economic challenges brought by the Covid-19 pandemic.
CA was embroiled in scandal last year after revelations that former test captain Tim Paine was investigated in 2018 for sending sexually explicit messages to a female former Cricket Tasmania staffer.
Former players and pundits were also up in arms over CA’s treatment of former head coach Justin Langer. Langer, who oversaw Australia’s maiden T20 World Cup title in late-2021 and a thumping Ashes series win over the home summer, resigned in acrimony in February after CA declined to offer him a long-term contract extension.

10,Fury offers Joshua ‘Battle of Britain’ heavyweight bout,LONDON: Tyson Fury has offered Anthony Joshua the chance to fight for his WBC crown before the end of the year in a...,"LONDON: Tyson Fury has offered Anthony Joshua the chance to fight for his WBC crown before the end of the year in a blockbuster British heavyweight title fight.
Fury suggested he was retiring from boxing after beating Dillian Whyte in April but is now searching for a high-profile opponent after rival champion Oleksandr Usyk said he does not intend to fight again until 2023.
Joshua suffered a second consecutive defeat to the Ukrainian in Saudi Arabia last month and his promoter, Eddie Hearn, is considering options for a return to the ring for the 32-year-old.
The unbeaten Fury announced he was retiring on his 34th birthday last month, having previously performed a number of U-turns over his future in the sport.
In a video posted on social media on Monday he appeared to confirm he had reversed his decision again.
“You’ve all heard that I’m going to be fighting within the next few months, and before I announce an opponent I need to do this just in case,” said Fury.
“Anthony Joshua, I know you’ve just lost a fight to Usyk, and I know you’re belt-less at the moment, and I’d like to give you an opportunity to fight me for the WBC heavyweight championship of the world and the lineal championship in the next few months. If you’re interested I’ll send you the date over and we can rumble — a battle of Britain for the WBC heavyweight championship of the world. 
Joshua responded on Twitter by telling Fury to contact his management team. “I don’t do the online discussions just for clout,” wrote Joshua, before adding:  “I’ll be ready in December.”

Dane Hojlund, 19, has been compared to Manchester City star Erling Haaland and began to repay the 17 million euro fee paid to Sturm Graz late last month by netting 56 minutes into his first start from Ademola Lookman’s low cross.
Nigeria International Lookman then forced in the away side’s second via a big deflection off Marlon Santos eight minutes later to put Gian Piero Gasperini’s side, who had been top at the start of this round of matches, on 13 points.
They are on their own at the summit for the first time since 1964 thanks to Roma being thrashed 4-0 by Udinese on Sunday night.
Unbeaten Atalanta lead Napoli and champions AC Milan and do not have any European football on their schedule after finishing eighth last season.
Monza have had a dismal start to their first ever Serie A season despite a summer spending spree and remain on zero points after their first five games in Italy’s top flight.
Torino are three points behind Atalanta thanks to Nikola Vlasic’s strike which earned them a 1-0 home win over promoted Lecce.
Vlasic netted the winner in the 40th minute to move Torino a point above their local rivals Juventus.
Salernitana, who escaped relegation thanks to a miracle run at the end of last season, are 10th after their 2-2 draw with Empoli.

13,Two officials at Tokyo 2020 sponsor arrested in widening bribery probe,TOKYO: Japanese prosecutors arrested two officials at a sponsor of the Tokyo Olympics on Tuesday as part of a...,"TOKYO: Japanese prosecutors arrested two officials at a sponsor of the Tokyo Olympics on Tuesday as part of a widening bribery investigation that media said involved a former member of the Tokyo 2020 board.
The Nikkei newspaper reported that the publisher Kadokawa Corp paid 70 million yen ($498,000) to a company linked to the then Tokyo 2020 board member Haruyuki Takahashi, who prosecutors suspect helped the company become a sponsor of the Tokyo Olympics.
Kadokawa confirmed that prosecutors had arrested two officials at the company and raided its office on Tuesday over bribery allegations.
“The company will continue to fully cooperate with the authorities’ investigations,” it said in a statement.
It declined to comment on details of the matter because of the investigation.
Shares in Kadokawa ended the day 5.42 per cent lower.
Takahashi is already in custody after being arrested last month on suspicion of bribery surrounding the Games. Media reported that prosecutors decided to re-arrest Takahashi, meaning he is facing longer detention so prosecutors can question him further.
Another Tokyo Olympics sponsor, Aoki Holdings, said on Tuesday that prosecutors had indicted two former executives and an executive on bribery charges.
They were arrested last month along with Takahashi, following reports that he received bribes from Aoki, a clothing retailer.
The former chairman of Aoki, Hironori Aoki, told prosecutors he gave cash to the head of the Games’ organising committee, former prime minister Yoshiro Mori, the Sankei daily reported last week.
Reuters has not able to contact Aoki for comment. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office declined to comment.
Reuters was not able to reach Mori or his legal representative for comment. Mori denied receiving the cash to the Sankei, the newspaper reported.
Reuters reported in 2020 that Takahashi, who was paid millions of dollars to work on Tokyo’s successful bid for the Olympics, said he played a key role in securing the support of a former Olympics powerbroker who was later suspected by French prosecutors of taking bribes to help Japan’s bid.
Takahashi told Reuters at that time his work included lobbying International Olympic Committee member Lamine Diack, to whom he gave gifts, including digital cameras and a Seiko watch. He said then that there was nothing improper with the payments he received or with the way he used the money.
Diack, once one of the most powerful people in athletics, was jailed in France in 2020 for corruption. He died last year at the age of 88.
