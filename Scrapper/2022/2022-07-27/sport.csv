0,India’s javelin champion Chopra out of Commonwealth Games,"Chopra was the reigning champion at the Games, which start on Thursday.","NEW DELHI: India’s Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra will not defend his Commonwealth Games javelin title in Birmingham due to injury, the country’s Olympic association said on Tuesday, two days ahead of the opening ceremony. 
Chopra, 24, picked up the injury during the World Athletics Championships in Oregon, where he won silver at the weekend. 
The Indian Olympic Association did not say what the injury was but after coming second behind Grenada’s Anderson Peters he complained about  “discomfort” in his thigh. 
Chopra was the reigning champion at the Commonwealth Games, which start on Thursday. 
“Chopra had called me earlier today from the US to convey his inability to take part in the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games owing to fitness concerns,” Indian Olympic Association secretary general Rajeev Mehta said in a statement. “[He] had an MRI scan done on Monday and, based on it, he has been advised a month’s rest by his medical team.” 
Chopra made history for his country when he won the javelin at last summer’s Tokyo Games, becoming India’s first Olympic athletics gold medallist. 
Chopra, who hails from the northern Indian state of Haryana, won the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games gold in 2018 and had been chosen as India’s flag-bearer for Thursday’s opening ceremony of the July 28-Aug. 8 Commonwealth Games. 
“Neeraj has said that since he is not 100 percent fit to compete at the Commonwealth Games, he would not be the flag-bearer of the Indian contingent at the athletes’ parade in the opening ceremony,” Athletics Federation of India president Adille Sumariwalla said in a statement. 
Chopra had been in top form this season until the injury struck. He broke his own national record at the Diamond League in Stockholm in June as he registered a personal best throw of 89.94m. 
India, the Commonwealth’s most populous country, is not generally known as a sporting powerhouse — except for cricket — but it has regularly performed well at the Games. 
Its athletes came third in the medals table behind hosts Australia, and England, at the Gold Coast and were in the top five at the previous four.

2,Pakistani players to feature in ‘professional’ baseball league,LAHORE: The inaugural season of the United International Baseball League will feature at least four Pakistani...,"LAHORE: The inaugural season of the United International Baseball League will feature at least four Pakistani players, the country’s baseball federation chief Fakhar Ali Shah said Tuesday.
The tournament, which is set to kick off in Dubai in February next year, was launched to provide professional league opportunities for players based in the subcontinent and the United Arab Emirates. 
“Pakistani players would earn a handsome amount of money as the league would be held on professional lines,” Fakhar told Dawn. 
“Our coaches will also be hired to perform duties in the league.”
Fakhar said he met UIBL founder Kanwal S. Sra in New York earlier this month, where it was decided that Pakistani players will participate in the league.
The Pakistan Federation Baseball president said the idea behind the UIBL was to unearth talented players in a region where cricket is the most popularly followed sport.
“The game of baseball has similarity in some of the departments like the pitching and throwing, so good baseball players would be developed through this league,” said Fakhar.
Hall of Fame Baseball players Mariano Rivera and Barry Larkin have also joined the UIBL and were also present in the launching ceremony.
According to the agreement with the PFB, the UIBL would also help Pakistan to promote the game in the country, said Fakhar.

Playing in extremely windy conditions in Oregon, Omar bounced back from a shaky start to finish his first round with a birdie on the par-5 18th on Tuesday. He is just one shot behind the projected cut after two rounds of stroke play event.
Omar’s compatriot Yashal Shah carded 75 at the par-71 Bandon Trails and remained with an outside chance of qualifying for the match play rounds.
A total of 264 top-ranked junior players from all over the world are featuring in the championship. The top 64 will qualify for the four-day match-play rounds of the championship. The winner of the championship will earn an exemption into the 2023 US Open to be played at the Los Angeles Cou­ntry Club. He will also earn an exemption into the next two US Amateurs.

For the 27-year-old Australian, who two weeks ago fell to Novak Djokovic in his first Grand Slam singles final, this will mark his sixth appearance in Cincinnati and first since 2019.
The entry list for the Aug. 13-21 Western & Southern Open includes world number one Daniil Medvedev and former champions Alexander Zverev (2021) — who missed Wimbledon with injury — Grigor Dimitrov (2017), Marin Cilic (2016) and Rafa Nadal (2013).
Twice champion Novak Djokovic is also on the Cinci­nn­ati entry list but is unlikely to play due to his refusal to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Travellers seeking to enter the US have to provide proof of vaccination.

5,"Rafiq ‘incredibly proud’ of Majid, Qasim for speaking up on racism",LONDON: Azeem Rafiq said he was  “incredibly proud” of former Scotland cricketers Majid Haq and Qasim Sheikh for...,"LONDON: Azeem Rafiq said he was  “incredibly proud” of former Scotland cricketers Majid Haq and Qasim Sheikh for speaking out about the racist abuse they had suffered in their careers, which led to a damning review into Cricket Scotland.
The review, which was backed by SportScotland, was published on Monday and said the governance and leadership practices of Cricket Scotland were  “institutionally racist”.
It was commissioned after Haq and Sheikh spoke out about the abuse they had suffered, with both players saying they were treated differently due to the colour of their skin.
Rafiq, whose allegations of institutional racism at Yorkshire rocked English cricket last year, stressed the importance of reaching out to individuals who had suffered abuse before moving forward.
“I’m just incredibly proud of them and everyone else that played a part in the review,” Rafiq told Sky Sports on Monday.  “I hope today gives them some sense of closure and that they’ve been fully vindicated.”
“There’s a lot of people that have suffered a lot of abuse over a lot of years,” Rafiq said.
“There’s got to be an attempt to build those bridges back, speak to them, re-engage them, apologise. Once that is done, and only then, it’s important to look to the future - and how we do that.”  
After Rafiq spoke about the discrimination he faced while at Yorkshire, the British government backed calls to limit public funding for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) unless they were able to demonstrate progress in getting rid of racism.
However, Rafiq said cutting Cricket Scotland’s funding was not necessary at this stage.
“If there’s an acceptance and an apology, then they need to be supported to make sure the change comes, and comes quicker,” Rafiq said.
“If things don’t change and if there’s a resistance to change, then I think at that point SportScotland need to come down a lot harsher.”

6,Haseeb shifts focus to sprints in the pool for CWG,KARACHI: Haseeb Tariq is focusing on just the shortest distance of the long course this time. At the last edition...,"KARACHI: Haseeb Tariq is focusing on just the shortest distance of the long course this time. 
At the last edition of the Commonwealth Games in Australia, the 26-year-old was the only swimmer from Pakis­tan to advance from his heat in the 50 metres backstroke. 
Haseeb couldn’t advance to the final but at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games, which open on Thursday, he’s aiming to do better as he takes part in three 50m events — the butterfly, backstroke and freestyle.  
“I’m focused on the sprint aspect this year having competed in the 100 free at the Tokyo Olympics last year,” Haseeb told Dawn during a telephone interview from Birmingham on Tuesday. “The aim is to improve on power and speed and my times in the 50m. That will naturally help me over the longer distance.” 
Haseeb will compete in the 50m fly heats on the first day of the competition at the Games on Friday with the heats in backstroke and the freestyle to follow on July 31 and Aug 2.  
“The aim is to at least reach the semi-finals in each of the events and then we will take it from there,” said Haseeb, who holds multiple national records in the sport. “And of course I’ll try to improve my previous marks.” 
Haseeb began competitive swimming at the age of 14 and his success at the 2012 National Games thrust him into the national fold. 
Moving to Canada at the age of 17, he’s been able to gain access to better coaching and facilities unlike swimmers who are based in Pakistan.  “In Pakistan, swimming is largely considered a seasonal sport while it’s a year-round sport globally,” he said about the local mindset. “Coaches in Pakistan don’t have the technical knowledge of what needs to be done.  
“The only obsession is with power and speed and nothing is done to improve technique. Swimming is a passion-driven sport. It requires hours in the pool, work in the gym. It drains you. But if you have that passion, you keep going.” 
Haseeb isn’t stopping. The 2024 Paris Olympics are in his sights as well as next year’s World Championships in Japan. But that could see him missing out on the Asian Games, which were postponed this year.  
“The Worlds [in Japan] are the most important for me looking ahead to next year,” Haseeb informed, looking back to the exposure he got at the 2019 edition in South Korea where he got the opportunity to rub shoulders with the global swimming elite, including the man he idolises — American star Caeleb Dressel.  
“It was an experience unlike anything. Competing against the best in the world helps you learn further technicalities of the sport … how you maintain stroke rate and heart rate and about warm-ups and activation.” 
Potentially missing out on the Asian Games doesn’t concern Haseeb and he doesn’t believe there is a bigger chance of Pakistan winning its maiden swimming medal in any multi-sport event when the Games open in China next year.  
“The swimming disparity between Asia and the rest of the world doesn’t exist anymore,” Haseeb said. “Swimmers from Japan and China are right up there with the best in the world. So as far as competition is concerned, it’s the same.” 
As far as immediate competition is concerned, Haseeb believes the Commonwealth Games will set the tone for his road to Paris qualification. “There is going to be a lot of depth as far as competition is concerned,” he said. “Australia and England are the traditional swimming powerhouses at the Commonwealths and they will come with their best swimmers but I’ll try to give my best.”

7,Karunaratne bats through pain to take Sri Lanka’s lead past 300,The hosts reached 176-5 when bad light stopped play early on day three.,"GALLE: Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne batted through back pain to help the hosts stretch their overall lead to 323 runs and boost their chances of a series-levelling victory in the second Test after key strikes by Pakistan’s bowlers on Tuesday. 
The hosts reached 176-5 when bad light stopped play early on day three, with stumps called in Galle after more than half an hour’s wait for conditions to improve. 
The left-handed Karunaratne, on 27, and Dhananjaya de Silva, on 30, were batting in an unbeaten stand of 59. 
“The wicket is a bit slower than the first couple of days,” off-spinner Ramesh Mendis, who claimed five wickets to help bowl out Pakistan for 231 in the opening session, told reporters. “We need to bat as deep as possible and get maximum runs possible. This is a good batting wicket.” 
Ramesh said the hosts would likely be safe with a lead of 400 and believes the captain and coach Chris Silverwood will decide on a possible declaration if they keep batting. “We would be happy with a lead of 400 runs,” Mendis said. 
Pakistan’s highest chase in Sri Lanka came in 2015 when they made a target of 377 in Pallekele, and the tourists chased down a Galle record of 342 in the series opener. 
Having conceded a lead of 147, Pakistan claimed four wickets in the second session but the stand between Karunaratne and de Silva put Sri Lanka in a strong position. 
Sri Lanka, having decided Karunaratne would bat only if required, sent Niroshan Dickwella into open with Oshada Fernando. 
The stop-gap arrangement did not really work and fast bowler Naseem Shah had Dickwella caught behind for 15 when he chased a wide delivery without any feet movement. 
Yasir Shah struck with his first ball to dismiss Oshada (19) and was denied a second wicket when Babar Azam dropped a catch, his third spill of the match, to reprieve Kusal Mendis. 
Kusal (15) could not capitalise on it, though, and Karunaratne walked out to bat after Angelo Mathews departed for 35. 
Off-spinner Agha Salman got Mathews out for his maiden Test wicket after Pakistan reviewed the umpire’s call, with ultra-edge technology confirming a spike when the ball passed the bat and into the hands of slip. 
Mathews walked back shaking his head after failing to capitalise on another good start in his 100th Test, after he made 42 in the first innings, having attempted to rebuild the innings with Dinesh Chandimal. 
The in-form Chandimal, with scores of 206 not out, 76, 94 not out and 80 in his last four innings, looked good on 21 but fell caught behind off Naseem soon after tea. 
Sri Lanka were in trouble at 117-5 but Karunaratne, who stayed off the field during Pakistan’s innings, and De Silva got down to the grind and looked largely untroubled. 
De Silva took on the opposition bowlers and hit six boundaries with Karunaratne happy to play anchor. The skipper got help from the physio in between his knock. 
Karunaratne rotated the strike and also hit two boundaries including a reverse sweep for four off leg-spinner Yasir. 
Naseem, who has taken five wickets in the match so far, said Pakistan would be comfortable with a big run chase. 
“They have a lead of about 320 and we will try to restrict them and get a target of around 350-360,” said Naseem. “Bowl them out soon tomorrow and stay positive in the chase. It doesn’t look that it will turn big on day four and five, but you never know.” 
Earlier, Mendis claimed 5-47, his third five-wicket haul in Tests, as Sri Lanka bowled out Pakistan after the tourists resumed the day on 191-7. 
Yasir and Hasan Ali batted resolutely to deny Sri Lanka any breakthrough in the first hour. 
Once Prabath Jayasuriya (3-80) removed Hasan, however, Sri Lanka did not take long to polish off the Pakistan tail as Mendis sent back Nauman Ali and trapped overnight batsman Yasir lbw.  Yasir faced 97 balls for his 26 and was the last man out. 
Mendis was almost dropped after his poor performance in the opener. 
“I was disappointed with the effort in the first test. I knew Prabath Jayasuriya is bowling so well and I needed to support him by building pressure and by sending down dot balls,” Mendis said. “That worked and [I’m] happy to end with five wickets in the innings.”

8,Police raid home of Tokyo 2020 executive over corruption allegations,A sports consulting firm run by Takahashi is suspected of receiving money from Aoki for a contract signed in 2017.,"TOKYO: Japanese police on Tuesday raided the home of a 2020 Tokyo Olympics board member who allegedly received money from a sponsor he signed a consulting contract with, local media reported.
Haruyuki Takahashi, 78, is suspected of receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from high street business suit retailer Aoki Holdings Inc., an “official partner” of last year’s pandemic-delayed mega-event.
Kyodo news agency reported that could constitute bribery, as Takahashi was considered a quasi-civil servant who was not permitted to accept money or gifts related to his position.
The Tokyo prosecutors’ office said it could not comment on individual cases.
A sports consulting firm run by Takahashi is suspected of receiving money from Aoki for a contract signed in 2017, according to local media.
Aoki in October 2018 became a Tokyo Games sponsor, allowing it to use the event’s logo and sell officially licenced products. Takahashi told the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper last week that the money his company received was for consultancy work.
Aoki issued a statement last week saying it had no comment on reports of the payments. The Tokyo Olympics organising committee disbanded last month.

WADA said the deal, which was signed at the CGF General Assembly in Birmingham ahead of the July 28-Aug 8 Commonwealth Games, was to facilitate joint activities within member nations and to strengthen its anti-doping programme.
“WADA recognises the importance of partnerships in the pursuit of clean sport,” WADA chief Witold Banka said.
“The global anti-doping system relies on collaboration... and this MoU between WADA and the Commonwealth Games Federation will boost the anti-doping work already being carried out within the federation’s member countries.”
CGF president Louise Martin said her organisation had  “zero tolerance” when it comes to doping in sport.
“The agreement is further affirmation of our commitment to clean sport, which is critical to achieving integrity and fairness in sport,” Martin said.
“In collaboration with WADA, the CGF seeks to maintain the integrity of the Commonwealth Games by 
running a comprehensive anti-doping program that focuses equally on education and prevention as well as testing.”

10,Most Qatar World Cup teams to be based inside 10km radius,FIFA said 24 of the 32 teams are based within a short drive of each other close to the capital Doha.,"DOHA: Three quarters of the teams at the World Cup finals in Qatar will be based within a 10km radius of each other, FIFA said on Tuesday, announcing the hotels and training venues for the 32 national sides.  
Unlike in previous tournaments, all teams will stay in the same hotel and use the same training base throughout the tournament — even carrying out their sessions the day before matches at their camps rather than the stadiums.  
FIFA said 24 of the 32 teams are based within a short drive of each other close to the capital Doha.  
“Players will have more time to train and rest during the competition, while being able to experience the excitement that will take over the country at much closer quarters, as fellow players and passionate fans from all 32 nations will be gathering in a single area,” said Colin Smith, FIFA’s Chief Operating Officer World Cup.  
The tournament starts on Nov. 21 and runs until the final on Dec. 18 and is played at eight venues.  
Teams will check in to their hotels and training camps at least five days before their first match.  
FIFA said the accommodation “range from four- and five-star hotels to villas, resorts and non-hotel accommodation, including sports academy residences and school/university housing” 
The layout is the opposite to that used in Russia four years ago, when teams were spread out across the European part of the country with some bases more than 1,300 miles (2,100 kilometers) apart and a heavy reliance on air travel to get to games. 
Defending champions France will be at the Al Messila, a resort near Doha that boasts of its “private palace setting”. Villas can cost more than $2,500 a night.  
Germany will be in the Zulal overlooking the Gulf that bills itself as the biggest wellness resort in the Middle East. Owned by Qatar’s ruling family, the resort’s royal suite costs more than $10,000 a night.  
Manuel Neuer and his team-mates will be the furthest from Doha, a 100-kilometre (62-mile) drive to the capital. The resort advocates “traditional Arabic and Islamic medicine”.  
Zulal general manager Daniele Vastolo said a lot of the teams had visited the resort because it allowed them to be “in a bubble” away from Doha’s crowds.  
He added that security would also be easier as there is only one entrance.  
“There will be no fans coming here bothering the guests or team to ask for photographs and autographs. So I think here they can really be isolated. “But at the same time if they have one day that they look for distractions, they can drive to Doha.”  
Fans will get easier access to the Al Shamal Stadium nearby, the German training ground, which is styled on a fortress.  
Belgium have chosen the Hilton Salwa on the opposite coast with its own private beach, a private water theme park, with slides and cliff jumps, and villas costing up to $7,000 a night.  
It is a favoured weekend destination for rich families in the Gulf state that has one of the world’s highest per capita incomes.  
England are in the Souq Al Wakra hotel, where authorities plan to close off a section of the nearby public beach for Harry Kane and the rest of the squad.  
Brazil have chosen the city centre Westin near a main road, while the United States will be in the main district for expatriate residents.  
Lionel Messi’s Argentina and former champions Spain have opted for “luxury” lodgings at Qatar University from where they can walk to their training ground.  
More than one million fans are expected to visit Qatar for the tournament. Some will be in $2,000 a night hotels but many are expected to stay in cheaper portable cabins and desert camps.

The 37-year-old, who missed the club’s pre-season tour to Thailand and Australia for personal reasons, wants to leave the club he rejoined last year.
He arrived at United’s Carrington training base with his agent Jorge Mendes. Former United manager Alex Ferguson was also seen arriving.
New United manager Ten Hag said earlier this month that Ronaldo was  “not for sale”.
“We are planning for Cristiano Ronaldo for the season and that’s it and I’m looking forward to working with him,” he said.
“I have read it, but what I say is Cristiano is not for sale, he is in our plans and we want success together.” 
The former Real Madrid and Juventus player finished as United’s top-scorer last season with 24 goals.
But the campaign was a huge disappointment for the club, who finished sixth in the Premier League, missing out on Champions League qualification.
United start their Premier League campaign at home to Brighton on Aug 7 after final pre-season games this weekend against Atletico Madrid in Norway and Rayo Vallecano at Old Trafford.

While the second XI white ball tournaments — the T20 Cricket Associations Cup and the one-day Cricket Asso­ciations Challenge — will see their number of matches doubled as compared to last season, the Cricket Associ­ations Championship matches will be four-day affairs. 
In previous seasons, the Championship matches were played across three days and the tournament was held on a single round-robin basis. This year, the second-string teams will come up against each other twice during the tournament, which will feature 30 matches as compared to half as many last year.
“This means each player will get a minimum of 10 matches across all three formats, which provides a good enough opportunity for any player to show his mettle and talent, and stake his claim in the first XI competitions,” PCB’s Director of High Performance Nadeem Khan said.
The domestic season kicks off with the National T20 Cup, which will feature 33 matches played across two legs in Rawalpindi and Multan on August 20 and will run until September 19. The second XI Cup will be played in Quetta from September 2-15.
Following the T20 blitz, the players will shift gears to the first-class format with the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, beginning September 27. The 31 matches of PCB’s premier first-class tournament, which ends November 30, will be hosted by Abbotabad, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Karachi.
The second XI Championship will be played alongside the Trophy at the same centres, ending a week earlier.
The one-day format Pakistan Cup and the second XI Challenge will be played in Karachi in December and will mark the end of the upcoming domestic season before several U-19 tournaments are held across the country.
Schedule:
Aug 30-Sept 19: National T20 Cup (Rawalpindi and Multan)

13,Macron seeks to calm concerns over 2024 Paris Olympics,PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron met senior ministers on Monday to calm concerns that preparations for the...,"PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron met senior ministers on Monday to calm concerns that preparations for the Paris 2024 Olympics are beset by security and budget worries, almost two years to the day before the sporting extravaganza opens.
The Olympics should be a centrepiece of the freshly re-elected Macron’s second term, projecting an image of a France comfortable in its modern identity and open to the world.
But as the opening ceremony on July 26, 2024 draws closer, concerns have grown over costs and security preparations.
France’s reputation as a reliable host of sporting events took a major battering following the chaos that marred the Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid in Paris on May 28, which critics blamed on heavy-handed policing.
A particular subject of anxiety is the ambitious vision — in a typical Macron flourish — of an opening ceremony which will not take place as is customary in the athletics stadium, but as a flotilla down the River Seine.
The meeting at the Elysee Palace included key ministers such as Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin and Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera — as well as the head of the Paris organising committee, the three-time Olympic slalom canoe champion Tony Estanguet.
“We are two years to the day from the start of the Games. Now it’s really a race against the clock,” Macron said in an interview with L’Equipe sports daily published on Tuesday.
The Olympics organising committee COJO has a budget of four billion euros ($4.1 billion), as does its partner organisation SOLIDEO, which is charged with building the peripheral infrastructure.
But rising inflation means savings have to be made and so far not enough sponsors have been found to plug the gaps.
“Everything is very tight concerning the budget,” said a source close to the issue who asked not to be named, adding the extent of the challenge would be clear in the autumn.
An Elysee official said a  “dialogue had now started” with the International Olympic Committee over where savings can be made.
“I reaffirmed a simple principle: there will be no Olympics tax. The Games must finance the Games,” Macron insisted in his L’Equipe interview.
Macron also met International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach after the gathering, the Elysee said.
Organisers also revealed their official slogan —  “Games Wide Open” — and said 13 million tickets will be sold for the Olympics and Paralympics, with nearly half of those reserved for the public set to be sold at less than 50 euros ($51).
The state  “will buy 400,000 tickets which it will distribute to young people and schoolchildren, especially those under 16,” Macron told L’Equipe.
Security is another headache, especially as the vision of the Games is to hold many events in the centre of Paris. This includes events around the Eiffel Tower and the central Place de la Concorde, which is close to the Elysee Palace.
In addition to the French security forces, more than 20,000 private security agents need to be hired.
Estanguet insisted that Macron had been preparing  “from the first day”.
But he acknowledged:  “In recent months, the situation distanced him a bit away from the Games project, so he wanted to reconnect with the different subjects,” he said.
France’s top audit body, the Cour des Comptes, has warned in a report that it is  “imperative” to ramp up preparations to deal with the  “considerable” security challenge.
“A more precise definition of security needs is becoming urgent,” said the report, the initial version of a study that will be published later this year.
The report also suggests scaling down the opening ceremony, which is set to feature an armada of 200 boats and some 600,000 spectators.
The Le Monde daily said the prospect of the river opening ceremony — with spectators packed on the banks of the Seine — was giving the organisers  “cold sweats”.
The Games will pose a unique challenge. The showcase athletics and swimming events are due to be held in Seine-Saint-Denis north of Paris, one of the lowest-income areas in France, with a cluster of events in the centre of the capital.
Sailing events will take place at the other end of the country in the Mediterranean city of Marseille, while the surfing will be in the Pacific territory of French Polynesia, on the other side of the world.
