ISLAMABAD: In a decision that was awaited with bated breath by political observers, the media and all the parties involved, the Supreme Court late on Tuesday declared Chaudhry Parvez Elahi as the duly elected chief minister of Punjab for securing 186 votes against the 179 of his opponent, PML-N’s Hamza Shehbaz, in the July 22 run-off poll for the coveted office of the province.
Later, in the small hours of Wednesday morning, President Dr Arif Alvi administered the oath to CM-designate Elahi at Aiwan-i-Sadr in Islamabad. Mr Elahi had to rush from Lahore to the federal capital after Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman refused to carry out the job.

Earlier when the short order was pronounced by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, Moonis Elahi, a son of the petitioner Parvez Elahi, was surrounded by PTI and PML-Q supporters and lawyers in courtroom No 1 to congratulate him. PTI senior leaders, including Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Asad Umar, Fawad Chaudhry, also accompanied former minister Moonis.
The CJP-led three-judge bench, also comprising Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar, announced the judgement in the absence of counsel for the respondent ruling coalition parties, who had during the proceedings earlier in the day informed the court that on the instructions of their clients, they were boycotting the hearing. Their clients intended to move a review petition against the court’s Monday decision of declining their request for a full court to hear Mr Elahi’s petition against the rejection of 10 votes of PML-Q lawmakers polled in his favour during the CM’s election in the Punjab Assembly on July 22.
Soon after the verdict was announced, a jubilant crowd carrying PTI flags present outside the Supreme Court on the Constitution Avenue as well as a number of supporters on the premises burst into cheers and sloganeering. Despite a heavy police contingent blocking the roads leading to the apex court building, a large number of supporters managed to reach the venue, and those who could not make it started celebrating at different police pickets on the way.
Announced around 9pm on Tuesday, the short order also set aside the July 22 ruling of Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Dost Mohammad Mazari and declared it void, without lawful authority and of no legal effect. Earlier, the hearing had commenced at 11:30am and continued until 9:15pm with two breaks.
Authored by the CJP, the short order also ordered the Punjab chief secretary to immediately issue the requisite notification declaring the petitioner as the duly elected CM. It added that Hamza Shehbaz was not a duly elected CM, the oath of office administered to him was without lawful authority and of no legal effect.
Moreover, all acts, deeds and things attendant and consequent upon the oath, including but not limited to the notification of Hamza and the formation and swearing-in of the cabinet on his advice, was also declared to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect.
Similarly, all advisers, special advisers and special assistants appointed under the orders or advice of Hamza would immediately cease to hold office, their appointment declared illegal and without lawful authority and the ministers appointed on his advice were relieved of their offices/posts with immediate effect, the 11-page order stated.
The Supreme Court also directed Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman to administer the oath of office to Parvez Elahi in accordance with law and Constitution not later than 11:30pm on Tuesday. And in case the governor was unable or unwilling to do so, President Alvi could carry out the job. The order added that all acts, deeds and things lawfully done or purported to be done by Hamza, or any member of the provincial cabinet, in accordance with the Constitution and law had been saved and protected under the de facto doctrine, subject to all just and legal exceptions and such review, modification, reversal or withdrawal as may be deemed appropriate by the incoming chief minister and any member of the cabinet or other officer appointed by him.
The short order also mentioned that the sole question of public importance with reference to enforcement of fundamental rights involved in the petition was whether the understanding and implementation of the SC’s May 17 short judgement in the presidential reference read with Article 63A(1)(b) was correct.
“We find that the understanding and implementation of the said short judgement as well as the provisions of Article 63A(1)(b) of the Constitution by the Punjab Assembly deputy speaker was patently incorrect and erroneous and cannot be sustained. Thus, the governance of the Punjab in accordance with the Constitution was subverted whereby the fundamental rights of the people have been seriously infringed,” it added.
The court office was also asked to communicate/transmit a copy of the short order to the Punjab governor, assembly deputy speaker as well as chief secretary for implementation and compliance. It also mentioned the objection raised by the ruling parties’ counsel to hearing of the petition by the three-judge bench, and sought referral to the full court, which the bench had declined on Monday.
The respondents’ counsel also laid out their case on the merits of the dispute, which essentially concerned a question of law touching the formation of the provincial government allegedly in violation of the provisions of the Constitution, in particular Article 63A read with Article 130(4), the short order stated.
Although elaborate submissions were made on Monday, the respondents’ counsel requested for further time to make additional submissions and seek instructions, it added.
During the hearing, Parvez Elahi was represented by Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, Imtiaz Rashid Siddiqui and Faisal Fareed etc. Whereas Irfan Qadir appeared on behalf of the deputy speaker, Mansoor Usman Awan represented Hamza Shehbaz, Farooq H Naek PPPP and Salahuddin Ahmed Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain.

1,"Ruling coalition rejects, PTI hails apex court verdict","Imran to observe ""thanksgiving day"" today; PDM chief Fazl calls meeting of ruling alliance tomorrow to discuss verdict.","ISLAMABAD: While the ruling coalition rejected the Supreme Court’s verdict on Punjab chief minister’s election and called it a day of “start of another phase of independence of judiciary”, the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) termed the decision “supremacy of the Constitution” and decided to observe ‘thanksgiving day’ on Wednesday (today). 
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leaders said on Tuesday that the formation of a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial to hear the case was evident of the fact that the apex court’s verdict would become controversial. 
PML-N supremo and self-exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif expressed disappointment over the verdict and said in a tweet: “The country has turned into a theatre — salute to three judges.” 

 





 
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the SC verdict had given a shock to the hopes of people, legal fraternity, petitioners and media for justice. In a tweet after the verdict, he said it was a demand of the reputation of the judiciary and justice that a full court should have been formed. “With the formation of the full court bench, justice would have not only to be done but it would have appeared to be done.” 

 





 

Nawaz says country has turned into a ‘theatre — salute to three judges’; Imran announces ‘thanksgiving day’ today

Terming the SC decision “judicial murder of democracy”, Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman called a meeting of the ruling alliance on Thursday (tomorrow) to discuss the verdict.  
In a statement, he said they had neither accepted any military dictatorship nor would accept “judicial martial law”.
At a press conference, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the rejection of government’s plea to form a full court had already made controversial the verdict of the apex court. “The second phase of a campaign regarding independence of judiciary has started that was first launched by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif,” she added. 
Just after the apex court announced its verdict, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz tweeted: “JUDICIAL COUP”. 

 





 
In another tweet, she said: “Murder of justice unacceptable!” A graphic image in the tweet says: “A public question! Why are there two different verdicts in similar cases? Nizam-e-Tehreek-i-Insaf Namanzoor (the system of Tehreek-i-Insaf is unacceptable).” 

 





 
Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety and central information secretary of the PPP Shazia Atta Marri termed the verdict of the apex court “very disappointing” and “regrettable”. 
In a statement, she said the court had announced the same decision at the night about which the PTI leaders had been talking since morning. “Courts make decisions according to the law and justice, but not according to conscience. The judiciary is writing a new constitution,” she added. 
She regretted that the supremacy and powers of parliament were being attacked. 
On the other hand, PTI chairman Imran Khan appreciated the three-judge SC bench for “upholding the Constitution and law against all manner of threats and abuse”. In his reaction to the verdict, he said his party would observe ‘thanksgiving day’ on Wednesday. 
PTI chairman said: “I appreciate our SC judges for standing firm and upholding the Constitution and law, against all manner of threats and abuse.” 

 





 
He also thanked Barrister Ali Zafar and his team and the people of Punjab for coming out in unprecedented numbers during by-elections against rigging. 
“Tomorrow [Wednesday] evening we will offer thanks to Allah and celebrate with all the people of Pakistan who have stood by us in our campaign for Haqeeqi Azadi, coming out in massive numbers to show support,” he announced. 

 





 
PTI vice president Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the SC decision had upheld the Constitution and the rule of law in the country.

2,Alvi ready to facilitate talks to end crises,ISLAMABAD: President Arif Alvi on Tuesday underscored the need for political parties to come together to tame...,"ISLAMABAD: President Arif Alvi on Tuesday underscored the need for political parties to come together to tame political and economic challenges faced by Pakis­tan and said the President House was “ready to play its role” to facilitate reconciliation. 
Speaking to media persons at the Presidency, President Alvi said he did not have the authority to direct political players to hold dialogue. He, however, reiterated the need for a consultative process within the ambit of the Constitution to tackle the prevalent problems, especially inflation.
According to the president, political and economic uncertainty could further polarise the society which was detrimental to everyone’s interest.
As per a senior journalist who attended the meeting, the president said that all pillars of the state and institutions should play their constitutional role for transparent elections in Pakistan as a government that would come to power through free and fair elections could provide “much-needed political, financial and economic stability”. 
The president said that he had a good working relationship with the current government and had no confrontation with the prime minister. He said he had received 74 summaries from the present government out of which 69 summaries had been assented to without any delay. 
Army chief’s appointment
Replying to a question about the early appointment of the army chief, the president said that if the appointment of the army chief was initiated through the laid down procedure under relevant laws and contained the formal approval of the relevant institutions and offices, then he would have no objections to it.
He added that there was no harm if the appointment of the next chief of army staff (COAS) was made before the expiry of the tenure of the incumbent COAS, General Qamar Javed Bajwa. “In my opinion, there is no harm in appointing the next army chief before the expiry of the incumbent’s term,” said the president.
In response to a question regarding the procedure surrounding the appointment of the COAS, the president said parliament should set procedure regarding the appointment of the army chief and possible extensions to his term.
COAS Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, who was given an extension by the previous PTI government in 2019, will leave his position on November 29 when his second three-year tenure comes to an end. “In my opinion, there is no harm in making the army chief’s appointment ahead of time,” the president added.
Responding to a question regarding the formation of a parliamentary committee to pursue a treason case against him, President Alvi said he had been performing his duties within the bounds of the Constitution and with a clear conscience; therefore, he would clarify his position if such a situation arose.
While responding to a question about the presidential system, President Alvi said the parliamentary system was a tried and tested system and had evolved over a period of time as the best-suited system for our country.
The president endorsed pursuing a “non-confrontational foreign policy” based on equality and dignity. He added past policies of the country to “completely align with one bloc” did not serve the interests of the country.

3,Power tariff up by Rs3.5 after cabinet approves ‘rebasing’,"Khurram Dastagir says govt to ensure uninterrupted power supply to dedicated industrial feeders, minimise disruptions.","ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday announced a three-phased increase in uniform base power tariff, starting with Rs3.50 per unit with effect from July 26 to generate funds to the tune of at least Rs900 billion during the current fiscal year and secure a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Speaking at a news conference with Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik, Minister for Power Khurram Dastgir Khan said ‘tariff rebasing’ was approved by the federal cabinet under which the second phase of Rs3.50 per unit will become effective next month and with a one-month gap in September, the remaining 91 paisa per unit increase would come into force in October.
He said the tariff rebasing involving Rs7.91 per unit should have come into force in February as the previous rebasing was implemented in February 2021 but the previous government delayed it for political reasons. With this increase of Rs7.91 per unit, the base national average electricity tariff would go up from Rs16.91 per unit to Rs24.82 with financial impact of Rs893bn in FY2022-23, besides over Rs150bn in additional sales tax.
Mr Dastgir said the power tariff would start decreasing in November-December once the rebasing process was complete and the results of the steps being taken by the current government start yielding results. 
Even with this tariff adjustment, the government would provide relief to about 45pc of the population or 13 million domestic connections (out of 27 million domestic consumers) with monthly consumption of up to 200 units per month.
Uninterrupted power supply
The minister said the federal cabinet also decided to ensure uninterrupted power supply to dedicated industrial feeders round the clock and minimise disruptions on mix (industrial and domestic) feeders so that jobs and economic activities remain unaffected.
Likewise, the cabinet also decided to ensure electricity and gas to five export-oriented sectors on priority and keep their tariffs close to the regional export competitors.
The minister said the coming three months would be difficult for the consumers but the power prices would start decreasing from November after reflection of fuel surcharge in the tariff. 
He added the tariff increase was already being recovered from consumers in the shape of monthly fuel cost adjustments and quarterly tariff adjustments which have now been taken into account in the tariff rebasing and hence the FCAs and QTAs would be on the lower side.
In response to a question, Mr Dastgir said a new law was being finalised to facilitate commercial transactions on a government-to-government basis in a transparent manner as some friendly countries were interested in investing in Pakistan but had been hampered by existing privatisation laws.
The law that would also come before the parliament for debate would bring transparency in commercial transactions between governments because there had been delays regarding privatisation.
He said the power generation has significantly improved over the previous month after increase in hydropower generation from Tarbela to 4500mw from 1100mw last month and resumption of production from 1100mw K-2 from nuclear power plant that was on outage last month for refueling.
The minister said the efforts of the current government had started bearing fruits as the circular debt it had inherited had been brought down by Rs214bn to Rs2.253 trillion as of June 30 from Rs2.467 trillion. He said the amount of unrecovered bills that stood at Rs300bn when the PML-N had left in 2018 had surged to Rs1 trillion over the past four years.
The minister accused the PTI government of benefiting their “blue-eyed investors” by intentionally delaying key power projects, including 1320mw Shanghai Thar Coal, 1200mw Trimmu RLNG, 1,320mw Jamshoro and 720mw Karot hydropower. Responding to a question, he said the entire tunnel of the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower project was being de-watered to confirm the real cause of the closure.
Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik said the power rates would start declining from October-November due to the “effective policies” of the government. “There will be a visible gradual reduction in the electricity price, hopefully in the coming three to four months,” he added.

4,"8 dead, many stranded in rain-hit Balochistan, Sindh","NDMA calls helicopters for rescue operation in Lasbela; heavy rains wash away parts of Karachi-Quetta highway, traffic suspended.","KARACHI / QUETTA: Heavy rains continued to wreak havoc in several areas of Sindh and Balochistan on Tuesday where at least eight more people lost their lives in rain-related accidents while several people stranded due to washing away of bridges and roads awaited rescue. 
A tragedy befell on a family in Sindh’s Khairpur district where a man died, along with his two minor sons, while his wife and two daughters suffered critical injuries when the roof of their house collapsed during heavy rain in Gambat area near Ranipur late Monday night.  
In Karachi, five people lost their lives as several areas of the city remained inundated in sewage-laced rain water for a third-consecutive day. 
Moreover, heavy rains caused flooding in Mirpurkhas, Larkana, Dadu, Qambar-Shahdadkot and other adjoining towns. 
However, citizens looking for a respite from torrential rain to return to their normal lives will have to wait for one more day as the Met office has said that the fresh spell of rain could stay till Wednesday (today) and would begin to weaken from Thursday.  
A brief statement by the Met office said that Karachi and other parts of Sindh, including Tharparkar, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal, Tando Mohammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Hyderabad, Matiari, Sanghar, Shaheed Benazirabad, Khairpur, Sukkur, Larkana, Jacob­abad, Dadu, Jamshoro, Shikarpur, Qambar-Shahdadkot, Ghotki and Kandhkot-Kashmore were likely to receive widespread rain, windstorm or thunderstorm with scattered heavy or very heavy rainfall till July 27. 
Families in Lasbela await rescue 
At least 300 people, including women and children, on Tuesday awaited rescue in the Oraki region of Lasbela district after floods inundated the villages in the area and washed away mud houses, forcing people to live under the open sky. 
Despite a passage of 24 hours, the local administration was not able to rescue the stranded people who were said to be running out of food and fresh water when this report was filed. The issue was brought to the notice of Balochistan Chief Minister Abdul Quddus Bizenjo who ordered the authorities concerned to rescue the stranded families.  
In a statement, the National Disaster Management Authority said that two helicopters will reach Lasbela to rescue the people from the Oraki area.  
Separately, the security forces saved at least 100 people in Danda and Soukhan areas of Bela and Uthal. “The affected families were shifted to the government buildings and provided with relief goods and food,” officials said. 
Quetta-Karachi traffic remains suspended 
The traffic between Quetta and Karachi which was suspended after heavy rains washed away parts of the highway, including three bridges, could not be restored despite a passage of 48 hours.  
A large portion of the main bridge on the Hub River collapsed last night due to flash floods. “The Quetta-Karachi highway was washed away at least five places,” a senior official of the Lasbela administration told Dawn.  
The traffic also remained suspended between Lasbela and Gwadar as a flood was passing through the coastal highway in the Hingol area. “Around 5 km of the coastal highway was submerged in the Hingol area,” officials said. 
The Khuzdar-Ratodero highway was also affected due to floods and landslides that cut off the road link between Khuzdar and Sindh. In Karkh area, flooded streams washed away mud houses as water entered residential areas due to increased inflows. 
Balochistan CM aide Mir Ziaullah Langove addressed a presser on Tuesday evening and said that 104 people, including women and children, lost their lives in Balochistan in the monsoon rains. 
LCCI demands new bridge 
The Lasbela Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) urged the government to construct a new bridge after the bridge on the Hub River was washed away by floods. It also urged the power companies to restore power in Hub which had been suspended as a result of flooding in the area that destroyed pylons. 
The chamber urged the National Highway Authority (NHA) to construct a “new bridge on war footings”. Drawing the attention of the Balochistan government, the chamber said that due to the current situation, traffic has been diverted towards the Hub Bypass. The bypass and its bridge are not wide enough, it said while seeking urgent measures to expand the bypass and its bridge. 
It added that an alternate route from Karachi to Hub, the Sakran Road, must be opened for traffic after repairing till the construction of a new bridge on N-25. 
Saleem Shahid from Quetta and Abdul Wahid Shahwani from Khuzdar also contributed to this report.
