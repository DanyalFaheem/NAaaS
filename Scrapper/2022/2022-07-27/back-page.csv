0,Three peacekeepers killed amid anti-UN protests in DR Congo,Violence also claims lives of 12 demonstrators.,"GOMA: Three United Nations peacekeepers and at least 12 demonstrators have been killed in escalating anti-UN protests in eastern DR Congo, officials said on Tuesday.
Anger has been fuelled by perceptions that MONUSCO, the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is failing to do enough to stop attacks by armed groups.
Crowds on Monday stormed a MONUSCO headquarters and supply base in Goma, the chief city in North Kivu province, and the protests spread on Tuesday to Beni and Butembo to the north.
Butembo police chief Colonel Paul Ngoma said three peacekeepers there — two Indians and a Moroccan — had been killed and another injured, while seven demonstrators had died and several others were wounded.
Earlier, government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said on Twitter that  “at least five people (were) dead, about 50 wounded” in Goma.

Violence also claims lives of 12 demonstrators

The security forces had fired  “warning shots” at protesters to stop attacks on UN personnel, he said.
MONUSCO is one of the world’s biggest peacekeeping operations.
But it has regularly come under criticism in the troubled east, where many accuse it of failing to do enough to end decades-long bloodshed.
More than 120 armed groups roam the volatile region, where civilian massacres are common and conflict has displaced millions of people.
In Monday’s unrest, hundreds of people in Goma blocked roads and chanted hostile slogans before storming MONUSCO’s headquarters and a supply base there.
Protesters smashed windows and looted valuables, while helicopters airlifted UN staff from the premises and security forces fired teargas in a bid to push them back.
The unrest in Goma continued on Tuesday, with the fatal shooting of a man near the supplies base, a correspondent saw.
Congolese security forces held back a crowd outside the facility, some of whom carried placards such as  “Bye-bye, MONUSCO.” At Goma’s CBCA Ndosho Hospital, the head of administration, Serge Kilumbiro, said that 28 people had been admitted with gunshot wounds on Monday and eight more on Tuesday.
In Beni, about 350 kilometres (215 miles) to the north, soldiers deployed on the road leading to the MONUSCO base there on Tuesday, while protesters burned tyres. Shops, markets and petrol stations were closed.
In the town of Butembo, security forces dispersed protesters who had gathered in front of a MONUSCO base, witnesses said. Ngoma, the local police chief, said some youths were  “armed”.
The latest protests come after the president of the senate, Modeste Bahati, told supporters in Goma on July 15 that MONUSCO should  “pack its bags”.
They coincide with the resurgence of the M23 — a militia that lay mostly dormant for years before resuming fighting last November. In 2010, it became the peacekeeping mission MONUSCO — the United Nations Organisation Stabil­isation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — with a mandate to conduct offensive operations.
It has a current strength of about 16,300 uniformed personnel, according to the UN.
MONUSCO said it  “vigorously condemned the attack” on its premises in Goma, “carried out by a group of looters on the sidelines of a demonstration which, in addition, was banned by the mayor of Goma”.
In a statement on Monday, Khassim Diagne, the deputy special representative of the UN secretary general to MONUSCO, said the peacekeepers were there to protect civilians. “The incidents in Goma are not only unacceptable but totally counterproductive,” he said.

1,FO rejects ‘preposterous’ remarks by India on CPEC,"Says casting aspersions over the project shows India's ""insecurity"" as well as pursuit of ""hegemonic agenda"".","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday categorically rejected as baseless and misguided the remarks made by the official spokesperson of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs on China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), calling it an effort to politicise the project.
In a statement, the Foreign Office spokesperson said CPEC was a transformational project and a harbinger of stability, mutual cooperation and shared development for the region.
As a flagship of the Belt and Road Initiative and hallmark of the Pakistan-China All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership, CPEC provides a vehicle for the people of the region to break from zero-sum approaches, he remarked.

He said China’s investment in CPEC had helped Pakistan overcome the energy and infrastructural bottlenecks that once constrained growth and development.
Attempts to cast aspersions over CPEC show India’s insecurity as well as the pursuit of a hegemonic agenda that has held back socioeconomic development in South Asia for decades, he commented.
While rejecting India’s fallacious assertion that CPEC impinges on its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the spokesperson pointed out that it was in fact India that was illegally occupying the state of Jammu and Kashmir for over seven decades. 
He said India’s attempts to mislead the international community about the status of Jammu and Kashmir and to hide its atrocities against the Kashmiri people would never succeed. India was cautioned to desist from falsehoods and baseless claims over a territory that it continued to illegally occupy through brute force, he added. The spokesperson said the Jammu and Kashmir dispute remained an internationally recognised dispute on the United Nations agenda and “its solution lies in exercise of the right of self-determination in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people”.

2,Justice Faez Isa urges CJP not to ‘bulldoze’ judges’ appointment process,"Writes letter to JCP, says it was surprising that meeting for judges' appointments being held during summer vacations.","ISLAMABAD: Senior puisne judge of the Supreme Court Justice Qazi Faez Isa advised Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial not to bulldoze the “due” process for appointment of more than one-third of the total number of judges in the apex court.
In a letter written to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan, headed by CJP Bandial, Justice Isa deplored the manner of summoning the JCP’s meeting to consider the elevation of high court judges to the Supreme Court.
Justice Isa said it was surprising that the JCP’s meeting had been convened to consider appointment of five SC judges during summer vacations.
Justice Isa stated in the letter that “while on my annual leave I received a Whatsapp message from the Additional Registrar of the Supreme Court informing me that the Hon’ble Chief Justice of Pakistan has convened a meeting of the JCP on 28 July 2022 to consider appointing five judges to the SC. 
“When availing of annual leave no meeting of the JCP was scheduled but as soon as I left Pakistan the CJP decided to hold two meetings of the JCP to consider appointments to the Sindh and Lahore High Courts, and now a third unscheduled meeting of the JCP is to be held during the summer vacations of the SC. 
“The summer vacations of the SC were notified by the CJP himself, and then these were gazetted in the Official Gazette. If the CJP renders his own notification utterly meaningless then let him first withdraw it, instead of violating it.”
He pointed out that in the JCP meeting held on June 28, everyone, except the CJP and Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan, voted to postpone the meeting as there was no justification to call it during the gazetted summer vacations and as the most senior judge was on sanctioned annual leave.
“I most respectfully submit that the CJP cannot reject decisions of the JCP. In calling another meeting during notified-gazetted vacations, when some members are on annual leave, and at a time when the Attorney-General is recovering from the second surgery he has recently undergone, is unjustified. 
The democratically taken decision by the JCP not to meet in such circumstances must be abided by. Democracy is the bedrock of the Constitution and the basis on which Pakistan came into existence.”
Justice Isa suggested that the meeting might be deferred till August 13 when he will resume the office, adding that the JCP did not convene its meeting for months when he was present in Pakistan and then scheduled three such meetings when the senior puisne judge was on sanctioned annual leave.
The letter stated: “It suggests that the CJP does not want me to be physically present, which is illegal and unconstitutional.”
It went on to state that “the CJP did not schedule meetings when the vacancies in the SC occurred, but all of a sudden wants to make wholescale appointments to the SC hurriedly. To appoint five judges means more than a third of the SC, which the CJP wants to pack during notified-gazetted vacations, and by avoiding the participation of all members.”
The CJP wants to fill-in an ‘anticipated’ vacancy too. Article 175(8) of the Constitution does not permit this. Nor does the Constitution permit that the CJP alone propose names, which is the sole prerogative of the JCP, the letter said. It added that the anticipated vacancy will occur on the retirement of Justice Sajjad Ali Shah. He is being called upon to choose his own successor. “This is unconstitutional. Pakistan is not a kingdom of yore in which kings decided their successors. If this is permitted then the CJP may next call a meeting of the JCP to fill-in ‘anticipated vacancies’ that will occur in respect of all the judges of the SC, including those retiring after him.”
Justice Isa said that the matter of appointing judges to the superior courts requires utmost care and due deliberation as it is a delicate matter. 
Addressing the CJP, the judge said: “Please do not ridicule the JCP and your nominees by contravening the Constitution. Restricting the JCP to consider only the CJ’s pre-selected nominees is inappropriate. The JCP deserves to be treated with respect and consideration by its chairman.”
The letter said that the CJP admits to having acted unfairly as he says that he decided to consider only a certain number of judges, and this he did arbitrarily. He informs that he considered three judges from Peshawar, six from Lahore till and 12 from Sindh. This does not stand to reason because the Lahore High Court is a much larger than the High Court of Sindh; neither the same number were considered nor of the same proportional ratio.
Justice Isa deplored that “CJP further discriminates by excluding for his kind consideration Chief Justice and Judges from the Balochistan High Court and the Chief Justice and Judges from the Islamabad High Court. The prevailing sense of deprivation of the peoples of these areas is being further aggravated. With utmost respect, it appears that CJP has resorted to reverse engineering by first deciding who all to nominate and then find some pretext to justify his nominations.”
He stressed that need that “all appointments must be made in accordance with the Constitution, on the basis of a predetermined and non-discriminatory criteria. And above all without any impression of favouritism. The Constitution does not grant the CJP any powers additional to those of the other members of the JCP; the CJP is only designated as the Chairman of the JCP.”

3,Bangladesh seeks $4.5bn IMF loan as reserves shrink,The nation has experienced lengthy blackouts in recent weeks as utilities struggle to source enough diesel and gas to meet demand.,"DHAKA: Bangladesh has asked the International Monetary Fund for support in riding out a financial shock triggered by volatile energy prices after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, officials said on Tuesday.
The South Asian nation has experienced lengthy blackouts in recent weeks, sometimes for up to 13 hours a day, as utilities struggle to source enough diesel and gas to meet demand.
Tens of thousands of mosques around the country have been asked to curtail their use of air conditioners to ease pressure on the electricity grid, with power shortfalls compounded by a depreciating currency and dwindling foreign exchange reserves.
A senior finance ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Dhaka had sought an IMF credit line, without disclosing the amount.
Local newspaper the Daily Star reported that Bangladesh was seeking $4.5 billion dollars from the Washington-based lender following a recent visit to the country by its representatives.

The country is grappling with crisis because of rising international fuel prices

Authorities were grappling with a “crisis” because of rising international fuel prices after the Russian attack on Ukraine, junior planning minister Shamsul Alam said.
“Our balance of payments is in the negative zone. We need to stabilise our exchange rate,” he said.
Austerity measures
Alam said the government had rolled out “austerity measures” in addition to electricity rationing, including import curbs and cuts to development spending.
Diesel power plants across the country, accounting for 1,500 megawatts of generation capacity, have been taken off the grid, while some gas-fired plants are also idle.
Bangladesh’s precarious financial position has been compounded by unprecedented floods in the northeast, inundating the homes of more than seven million people and causing nearly $10 billion in damage, according to government estimates.
The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has blamed the government for the crisis, accusing it of squandering cash on multibillion-dollar vanity projects.
Several South Asian nations are struggling with galloping inflation and deteriorating public finances triggered by global economic headwinds.
Nearby Sri Lanka is currently in negotiations for an IMF bailout after running out of foreign currency to import even its most vital essentials, triggering long queues at petrol stations, food shortages and lengthy power cuts.
Angry crowds in the island nation stormed the president’s official residence earlier this month, prompting the leader to flee abroad and tender his resignation.
Known for its big garment-exporting industry, Bangladesh has sought the funds for its balance of payment and budgetary needs, as well as for efforts to deal with climate change, the Daily Star reported, citing documents it had seen.
It said Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal wrote to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Sunday.
Officials at the finance ministry and the office of the IMF in Bangladesh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Bangladesh Bank recently announced a policy to preserve dollars by discouraging imports of luxury goods, fruit, non-cereal foods, and canned and processed foods.
The bank’s foreign-exchange reserves fell to $39.67 billion as of July 20 — sufficient for imports for about 5.3 months — from $45.5 billion a year earlier.
Remittances from overseas Bangladeshis fell 5 per cent in June to $1.84 billion, the central bank said, as many migrant workers lost their jobs because of the Covid-19 pandemic and many of them could not get home because of the travel disruption it caused.

4,ECP denotifies PML-N MPA months after disqualification,Chaudhry Kashif Mehmood was disqualified by IHC in a fake degree case in 2020.,"ISLAMABAD: After a lapse of seven month, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday de-notified PML-N member Punjab Assembly (MPA) Chaudhry Kashif Mehmood who was disqualified in a fake degree case. 
Mr Mehmood, an MPA from PP-241 Bahawalnagar-V, was disqualified by the Islamabad Hight Court (IHC) in January 2020. Subsequently, he filed an appeal with the Supreme Court which was also rejected in November last year. 
“Pursuant to the judgement dated January 31, 2020 passed by the Hon’ble Islamabad High Court … and subsequent order dated November 23, 2021 passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court ... the [ECP] hereby de-notifies Mr. Kashif Mehmood,” reads a notification issued by the ECP. 
The IHC disqualified the lawmaker after receiving a report from Al-Khair University in Bhimber, AJK, confirming that he held a bogus degree of the Bachelor of Business Administration. 
“The record held in the university reveals that Mr Kashif Mehmood, son of Khalid Mehmood, had neither been [a] student of Al-Khair University, Bhimber, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, nor did he graduate in the course of BBA,” the report said. 
In the 2018 general election, Mr Mehmood was elected after securing 48,543 votes. Muhammad Muzaffar Khan of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf who bagged 44,184 votes came in at second position.

5,SITUATIONER: PML-N TO SWITCH GEARS BACK TO ‘ATTACK’ MODE?,This policy ‘trap’ is not the only factor forcing PML-N to review its strategy; it fears it may soon face a physical challenge.,"AS most of the legal tea leaf readers had predicted over the last four days, the Supreme Court on Tuesday night dethroned Hamza Shehbaz, declared Chaudhry Parvez Elahi as the chief minister, and told President Arif Alvi to administer the oath within the next 150 minutes of the order if the governor causes any delay, after which the PML-N feels ‘trapped and deceived’ — in every sense of the word — physically, politically, and most importantly, psychologically. 
The immediate reaction to the short SC order from the party supremo and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was instructive. He tweeted: “Pakistan turned into a circus. Salute to the three (Supreme Court) judges.” His daughter and heir apparent, Maryam, called it a “judicial coup” in her reaction. Both these tweets, as party insiders explain, reflect the line of thinking in the PML-N that may now set the course of their politics. “Expect a change of policy direction as well as gear in the days to come.”

The Tuesday decision did not hit the party out of the blue; it rather concluded a long series of events that ‘generated and cemented’ a sense of deception in the party, explains a party leader, who did not want to named because the party is still in the process of debating its future course of action. In fact, none of the leaders Dawn spoke to last night wanted to be named for the same reason.  
“Ever since the PML-N took over in Islamabad in April, it did not want, and was not allowed to either, to deal with Imran Khan and the PTI as outgoing parties are usually dealt with in the country — arrests, investigations, corruption cases and police chasing and rounding up party leaders,” the PML-N man said.
“Rather, the party soon sensed that the judiciary is turning out to be the new protector of Imran Khan since he started getting relief in years-old cases, which were registered even before him coming to power and included charges like terrorism. He was allowed to protest and launch long marches under judicial protection, which turned into a huge encouragement for him. He went to court on the slightest of excuses and got instant relief – a pattern that politically hit the PML-N. 
“It all happened while the PML-N government was requested to negotiate with the IMF, beg friendly countries for billions of dollars and take some suicidal economic decisions — all in the name of saving the country from economic meltdown and default. Now, when the IMF deal is sealed, friendly states have promised money and hard economic decisions have started biting people, the rug is being pulled from under the party’s feet,” he explains, insisting: “The party has a right to feel cheated.”
This policy ‘trap’ is not the only factor forcing the PML-N to review its strategy; it fears it may soon face a physical challenge.
“The federal government will now be beseeched by two federating units — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab — ruled by the PTI. The Centre would literally be on its knees if Imran Khan announces a long march in the next month and runs unhindered on the capital from both sides. What would happen to the federal government’s writ, especially if the Rangers are not ‘available’ to protect the capital? In that case, what would happen to the political capital of the PML-N? For the party, it is not a conspiracy theory, but a looming threat. What if the long march also has judicial protection, as was the case last time? Its altruism of economic decisions has not served it well, and any physical blockade of the capital would only drive the proverbial last nail in its political coffin,” explains another party insider. 
“The party always had critics of the policy of cooperating with the establishment, including people like Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz — supported by dozens of important leaders. The sense of betrayal will now strengthen their hands and one may soon see the party dusting off its old narrative of ‘vote ko izzat do’ (respect for vote). The SC throwing out the PML-N government in Punjab may soon prove to be a God-send opportunity to renew the campaign,” a party leader says.
One may soon see Nawaz Sharif taking the lead in attacking both the judiciary and the establishment, starting from where he left some 18 months ago with Maryam, always eager to do so, following him.
“The party has been thinking for a while to restore its narrative, and the judicial act of Tuesday may turn out to be the starting point that the party had been looking for,” comments the leader, who has been involved in the policy formation debate for the last few weeks.
