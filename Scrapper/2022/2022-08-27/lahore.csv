Chairing a meeting, Minister for Environment Protection and Parliamentary Affairs Muhammad Basharat Raja approved the plan at a meeting.  
Addressing the meeting, he said the provincial government was taking concrete steps to deal with air and water pollution on the Punjab chief minister’s orders.
“As compared to the past, measures have been initiated since May this year to deal with the danger of smog,” said the minister.  
He blamed the practice of burning of crops residues in Indian Punjab for “90 per cent of the smog in Pakistan”.  
“However, the intensity of smog can be reduced by taking measures at the local level,” he added.  
The minister said there was a need to launch an awareness campaign for the public, especially among school students about the issue.  
Emphasising the need to increase tree planting, he said that all relevant departments should take practical steps in this regard.
“Focus on the problem of air pollution throughout the year instead of just in this season,” he directed the officials.  
On the occasion, the Environment Protection Department (EPD) secretary said special squads were impounding the vehicles emitting excessive smoke and heavy fines were also being imposed for violations. The minister directed that the documents of smoke-emitting vehicles should be seized and not be returned until the vehicle’s fitness was ensured.  
He said burning crops residues and solid waste could not be allowed. “All deputy commissioners should task patwaris and village lumberdars with ensuring prevention of crop residues burning in their respective areas,” he said.
The minister called a video-link meeting of all commissioners and DCs next week and said that to discourage the crop residues burning, farmers should use straw cutters and happy seeder machines.  
“Small farmers will be given loans through cooperative banks for purchase of straw cutters and happy seeders,” he announced.  
He said that the cooperatives department should ensure that no housing society was established without getting NOC from the EPD. Every year, instead of mere symbolic planting, housing societies should practically work for planting trees and ensure survival of the plants.  
The EPD secretary, while briefing the meeting, said no brick kiln would be allowed to function without zig-zag technology. “Legal notices have been issued in this regard” he told the meeting.”

The company had received complaints about its Baghbanpura (Lahore) division. 
“It is very ridiculous that the consumers, who are already under severe financial stress due to inflated bills having massive fuel price adjustment charges, general sales tax etc, are being forced to pay bribe for correction of bills. The government must take strict notice of the situation,” a consumer said while talking to Dawn. 
According to a Lesco spokesperson, Chief Executive Officer Chaudhry Muhammad Amin suspended EXEN (Baghbanpura) Rab Yar, Revenue Officer Abdul Jabbar and Commercial Assistant Muhammad Imran from service.  

Consumers had complained against officers, including an EXEN

“We will not allow anyone to use correction of bills for the vested interests,” the Lesco chief said in a statement. 
“In case any issue, the consumers must report to us,” he added. 
Speaking at a news conference, Mr Amin said the bills of those domestic consumers who had consumed up to 200 units were being corrected by deleting the FPA charges. 
He added that the tube-well consumers’ bills were also being corrected in the same way. 
“We have directed all banks to receive all manually corrected bills,” he said, adding that those who had already deposited their bills would be reimbursed the FPA charges/amounts. 
“Moreover, we have also extended the last date of depositing such corrected bills up to Aug 31”.
While talking to Dawn, the Lesco chief said the 2.1m such consumers had been issued revised bills after the required correction. 
“The correction of bills of around 1.5m remaining consumers (in six batches) is underway at the moment and it will be done soon,” he maintained. 
Meanwhile, the protests against inflated bills continued in Lahore and other cities. 
In Lahore, the rickshaw union and other groups, representing workers, also organised protest demonstrations on Friday. A number of rickshaw drivers, under the aegis of the Awami Rickshaw Union, gathered outside the Lahore Press Club and chanted slogans against the government for fleecing the poor consumers on the pretext of the FPA and other taxes imposed through electricity bills. 
They also complained against the repeated challans of their rickshaws by the Lahore Transport Company (LTC) for minor violations. They warned the government of holding a sit-in at Charing Cross if the FPA, GST etc were not withdrawn from the bills. 
“We also ask the government to stop the LTC from issuing challans,” one of the protesters said. 
Similar protests were also reported from other parts of the province. They, during protests, also burnt the bills reportedly.

7,14 children injured in Muzaffargarh school roof collapse,Officials reach the spot and the sealing of the school.,"MUZAFFARGARH: At least 14 minor students were injured, 12 of them seriously, when the roof of a classroom collapsed in a private school here on Friday.
The incident occurred in Jinnah Garden locality, where 65 students were studying in private Universal Public School from nursery to 5th class.
On Friday, roof of one of the classrooms suddenly caved in, leaving 14 children injured.
On being called, a Rescue 1122 team reached the spot and shifted the injured students to the district headquarters hospital, where two of them, who had suffered minor injuries, were discharged after provision of first aid, while the rest of them with serious injuries were admitted.
On knowing about the roof collapse, the worried parents and relatives of the students also rushed to the school and joined the rescue work.
Deputy Commissioner Ali Annan Qamar reached the spot and after inspecting the building ordered the sealing of the school and legal action against its owner.
He also ordered the education officials and buildings department to check all schools in the district to help avoid such incidents in future.
Dawn has learnt that dozens of private schools were running without getting a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the district government, which was issued after an inspection of the buildings.
The administration has already issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) with regard to the structure of the school buildings. Some schools set up in dilapidated buildings have been sealed by the administration.
The Punjab Education Foundation had also stopped funding the schools running without NOCs issued by the district administration.
Meanwhile, South Punjab Education Secretary Dr Ehtesham Anwar took notice of the incident and constituted a team to probe into the matter.
He said stern legal action would be taken against those showing negligence.
Sources say that because of the heavy rains in south Punjab region, many old buildings have developed cracks, that could result in more roof collapse incidents.
Following the incidents, parents of many students said they would stop sending their children to the schools during the ongoing rain spell.
They demanded the district administration and secretary education should get the buildings of all schools inspected by engineers to avoid such incidents.

People at other places also continued to face a great deal of trouble due to unabated rain. Many people complained that they failed to encash the cheques of financial aid given by the chief minister.  
Deputy  Commissioner Muhammad Anwar Baryar said the problem arose because most people had no bank accounts and the cheques could be encashed only by those having accounts. He said the money would be given to the affected people after due process and assistant  commissioners had been asked to help them in opening accounts.  

Most people fail to get relief amid mounting challenges

9,Saggian Road project to be completed by October,LAHORE: The Rs3.406 billion Saggian Road rehabilitation and improvement project will be completed by October this...,"LAHORE: The Rs3.406 billion Saggian Road rehabilitation and improvement project will be completed by October this year. 
The project was launched in February. 
An official of the Lahore Development Authority — the project executing agency — said the project would be completed in October subject to the uninterrupted provision of the funds, support and ownership from the authorities. 
The project consists of two packages  — one is from Ravi Bridge to Lahore-Sheikhupura Road and the other from Phhol Mandi Chowk to Faizpur interchange (M-2). 
Package one is of 150-foot wide and 3.90 km long three-lane dual carriageway having a median measuring 1.2 metres, two-metre wide drain-cum-walkways (both sides), 1.8 metres wide paved shoulder (both sides) and the provision of sewerage system as proposed by the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) and Public Health Engineering Department. 
The second package (Phool Mandi Chowk to Faizpur Interchange (M-2) will be 110 feet wide and 4.40km long two-lane dual carriageway having 1.2-metre wide centre median, two-metre wide drain-cum-walkway (both sides), three-foot wide paved shoulder (both sides) and a sewerage system. The estimated cost of package-1 and 2 is over Rs1.5457 billion and Rs1.5273 billion. 
The official said the project will ease traffic flow, and remove bottlenecks, ending carbon emissions and environmental pollution and reducing the travel time to a minimum level at both packages. 
The work related to the asphalt base course has been completed by around 50 percent. Likewise, works related to drainages, such as excavation, lean concrete, base slab, wall and top slab have been completed. However, the pace of work on other works such as sewerage and ancillary jobs, bridge (replacement of joints), and shifting of utility services, poles, and street lights has yet to pick momentum. 
About the construction of the Lahore bridge (Qainchi intersection, Ferozpur Road) expansion project, he said it is likely to be completed by September as around 75 per cent of work has been completed. This project lingered on owing to delay in issuance of NOC from Pakistan Railways, shifting of utility services and other technical issues. 
“The Lahore bridge expansion (addition of two-lane along with the existing flyover towards Gajjumata side) is a part of the Rs1.711 billion Gulab Devi underpass project. The underpass was opened to traffic a couple of months ago while work on the bridge expansion couldn’t pick momentum due to a delay in an NOC from the Pakistan Railways that was supposed to allow the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) to carry out piling, girder launching while crossing over the railway lines at the intersection,” the official explained. 
He said the need for the Lahore bridge emerged after the LDA in a survey that the traffic heading towards Gajjumata and Kasur from Kalma Chowk was stuck at the existing Lahore bridge due to the low width of the road (two lanes).

Tigers are extinct in Pakistan; however, they are protected in India where killing a tiger can result in seven-year jail term. 
Local residents Nauman Ahmed and Munawwar said many wild animals had entered the area from India-held Kashmir due to the flood in the river Dek.  
The wildlife department is still unaware of the tiger’s presence in the area.

The authority was formed in February 2021 through an ordinance to establish a business district in Gulberg, Lahore. 
According to a press release, with an expanded scope of work, the PCBDDA will work in various cities, such as Faisalabad, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Multan and Rawalpindi, and boost the economic activities for the development of the province. 
In March, the authority in an open auction sold seven commercial plots (12 to 14 kanals) of mixed-use in Gulberg’s downtown at a record cumulative price of Rs34.9 billion. The plots, namely Lahore Downtown-One was sold for Rs6.5 billion, followed by Downtown-two for Rs5.1 billion, Downtown-three for Rs4.08 billion, Downtown-four for Rs3.6 billion, Downtown-five for Rs4.2 billion, Downtown-six for Rs5.28 billion and Downtown-seven for Rs6.14 billion. 
Earlier in September 2021, the authority auctioned its five commercial plots for Rs21.588 billion after it received the highest bid price from four groups, including a Turkish real estate company. The successful bidders of the previous and Thursday’s auction intend to build high-rises on these plots in the commercial zones. 
Since the favourable bylaws related to height (500+ft and FAR-Floor area ratio of 1:15) are the significance and uniqueness of this project, the authority says that its team is striving to put every effort into the success of this project 
The plots auctioned in September included Prime-1 measuring 18 kanals for Rs7.623 billion (Rs424 million per kanal), Prime-2 plot measuring 11 kanals for Rs4.202 billion, Prime-3 measuring 10 kanals for Rs2.840 billion, Prime-4 and 5 measuring 10 kanals each for Rs4.069 billion and Rs2.845 billion.

Addressing a press conference, PUC chairman Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi said all political and religious parties should pool financial and human resources to deal with the calamity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should call the APC to help flood victims and Chief Minister Parvez Elahi should also play his role. 
“We thank Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE for the announcement of financial support and investment in the country,” said Ashrafi, who is also Special Representative to Prime Minister on Religious Harmony and Middle East. 
“The Arab-Islamic countries are friends of the people of Pakistan,” he said and added that Islamic countries should not get involved in the internal political situation of the country. “The prime minister and his delegation did not meet any Israeli during the recent visit of Qatar. The stance of the state of Pakistan is very clear on the issue of Palestine and no one can change it,” he said.
“The current flood situation is more disastrous than the past floods and natural calamities. Pakistan alone cannot deal with this situation, where millions of people are affected across the country. Philanthropists and international community should come forward to help those caught in the calamity,” he demanded.
