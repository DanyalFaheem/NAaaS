0,Research reveals dark side of gig economy,Study finds that most companies in Pakistan fail to ensure minimum standards of fair work.,"KARACHI: The gig economy has been encouraging a race to the bottom with respect to the working conditions, according to a research report by Fairwork Foundation of the Oxford University and the Centre for Labour Research, Pakistan.
The country has nearly two per cent of its labour force engaged in the gig economy through online and location-based services, a press release said on Friday.
Seven of the most popular gig economy platforms in Pakistan have been rated according to how fairly they treat workers. Only Gharpar, Uber and Foodpanda were able to earn a score, obtaining one out of 10 each.
The study found that most of the companies — Careem, Cheetay, Bykea and Daraz — failed to ensure minimum standards of fair work such as ensuring all workers earn above the national minimum wage.
This is the first study of its kind in Pakistan that scores companies on labour standards such as pay, employment conditions, contracts, management and representation.
Labour economist Dr Aliya Hashmi Khan, columnist Mutaher Khan, App Drivers and Couriers Union President Yaseen Aslam, International labour Organisation Governing Body member Zahoor Awan, Johns Hopkins University Lecturer Syed Muhammad Ali, former Central Labour law adviser Raja Faiz ul Hassan Faiz and Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development’s Azhar Malik were the panellists.
According to Iftikhar Ahmad, principal investigator of the Fairwork Pakistan, an unexpected phenomena of negative income hovers over the platform workers when their monthly costs exceed their incomes.
The report titled “Pakistan Ratings 2022: Labour Stan­dards in the Platform Economy” ranks platforms against five principles of fair work, giving each company a score out of 10. The report found that the majority of the seven platforms are failing to meet the basic standards of fairness when benchmarked against the Fairwork principles.
Only one (Gharpar) of the seven platforms demonstrated that its workers are guaranteed to be paid the minimum wage after costs. Only Uber provides sufficient protection from the task-related risks in their daily work. Only Foodpanda provided the evidence of clear and accessible contracts or terms of service.
None of the seven platforms assessed by researchers had a formalised process where workers could appeal decisions. None of the platforms allowed for collective representation of workers, it said.

1,Lucky to buy back 10m shares to improve ‘future financial position’,Will buy back its shares from Sept 29 to Dec 19 or the date when targeted buyback volume is achieved.,"KARACHI: Lucky Cement Ltd told investors on Friday it wants to buy back up to 10 million of its own shares from the stock market for the purpose of cancellation.
The move is aimed at improving the “future financial position” of the company, said a regulatory filing on the stock exchange.
Of late, many listed companies have resorted to repurchasing their own shares from the ready market. The total number of shares goes down once a company conducts a share buyback. As a result, the company’s break-up value and profit per outstanding share go up.
Lucky Cement will start buying back its shares on Sept 29. It’ll keep repurchasing the shares until Dec 19 or the date when the targeted buyback volume is achieved.
It’ll use the funds from its “distributable profits” and utilise its “internally generated cash flows” for the transaction. The buyback will take place at the share price prevailing on the stock exchange during the purchase period.
“It’ll also provide an opportunity of exit to those members who wish to liquidate their investment fully or partially,” it said.
Recent changes in share buyback regulations seem to have encouraged listed companies to repurchase their own stocks on the stock exchange.
This is in line with a global trend. Big companies in developed economies have ramped up their share repurchases as they carry excess cash on their balance sheets and expect stock prices to go up.
Netsol Technologies Ltd and Maple Leaf Cement Factory Ltd repurchased portions of their respective outstanding shares in recent months.
Speaking to Dawn, JS Global Assistant Vice President Waqas Ghani said a share buyback is an indication that the company likes its own stock enough to buy it back. He said the intended volume of buyback shares (10m) constitutes 8pc of the company’s free float, which means the shareholding that’s in the hands of public investors as opposed to locked-in shares held by the sponsors.
The number outstanding shares of Lucky Cement will reduce to 313m from 323m after the transaction. 
With the market capitalisation of Rs171 billion, the current price of 10m shares is going to be Rs5.28bn. The company’s share price declined 0.39pc to Rs518.78 apiece. 
According to a recent research report by Topline Securities, companies repurchase their own stocks sometimes to cancel them altogether or hold them as treasury stocks. Both moves effectively reduce the number of outstanding shares on the open market.
The changes in buyback regulations were introduced via an amendment to Companies Act 2017 on Dec 4, 2021. Now the repurchase can only be made through the stock exchange on the basis of the prevailing share price. This is different from the previously allowed method of a 
tender offer, which involved a company asking stockholders to sell its shares for a specific price at a predetermined time.

2,Consultation on wheat support price begins,ECC will take a final decision on the minimum wheat support price after proposals from the provinces are received.,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of National Food Security and Research (MNFSR) on Friday said it has started a consultative process with provinces to finalise the wheat support price ahead of the 2022-23 wheat crop.
Chairing a meeting on wheat support price, Minister for National Food Security and Research, Tariq Bashir Cheema said the proposals from the provinces on support price should be profitable for the farmers. “A profitable support price would provide relief to the flood-affected farmers and help them recover their losses,” he added.  
The meeting was of the view that the announcement of profitable support price well before the wheat sowing season will encourage growers to increase area under cultivation, and this could result in the curtailment of $1 billion for the import of the grain.
The Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet will take a final decision on the minimum wheat support price after proposals from the provinces are received by the MNFSR. 
Mr Cheema said the import of wheat for building strategic reserves is putting unnecessary stress on the country’s precious foreign exchange and, therefore, the productivity of wheat and area under cultivation need to be enhanced.
Wheat production fell by nearly 4 per cent in 2021-22, to 26.394 million tonnes, compared to 27.464m tonnes in 2020-21. The major reasons for the decline in wheat production was due to reduction in area sown; shortfall in irrigation water and drought conditions at sowing; less fertiliser off-take and heat wave in March and April, though the government has increased the minimum support price to Rs2,200 per 40kg in 2021-22, aligned to the cost of production.
The meeting was of the view that the cost of land preparation for cultivation during the coming rabi season will be higher because of the destruction caused by the recent floods. 
The minister expressed his grief over the loss caused to farmers due to extensive rainfall and floods in the country. “It is a hard time for the farmers as floods brought disaster for the agriculture sector. The ministry will do whatever it can to provide relief to the flood victims,” he said.

5,SBP sets higher Rs1.8tr agri credit target to help flood-hit farmers,"Specific targets of Rs140bn for production loans of wheat crop, Rs45bn for tractor financing set under budget for FY23, SBP says.","KARACHI: In the backdrop of massive damages to agriculture by unprecedented floods caused by historic monsoon rains, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday set a little higher Rs1,800 billion agriculture credit target for 2022-23.
Last year, the Rs1,700bn target was missed primarily due to financial institutions’ cautious lending approach.
The current year is under the immense pressure of devastating flash floods across the country. No official data is available about the loss of crops, livestock and other related valuables in the agriculture sector, a brokerage house initially estimated a total loss of Rs900bn.
However, it is difficult for brokerage houses or independent NGOs to assess the possible losses due to limited capacity, only the government can provide data about the exact damages caused by the floods.

Banks missed last year’s target due to cautious lending approach

At the same time, it is also obvious that the agricultural sector needs much more financing to recover from the massive losses inflicted by the natural calamity.
The SBP has assigned an annual agriculture credit disbursement target of Rs1.8 trillion to the financial institutions for the current fiscal year to cater to the agriculture credit demand.
Moreover, in line with the national food security requirements and the need for mechanisation of farms to enhance agriculture productivity, specific targets of Rs140bn for production loans of the wheat crop, Rs45bn for tractor financing, and Rs20bn for harvesters, planters and other farm machinery have also been set under the overall target for FY23,” said the central bank.
The per acre indicative credit limits for agriculture financing have also been increased to support the farming community to avail adequate financing from banks and optimise their agriculture inputs’ usage.
Credit for wheat has been increased by 40pc per acre this year in the wake of the shortage of wheat. 
The country is expected to spend $1.7bn on the import of 2m tonnes of wheat.
“The per acre indicative credit limit for wheat has been enhanced from existing Rs60,000 to Rs100,000 which will allow farmers to deploy quality inputs for improved yields,” said the SBP.
During FY22, the financial institutions managed to disburse Rs1,419bn to the agriculture sector compared with the disbursement of Rs1,366bn in FY21.
The SBP said the unprecedented disbursement and growth in the agriculture credit portfolio was supported by various recent initiatives to promote agriculture credit and financial inclusion in the country.
One of the major recent initiatives of SBP was the introduction of a comprehensive agriculture credit scoring model to bring the focus of banks towards improving qualitative aspects and regional distribution of agriculture financing in the country, it added.
The model, adopted by the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee, provides individual scores reflective of each bank’s agriculture credit performance against multi-dimensional criteria based on various indicators including sectoral disbursement, regional performance, outstanding amount and outstanding borrowers etc.
“Recently, growth in agriculture credit disbursement remained subdued due to various challenges such as adverse climate change effects, resource constraints in banks, underutilisation of approved limits by borrowers etc, while a few banks, particularly large public sector banks, among others, also performed slower than usual and struggled to achieve their assigned annual targets,” said the SBP.
The SBP has also released the annual ranking of banks under this scoring model to bring transparency and competition among the various agriculture credit providers.
As per the model’s results for FY22, HBL ranked top among large banks with a score of 75.4, Bank of Punjab scored 62.1 and ranked highest among midsize banks, and BankIslami stood first among small banks with a score of 55.7. Further, U Microfinance Bank scored the highest 80.4.

6,Flour price hike compounds consumer misery in Karachi,Millers have shocked already-stressed consumers by raising the prices of various flour varieties by Rs4 per kg.,"KARACHI: Millers in Karachi have shocked already-stressed consumers by raising the prices of various flour varieties by Rs4 per kg, effective Friday, citing a significant drop in the arrival of wheat from flood-affected areas of interior Sindh.
Data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed that inflation measured by the Sensitive Price Index continued to climb in the week that ended on August 25, jumping to a record 44.58 per cent year-on-year.
In this backdrop, the new price of flour No.2.5 has been raised to Rs94 from Rs90 per kg while the rates of fine and super fine flour have been jacked to Rs96 from Rs92 per kg.
The 10 kg flour bag rate has been fixed at Rs945 as compared to Rs905 per bag.
On Friday, branded flour makers of five and 10 kg flour bags also issued new trade rates. For example, the price of Bake Parlour fine flour of five kg and 10 kg bags now 
carries rates of Rs537 and Rs1055, as compared to Rs517 and Rs1,015. 
The above rates are for the retailers’ trade rates. Consumers who were already paying Rs550 and Rs1,050 will now pay at least Rs570-580 and Rs1,100-1,120 depending on the areas.
The new trade rate of five kg and 10 kg Chakki flour bags of Bake Parlour now carries a new price of Rs537 and Rs1,075 as compared to Rs517 and Rs1,035. Consumers would be charged an additional Rs 4-5 per kg by retailers, depending on the size of the bag.
In the markets, retailers are already charging Rs105-110 per kg for fine flour.
A miller said the arrival of wheat from the interior Sindh areas had shrunk to only 20 per cent in the last 15 days due to heavy floods and rains that have played havoc with the road infrastructure in the interior Sindh and even in Karachi. The rate of a 100 kg wheat bag 15 days back was hovering between Rs7,600-7,800 and now the open market lacks the presence of grain.
He claims that large trucks carrying more than 500 bags of 100 kg wheat bags are not willing to risk destroying their vehicles on the deteriorating road network.
The miller expressed surprise that flour rates are getting costlier than sugar, whose prices hover between Rs85-95 per kg depending on the areas.
