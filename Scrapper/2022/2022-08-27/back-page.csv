0,Turkiye dismisses concerns over US sanctions warning,"Finance minister terms concerns ""meaningless"".","ISTANBUL: Turkiye’s fin­a­nce minister on Friday dismissed as “meaningless” con­cerns among Turkish businesses over a US Trea­sury warning that they risked being penalised if they maintained commercial ties with Russians under sanctions. 
Nato-member Turkiye has sought to strike a balance between Moscow and Kyiv by criticising Russia’s invasion and sending arms to Ukraine, while opposing the Western sanctions and continuing trade, tourism and investment with Russia. 
Finance Minister Nure­ddin Nebati said Turkiye was determined to improve economic and trade relations with its neighbours “within a framework that is not subject to sanctions”. 
Some Turkish firms have purchased or sought to buy Russian assets from Western partners pulling back, while others maintain major assets in Russia. Ankara has said Western sanctions will not be circumvented in Turkiye. 
The US Treasury warned both the country’s largest business group TUSIAD and Nebati’s ministry this month that Russian entities were attempting to use Turkiye to bypass Western sanctions. 
“It is meaningless for a letter relayed to Turkish business groups to create concern in our business circles,” Nebati said in a tweet. “We are pleased to see that the United States, our ally and trade partner, is inviting its businesses to invest in our economy.” 
All players in Turkey’s economy are tied to free market principles and are working to obtain a bigger share of global trade, and the government is “beside its business world on this path,” he said. 
Tim Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said Nebati’s response risked annoying Washington, making secondary sanctions on Turkiye more likely.
“It reads like telling the Yanks, the Turkish state is strong... enough to withstand any actions you might take against us,” Ash wrote on Twitter. 
Turkey, which has Black Sea borders with both Russia and Ukraine, has said joining sanctions against Russia would have hurt its already strained economy and argued that it is focused on mediation efforts. 
One benefit for Turkey has been a jump in foreign arrivals, thanks largely to Russian visitors with few other options due to Western flight restrictions.
The head of a metal exporters group said this month that Russian demand for Turkish products had increased, and that Turkish companies had received enquiries from European businesses about supplying Russia via Turkiye. 
Security concerns 
Officials from Turkiye, Finland and Sweden agreed on Friday to keep meeting in the coming months to discuss security concerns that Turkey raised as a precondition for allowing the two Nordic countries to join the Nato military alliance. 
Officials from the three countries held their first such meeting on Friday in Vantaa.

1,"Sparing PM, Nawaz aides keep targeting his ‘economic wizard’",PML-N supremo denies reports he is not happy with brother’s ‘economic policies’.,"LAHORE: Although PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif has dismissed reports that he is not happy with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s ‘economic policies’, his close aides continue lashing out at his younger brother’s ‘economic wizard’ Miftah Ismail with his (Nawaz) blessing in order to ‘scapegoat’ the finance minister at an appropriate time.  
On Friday, another party leader Hanif Abbasi joined the anti-Miftah camp, blaming the finance minister for spoiling the efforts of PM Sharif to revive the economy.  
On Thursday, Abid Sher Ali, who is a relative of Nawaz Sharif, targeted Mr Ismail for what he called his “anti-people policies”. Mr Ali has remained in ‘self-imposed exile’ in the UK for three years.  
Tallal Chaudhry, who accompanied Abid Sher Ali at the press conference in Faisalabad, also criticised the finance minister for his economic decisions.  

PML-N supremo denies reports he is not happy with brother’s ‘economic policies’

Ousted prime minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf also entered the controversy, terming the ‘purported’ statement by Nawaz Sharif about his brother “an admission of incompetence” of the coalition government at the Centre.  
Omar Sarfraz Cheema, former governor and adviser to Punjab Chief Minister Parvez Elahi, said the PML-N supreme leader had finally admitted the “incompetence and inefficiency of Shehbaz-League”.  
“Shehbaz Sharif’s work can only be seen in advertisements. The coalition partners at the Centre are in fact ‘crime partners’. The nation has come to know the reality of their hypocrisy,” he said in a statement.  
After a leading news channel aired Nawaz Sharif’s purported comments that he was not happy with the prime minister, the former, who has been in London since November 2019, chose to respond through his Twitter handle, saying: “The negative comments attributed to me about PM Shehbaz Sharif are misleading and incorrect. I remain hopeful that the sincere and tireless efforts by SS under the most challenging circumstances will bear fruit and he will steer the country out of the mess created by Imran Khan.”  

 





 
Talking to Dawn on Friday, a couple of senior PML-N leaders admitted that the top party leadership was perturbed over not giving any substantial relief to the masses and as a result its popularity was declining and that of Imran Khan gaining.
“Apparently, Nawaz Sharif and his close aides’ statements appear to be damage-control measures in the face of soaring inflation and electricity prices. Nawaz wants to tell the people that he empathises with them and he is not with the coalition government in its decision to increase prices of petroleum products and electricity,” a PML-N leader from Punjab said.  
He said this was a kind of an ‘old strategy’ but necessary in politics to keep the party’s vote bank intact. “However, several senior leaders in the party want Senator Ishaq Dar to return to the country and take over the finance ministry as he can better manage the economy being an experienced person,” he added.  
The other leader said: “The systematic campaign by Nawaz Sharif and his aides against Miftah Ismail seems some serious thinking is under way in the PML-N [Nawaz] camp to scapegoat him (finance minister) at an appropriate time.”  
He said as far as the Nawaz-Shehbaz relations were concerned there was absolutely no issue between them, adding that the coalition government was confident that by the time next general elections were due it would overcome inflation, stabilise the rupee and provide relief to the masses.  
Over a week ago when the Shehbaz administration had increased the petrol price by Rs6 per litre, Nawaz Sharif and PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari opposed the decision.  
“The PPP is a part of the federal government, which should consult us on such important decisions,” Mr Zardari had said.  
Nawaz Sharif had purportedly opposed the increase in oil prices and left a meeting in protest.

2,PIA increases working hours of cabin crew from 14 to 16 hours,At least five off days can be availed by the crew in a month and after six days of consecutive duty.,"RAWALPINDI: Pakistan International Airlines has increased working hours of cabin crew, including air hostesses, from 14 hours to 16 hours. 
In a directive to cabin crew, the PIA management referred to the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority’s order under which flight time and flight duty hours of the cabin crew had been revised and these would now be 16 hours instead of 14 hours. 
According to PIA, at least five off days can be availed by the crew in a month and after six days of consecutive duty, and it is mandatory to provide a day off to a crew member at his/her home base after availing his/her rest period of last flight duty undertaken on sixth day and will consist of 24 hours. In case, a cabin crew being on a series of flight pattern, this seventh day off shall be afforded after the person returns to home base. 
About local night, it said it is a period of eight hours falling between 2200 hours and 0600 hours local time. A crew member shall neither be detailed nor undertake any duty between periods embracing 2200 hours to 0600 hours local time for more than two consecutive nights. 
About stand-by period, the airline said that it is time period during which a cabin crew member is required to be available to receive an assignment for a specific duty without intervening rest period. Crew will be planned for the airport stand-by duty for six hours and home stand-by for 12 hours. It added that airport stand-by should be considered as part of a duty period. 
Regarding basic duty on long range operations, it said the time limitation will be 16 hours, including two hours for briefing and de-briefing, and it could be extended up to 20 hours for planning purposes only on single sector long range flights. The airline added that rest requirement on long range flights shall be 24 hours, including one local night. At destination outside Pakistan, a minimum of 24 hours rest shall be provided whereas rest after return to base shall be 48 hours or double the duty whichever is more.
Meanwhile, former Senate chairman Mian Raza Rabbani has condemned the decision of the PIA management and termed its move unjustified.
In a statement issued on Friday, Mr Rabbani said the PIA management’s decision was against the prescribed international standards as the fatigue factor might also affect services of the cabin crew if an emergency took place. 
He also condemned the closure of hostels, saying the minister for aviation should ask the PIA management to reverse these decisions as they were not in conformity with labour practices and international safety standards. 
PIA CBA Peoples Unity’s president Hidayatullah has demanded the reversal of the two decisions by the PIA management.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for PIA said the increase in duty hours of the cabin crew had been made in the light of Pakistan Civil Aviation’s Air Navigation Orders (ANO) as other Pakistani airlines had been following the CAA rules. 
He said it was only PIA which had been following its own rule of 14 hours’ duty for cabin crew. He, however, made it clear that the increase in duty timings would be only in case of flights’ delay. 
“Only PIA adhered to its own guidelines requiring a 14-hour shift for the cabin crew, but the increase from 14 to 16 hours is only allowed for incidental or unforeseen delays,” the spokesman added. 
He said the cabin crew would receive an incentive of Rs15,000 for a 16-hour shift. “This is in accordance with the CAA’s Air Navigation Order (ANO).” 
The spokesman said it would also assist the airline in improving its reliability because PIA passengers had in the past experienced inconvenience owing to erratic work schedules of the members of cabin crew who refu­sed to complete their duty after 14 hours.

4,"Telephone, internet partially restored in 10 Balochistan districts",Damage to cable network causes blackout; flood victims can make calls on ‘zero balance’.,"ISLAMABAD: Telephone and internet services in at least 10 districts of Balochistan were partially restored, hours after they were suspended due to the damage caused to the cable network. 
Meanwhile, the government has asked mobile telecom companies to enable consumers in the flood-hit areas in all the provinces to make calls, even with zero balance.
According to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), Quetta, Ziarat, Khuzdar, Loralai, Pashin, Chaman, Panjgur, Zhob, Qila Saifullah and Qila Abdullah suffered a massive internet and telephone blackout on Friday noon. 
The PTA said a serious damage to the cable and optical-fibre network due to torrential rains and flash floods caused the outages.

Damage to cable network causes blackout; flood victims can make calls on ‘zero balance’

The optical-fibre cable network of PTCL has suffered cuts at three different locations due to the usage of heavy machinery for clea­ring floodwater, the PTA said in a statement.
However, by-passes and satellite-based connectivity were used to operationalise telephone and data services in Quetta by 3pm, the PTA added.
The services of PTCL and telecom operators, including Ufone and Telenor, started coming online by 4pm in Quetta and other districts, the PTA statement said. 
However, the services in some areas could not be restored till Friday evening. 
Federal Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunication Syed Aminul Haque has issued directives for the telecom firms to activate their emergency service systems, the statement added. 
The minister has also issued directives for the companies, including PTCL, to utilise all possible resources to bring all areas online. 
The statement said that the networks of Zong and Jazz have suffered in some areas after Radio Base Stations (telecom towers) saw either technical or structural damage.
Meanwhile, a technical expert in Telenor said that as cables in the PTCL network were hit by rehabilitation works, the company adopted different routes that were not impacted. 
A senior IT ministry official said that all the telecom operators were using three different cable routes for traffic and all of them went down on Friday morning. 
“Despite accessibility issues, one of the cables has been recovered now, and it is being used mainly for voice traffic for all operators,” the official said, adding that if the situation deteriorates, and the cable suffers the damage again, the connectivity will drop for Quetta and other key areas. 
Sources in the ministry said Mr Haque had held discussions with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the army’s top brass to extend all possible help to the teams of PTCL and other telecom companies to repair the damaged cables and other infrastructure. 
Consumers to make calls on zero balance
On Friday evening, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced that consumers in the flood-hit areas in all the provinces can make calls even with zero balance. 
The IT and telecommunication ministry and PTA have issued directives for all mobile telecom companies to arrange the facility from Saturday (today). 
“The initiative has been taken to improve public rescue and relief efforts,” a statement by the Prime Minister Office said. 
In another development, the PTA has allocated a short code “9999” to enable mobile subscribers to donate to ‘Prime Minister’s Flood Relief Fund 2022’. Users can donate Rs10 by typing ‘fund’ in SMS and sending it to 9999.

5,Ukraine narrowly escapes nuclear disaster as plant loses power,Ukraine president urges international bodies to act faster to force Russian troops to vacate nuclear power plant site.,"KYIV: The world narrowly escaped a radiation disaster when electricity to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant was cut off for hours, Ukraine’s president said on Thursday, urging international bodies to act faster to force Russian troops to vacate the site.
President Volodymyr Zelen­sky said Russian shelling had sparked fires in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the Zaporozhzhia plant from the power grid. A Russian official said Ukraine was to blame.
Back-up diesel generators ensured power supply vital for cooling and safety systems at the plant, Zelensky said, praising the Ukrainian technicians who operate the plant under the gaze of the Russian military.
“If our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident,” he said in a video address.
“Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster... Every minute that Russian troops remain at the nuclear power station there is a risk of a global radiation catastrophe,” he said.
Residents in the capital Kyiv, about 550 km to the north-west of the plant, expre­ssed alarm at the situation.
“Of course everyone is afraid, the entire world is afraid. I really want the situation to become peaceful again,” said businessman Volodymyr, 35, who declined to give his last name. 
“I want the power shortages to be overcome and additional facilities to be operational.”  
Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said electricity for the plant’s own needs was now being supplied through a power line from Ukraine’s electricity system. It later said one of the plant’s two functioning reactors had been reconnected to that grid.
Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in the occupied town of Enerhodar near the plant, blamed Ukrainian armed forces for Thursday’s incident, saying they caused a fire in a forest near the plant.
“This was caused by the disconnection of power lines from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station as a result of provocations by Zelensky’s fighters,” Rogov wrote on Telegram. 
“The disconnection itself was triggered by a fire and short circuit on the power lines.” 
Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday its forces had destroyed a US-made M777 howitzer which it said Ukraine had used to shell the Zaporizhzhia plant. Satellite images showed a fire near the plant.
Energoatom said Thursday’s incident had been the first complete disconnection of the plant, which has become a hotspot in the six-month-old war.
18,000 without power
The regional authorities in Zaporizhzhia said more than 18,000 people across several settlements remained without electricity on Friday due to damage caused to power lines.
A cameraman said there was electricity as normal in the city of Zaporizhzhia.
Russia invaded Ukraine in February, captured the plant in March and has controlled it since, though Ukrainian staff still runs it. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling the site, fuelling fears of a nuclear disaster.
The United Nations is seeking access to the plant and has called for the area to be demilitarised. 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) officials are  “very, very close” to being able to visit Zapo­rizhzhia, agency Director-General Rafael Grossi said on Thursday.
Germany on Friday condemned Russia’s continued occupation of the plant. “The situation (there) is still very, very dangerous,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said.
Nuclear experts have warned of the risk of damage to the plant’s spent nuclear fuel pools or its reactors. Cuts in power needed to cool the pools could cause a disastrous meltdown.
Paul Bracken, a national security expert and professor at the Yale School of Management, said the concern was that artillery shells or missiles could puncture the reactor walls and spread radiation far and wide, much like the 1986 accident involving the Chornobyl reactor.
