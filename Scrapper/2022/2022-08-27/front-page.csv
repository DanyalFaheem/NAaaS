PESHAWAR / ISLAMABAD/ QUETTA: As floods continue to devastate the length and breadth of the country resulting in the death of at least 42 more people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and prompting emergency in several districts, the government decided to deploy the army in all provinces to help the civilian authorities in rescue operations in the calamity-hit areas.
At present, more than half of Pakistan is under water and millions of people have been rendered homeless as a result of flash flooding generated by abnormal monsoon rains which have entered their eighth spell with no signs of subsiding.
A notification issued to this effect said that the exact number of troops and area of deployment will be worked out by the respective provincial governments in consultation with the military operations directorate and General Headquarters.
“…The date of de-requisitioning of said deployment will be decided subsequently after mutual consultation among all stakeholders,” the notification read. 
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said the Punjab government had requisitioned the army’s deployment in Dera Ghazi Khan, while KP wanted the army’s assistance in Dera Ismail Khan. Balochistan sought the deployment of the personnel in Nasirabad, Jhal Magsi, Sohbatpur, Jafarabad and Lasbela districts while Sindh also sought the military’s help in the flood-hit districts.

Meanwhile, parts of KP witnessed devastation as the Kabul River and Swat River experienced “very high floods”, triggering evacuations by the authorities from low-lying parts of the region and imposition of emergency in Swat and other districts.
The floods which left 42 people dead in different parts of the province earlier on Friday hit Charsadda and Nowshera districts in the evening. At least 21 people were killed in Mansehra and Kohistan, 12 in Swat, five in Shangla, three in Lower Dir and one in Lakki Marwat by the time this report made it to print.
According to the provincial irrigation department officials, part of Munda headworks, which regulates flow of Swat River, collapsed. The official said last recorded river flow at the headworks was 260,000 cusecs. The Swat River at Munda Headworks in Charsadda was in very high flood with 260,000 cusecs of water flow while the Kabul River in Nowshera was experiencing “very high floods” with 176,500 cusecs at around 7pm. A Charsadda district administration also confirmed to Dawn that a 100- to 300-foot portion of the headworks collapsed, due to which water levels in Jindi and Khiyali canals had increased. 
On the other hand, authorities were working to evacuate people from the surrounding areas of both canals to safe places.

Nowshera Deputy Commissioner Mir Reza Ozgen asked the residents at risk to immediately vacate their houses and move to safer places, fearing over 400,000 cusecs of water flow on Friday night which would submerge the GT Road under three to four feet of water. Similarly, in Charsadda, the Swat River at Munda Headworks recorded a very high flood as the flow reached 260,000 cusecs; it was only 175,000 cusecs in the 2010 floods. A district administration official said that nearly 200,000 people have been evacuated to safer places in Charsadda.
Swat
Owing to the intensity of the floods, the KP government declared a rain emergency in the Swat district with immediate effect till August 30 after the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) warned of “high to very high floods” in the Swat River.
The flash floods washed away dozens of hotels, bridges, mosques and link roads in the Upper Swat district while hundreds of houses, shops and restaurants were submerged.
According to local sources, hundreds of animals, about 20 trout fish hatcheries, at least 15 bridges, about 15 hotels, five mosques and hundreds of houses were washed away by the flash floods whereas the main road between Madyan and Kalam was partially damaged, disconnecting Kalam valley with the rest of the district. The flash floods also destroyed thousands of acres of agricultural land in the valley. “About 50 hotels, five bridges, and five markets have also been washed away by the floods in Kalam,” said Aziz Kalami, a local journalist.
Quetta submerged
The highways linking Balochistan with other provinces remained non-operational on Friday as relentless rains and floods did not allow authorities to repair the damaged artery. One more bridge on the Quetta-Sukkur also suffered damage due to flooding in the Bolan River.
Meanwhile, Quetta and its outskirts remained submerged as a 36-hour-long rain spell inundated most parts of the provincial capital, bringing life to a standstill and leaving hundreds of families without homes.
Editorial: Looming shortages
In Nawan Killi, Chashma Achozai, Pashtoonabad, Hazara town, Faisal town, various localities in Sariab, Sabzal road, western and eastern bypass areas, the flood water forced the people to leave their homes.
“Several hundred people have been shifted to the Pakistan Sports Board hostels in the Ayub Stadium,” official sources told Dawn while sharing details about the magnitude of destruction.
The situation in the Nasirabad division further deteriorated as overflowing Bolan, Lehri and Nari rivers hit the protection dams in Nasirabad, Jaffarabad, Jhal Magsi and Sohbatpur districts. At least 100 villages were submerged after the Sabri dam was breached.
“We have rescued and shifted many families’ safe places and provided them relief goods, food, and drinking water in their tents,” Nasirabad Commissioner Fateh Muhammad Khajjak said who visited the affected areas.
The Lehri River flooding damaged most parts of all four districts and breached Pat Feeder and Rabi canals, putting Dera Murad Jamali and Dera Allahyar town at risk of floods. “Flood water entered some localities of Dera Allahyar town,” it was learnt.
The acting Balochistan governor in a meeting with the chief minister stressed the need for Islamabad and donors to come forward and help the province.
Acute gas shortage
The gas authorities could not repair the two gas pipelines washed away as a result of floods in the Bolan River, resulting in an acute LPG shortage across the provincial capital. Due to the high demand for LPG, the prices have shot up in the city by up to 35 per cent.
The 12-inch diameter pipeline, which supplies gas to Quetta and other towns of Balochistan, was swept away near Bibi Nani areas of the Bolan district a week after a 24-inch main pipeline was washed away in a flash flood last week.
The spokesman for Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) had asked the people to make alternative arrangements as the pipelines could only be repaired after a respite in floods.

Long queues of people were witnessed at the LPG dealers’ shops carrying gas cylinders. “We are here in a long queue for two hours but gas is not available,” Tariq Ali told Dawn while standing at the LPG shop with a cylinder.
The shop owners said that they were also “paying extra money to the LPG dealers” owing to the lack of LPG in the market. The dealers were importing gas from Iran and Karachi and due to the closure of highways the LPG supply had been suspended.
Flight, train operations suspended
Meanwhile, the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight operations were suspended due to bad weather conditions in Quetta due to weather and communication system failure, a PIA spokesman said.
The spokesman said that PIA flights PK 310 Karachi to Quetta, PK 322 Lahore to Quetta and PK 325 Islamabad to Quetta have been affected due to prevailing weather conditions. Earlier the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had temporarily closed the Nawabshah airport due to the deluge.
Also, passenger train services between Hyderabad and Khanpur have been suspended for five days due to floodwater near Nawabshah; however, freight and cargo transportation will remain operational, Railway Minister Saad Rafique said during a press conference. He said around 18 inches of floodwater had submerged a 10km stretch of the railway track near Nawabshah on the Karachi-Peshawar track, also referred to as mainline one (ML-1).
He said that Pakistan Railways, divisional headquarters and regional headquarters had decided to close passenger services on this track; however, trains from Peshawar to Multan will continue to operate.
Trains whose operations will be affected include Allama Iqbal Express, Awam Express, Farid Express, Khyber Mail, Pakistan Express, Shalimar Express, Bahauddin Zakariya Express, Hazara Express, and Tezgam, he said, adding that fares would be reimbursed.
Mr Rafique said several flood-hit parts of ML-2 and ML-3 tracks had already been closed. A major bridge on the ML-3 line was swept away by floodwater and talks had been underway with the National Logistics Cell (NLC) for an alternative arrangement to restore operations, he said.
The minister said the railway track from Karachi, Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas would remain operational and every railway bridge would be reviewed within the next 72 hours. He said shuttle trains would be run in those areas not affected by floods.
He told reporters that Pakistan Railways had suffered a loss of Rs10bn billion due to damage to its tracks and infrastructure after the flood and further losses were being assessed.
Meanwhile, the National Assembly speaker said the MNAs will donate their one-month salary whereas the NA secretariat staff would donate one-week pay to the flood funds. Separately, Marriyum Aurangzeb stated that civil servants from grades 17 to 22 have decided to donate their one-week salary to the flood relief fund.

1,UN plans $160m Flash Appeal,"FO spokesperson says appeal to be launched on Aug 30; nearly 1,000 lives lost in country due to rain-induced floods.","ISLAMABAD: The United Nat­ions will on Tuesday launch a $160 million Flash Appeal to help millions of people affected by unprecedented monsoon rains in Pakistan that triggered massive floods.
Foreign Office spokesman Asim Iftikhar, at his weekly media briefing, said: “A UN Flash Appeal is going to be launched on Tuesday 30 August simultaneously from Geneva and Islamabad.” He said the UN flash appeal was very significant, and it would trigger the international community’s response as well as bilateral assistance from other countries.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in his interaction with a group of envoys and diplomats on Friday said the government was reaching out to the friendly countries, donors and the international financial institutions for their continued cooperation at this difficult time. The meeting was attended by ambassadors and high commissioners of Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Kuwait, the UAE, Turkiye, South Korea, the US, and Germany. Senior diplomats of Bahrain, European Union, France, Oman, Qatar, the UK, and Saudi Arabia and the country representative of World Food Programme (WFP) were also present.
The international community’s response to the government’s appeal has been slow so far, while nearly 1,000 people, including 300 children, have lost their lives because of the rains and resulting flooding that impacted nearly 33 million people – almost 15 per cent of the country’s population.
Flash Appeals are made in response to sudden onset of disasters, when the government lacks the capacity to give a coordinated response and any single UN agency too cannot respond to the situation. The appeals fund urgent humanitarian needs normally for up to six months.
UN Resident Coordinator’s office and National Disaster Management Authority collaborated for the assessment of the needs on the basis of which the appeal would be launched.

2,FO condemns Pakistani prisoner’s killing in IHK,Brother of slain man claims he was tortured by Indian authorities...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has strongly condemned the extrajudicial killing of a Pakistani civilian prisoner who was incarcerated in India-held Kashmir’s Kot Bhalwal Jail since 2006. 
Islamabad called upon New Delhi to immediately share details of the incident, APP reported.
In a statement issued by the Foreign Office on Friday, the Indian charge d’affaires was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a strong protest was lodged against the “extrajudicial killing of a Pakistani prisoner, Muhammad Ali Hussain, by Indian occupation forces in a fake encounter that took place in the Arnia, IIOJK (Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir)”.
Hussain remained in held Kashmir’s jail since 2006.
“The Indian diplomat was told that Mr Hussain’s death under mysterious circumstances at a location away from the prison has once again substantiated Pakistan’s long-standing position that Indian Occupa­tion Forces in the IIOJK are routinely involved in undertaking choreographed attacks and extrajudicial killings of Pakistani and Kashmiri prisoners,” the statement said. 

Brother of slain man claims he was tortured by Indian authorities

It added that the narrative being spun that Hussain had allegedly attacked the Indian forces and attempted to escape when he was being taken to a suspected weapons’ smuggling site was not only fallacious but deceptive.
“The reality is that Hussain’s death was nothing but cold-blooded murder.” 
Liaqat, the elder brother of Hussain, rejected the Indian police claim. He said his brother had remained under Indian detention on concocted charges and was taken out of the Kot Bhalwal jail only to be eliminated, echoing the FO’s remarks. 
The FO said Pakistan “outrightly” rejected the “implausible explanation” proffered in the case and demanded the Indian government must immediately share details of the incident, including a credible post-mortem report.
The report, the FO said, would help determine the cause of death and undertake a transparent investigation to bring to account whoever was responsible for the prisoner’s murder.
Liaqat, a grocery items supplier, said Hussain contacted the family several times, telling them that the Indian army and police subjected him to severe torture.
Liaqat, however, was not sure about the circumstances leading to his brother’s landing in occupied Jammu’s jail.
In 2007, Liaqat said, an official of the Jammu jail facilitated a brief chat between the mother and her son on phone. “Ali told the mother that he was in a Kashmir jail, facing multiple criminal charges, but assured her he would be home soon.”
“My mother passed away in October 2012 in desperate wait for her son,” Liaqat said with tears rolling down his cheeks.
“On the evening of August 18, one of my acquaintances informed me that Indian police had killed Ali in a fake encounter,” Liaqat said. “My brother was killed for no sin.”
According to the FO statement, the government of India has also been called upon to ensure prompt and expeditious repatriation of the mortal remains of the deceased to Pakistan, as per the wishes of his family.
Moreover, it raised “serious concerns” over the safety, security and well-being of other Pakistani prisoners in Indian custody.
The Indian charge d’affaires was reminded of the case of Zia Mustafa, another Pakistani prisoner, who was “murdered by Indian authorities in a similar fake encounter last year”, the statement read.
It reiterated Pakistan’s call to the international community to hold India accountable for its “gross and systematic violations of international humanitarian law” and ensure that Pakistani and Kashmiri prisoners under Indian custody were not “expended as cannon fodder in the execution of India’s nefarious designs in the IIOJK”.

3,IHC dismisses contempt plea against PDM leaders,"Declares petition ""non-maintainable""; plea argued PDM leaders criticised judiciary after SC's refusal to form full court bench.","ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) on Friday dismissed a petit­ion seeking contempt proceeding aga­inst leaders of the Pakistan Democratic Mov­e­ment (PDM) as “non-maintainable”. 
The petitioner argued that PDM leadership during a press conference held on July 25, criticised the judiciary, and also attached the transcript of the presser.
On July 25, at the late-night press conference following the Supreme Court’s refusal to constitute a full court to hear the plea regarding the Punjab chief minister’s election, the ruling coalition announced a boycott of the proceedings.
Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, who heard the petition seeking contempt proceedings against the PDM leaders,  observed that the coalition leaders did not utter any word against judges of Islamabad’s judiciary and suggested the petitioner take up this matter with the persons concerned.
He asked why the petitioner, who was a resident of Lahore, had to approach the Islamabad High Court. Since the counsel could not give a cogent argument for the maintainability of the petition, Justice Kayani dismissed the application without even issuing notices to the respondents.

4,Weekly inflation surges to record 44.6pc,ISLAMABAD: Inflation measured by the Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) rose sharply during the week that ended on Aug...,"ISLAMABAD: Inflation measured by the Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) rose sharply during the week that ended on Aug 25, climbing to a record 44.6 per cent year-on-year, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics data showed on Friday. The index rose mainly because of higher prices of essential food items — mainly tomatoes, onions, pulses and cooking oil — and fuel.  
Before this, the highest ever year-on-year increase in the SPI was 42.3pc, recorded for the week ending on Aug 18 and 38.63pc in the week ending on Aug 5. 
The latest data showed that the increase in the SPI was 1.83pc on a week-on-week basis. The highest week-on-week increase in the inflation indicator was recorded at 3.68pc for the week that ended on July 28.
Soaring vegetable prices due to damage to standing crops and a massive hike in electricity rates have also contributed to higher pri­ces. The damage to standing crops will lead to higher vegetable prices in the coming weeks.
The government has already announced in the budget that it would revive sales tax on petroleum products as well as impose a petroleum development levy in phases. As a result, petrol and diesel prices are expected to increase for the next quarter.
The government projected a modest inflationary annual target of 11.5pc for the ongoing fiscal year. However, the Federal Board of Revenue, which uses inflation as a measure to gather additional tax from consumers, has projected inflation at 12.8pc. Independent economists estimate inflation to remain around 25pc to 30pc.
On Aug 22, the government also revived the national price monitoring committee after four months to keep a check on the prices of essential food items in the country.
The SPI monitors the prices of 51 essential items based on a survey of 50 markets in 17 cities. During the week under review, the prices of 23 out of 51 items increased, seven decreased and 21 remained unchanged.
The highest week-on-week increase was noted in the prices of tomatoes at 43pc, onions at 41pc, potatoes at 6.3pc, eggs at 3.4pc, garlic at 2.2pc, powdered milk at 1.5pc, and mash pulse at 1.12pc.
As for non-food items, the price of cigarettes jumped 2.3pc and LPG 1.95pc.
On a year-on-year basis, the items whose prices jumped the most included tomatoes 178pc, onions 155pc, high-speed diesel 108.8pc, petrol 94.5pc, pulse masoor 90.7pc, cooking oil’s five-litre pack 70.6pc, mustard oil 67.6pc, 2.5kg pack of vegetable ghee 64.7pc, 1kg pack of vegetable ghee 63.9pc, washing soap 63.3pc, electricity 63pc, chicken 55.8pc and gram pulse 55pc.
The SPI increased 2.7pc for the lowest income group (i.e. people earning below Rs17,732 per month) and by 1.53pc for the group with a monthly income above Rs44,175.

5,Govt slams PTI for ‘jeopardising IMF deal’,"Provincial surplus ""next to impossible"", says KP minister; Miftah says will sit down with KP counterpart to resolve differences.","• Provincial surplus ‘next to impossible’, Jhagra writes to Centre
• Miftah says will sit down with KP counterpart to resolve differences, hopes things will be settled before Fund’s board meeting
• Power users assured of relief in 24 hours
ISLAMABAD: The coalition government on Friday took exception to PTI’s “attempts to jeopardise the IMF loan programme” just days ahead of the Fund’s board meeting on Monday, with Finance Minister Miftah Ismail making an impassioned appeal to shun politics at a time when unprecedented floods have wreaked havoc on every nook and cranny of the country.
In a joint statement, the ruling parties criticised the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for “playing politics” after it allegedly refused to implement the terms of the IMF agreement in a letter as part of “a ploy to plunge Pakistan into a flood of economic crisis”.
The late-night statement was part of a series of events emerging out of the letter written on Friday by KP Finance Minister Taimur Khan Jhagra to his federal counterpart Miftah Ismail.
In the letter, Mr Jhagra informed Mr Ismail that his KP administration might find it difficult to run a provincial surplus this year in view of flood-related damages.
Ensuring surpluses by provinces this fiscal year is a key requirement previously agreed upon to revive the IMF programme.
Mr Jhagra said running a surplus would be “next to impossible” if the federal government didn’t resolve certain issues, such as budget allocations for ex-Fata, monthly transfers of net hydel profits as per agreed terms, immediately reviving the National Finance Commission award, etc.
Reacting to the letter in his second presser of the day late in the night, Finance Minister Ismail criticised what he called PTI’s “atte­mpts to sabotage the IMF deal”.
Addressing the press conference alongside Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, the finance minister said throwing a spanner in the works at this stage might destroy Pakistan’s economy.
He regretted that the PTI was “doing politics” at a time when rain-induced floods have affected millions of families across the country. “If you can’t stop politics even at this time, let the country go to default,” he thundered.
However, Mr Ismail hoped the matter would be settled when he meets Mr Jhagra on Monday. “Taimur Jhagra is an honourable man,” he said, adding the KP minister had told him that he hadn’t forwarded the letter to the IMF, an allegation earlier doing the rounds on the media. “I hope the IMF will approve the programme on Monday,” he said.
Mr Ismail also slammed PTI leaders and former ministers Fawad Chaudhry and Shaukat Tarin for suggesting that Punjab and KP governments would not cooperate with the federal government over the IMF programme.
Earlier in the press conference, Miftah Ismail said the government would provide 1.15 million flood-hit families with Rs25,000 cash assistance each in the next week.
Relief to power users
Meanwhile, the government announced on Friday that it would provide relief to the consumers using up to 200 units of electricity in 24 hours and constituted a high-level committee to address their complaints.
The announcement by the prime minister came following the severe countrywide criticism of his government’s decision to raise the power tariff multiplying the miseries of the masses.
In another press conference earlier in the day, Mr Ismail said decisions about the increase in electricity tariff as well as petroleum products were taken with the approval of the prime minister.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also directed the officials of power distribution companies (Discos) to work round the clock for correcting the bills. He directed that holidays of the Discos staff be cancelled for immediate completion of this task and a report in this regard be submitted to him.
Mr Sharif said banks should also be directed to remain open on holidays to receive the payment of electricity bills.
The correction of the bills of 16.6 million consumers is being done as per the relief given in the fuel price adjustment (FCA).
At the press conference, Miftah Ismail said the government was also weighing options to provide further relief to the people burdened by high electricity bills. The committee will deliberate what relief can be given to the power consumers using between 200 and 300 units per month, he added.
The finance minister said the increase in power tariff was in line with the conditions of the International Monetary Fund and expensive electricity generation combined with higher temperatures in May.
“Our anticipated charges were Rs6 per unit, but actual charges were around Rs100 because coal became very expensive and gas prices were the highest on record. May was very hot,” he said, adding that there was a day when the electricity demand rose beyond 30,000 megawatts.
“We generated 25,000MW which was the maximum we can. We have informed the IMF about the removal of FCA on those using less than 200 units,” the minister said, adding this would cost the national exchequer Rs20-21 billion.
The corrected bills will be sent to the consumers soon, while the amount already paid would be adjusted in the bill for the month of September.
The last date for the payment of bills is now Aug 31.
IMF bailout package
The finance minister said the IMF executive board would meet on the night between Aug 29 and 30 and approve the loan tranche for Pakistan. He said Pakistan had fulfilled all the requirements of IMF and would receive the next tranche after the board meeting.
He refuted rumours that the government was planning to sell Roosevelt Hotel in New York, which is owned by Pakistan International Airlines, or the airline itself, to Qatar. There have been no talks in this regard, he added.
The Gulf country was primarily interested in leasing Pakistan’s airports for long-term and managing them, constructing terminals at ports, LNG plants and large-scale solar farms, he said, adding that Qatar may also invest in the stock market.
The minister welcomed Qatar’s announcement of investing $3bn in Pakistan, saying that with this amount, Pakistan had collected $5bn in funding compared to the IMF’s demand of $4bn.
Responding to criticism by PML-N leader Abid Sher Ali for his “anti-people policies”, Mr Ismail said the country needed $40bn to deal with its current account deficit and debt repayments.
“I ask Abid Sher Ali and all my brothers to tell me of any decision I took that Shehbaz Sharif did not agree with. If the petroleum levy or FCA is imposed, it is done so with PM Shehbaz’s permission. It is easy to criticise me but everyone knows the facts,” he explained.
