3,Imran asks KP govt to accelerate relief efforts for flood victims,Visits flood-hit Dera Ismail Khan and Tank districts.,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman Imran Khan on Friday asked for an immediate acceleration of relief efforts for the flood victims in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as he visited the flood-hit Dera Ismail Khan and Tank districts to oversee the situation and meet the marooned families.
Talking to mediapersons after inspecting the flood relief camp set up for the affected people at the Ratta Kulachi Sports Complex here, the PTI chairman said that the calamity had surpassed the destruction caused by the 2010 floods in Sindh.
“We used to think of the 2010 floods as an unimaginable catastrophe, but according to reports, the devastation and the loss of life caused this time is far greater. 
The construction of dams is extremely important for Pakistan. If there were dams, this water could have played an important role in the development of the region but now the entire nation will have to bear the burden of the flood damage in Sindh and Balochistan. During my tenure, I had planned to construct 10 dams,” he said.

Imran said, “I am under pressure to raise funds from the public for flood relief, but I will not raise funds until I have a clear picture of whether I can spend the money fairly or not. Our governments in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab will actively participate in all possible relief activities for the flood victims.”
The PTI chairman issued instructions to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan to ensure immediate release of funds for the rehabilitation of the victims after assessing the losses on an emergency basis. He also appreciated the efforts of the district administration and provincial departments.
Speaking on the occasion, Chief Minister Mahmood Khan said his government was with the flood victims and would not leave them alone in this hour of difficulty. He said that an emergency had been declared in Dera Ismail Khan district to speed up the rescue and relief activities and ensure early rehabilitation of the affected people.
“Officials of the rescue and other departments are being dispatched from nearby districts to DI Khan so timely relief activities can be carried out,” he added.

Chairing a meeting of the divisional intelligence implementation committee at his office the other day, he said the divisional and district administrations would not tolerate plying of unregistered vehicles on local roads.

6,"PHC suspends notification for cases against opposition leaders, seeks govt response",Petitioner insists PTI govt misinterpreted law for political gains.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Friday suspended the recent government notification for the empowerment of the Dera Ismail Khan district administration to register cases against the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement’s leaders on the charge of spreading hate against state institutions.
A bench consisting of Justice Wiqar Ahmad and Justice Shahid Khan issued notices to the provincial chief minister, chief secretary, advocate general and relevant officials seeking their response to the petition of advocate Shabbir Hussain Gigyani against the Aug 9 notification.
It fixed Sept 13 for next hearing into the case suspending action on the notification until then.
The petitioner contended that the government misinterpreted Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for empowering an additional assistant commissioner (AAC) to receive complaints from former federal minister Ali Ameen Gandapur or any other interested party and lodge FIRs with police.

Petitioner insists PTI govt misinterpreted law for political gains

He requested the court to suspend the notification until the final disposal of the petition as an interim relief saying as there is strong apprehension of its misuse and abuse by the respondents, including the government, to cause ‘chaos in the peaceful political and social atmosphere’ of the province.
Mr Gigyani insisted that the notification was meant to misuse the law to achieve political goals and create anarchy in the province.
The provincial cabinet had allowed the registration of cases on Aug 18 and issued the impugned notification the next day declaring, “In exercise of powers conferred by Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and in pursuance of cabinet decision on August 18, 2022, KP government is pleased to empower Mr Muneer Ahmed, Additional Assistant Commissioner, Dera Ismail Khan, to receive written complaints from Mr Gandapur or any other interested party and require local police to lodge FIRs under sections 108A, 153-A and 505 of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with any other enabling provisions of law, and to sanction and pursue such cases within his respective jurisdiction with effect from August 18, 2022.”
Section 153-A of the law deals with cases against those promoting enmity among different groups, while Section 108-A is about abetment in Pakistan of offences committed overseas.
Section 505 of the PPC covers statements on public mischief.
Mr Gigyani argued that the respondents had wrongly interpreted Section 196 of the CrPC and issued the impugned notification for the registration of FIR, initiation of criminal proceedings, and opening of criminal cases against anyone.
He contended that Section 196 of the CrPC was meant for empowering the courts to take cognisance for trial of any such offence mentioned in the said section after completion of investigation and was not applicable before registration of FIR or case.
The petitioner said Section 196 of the CrPC was meant for trial by courts and not for the lodging of FIR, initiation of criminal cases or institution of criminal complaints.
He said the section in question did not empower any ‘officer’ what to say about a private person (Mr Gandapur) to direct registration of FIR or initiation of a criminal case.
Additional advocate general Rabnawaz Khan appeared for the provincial government and requested the court not to suspend the notification.
The respondents in the petition are the chief minister, chief and law secretaries, Mr Gandapur and the administration department’s cabinet section through its secretary and deputy secretary.

8,KP asks centre to honour commitment on ex-Fata funds,"Jhagra writes to Miftah, demands net hydel profit","PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has demanded of the federal government to honour the commitments it had made earlier this year with the province regarding provision of funds to address major financial issues being faced by the province mostly related to the merged tribal districts. 
The demand was made through a letter, which was sent by provincial finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra to federal finance minister Miftah Ismail. 
The federal government had earlier agreed in the Memorandum of Economic and Fiscal Policies inked with the IMF to present a MoU signed by provinces for the provision of around Rs750 billion cash surplus by them. 
The KP had signed the document when the centre agreed to finance the Sehat Card programme for the merged districts, increase the region’s current budget, transfer net hydel profit (NHP) to the province on a regular basis and revive the National Finance Commission. 

Jhagra writes to Miftah, demands net hydel profit 

‘Provincial surpluses in the IMF MOU’ is the subject of the letter, which has been sent to the federal government as a follow-up to the earlier one sent to the finance minister on the same topic on July 6 this year. 
“When we last met, the federal government had committed to resolve our major financial issues,” Mr Jhagra reminded Mr Miftah. 
In the letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the provincial government has drawn the federal government’s attention towards “criticality of the issues”, including budgetary allocation for merged districts, financing merged districts Sehat Card scheme and rehabilitation of displaced persons, payment of net hydel profit and National Finance Commission awards. 
In the letter the provincial government has urged the federal government to resolve the issue of budget allocations for ex-Fata, which, in the absence of an updated NFC award, is decided at the discretion of the federal government; resolve the issue of current budget allocations for ex-Fata, which are insufficient to cover even the monthly salary costs of existing employees; finance the transfer of the Sehat Card programme for the six million residents of ex-Fata; and ensure adequate budgeting to cater to the needs of the Temporarily Displaced Persons. 
The provincial government has also reminded the federal government to commit to monthly NHP transfers based on the MoU, which was signed between the federal government and KP government in 2016. This MoU was signed during the previous PML-N government. 
Through the letter, Mr Jhagra also demanded of the federal government to immediately revive the NFC so that these issues could be resolved permanently, and to also commit to immediately engage and resolve other financial issues with the KP government. 
These include clearing outstanding liabilities to the Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organisation; resolving the issues of energy wheeling; ensuring availability of natural gas to the province in line with Article 158; financing of Pesco to develop transmission and distribution infrastructure in the province; and execution of provincially-funded Pesco and Tesco projects. 
“We estimate that the overall impact of not resolving these issues is actually to create Rs100 billion unfunded liability in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa budget,” reads the letter. 
The provincial government has also mentioned in the letter the new challenges created by the devastating floods. It states that the monsoon flooding has wreaked destruction in Swat, DI Khan and Tank that may make the damage from this year’s flooding greater than the super floods of 2010. 
The letter states that the cost in terms of rescue, relief, rehabilitation and building back is likely to run into tens of billions.

GOVT CRITICISED: Awami National Party and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz in separate meetings here on Friday alleged that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, which was ruling Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since 2013, had destroyed the public sector hospitals in the name of medical teaching institutions (MTIs). 
“In fact, PTI has badly disturbed the delivery of health services across the province by introducing MTI Act, 2015. It was a step towards privatisation of public sector hospitals in the province,” claimed ANP leader Mukhtiar Khan. 
He added that the provincial government had created more health-related problems instead of resolving them amid rising health expenditures and medicine prices. 
PML-N leader Dildar Khan demanded that the government should withdraw the MTI Act and abolish fee in the public sector health units.
