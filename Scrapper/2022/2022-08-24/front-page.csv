ISLAMABAD: As massive floods across Pakistan have so far claimed at least 830 lives since July, the government on Tuesday decided to launch an international appeal seeking funds for relief and rehabilitation of flood-hit people and restoration of damaged infrastructure.
This decision was taken during an urgent briefing on the flood emergency in Pakistan by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), which was summoned to reassess the damage done by floods and to apprise the development partners and donors of the magnitude of the crisis.
In addition to looking outward for assistance to mitigate the devastation caused by abnormal monsoon downpour, Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif also appealed to the nation to extend help to the flood-stricken people as the government required hundreds of billions to rehabilitate the flood victims.
“The current relief operation needs Rs 80 billion and hundreds of billions of rupees also required to overcome the losses as well as for rehabilitation of the victims,” the prime minister said in a video message.
Editorial: Climate catastrophe
Sharing details about the relief announced by the government, the premier said the government was distributing Rs37.2 billion as cash relief whereas funds to the tune of Rs5 billion had “immediately” been released to the NDMA to accelerate the rescue efforts.
PM Sharif said Rs25,000 cash assistance was being paid to the flood victims. Similarly, the government would also provide compensation of Rs1 million to the families of the deceased, along with additional support for the injured and damages caused to the houses, he added.
Appeal for funds
The participants of the NDMA meeting chaired by the planning minister, Ahsan Iqbal, were told that so far the floods had claimed 830 lives, left at least 1,348 injured, and rendered thousands of people across the country homeless.
During the meeting, the planning minister asked the governments of Balochistan and Sindh – which are the two worst-hit provinces – to formally requisition the military for help in dealing with the disasterous floods.
Speaking at the meeting, Climate Change Minister Sherry Rehman called for immediate humanitarian and rescue efforts in the wake of devastating floods as she admitted Pakistan was not able to cope with the situation on its own.

“Right now we are in the seventh spell of a torrential monsoon that has left thousands homeless, 830 dead and 1,348 injured. From Balochistan, the monsoon system has moved to Sindh where 30 districts are underwater. The magnitude of it can be accessed from the fact that it has rained more than 395 per cent in Sindh and 379 per cent in Balochistan, above the average rainfall.”
The senator compared the current calamity with super floods in 2010 that had wreaked havoc in Pakistan and said at least 30 districts of Sindh, almost the entire Balochistan, and south Punjab were facing an unprecedented humanitarian disaster. “People are adrift, livestock and crops are damaged. It is a humanitarian disaster of unprecedented monsoon proportions.”
Ms Rehman added the provincial and federal governments were incapable of dealing with the situation given the magnitude of the disaster and urged international partners to mobilise assistance. “The Indus is in high floods where the flow of over 600,000 cusecs is expected to cross Guddu and then Sukkur barrages on August 23 and 24, which will bring all the katcha area along the Indus under water, displacing thousands of families.”
At least 216 lives have been lost, an estimated 1,500,000 mud houses have been damaged and crops cultivated on 1,989, 868 acres have been completely destroyed in Sindh, the senator added while sharing details about the damages.
Rs76m aid from EU
Meanwhile, the European Union agreed to provide Rs76 million for crucial humanitarian assistance which will focus on addressing the urgent needs of those most affected in some of the hardest-hit districts of Jhal Magsi and Lasbela.
“The devastating floods have left a trail of destruction in Pakistan, causing many to suffer the loss of their homes, livelihoods, and belongings,” said Taheeni Thammannagoda, who oversees EU humanitarian programmes in Pakistan. “The EU funding will help get vital assistance to the most vulnerable people to support them during this hard time,” a press release by the EU mission in Islamabad added.
Balochistan toll reaches 232
Meanwhile, thousands of families remained stranded in Balochistan amid heavy rains and flash floods that swept away houses and inundated entire settlements. The province remained disconnected from the rest of the country as authorities concerned failed to restore the road and rail links connecting Balochistan to other provinces.
As the authorities warned of further rainfall, the death toll due to the deluge hit 232 amid reports that dozens who had been washed away in hill torrents remained missing.

In Dera Bugti, 207 houses were completely damaged and 147 were partially damaged. A vehicle with six passengers on board was swept away near Sui, resulting in the death of one person. Three persons were rescued while the whereabouts of the remaining two remained unknown.
The traffic between Pakistan-Afghanistan at Chaman and Pakistan-Iran at Taftan also witnessed disruption due to the heavy downpour that damaged highways connecting the country with its neighbours. According to official sources, Nasirabad, Jaffarabad, Sohbatpur, Jhal Magsi, Kalat, Bolan, and Lasbela districts were facing heavy floods.

1,High court summons Imran for ‘contempt’ of judge,Court terms PTI chief’s remarks against ADSJ who granted Gill’s remand ‘highly inappropriate’,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman Imran Khan was summoned on Tuesday to appear before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on August 31 as prosecutors are considering charging him with contempt after he threatened a woman judge, who approved the remand of his chief of staff Shahbaz Gill in a sedition case.
A three-member bench — headed by Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and consisting of Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb — observed that the PTI chief’s remarks against the additional district and sessions judge (ADSJ) were “highly inappropriate” and “uncharitable”.
The court directed Islamabad Advocate General Jahangir Khan Jadoon to provide additional security to the judge as Mr Khan’s rem­arks could jeopardise her safety.
The bench issued a show-cause notice to Mr Khan and a notice to the attorney general. It referred the matter to the IHC chief justice to increase the number of judges on the bench. “This is a matter of public importance and relates to the administration of justice. Therefore, we want to decide it once and for all,” Justice Kayani said.

Court terms PTI chief’s remarks against ADSJ who granted Gill’s remand ‘highly inappropriate’

The bench served notice on Mr Khan under Section 17 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance 2004. As per the section, contempt proceedings “shall be commenced by the issuance of a notice, or a show-cause notice, at the discretion of the court”. Besides, it says the alleged contemnor “shall appear in person” in response to a show-cause notice.
During Tuesday’s hearing, Adv­o­cate General Jadoon told the high court that on behalf of the state, he had filed a civil miscellaneous application to bring some facts related to the Aug 20 speech of Imran Khan on judicial record.
“We will not spare you,” Mr Khan said in the speech that named the police chief and the judge involved in the case against the aide. “We will sue you.”
He accused the judiciary of showing a “biased” attitude towards his party, saying that it should brace itself for consequences. He also threatened the sessions judge with dire consequences for handing over the custody of Shahbaz Gill to the Islamabad police.
Justice Kayani remarked that this was not a threat to a judge, but the sanctity of the entire judiciary had been jeopardised.
He said the people came to court as an option of last resort to settle their dispute and it would lead to anarchy if we allowed some influential people to hijack the judicial system since people would take the law into their own hands.
The court then asked the advocate general whether the PTI chief should be issued a notice or a show-cause notice, to which he replied that a show-cause notice should be issued based on the first impression.
The advocate general said Mr Khan censured the sessions judge while she was hearing the criminal revision related to Mr Gill’s remand case and the matter was not only pending before the said judge, but it was also being heard by the IHC.
Justice Kayani wondered how someone could utter such remarks while the matter was sub judice. Mr Khan also threatened the inspector general of police in his speech, he said, adding that such a mindset would lead to anarchy as the institution could not work in such an environment.
Legal expert Kashif Ali Malik recalled that it wasn’t the first time Mr Khan was facing contempt proceedings. In 2013, the Supreme Court dropped contempt charges against Mr Khan and advised that “politicians and other public figures … are expected to use more decent and guarded language … so as to show their intellect, maturity of mind and wisdom qua respect to various national institutions and present themselves as role models”.

2,KP govt to book PDM leaders for ‘fanning hate’,PESHAWAR/DERA ISMAIL KHAN: The Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa government announced on Tuesday that it would be registering...,"PESHAWAR/DERA ISMAIL KHAN: The Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa government announced on Tuesday that it would be registering cases against the leadership of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) on charges of ‘spreading hate against state institutions’.
In a statement, KP government spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said the provincial government had decided to take action against the PDM leaders for making hateful statements against state institutions in the recent past. He said the provincial cabinet had allowed the registration of cases.
On the other hand, the KP government, through a notification, empowered a government official in Dera Ismail Khan district to receive complaints from senior PTI leader Ali Amin Khan Gandapur or any other interested party for registration of cases falling under certain sections of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which otherwise require the permission from the provincial government to do so.
“In exercise of powers conferred by Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Proce­dure and in pursuance of cabinet decision on August 18, 2022, KP government is pleased to empower Mr Muneer Ahmed, Additional Assistant Commissioner, Dera Ismail Khan, to receive written complaints from Mr Ali Ameen Khan Gandapur or any other interested party and require local police to lodge FIRs under sections 108-A, 153-A and 505 of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with any other enabling provisions of law, and to sanction and pursue such cases within his respective jurisdiction with effect from August 18, 2022,” the notification stated.
Section 153-A deals with cases against those promoting enmity between different groups, while 108-A deals with abetment in Pakistan of offences outside it. Section 505 covers statement relating to public mischief.
Similarly, a Peshawar-based lawyer has approached Peshawar’s East Cantonment police station, seeking registration of FIRs against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, Khawaja Saad Rafique, Attaullah Tarar, Pervez Rashid, Ayaz Sadiq, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and others for inciting the public against the army, putting Pakistan’s security in jeopardy, making statements against the judiciary, hurting the country’s ideological base and promoting rebellion through their statements.
In his written application, lawyer Noor Sher stated that he recently watched and heard PDM leaders’ statements on social media and was shocked to see the bravado with which the people named in the application had used hateful and incendiary language against Pakistan Army. He said the statements were tantamount to rebellion and treason and only anti-Pakistan elements could make such statements.
A city police spokesperson confirmed receiving the application and said police were reviewing legal opinion on this matter. “Any decision on this application will be made following considering its legal aspects,” he added.
On the other hand, the Peshawar administration said no official had been tasked with receiving application against the PDM leaders like in Dera Ismail Khan.

3,India sacks 3 officials over missile mishap,ISLAMABAD: India on Tuesday blamed the March 9 firing of a missile into Pak­istan on violation of Stan­dard...,"ISLAMABAD: India on Tuesday blamed the March 9 firing of a missile into Pak­istan on violation of Stan­dard Operating Proce­dures and sacked three Indian Air Force (IAF) officials.
A mid-range BrahMos cruise missile had struck a cold storage in Mian Channu after originating from India.
No loss of life occurred due to the incident, which India had then claimed to have happened accidentally during a routine maintenance operation because of a technical malfunction.
The missile travelled 124km inside Pakistan for three minutes and 44 seconds, but it was not shot down by Pakistani air defences. The military had claimed to have tracked the missile all along its route till it hit the cold storage.
The incident could have potentially prompted a catastrophic accidental excha­nge between the two nuclear armed neighbours.
According to a press statement issued by IAF from New Delhi: “A Court of Inquiry (Col), set up to establish the facts of the case, including fixing responsibility for the incident, found that deviation from the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) by three officers led to the accidental firing of the missile.”
“These three officers have primarily been held responsible for the incident. Their services have been terminated by the Central Govt with immediate effect. Termination orders have been served upon the officers on 23 Aug 22,” it further said.
The IAF did not identify the three officers. Indian media, meanwhile, claimed that the three were mid ranking officers. An officer of the rank of group captain was in charge of the BrahMos battery from which the missile was launched.
The statement insisted that the incident happened accidentally meaning the violation of SOPs by the sacked officers was not willful.
The CoI, which was headed by a two star air force general, took five and a half months to reach this conclusion. Soon after the formation of CoI, Pakistan had rejected it and demanded a joint probe into the incident on the grounds that the missile had hit a site inside Pakistani territory.
Islamabad had also questioned the safety and security of Indian weapon systems. There was, however, no immediate reaction from Islamabad following the IAF statement on the findings of CoI.
Some officials, speaking privately on the background, expressed dissatisfaction on the outcome and said more answers were needed. “The Indian explanation isn’t enough,” one of them maintained.
They said the incident exposed Indian capability to manage its arsenal and the high-end technologies possessed by it. Moreover, they reminded that Indian military was increasingly getting radicalised, which could have repercussions for regional peace and security.

4,"PAC invites ex-CJP, SC registrar for dam fund briefing","• Directs NAB to recover KP’s chopper expenses from Imran, others • Wants Azam Khan’s name placed on ECL","• Directs NAB to recover KP’s chopper expenses from Imran, others
• Wants Azam Khan’s name placed on ECL
ISLAMABAD: The Public Accounts Committee of the National Assembly on Tuesday invited former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar and the Supreme Court’s registrar to brief the committee on the Diamer-Bhasha Dam Fund.
The former CJP had taken the initiative of collecting donations for the Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand dams by launching the fund in July 2018, which was later joined by former prime minister Imran Khan, making it a joint venture to overcome the country’s water scarcity.
The fund had hit Rs10 billion in collections by March 2019, while reportedly incurring Rs13bn as advertisement expenses, according to PML-N’s Ahsan Iqbal.
Barjees Tahir, a PAC member and PML-N MNA, claimed that Rs14bn was spent on ads against an overall collection of Rs9bn, calling for an explanation on why the funds were not used on the construction of dams.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed suggested that an inquiry should be conducted regarding utilisation of the funds.
The committee observed that since the fund has not been utilised for dam construction, it is appropriate to seek an explanation from the SC registrar in this regard.
It may be mentioned that the Supreme Court registrar used to appear before the PAC to explain audit objections on the financial affairs of the apex court.
However, after his restoration as chief justice of Pakistan, Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry had stopped the registrar from appearing before the parliamentary forum.
Former PAC chairman Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan had strongly opposed the move and ultimately tendered his resignation.
The registrar has thus far refused to appear before the PAC, arguing that the Supreme Court does not fall under the PAC’s ambit.
Helicopter expenses
The committee directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to recover from former premier Imran Khan the amount incurred as expenses on the use of a helicopter of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government.
The committee, which met under the chairmanship of Noor Alam Khan, directed NAB to write a letter to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in this regard. The lawmakers deliberated upon the fund established by the ex-chief justice for the construction of Diamer-Bhasha dam and the members agreed to convene a meeting where the SC registrar, as well as Justice Nisar, would brief the members on the fund.
The NAB chairman told the committee that the former PM had used the KP government’s helicopter for 156 hours during 2013 to 2018. In this time, over Rs70 million was spent on the helicopter. He further said that the NAB was taking steps for the amount’s recovery.
Arrest warrant
The PAC had also asked former principal secretary to prime minister Azam Khan to attend the meeting, but he did not comply with the direction. While expressing displeasure over his absence, the committee at the meeting directed to the relevant authorities for issuance of arrest warrant.
The PAC issued directions to the interior secretary and director general of the Federal Investigation Agency to place his name on the Exit Control List (ECL).
It also directed that NAB chairman, DGs and directors to submit their income tax returns since the date they had joined the bureau. It asked NAB chairman to complete the inquiry of Billion Trees case within six months and submit reports on a monthly basis.
At the meeting, the NAB chairman apprised the committee that 1,800 unauthorized persons utilized helicopters of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government without paying their official charges.
The committee directed the NAB chairman to write a letter to the Election Commission of Pakistan to stop their nominations to contest the elections until the payments of official charges.
It also decided that there should be no confrontation with the ministries, divisions, departments, including NAB, and all the decisions by the PAC would be made as per Constitution and Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the National Assembly. The participants agreed that no discriminatory treatment would be tolerated with any officer.
The PAC directed the NAB to pursue the court case of Peshawar BRT vigorously. It directed the auditor general to check the accounts of NAB’s officers. It also directed the FIA to finalize the inquiry pertaining to Broadsheet scandal within a month.
