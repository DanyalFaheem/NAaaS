0,Industry leaders slam govt failure in dealing with economic challenges,"Urge govt to fix dollar rate, appoint SBP chief and declare economic emergency.","• Differ over notion Pakistan facing Sri Lanka-like crisis • Urge govt to fix dollar rate, appoint SBP chief, declare economic emergency 
KARACHI: A sort of rift appears to have emerged as the top leadership of Businessman Group (BMG) has contested the warning of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) chief that Pakistan is heading towards a Sri Lanka-like crisis.
On Thursday, FPCCI chief Irfan Iqbal Sheikh told a press conference that a national security issue had emerged after a steep fall in the rupee value and if the dollar appreciation was not contained, “Pakistan would become Sri Lanka.”
He said importers were running from pillar to post in getting the dollar and in case the situation persists, a petrol crisis would emerge as banks were opening the letters of credit (LCs) at Rs242 for a dollar.
Highlighting the government’s non-seriousness, Mr Irfan said the government had yet to appoint a full-fledged State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor, while the acting SBP chief is not interested to meet with the FPCCI leadership.
As a result, commercial banks were enjoying a heyday by indulging in speculation about the exchange rate, which was evident from the forward buying of a dollar at Rs245, he said.
He urged the government to appoint a permanent SBP government in the next 48 hours and also fix rupee-dollar parity for the next 15 days to avert any serious economic meltdown.
Speaking at a press conference after chairing an SOS meeting of key stakeholders representing all economic sectors at the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) on the current economic crisis, BMG chairman Zubair Motiwala ruled out the possibility of a Sri Lanka-like crisis saying that Pakistan was a land of 220m people and an agrarian country with very different dynamics.
Over 50 representatives of trade and industry including prominent businessmen like Muhammad Ali Tabba, Aqeel Karim Dhedhi and Ali Jameel attended the brainstorming session to find workable solutions to revive the deteriorating economy.
They called upon the government to immediately impose an economic emergency and fix the dollar rate for at least a month.
Mr Motiwala and KCCI President Muhammad Idrees expressed deep concerns over the government’s non-serious attitude towards dealing with economic challenges, heightened political uncertainty, steep currency devaluation, ineffective SBP role and unregulated profiteering by banks.
He demanded that the SBP governor should be appointed as soon as possible to manage the affairs of the central bank.
The industries are unable to ascertain the selling price and manufacturing cost of their products amid such an intense level of exchange rate uncertainty, Mr Motiwala added.
Mr Idrees said the decision to ban the import of raw materials to reduce import bill should be reconsidered as it will have adverse consequences on the economy as it will lead to halting the production processes, resulting in decreased progress, leading to reduced export quantity as well.
Meanwhile, Hyderabad Cha­mber of Commerce and Indu­stry President Adeel Siddiqui in a statement on Thursday urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to impose an economic emergency without any delay and also consult all stakeholders to find out a solution to the foreign exchange crisis. 
He said that a crisis like Sri Lanka was staring at Pakistan and deplored the fact that the federal government had yet to appoint the SBP governor.

1,ADB sees chance of recovery in FY23,ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) in a new report released on Thursday forecast Pak­istan’s economic...,"ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) in a new report released on Thursday forecast Pak­istan’s economic growth will recover slightly during the fiscal year 2022-23, while it is expected to moderate in FY22 that ended last month. 
Inflation is marginally revised up for FY22 and substantially so for FY23. In addition to the effects of elevated global energy and food prices, the government’s efforts to revive the stalled International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme has meant raising power tariffs and withdrawing subsidies in the oil and power sectors, says the supplement report of ‘Asian Development Outlook’. 
In South Asia, the headline inflation is in double digits in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and in most of the Caucasus and Central Asia and Southeast Asia. In Pakistan, the headline inflation, which was 12.3 per cent in December 2021, rose to 21.3pc in June 2022. But headline and core inflation in the rest of developing Asia’s large economies remain manageable, the report says. 
So far in the region as a whole, inflation remains moderate on average and much lower than elsewhere in the world, it says. 
The supplement report revised the growth forecast for developing Asia from 5.2pc to 4.6pc for 2022 and from 5.3pc to 5.2pc for 2023, reflecting worsened economic prospects because of Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine, more aggressive monetary tightening in advanced economies, Covid-19 lockdowns in China.
The outlook compares with a projection of 5.2pc issued by the ADB in April. The bank also raised its forecast for inflation in the region, amid higher prices for food and fuel.
The ADB report lowered the economic growth of South Asia from 7pc to 6.5pc for 2022 and from 7.4pc to 7.1pc for 2023, mainly due to economic crisis in Sri Lanka and high inflation and associated monetary tightening in India. The inflation forecast for developing Asia is raised from 3.7pc to 4.2pc for 2022 and from 3.1pc to 3.5pc for 2023 due to higher fuel and food prices. Inflation pressures in the region are, however, less than elsewhere in the world. 
Even though the impact of Covid-19 has declined across most of developing Asia, the economic fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the region has increased. War-induced supply disruptions and escalating sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation have led to global commodity prices spiking and remaining higher than 2021’s already elevated levels. Because of this, inflationary pressures have increased in many regional economies. 
Risks to developing Asia’s economic outlook remain elevated and mainly associated with external factors. A substantial slowdown in global growth could hurt exports, manufacturing activity, and employment prospects, and cause turbulence in financial markets. The aggressive monetary tightening by the Fed and other major central banks — even if largely anticipated — could damage growth and rattle financial markets in the region.

2,Power companies seek to charge additional Rs155bn in August,Discos have sought permission to raise about Rs133bn additional funds in August.,"ISLAMABAD: Bad news continues to pour in for electricity consumers almost daily as K-Electric and ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) on Thursday sought to generate more than Rs155 billion through unprecedented Rs11.4 and Rs9.90 per unit additional fuel cost adjustment (FCA), respectively, for electricity consumed in June.
A day earlier, National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) had concluded a hearing on a government directive for about Rs7.91 per unit increase in average base tariff across the country in three phases, starting from the current month. The government has also approved a Rs1.55 per unit increase in base tariff across the country under a quarterly adjustment.
Nepra on Thursday said it had accepted for hearing separate tariff petitions from the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), on behalf of all ex-Wapda Discos, for a record Rs9.90 per unit monthly FCA for electricity sold to consumers in June. This will generate about Rs133bn in additional funds in August. The additional FCA is almost 166pc higher than the reference fuel cost charged to consumers in June, which is an unprecedented mismatch between estimated and actual fuel cost.
Separately, KE’s request for Rs11.4 per unit additional FCA for June was accepted for a public hearing to generate Rs22.25bn. Both the hearings have been called on July 28 for verifying evidence and fuel invoices. KE said the major reason behind its higher FCA was 50pc expensive LNG and 74pc increase in power purchase from CPPA.

Regulator fixes public hearing on 28th 

Data showed that despite 51pc power generation from cheaper domestic resources with static prices, Discos have sought permission to raise about Rs133bn additional funds in August.
The CPPA claimed that the consumers were charged a reference fuel cost of Rs5.93 per unit in June, but the actual cost turned out to be Rs15.84 per unit, hence an additional charge of about Rs9.9 per unit to consumers, up 166pc.
The higher electricity rates, once approved, would be charged to all consumers in the next billing month except to those using less than 50 units.
Data shows that the share of domestic fuel sources in overall power generation was slightly lower at 51.58pc in June compared to a robust 54pc in May and better than 50pc in April and 45pc in March. The share of hydropower supply in the overall basket stood almost unchanged at more than 24pc as in May. Hydropower has no fuel cost.
The share of nuclear power almost dropped by 50pc to 9pc in June from 13pc in May and 17.37pc in April because of the closure of 1,100MW K-2 for re-fuelling.
As a result, the biggest contribution of over 24.43pc in overall power supply came from imported RLNG-based power plants, partly at very expensive rates, and its share was nominally higher than 23pc in May. The share of domestic gas in power generation stood increased to almost 11pc in June against 10pc in May and April.

3,US charges ex-Coinbase worker with crypto insider trading,"US Attorney Damian Williams says case shows the digital assets space ""is not a law-free zone"".","WASHINGTON: US authorities on Thursday charged and arrested a former employee of a major digital exchange in what they called the first-ever cryptocurrency insider trading case.
The Justice Department charged former Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi, saying he released confidential information about coming listings to his brother Nikhil Wahi, and friend Sameer Ramani, who also were charged in the scheme alleged to be worth $1.5 million.
US Attorney Damian Williams said the case shows the digital assets space  “is not a law-free zone.”  “Just last month, I announced the first ever insider trading case involving NFTs (non-fungible tokens), and today I announce the first ever insider trading case involving cryptocurrency markets,” he said in a statement.
“Fraud is fraud is fraud, whether it occurs on the blockchain or on Wall Street,” Williams added.
Ishan Wahi had access to confidential information about when new assets would be listed by Coinbase, and tipped off his brother and friend allowing them to make illegal trades in at least 25 different crypto assets, the statement said.
They allegedly used multiple anonymous Ethereum blockchain wallets to conceal their activity.
When a post on Twitter alerted about trading ahead of a listing in April, Coinbase began investigating.
When called in for a meeting in May, Ishan Wahi, 32, of Seattle, attempted to flee the country, buying a one-way ticket to India, the Justice Department said.
The Securities and Exchange Commission also charged the three men with insider trading.

4,"Fiscal, monetary steps eroding investor confidence: OICCI","Influential group of international investors welcomes govt’s ""bold policy measures"" but laments high taxes, rupee’s slide.","ISLAMABAD: An influential group of international investors operating in Pakistan has welcomed the government’s “bold policy measures” to finalise the IMF programme but has warned that such a stance, along with the central bank’s monetary tightening and fast currency depreciation, was further eroding investor confidence.
Representing more than 200 top foreign investors, the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has approached Finance Minister Miftah Ismail for immediate course correction, including a clear road map to reduce expenditure, sell public sector entities and broaden the tax base, beyond what was announced in the latest budget.
In a letter to Mr Ismail, OICCI President Ghias Khan and Chief Executive Abdul Aleem said the chamber’s more than 200 members had invested over $20bn in Pakistan over the past ten years and would continue to be the largest tax contributor to the exchequer.
“We compliment you for finalising the IMF programme, subject to approval of the IMF policy board,” they told the minister. “We also appreciate the bold stance of your government in taking measures to align the petroleum prices to the actual cost. Hopefully, the electricity and gas pricing will also be aligned to cost, no subsidy, level soon.”

Welcomes govt’s ‘bold policy measures’ but laments high taxes, rupee’s slide

Meanwhile, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has also increased the discount rate to a record high level to contain the fast-escalating inflation in the country.
The OCCI noted that the “bold cost-push measures have further been compounded by the fast-declining rupee parity against the US dollar”. Besides, these measures were bound to have a severe impact on the cost of living of the people and the cost of doing business in Pakistan, which was partly a regional phenomenon as well, it said.
The OICCI said its members had also been perturbed by abrupt changes in the taxation regime — such as a super tax — in the recently announced Finance Bill and, more importantly, the rapid decline of the rupee in the last few weeks and days.
At the same time, the SBP has also been issuing various ad hoc measures to curb unnecessary import payments, and perhaps rightly so, the chamber said but insisted that all these actions, especially currency depreciation, were causing serious concerns and were shaking the confidence of OICCI members.
The letter said many OICCI members had investment plans in the pipeline and continued to promote further foreign direct investment (FDI) to the country. However, high taxation announced in the latest budget and the never-ending decline in the rupee’s value posed the danger of permanently damaging the country’s image as an attractive destination for FDI, it said.

5,Non-textile exports soar to $12.5bn,Overall growth in the non-textile sector is mainly led by the value-added sectors.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s non-textile exports grew 25.85 per cent year-on-year to $12.46 billion in the outgoing 2021-22 owing to a partial revival of international orders and the government’s support schemes.
Overall growth in the non-textile sector is mainly led by the value-added sectors. The non-textile sector has yet to receive full orders to pre-Covid levels, data compiled by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) showed on Thursday.
In FY21, three sectors — leather garments, surgical instruments and engineering goods — maintained growth in export proceeds despite lockdowns in many countries.
In the value-added leather sector, exports of leather garments grew 10.15pc and leather gloves 10.60pc, respectively. Contrary to this, the exports of raw leather increased by over 28.50pc during the previous fiscal year.
Pakistan is one of the main suppliers of global surgical instruments. However, these instruments are re-marketed in western countries by famous brands. As a result, the export value of these products remains very negligible.
Exports of surgical instruments posted a negative growth of 1.29pc in FY22. However, the exports of pharmaceutical products shrank 0.49pc.

The local currency shed 0.83 per cent of its value on a day-on-day basis to close at 226.81 in the interbank market. The central bank has attributed the unending depreciation to the market-determined exchange rate system as well as a worldwide bullish trend in the value of the greenback against a basket of currencies.
