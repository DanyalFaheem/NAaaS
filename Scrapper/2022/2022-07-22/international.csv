0,Scientists sure Webb telescope has found oldest known galaxy,"""We’re potentially looking at the most distant starlight that anyone has ever seen,"" scientist says.","WASHINGTON: Just a week after its first images were shown to the world, the James Webb Space Telescope may have found a galaxy that existed 13.5 billion years ago, a scientist who analysed the data said on Wednesday. 
Known as GLASS-z13, the galaxy dates back to 300 million years after the Big Bang, about 100 million years earlier than anything previously identified, Rohan Naidu of the Harvard Center for Astrophysics said. 
“We’re potentially looking at the most distant starlight that anyone has ever seen,” he said. 
The more distant objects are from us, the longer it takes for their light to reach us, and so to gaze back into the distant universe is to see into the deep past. 
Although GLASS-z13 existed in the earliest era of the universe, its exact age remains unknown as it could have formed anytime within the first 300 million years. 
GLASS-z13 was spotted in so-called “early release” data from the orbiting observatory’s main infrared imager, called NIRcam — but the discovery was not revealed in the first image set published by Nasa last week. 
When translated from infrared into the visible spectrum, the galaxy appears as a blob of red with white in its centre, as part of a wider image of the distant cosmos called a “deep field”, Naidu and colleagues — a team totalling 25 astronomers from across the world — have submitted their findings to a scientific journal. 
For now, the research is posted on a “preprint” server, so it comes with the caveat that it has yet to be peer-reviewed — but it has already set the global astronomy community abuzz. 
“Astronomy records are crumbling already, and more are shaky,” tweeted Nasa’s chief scientist Thomas Zurbuchen. 
“Yes, I tend to only cheer once science results clear peer review. But this looks very promising,” he added. 
Naidu said another team of astronomers, led by Marco Castellano that worked on the same data, has achieved similar conclusions, “so that gives us confidence”.
‘Work to be done’ 
One of the great promises of Webb is its ability to find the earliest galaxies that formed after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago. 
Because these are so distant from Earth, by the time their light reaches us, it has been stretched by the expansion of the universe and shifted to the infrared region of the light spectrum, which Webb is equipped to detect with unprecedented clarity. 
Naidu and colleagues combed through this infrared data of the distant universe, searching for a telltale signature of extremely distant galaxies. 
Below a particular threshold of infrared wavelength, all photons — packets of energy — are absorbed by the neutral hydrogen of the universe that lies between the object and the observer. 
By using data collected through different infrared filters pointed at the same region of space, they were able to detect where these drop-offs in photons occurred, from which they inferred the presence of these most distant galaxies. 
“We searched all the early data for galaxies with this very striking signature, and these were the two systems that had by far the most compelling signature,” said Naidu. 
One of these is GLASS-z13, while the other, not as ancient, is GLASS-z11. 
“There’s strong evidence, but there’s still work to be done,” said Naidu. 
In particular, the team wants to ask Webb’s managers for telescope time to carry out spectroscopy — an analysis of light that reveals detailed properties — to measure its precise distance.

1,Biden tests positive for Covid,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, with his doctors saying the 79-year-old...","WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, with his doctors saying the 79-year-old leader was experiencing only mild fatigue and would isolate at the White House while carrying out his duties.
Biden, who posted a picture of himself working at his desk, tweeted that he was  “doing great” — and apologised for missing a scheduled event in Pennsylvania.
“Keeping busy!” added the US leader, in a post carefully curated to show he remains at the country’s helm — smiling in a suit, with smartphones and documents laid out in front of him.
In announcing Biden’s diagnosis, the White House stressed that the president was fully vaccinated and twice boosted, and said he was  “experiencing very mild symptoms.” It said Biden was taking Pfizer’s Paxlovid pill, an antiviral used to minimize the severity of Covid-19.
“Consistent with CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines, he will isolate at the White House and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,” it added in a statement.
Biden’s doctor Kevin O’Connor wrote in an official note that the president was suffering from fatigue, runny nose and a dry cough, starting on Wednesday evening.
O’Connor added that the president had tested positive in a rapid antigen test on Thursday morning before the result was confirmed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test.
“I talked to him just a few minutes ago. He’s doing fine, he’s feeling good,” First Lady Jill Biden, who tested negative, told reporters on a visit to a school in Michigan.
Joe Biden is reported to be in good general health, but his advanced age will heighten concern over the impact of Covid.
Politically he is in a tough phrase of his presidency, facing November midterm elections that are forecast to be painful for his Democratic Party, as well as declining personal approval ratings.

2,Pakistan seeks US support for reviving economy,"Islamabad views Washington as an important partner in efforts to revive Pakistan’s economy, SAPM Tariq Fatemi tells US official.","WASHINGTON: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi told US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Thursday that Pakistan views the United States as an ‘important partner in its efforts to revive” the country’s ailing economy. 
State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Deputy Secretary Sherman noted the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the United States and Pakistan and “reaffirmed our shared goals for enhancing the US-Pakistan relationship by advancing our economic and commercial ties and health cooperation”. 

 





 
A Pakistan Embassy press release said Mr Fatemi told the US official that “Pakistan seeks close and cordial relations with the US on the basis of equality, mutual cooperation and mutual benefit”. He told the deputy secretary that “Pakistan is an important player in promoting regional peace, security and prosperity and taking the bilateral relationship forward in a substantive manner would serve the interests of both countries,” the statement added. 
Mr Fatemi told Sherman that Islamabad viewed Washington as “an important partner in its efforts to revive Pakistan’s economy,” the embassy said. 
Spokesperson Rice, however, focused on “coordination on Afghanistan, regional stability”, but he also mentioned the need for supporting efforts to cope with “the devastating effects of [Russian President] Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on food security in Pakistan and worldwide”. 
The embassy’s statement said Mr Fatemi underscored Pakistan’s desire for “enhanced bilateral cooperation” in trade, investment, agriculture, textile, and IT sectors, calling it Pakistan’s “key priority”.

3,Ex-cop gets over two years in jail for Floyd murder,NEW YORK: A former Minneapolis police officer was sentenced on Thursday to two and a half years in federal prison ...,"NEW YORK: A former Minneapolis police officer was sentenced on Thursday to two and a half years in federal prison for his role in the killing of African-American George Floyd.
Thomas Lane was convicted in February of violating the civil rights of Floyd, the man whose May 2020 murder by senior officer Derek Chauvin sparked protests across America. Lane, alongside ex-colleagues Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, was found guilty of showing  “deliberate indifference” to Floyd’s medical needs.
Chauvin, who kneeled on the neck of a handcuffed Floyd for nearly 10 minutes until he passed out and died, was convicted of murder last year and is serving 22 years in prison.

4,Liz Truss leads rival Rishi Sunak in race to succeed Johnson,"Truss criticises Sunak over his tax policies while finance minister, as the pair kick off six weeks of campaigning.","LONDON: British  leadership candidate Liz Truss held a 24 point lead over her rival  Rishi Sunak in a YouGov poll of Conservative Party Members published on  Thursday.
Liz Truss, the favourite to become Britain’s next prime minister, on Thursday criticised rival Rishi Sunak over his tax policies while finance minister, as the pair kicked off six weeks of campaigning.
The foreign minister wrote in the Daily Mail that Britain had been  “going in the wrong direction on tax, with the tax burden at its highest in 70 years”. She promised to reverse recent rises and suspend green levies on energy bills.
Sunak oversaw the tax hikes as the UK battles to fix public finances after the coronavirus pandemic and amid spiralling inflation, and has accused those promising cuts of  “fantasy economics”.
The pair reached the final run-off to try to persuade some 200,000 party members after the last round of voting among Conservative MPs on Wednesday. The final result is due on Sept 5.
Sunak launched his bid to woo grassroots members by saying he was the only candidate capable of winning a general election, due within the next 18 months.
“We’ve got a really positive message to take out to all our members now — crucially, who is the best person to beat Keir Starmer and the Labour Party at the next election?” he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. “I believe I’m the only candidate who can do that.” 
Sunak invoked former leader Margaret Thatcher, who remains a hero to many party members. “My values are Thatcherite. I believe in hard work, family and integrity,” he wrote.
“I am a Thatcherite, I am running as a Thatcherite and I will govern as a Thatcherite.” But he faces an uphill struggle, with polling suggesting that party members support the more right-wing Truss.
The fight has already turned personal during televised debates, but Sunak seemingly called for a truce on Thursday, writing that  “I like and respect” Truss. The pair will lobby members face-to-face for the first time on Thursday, before a dozen hustings across the country over the next few weeks.
Truss’s message to the members is that she is a politician of conviction who will  “bulldoze” through institutions that stand in the way of reform.
But she was forced to defend a record of ideological and policy U-turns, including her previous support for the Liberal Democrats and opposition to Brexit, which she now supports.

6,Sri Lanka’s new president to appoint ally of ousted Rajapaksa as PM,COLOMBO: New Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe will appoint an ally of the ousted Rajapaksa dynasty as prime...,"COLOMBO: New Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe will appoint an ally of the ousted Rajapaksa dynasty as prime minister, four sources said on Thursday, a day after urging unity to find a way out of the country’s worst economic crisis in decades.
Wickremesinghe, a six-time prime minister, succeeded Gotabaya Rajapaksa who fled Sri Lanka and resigned from his post last week after mass protests over his handling of the economy. A swearing-in ceremony was conducted in parliament on Thursday.
He is expected to appoint Dinesh Gunewardena, a former foreign and education minister, as prime minister along with a new cabinet on Friday, the sources, close to Wickremesinghe and Gunewardena, said.
The country of 22 million people has been crippled by a lack of foreign currency, triggering shortages of fuel, food and medicines as prices soar. Inflation hit an annual 59pc in June, according to the statistics department.
Protesters succeeded in removing Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his brother, ex-premier Mahinda Rajapaksa, but many want Wickremesinghe and others they see as allies of the family gone too.
Sri Lanka received fresh diesel supplies over the weekend, and the main state-run distributor, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, will restart sales under a new rationing system from Thursday, the power and energy ministry said.
The protest movement that pushed out Rajapaksa — the first sitting Sri Lankan president to quit office — remained largely muted, despite Wickremesinghe’s unpopularity among some sections of the population.
Only a handful of people were present outside the presidential secretariat on Thursday, a colonial-era building that was stormed by protesters this month along with the president’s and prime minister’s official residences. But some have vowed to fight on against Wickremesinghe.
“We won’t give up because what the country needs is a total system change,” said Pratibha Fernando, a protester at the secretariat.  “We want to get rid of these corrupted politicians, so that’s what we are doing.”  
Hours after winning the parliamentary vote on Wednesday, Wickremesinghe appeared to distance himself from the Rajapaksa family that dominated politics in Sri Lanka for decades.
“I am not a friend of the Rajapaksas. I am a friend of the people,” he told reporters after praying at a Buddhist temple.
Wickremesinghe, who served as prime minister and finance minister under Rajapaksa, has been involved in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bail out package worth up to $3 billion.
Sri Lanka is also looking for assistance from neighbouring India, China and other international partners.

7,"Russian army about to ‘run out of steam’ in Ukraine, says  UK spy chief","Says about 15,000 Russian troops have been killed so far, adding that this is ""probably a conservative estimate"".","ASPEN: Russia’s military is likely to start an operational pause of some kind in Ukraine in the coming weeks, giving Kyiv a key opportunity to strike back, Britain’s spy chief said on Thursday.
Richard Moore, chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) known as MI6, also estimated that about 15,000 Russian troops had been killed so far in its war in Ukraine, adding that was  “probably a conservative estimate.” 
“I think they’re about to run out of steam,” Moore said, addressing the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado, adding that the Russian military would increasingly find it difficult to supply manpower and materiel over the next few weeks.
“They will have to pause in some way, and that will give the Ukrainians opportunities to strike back.”  Nearly five months since Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv hopes that Western weapons, especially longer-range missiles such as US HIMARS which Kyiv has deployed in recent weeks, will allow it to launch a counterattack in coming weeks and recapture Russian-occupied territory.
Moore underscored the need for Ukraine to show the war was winnable — both to preserve high Ukrainian morale but also to stiffen the resolve of the West as concerns mount about European energy shortages during the coming winter.
“It’s important, I think, to the Ukrainians themselves that they demonstrate their ability to strike back. And I think that will be very important for their continuing high morale,” Moore said.
“I also think, to be honest, it will be an important reminder to the rest of Europe that this is a winnable campaign by the Ukrainians. Because we are about to go into a pretty tough winter and ... I don’t want it to sound like a character from ‘Game of Thrones.’ But winter is coming.
“And clearly in that atmosphere with the sort of pressure on gas supplies and all the rest, we’re in for a tough time,” Moore said.

8,BBC pays ‘substantial’ damages to nanny over Diana interview,LONDON: Princes William and Harry’s former nanny on Thursday received substantial damages from the BBC over...,"LONDON: Princes William and Harry’s former nanny on Thursday received substantial damages from the BBC over  “false and malicious” claims about her used to obtain a 1995 interview with Princess Diana.
Alexandra Pettifer, known at the time as Tiggy Legge-Bourke, was given a public apology for  “fabricated” allegations that she had an affair with the princes’ father, Prince Charles.
The High Court in London was also told that she was falsely accused of becoming pregnant by him when she was his personal assistant and of having an abortion.
Pettifer’s lawyer Louise Prince said the allegations caused  “serious personal consequences for all concerned” and her client did not know where they came from.
But she said it was likely that the  “false and malicious allegations arose as a result and in the context of BBC Panorama’s efforts to procure an exclusive interview with Diana, Princess of Wales”.
The explosive interview saw Diana detail her troubled marriage to Charles, his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, and how she had also been unfaithful.

9,How climate change can fuel global instability and spark conflict,Climate hazards even threaten to destabilise powerful players such as China and Brazil.,"LONDON: From record-breaking and deadly heatwaves in western Europe to a severe drought in the Horn of Africa, the impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly clear and concerning.
But experts say insufficient attention is being paid to the knock-on effects of extreme weather events, and warn that they could jeopardise already fragile political stability around the globe by fuelling mass migration, food insecurity, and conflict.
Climate hazards even threaten to destabilise powerful players such as China and Brazil, which could have severe consequences for the rest of the world, according to a new report by risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.
So how can intensifying climate change hike these risks, and what can be done in response? How do climate risks affect global stability?  As the impacts of climate change become more severe, they are expected to lead to  “cascading” risks around the world.
This means they trigger chains of events which can eventually lead to political and economic turmoil.
For example, climate change can damage agricultural livelihoods, forcing farmers to abandon their land and move to cities. That may lead to urban overcrowding and pressure on infrastructure, which can in turn fuel civil unrest.
Climate-related pressures act as a catalyst for complex social and political issues which might already be  “bubbling under” in countries, said the report’s lead author Will Nichols.
“The very nature of these risks make them quite difficult to define and plan for,” he said, urging governments and companies to put more effort into understanding them.
Which parts of the world are most vulnerable?  The report judges the vulnerability of 196 countries across 32 issues — including their exposure to climate hazards, natural resource security and poverty levels — using its own risk data along with information from sources like the World Bank.
It categorises countries into three groups:  “insulated” nations that are most resilient to cascading risks; those which are most  “vulnerable “; and  “precarious” countries in between. The  “vulnerable” group broadly consists of developing nations in Africa and Asia which are bearing the brunt of climate impacts.
The  “insulated” group, of predominantly wealthier countries in Europe and North America, are strengthened by factors such as food security, strong governance and robust social policies.

10,Migratory monarch butterfly joins global endangered species list,"Numbering in the millions in the 1990s, the butterfly’s population has since shrunk by more than 85pc, scientists estimate.","GENEVA: The migratory monarch butterfly, which has for millennia turned North American woodlands into kaleidoscopes of colour in one of nature’s most spectacular mass migrations, is threatened with extinction, international conservationists said on Wednesday.
Every autumn, migratory monarchs fly thousands of miles (km) from breeding grounds in the eastern United States and Canada to spend the winter closely huddled in trees in Mexico and California.
Numbering in the millions in the 1990s, the butterfly’s population has since shrunk by more than 85pc, scientists estimate.
On Wednesday it was placed in the endangered category of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species.
“What’s happening to monarchs is like a death by a thousand cuts,” said Karen Oberhauser, director of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum.
Logging has destroyed much of the insects’ winter grounds, agricultural pesticides have decimated the milkweed plants that their larvae feed on, and extreme temperatures due to climate change are triggering them to begin migrating too early, before the remaining milkweed is available.
In all, the IUCN says, more than 41,000 species are now at risk of going extinct in what scientists are calling the planet’s sixth mass extinction event — and the first caused by humans.
“Today’s Red List update highlights the fragility of nature’s wonders,” said IUCN director general Bruno Oberle.
