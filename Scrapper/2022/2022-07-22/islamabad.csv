0,Pakistan needs to engage Kabul directly to neutralise TTP: report,"Trust deficiency is a major issue between Pakistan and the Taliban, research paper says.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will have to engage the Taliban government in Kabul directly to neutralise the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as the group continues to pose threats to Pakistan’s internal security and western borders.
Talking to the outlawed group will not favour the Taliban regime either as it will not help to boost their image as a peace builder; rather, their regime will continue to be considered supportive of the terrorists and manipulators.
These are some of the key findings of the paper series titled “Afghanistan as Seen from Pakistan IV” released here on Thursday by Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), an Islamabad-based policy research and advocacy think-tank. The research is part of PIPS’ on-going quarterly ‘Situation Review’ series on Afghanistan.
In the first research paper, PIPS Director Mohammad Amir Rana assessed the impact of the peace talks between the Pakistani state and the TTP. The second contribution comes from senior journalist Ziaur Rehman, which explores factors of Afghanistan’s persisting outlook on Pakistan.
The research underlines that whether Kabul absorbs the TTP within their ranks and files or expels it, Pakistan should allow Kabul to make its own choice. “Pakistan should have broadly focused on encouraging and facilitating the Taliban to fulfill its commitments, which they made after Kabul’s takeover.”
According to the report, Pakistan must intensify its efforts further for humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan which can reduce the bitterness of angry Taliban leaders. 
“This trust deficiency is a major issue between Pakistan and the Taliban,” the study says and adds, “For that purpose, Pakistan must have a uniform approach toward all the Taliban groups and factions.”
The research points out that some recent obstacles in trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan have also been causing a negative impact on the relationship between the two countries. It suggests that instead of relying on or leaving it to the governments of the two countries, there is a need to develop and enhance people-to-people contacts at different levels to build trust and cement bilateral relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. “Youth, parliamentarians, religious scholars, academics and non-governmental organisations of both the countries should meet and discuss bilateral affairs.”
The report recommends that initiating cross-border economic activities, trade, and social exchanges could also build stronger relations between the two countries, forcing both governments to sit and discuss ways forward too. 
“Both the countries, despite having a fence, could mend their relations if the people on both sides join hands for economic, trade, and social exchanges.”
The research concludes that Pakistan should look upon Afghanistan as a sovereign country having freedom to develop ties with other countries. It must also stop relying on the Taliban regime in power and should engage with other political and ethnic groups of Afghanistan, in line with its policy to build trust and strengthen relations with Afghans, it added.

4,Ghouri Town’s main office sealed,"Sale and purchase of plots/houses continued without approved layout plan and NOC, says CDA","ISLAMABAD:  The Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Thursday sealed the main office of Ghouri Town, an unauthorised housing scheme, and directed its management not to carry out any further construction.
The management of the town, comprising eight phases, has been accused of carrying out construction work and sale and purchase of plots/houses without having the approved layout plan and no-objection certificate (NOC) from the CDA.
In the past too, the CDA swung into action but construction work and sale purchase of plots continued unabated in the town. The CDA failed to stop development work in the society during the last one decade. Thousands of houses and commercial plazas have been constructed just because of the negligence of the CDA.
CDA’s Senior Special Magistrate Sardar Asif after receiving a letter from the civic agency’s planning wing sealed the offices of the society.

Sale and purchase of plots/houses continued without approved layout plan and NOC, says CDA

The planning wing’s letter dated July 18 stated:  “It has been observed with serious concern that Mr Ramza (CEO) and Raja Ammar (relative of late Raja Ali Akbar) are running the affairs (sale, purchase, transfer, marketing and advertisement)  of the illegal/unauthorised housing scheme namely Ghouri Town (all phases) and cheating the general public.”
It said: “All this activity is illegal and without approval of the Authority. Despite issuance of several notices from time to time and public notices, they have not stopped illegal and unauthorised activities in the said scheme.”
It said in view of the above, “competent authority has decided to seal the offices of Ghouri Town Management Zone-4, Islamabad, located in the building of Raja Ali Akbar and Company and Abdur Rehman Associates Arcade, eastern side, Islamabad Highway. It is therefore, requested to initiate legal proceedings to seal the said premises, on priority basis.”
After receiving the letter, the CDA magistrate sealed the main office of the scheme where sale purchase deeds were made by the society.
An official of the CDA said practically sealing the office of the illegal housing scheme would not stop the developers from construction work and sale and purchase of plots.
“If CDA seals one office, they will set up another office. Right now, another main office of this scheme is operating in Rawalpindi side,” the official said and added that instead of sealing offices the CDA should take over the entire illegal housing scheme.
In the past too, the CDA took such action but the town saw unabated construction.
“Now, this scheme comprises a number of phases where thousands of houses have been built. This all was done during the last one decade and I guess such action of sealing the office is insufficient,” the official said.
Last year, the CDA’s magistrate had sent Chaudhry Usman, the then chief executive (CE) of the scheme, to jail for three years for environment destruction.  The magistrate had also imposed a fine of Rs1.5 billion on him and directed the society to plant trees worth Rs1 billion in the area.
According to the CDA, the society chopped off thousands of trees and also encroached on Korang River.
However, after spending just eight days in jail, Chaudhry Usman got bail from court. No fine was paid and neither any tree plantation was carried out.  Later, the CDA filed an appeal in Islamabad High Court, which is slated to be taken up in September.

7,Education ministry renames Single National Curriculum,"""National Curriculum of Pakistan is new name of curriculum reforms,"" education minister says.","ISLAMABAD: The Federal Education Ministry has decided to rename the Single National Curriculum (SNC) - a much-hyped initiative of the previous Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government - as National Curriculum of Pakistan (NCP).
“The National Curriculum of Pakistan (NCP) is the new name of the curriculum reforms,” said Federal Education Minster Rana Tanveer Hussain on Thursday.
Addressing a workshop in Islamabad, the minister said: “The word ‘single’ caused confusion and excluded the diversity education that is an asset to our country’s rich heritage. We are now ready for getting back on track.”
The PTI government had launched SNC at the primary level last year in three provinces except Sindh.

‘National Curriculum of Pakistan’ is new name of curriculum reforms, says minister

The education minster said NCP will be a comprehensive exercise, covering all four aspects of a quality curriculum.
“This includes standards, textbooks, teachers training and examinations reforms. Going forward, there will be a special focus on teacher training without which reforms are incomplete,” he said and added that most importantly “we will spearhead examination reforms. Our children must move away from rote memorisation in exams to concept-based understanding,” he said.
The two-day National Curriculum Workshop was organised by the ministry in collaboration with its development partners with representation from all the federating units to promote an inclusive approach on the national curriculum and its implementation.
According to a press release, Mr Tanveer said: “It is imperative to highlight that the true vision of education reforms began in the previous tenure of the PML-N government in 2013 to 2018.  After the tragic attack on schoolchildren at an Army Public School in 2014, a national consensus was evolved to counter violent extremism through a National Action Plan. Development of a national curriculum with consensus to set minimum standards for all public and private schools and religious seminaries is a part of this serious effort from the government,” he said.
The minster said that the establishment of the National Curriculum Council (NCC) Secretariat with consensus from all provinces in 2015 was the first major step in this regard. The purpose, he said, was to make minimum standards of quality education for all children in Pakistan, as Article 25A of the Constitution makes it the state’s responsibility to provide education to every child.
“Our government was the first one to make a National Curriculum Framework for the country in the year 2017. A minimum national standards framework document was also released at the time. To ensure progressive and concept-based religious education, a historic Compulsory Teaching of Holy Quran Act was passed in 2017,” he said and added that Pakistan has not had an education policy since 2009.
“However, it was our government that devised and released a new National Education Policy draft in 2017.”
Mr Tanveer said that curriculum reforms should not be forced on provinces. Sindh did not join the important initiative because of this reason. Similarly, he said, private sector was alienated because what was supposed to be a minimum standard was treated as the maximum standard.
“Many private publishers went bankrupt due to this unfortunate step. Finally, the word ‘single’ caused confusion and excluded the diversity education that is an asset to our country’s rich heritage,” he said.
The minister said: “Our focus is on inclusivity, where representation from all sectors is to be ensured. We will keep the national curriculum a living document which will be consistently updated in light of research findings from schools and international best practices.”
He said that to ensure deeper engagement and a truly consultative process for making the national curriculum, a calendar of country-wide curriculum workshops will be released soon. 
He said the ministry was committed to providing a supporting role to all provinces for capacity building in education and inter-provincial harmony, respecting the 18th Amendment.
The minister said that special focus will be put on issues related to out of school children, quality of education at school, tertiary and higher education level which mainly includes teacher training, missing facilities, girls’ education, improving adult literacy and accelerated learning programs and last but least skill education.
In August last year, the then prime minister Imran Khan had launched the SNC at the primary level, saying the initiative will end disparity in society and provide equal opportunities to all students to excel.

8,Varsities’ employees from KP end protest after assurance,ISLAMABAD: Ad hoc employees from public sector universities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) dispersed from their protest...,"ISLAMABAD: Ad hoc employees from public sector universities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) dispersed from their protest sit-in camp outside PTI Chairman Imran Khan’s Banigala residence after successful negotiations with the party leadership.
Just a day after schoolteachers from KP managed to get their demands approved, the ad hoc employees of universities gathered outside the residence of Mr Khan demanding regularisation of their jobs.
The schoolteachers had arrived in the capital in a large number on July 19 to press their demands and after intense negotiations the representatives of the provincial government agreed to regularise them. As a result, the teachers dispersed late on Tuesday night.
The contractual employees of public sector universities assembled at Banigala on Wednesday.
The KP chapter of the Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association (FAPUASA) had announced to join the protest at Banigala on Thursday.
However, former minister of Kashmir Affairs and PTI central leader Ali Amin Gandapur assured the protesting employees on Wednesday evening that since contractual employees of public sector universities in Punjab had been regularised, the same would be adopted in KP.
“We have clear precedence and examples of regularisation in similar cases. The provincial government would consider your case,” he said.
As a result, the employees left the protest site by Wednesday night, but announced to resume their agitation if the demands were not implemented within a week.
Talking to media on Thursday, Secretary Information All Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Universities Contract Employees Association Dr Latif Shinwari claimed that there were at least 8,000 teaching and non-teaching contractual employees of the universities waiting for regularisation for years.
He said every university had about 30 PhD degree holders who had been at the job for up to 13 years and still waiting for their regularisation.
He said thousands of teaching and non-teaching employees in 28 public sector universities in the province had decided to protest to push for their demands.
The PTI government in Punjab resolved a similar matter in April 2019.
Dr Shinwari warned that if the matter was not resolved in a week, thousands of employees would gather outside Imran Khan’s house in Islamabad.
He said a written demand had been made to Mr Khan when he was the PM that KP and Punjab assemblies had imposed a restriction that there will be no extension in the contracts of the contractual employees beyond three years.
Both KP and Punjab assemblies passed “Regulation of Services Act” in 2018 to save the services rendered by contractual employees in both provinces.
“On the basis of this act, all contract employees except the employees of public sector universities were regularised in KP and Punjab,” Dr Shinwari said.
He added that after the exclusion of university employees from regularisation process, both the governments were approached by the employees and the Punjab government regularised the employees in 2019 after a complaint was lodged in Pakistan Citizen Portal by Punjab universities contract employees, but the KP government failed to do it till now.

12,Housing societies continue to ‘cover’ natural water courses,"ISLAMABAD: Flouting directives of Capital Development Authority (CDA), administrations of several housing societies...","ISLAMABAD: Flouting directives of Capital Development Authority (CDA), administrations of several housing societies and individuals have started to cover natural water courses, enhancing the risk of urban flooding in Islamabad.
The engineering department of CDA on Thursday forwarded the fifth letter to Fazaia Housing Society, asking it’s management to clear all constructions around storm water drains. In the event of heavy rains, water after hitting boundary wall of the society, turns towards Islamabad Expressway.
The letter stated that accumulated water not only disturbs traffic at one of the main arteries of the federal capital but also causes long term damage to the road, adding that CDA has to incur manpower and material expense to clear the water from the road.
Talking to Dawn, a senior official of the engineering department said that despite writing several letters, the management of Fazaia Housing Society has not taken the matter seriously. 
Similarly, the management of Margalla Town Housing Society has expressed concerns about environment department of CDA failing to take action against those covering storm water drains and the traditional water pathways within the jurisdiction of the housing colony.
After issuing a notice to residents, the Margalla Town Housing Society administration told CDA that Irfan Marwat, a resident of street 41 and other individuals in street 44 have not only covered the storm water drain but also occupied more than 1 kanal land for personal use.
Such cases could lead to serious urban flooding as witnessed in E-11 in July last year, where illegal construction at the storm water nullah flooded the street causing serious damage to property in the area.
While responding to the query, a senior official of the environment wing of CDA said covering storm water natural nullahs was a recent phenomenon in the city.
“Previously, the residents of Islamabad used to respect nature, its water courses, as well as the flora and fauna here,” the official said, adding that those who came to the city from other areas of the country mainly during the past decade started construction over the natural landscape.
The official highlighted that currently there was no law to impose strict penalties upon those who cover the natural nullah with concrete structure, and the CDA can only impose fines.

The victim’s brother succeeded in getting a case registered against the officials at Khanna police.
According to the first information report (FIR), a team of six officials raided a house in Madian Town on April 19 without any warrant and abducted Osama Saeed. Over the issue, Saeed’s brother Omer Saeed informed Rescue 15 and also tried to lodge a complaint at Khanna police station.
However, the then SHO refused to receive the complaint, the FIR stated, adding that later he approached the then inspector general of police (Islamabad) and submitted the complaint against the police station.
The Khanna police allegedly registered a fake case against Osama on April 21 on charge of recovery of an illegal weapon at Soan Garden, the FIR said, adding that later he was sent to Adiala jail on April 22 for identification parade in connection with a case for 14 days.
Later, Omer Saeed, along with his friend met with then SHO Khanna and asked him to furnish the allegation and reason behind the arrest of Osama Saeed, the FIR said, adding that the SHO told him that 15 cases were registered against Osama, but he would find out a way to reduce the cases to three.
A spokesman for police said that Osama Saeed was arrested because he was identified by his two accomplices during police interrogation in custody. Police’s mistake was that they arrested Osama without a search warrant, the spokesman said.
