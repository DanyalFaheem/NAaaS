ISLAMABAD: The country’s economic managers continued to give assurances on Thursday that Pakistan was not heading to default, the rupee has stabilised — even as it fell 0.83 per cent — and the country has enough petrol for over a month.
In his press conference alongside Finance Minister Miftah Ismail, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif called for a complete end to ‘executive allowance’ recently given to top government employees and other similar lavish lifestyles on public expense, whereas the prime minister in a cabinet meeting expre­ssed concern over the local currency’s record depreciation against the dollar.
Separately, Energy Minister Khurram Dastgir asserted that the country’s petroleum product reserves were at a “record level”.
Conceding that ongoing policy measures by the government coupled with external factors would push a lot of middle-class people below the poverty line, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Thursday called for a complete end to ‘executive allowance’ recently given to top government employees and other similar lavish lifestyles on public expense.
“The permanent government, I mean the bureaucracy and others, would have to jointly share the burden to ensure that it is felt by the common man that they are not paying the price alone but shared by the entire nation,” Mr Asif told reporters.
He attributed the rupee’s downfall — which has plunged to 227 to the dollar from 204.85 on June 30 — mainly to US currency’s appreciation against other currencies, saying that the dollar had touched a 20-year high.
He said the size of Pakistan’s government should be reduced as much as possible in given circumstances but noted that it was too large because a lot of things the private sector should be doing was still in government hands. He also stressed the need for a change in habit patterns and said business should be restricted to daytime only.
The defence minister, who is part of a cabinet committee on importing coal from Afghanistan and engagement with friendly countries for financial support, said the government had already cleared amendments in laws to facilitate government-to-government transactions and legislation would be completed in a few days.
He said the Middle Eastern friends had shown interest in investment in listed companies while their investment companies and sovereign funds were keen in many other companies which are in the privatisation list for decades.
Responding to a question, Mr Asif said a delegation had returned from Kabul and arrangements would now be made to increase coal imports for power plants.
Speaking on the occasion, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said inflows from friendly countries could not flow so quickly and such transactions took time to materialise.
However, he claimed that the currency market was now under control after the coalition partners announced to complete the remaining constitutional term until June next year. He said he would immediately announce if any of the foreign transactions materialise.
He said imports had been brought under control because of hoarding to petroleum products that had been imported when the government was providing heavy subsidies and as result Pakistan had over 30 days of petrol, about two months for diesel and furnace oil.
On the other hand, consumption had also declined because of higher prices. “We will spend our political capital to protect the country and have taken difficult decisions and there is no regret. If we have to do it again, we will do it,” he said.
Mr Ismail said the economy was on the right track and all indicators, apart from the exchange rate, were positive. He said the SBP had also taken steps to discourage imports. Responding to a question, he said the SBP governor would be appointed next week and its board of directors would be notified anytime.
‘Fuel reserves at record level’
Meanwhile, Energy Minister Khurram Dastgir asserted on Thursday that the PML-N-led coalition government’s commitment to stabilise the economy and prevent the effects of an “international energy crisis” from manifesting here was clear as petroleum product reserves were at a “record level”.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad alongside State Minister for Petroleum Musadik Malik, Mr Dastgir also drew comparisons between Pakistan and “another country in the region that is facing economic difficulties”, apparently referring to Sri Lanka, which has been reeling from economic crises for months and the president had to step down amid widespread protests.

The biggest indication of economic turmoil in the country was that it ran out of petroleum products, he said. “People had to stand in queues for four days to get petrol. But here, we have diesel stocks that will last for two months and those of petrol for 34 days.”
‘Import bill significantly reduced’
Musadik Malik told reporters that imports of petroleum products was witnessing a gradual decline, as the country’s petrol consumption had dropped 9pc to 704,000 tonnes in June from around 778,000 tonnes in the same month a year ago. Similarly, there was an 8pc to 9pc decline in the sale of diesel oil, which is used in heavy vehicles and agriculture machinery.
He said his ministry was managing the matters on a daily basis and were not allowing any unnecessary imports. He also emphasised that there was no risk of a shortage of petroleum products amid “record-high” petrol and diesel reserves.
Cabinet meeting
A cabinet meeting presided over by the premier on Thursday claimed that it would bring down unbridled prices of petroleum products in the country by next month.
“All necessary steps are being taken to bring down the dollar rate and by the next month the rupee will stabilise against dollar,” Finance Minister Miftah Ismail informed the meeting.
The prime minister — who is staying in Lahore for a couple of days, apparently to closely monitor Punjab’s chief minister election scheduled to be held today (Friday) — chaired the meeting through a video link.
According to Prime Minister Office, Mr Sharif expressed concern over the local currency’s record depreciation against the dollar.
The cabinet also took some other important decisions, including the approval of the Multi-Model Air-Road Corridor policy for trade with neighbouring Afghanistan.
It also approved “trade in goods” agreement with Turkiye, which will relax 261 tariff lines for Pakistan in addition to give zero rating on 123 items. Reciprocally Pakistan will give relaxation to Turkiye on 130 tariff lines and sectors like agriculture, chemicals, leather, plastic, rubber, engineering and steel industries. The agreement is expected to boost the bilateral trade to $5 billion.

LAHORE: All eyes are on today’s run-off election for the slot of Punjab chief minister as its outcome will set the tone for the future of the country’s politics, with the ruling alliance making last-ditch efforts to ensure it has the numbers to save its government. The opposition coalition, meanwhile, was busy trying to save its own lawmakers from any move to lure them towards defection.
With a clear majority in the Punjab Assembly after inflicting a crushing defeat on the ruling PML-N, the PTI-PML-Q alliance should apparently have no problem getting its candidate, Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, elected to the CM’s office.
But, the PML-N and its ally PPP are in no mood to allow the opposition alliance smooth sailing, considering a lot more is at stake for them. Perhaps the most upsetting consequence of the defeat for the ruling coalition would be the difficulties this would pose for the Shehbaz Sharif government in the Centre; it will also provide an opportunity for ousted prime minister Imran Khan to build further pressure on the rulers to call fresh elections.
Currently, in the provincial house of 368, the opposition alliance (PTI-PML-Q) has 187 lawmakers and the PML-N-led ruling coalition 179. Hamza is certain to lose his office unless there is a change of heart on the part of opposition MPAs, because last-minute efforts by the PML-N and PPP are reportedly under way to purchase loyalties of as many PTI or PML-Q lawmakers as possible.
The PTI which appeared a little unnerved on Wednesday after the resignation of its MPA, Chaudhry Masood Ahmed from Rahim Yar Khan, seemed relieved on Thursday when no further defections from the party were reported. However, the opposition is still wary of the Sharifs’ ‘surprise moves’ on election day (today).
To save PM Shehbaz’s son, incumbent Chief Minister Hamza, the PML-N bigwigs on Thursday consulted their party’s legal brains to explore ‘some ways’ to save the provincial government in case the party does manage to cause the required number of defections. And that scenario seems likely.
It may not come as a surprise if the PML-N follows what the PTI did during the previous CM election three months ago. On April 16, the PA had descended into chaos, leaving many injured, including Parvez Elahi, and the house was taken over by law enforcement agencies. Hamza got elected after bagging 197 votes, including from 25 PTI dissidents. Subsequently, these 25 PTI lawmakers, including five reserved, were de-seated over defection and a by-election on 20 of these seats was held with the PTI clinching a sweeping victory with 15.
Former Punjab advocate general Ahmad Awais told Dawn the incumbent CM could have survived if he had more numbers than his opponent candidate. “Going by the party position, Hamza has no chance (unless the PTI-PML-Q number recedes because of defections). There is no legal point the PML-N can exploit nor delay or manipulate the election as it is under the direct scanner of the apex court,” he maintained.
Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Dost Mazari of the PTI declared on Thursday that he would ensure a “free and fair” election for the top post of the province. He said he was entrusted by the Lahore High Court to conduct the election in accordance with law.
Meanwhile, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari pledged his party’s unequivocal support for the PML-N, denying his involvement in horse trading. “Why would I buy votes for Hamza? Had PPP’s Hasan Murtaza been a CM candidate in Punjab, I might have helped him,” he told party lawmakers.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah also claimed that not five but 50 PTI members could either vote against Elahi or abstain ‘for being politically conscious and aware’. He had earlier openly declared that around five to seven opposition MPAs might “disappear” on the voting day.
The lawmakers of both ruling and opposition alliances are lodged at separate hotels in Lahore. They would be transported to the PA together on Friday (today) for voting. The PTI and PML-Q activists are guarding their members in anticipation of any action by government agencies.
Separately, Mr Zardari met PML-Q president Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain twice within the span of a few hours on Thursday. Reportedly, Parvez Elahi and his son Moonis were also sent a message to join the meeting, but the father-son duo declined. The proposals apparently discussed during the two Shujaat-Zardari meetings were that either Elahi contests as the CM from the PML-N platform as a last resort or the PML-Q chief asks his party MPAs not to vote for the party candidate.
‘Facilitate MPAs to cast votes safely’
Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court ordered the Punjab chief secretary and inspector general of police to ensure that all MPAs cast their votes safely and freely in the CM’s election today.
Justice Aalia Neelum passed this order disposing of petitions of PTI MPAs Zainab Umair and Sibtain Khan.
Advocate Azhar Siddique, on behalf of the petitioners, said the only prayer of the petitioners was a direction to the police and administration to facilitate the MPAs to safely cast their votes without any harassment. He alleged PTI MPAs had faced harassment at the hands of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and other state functionaries.
However, Additional Advocate General Nasir Chohan submitted a reply on behalf of the police chief, saying no harassment had been caused or threat issued to the petitioners or any other member of the assembly.
The petitioner also contended there were apprehensions the interior minister could use the state machinery to sabotage the election for the chief minister.
Also on Thursday, a petition was filed before the Supreme Court Lahore bench challenging an LHC order that envisaged first recounting of votes cast in the April 16 election of the chief minister of Punjab excluding 25 votes of defecting MPAs and then a re-poll if no candidate got a majority.
Munir Ahmad, a lawyer by profession, filed the petition through Advocate Azhar Siddique, saying the impugned judgement was an error in the law as it rejected 25 votes and directed the presiding officer to recount votes. He argued that the bench ignored the distinction between ‘majority of the house’ of the original electorate and ‘simple majority of the house’, as after defection of 25 members, the present house did not constitute the same electorate that had earlier elected Hamza Shehbaz as the chief minister.
He said after notification of the five reserved seats and by-election victories, the present ‘majority of the house’ was not the same as that on April 16. The petitioner asked the apex court to declare that the impugned judgement was disproportionate and unreasonable, and order the presiding officer to simply conduct a fresh election for the chief minister.

2,Ex-IB chief Aftab Sultan appointed NAB chairman,ISLAMABAD: Former Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief Aftab Sultan was on Thursday appointed as chairman of the National...,"ISLAMABAD: Former Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief Aftab Sultan was on Thursday appointed as chairman of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the country’s premier white-collar crime investigation agency.
The decision to appoint Mr Sultan was taken by the federal cabinet at its meeting presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“Federal cabinet has given approval for the appointment of Aftab Sultan as NAB chairman,” said a press release issued by the Prime Minister Office. It said the tenure of the NAB chairman has been fixed for three years and it is non-extendable.
The NAB chairman is appointed through consultation between the leader of house (prime minister) and the leader of opposition in the National Assembly.
NAB was established by former president retired Gen Pervez Musharraf in 1999.
Mr Sultan is a retired officer of the Police Service of Pakistan and he has served in key positions during both the previous governments of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).
Mr Sultan is a law graduate from Punjab University. He later completed LLM from the University of Cambridge. In 2002, as regional police officer in Sargodha, Mr Sultan refused to assist the administration during the referendum called by the then chief executive, retired Gen Pervez Musharraf. He paid for his defiance when he was made OSD.
He prepared a 5,000-page report on the directives of the Supreme Court as the additional inspector general of police about the famous Bank of Punjab case. The SC had appointed Mr Sultan as the investigation officer after expressing dissatisfaction over the investigation conducted by NAB.
Mr Sultan retired as IB chief on April 3, 2018 after serving it since June 7, 2013. He served two governments each of the PPP and PML-N under four prime ministers — Yousuf Raza Gilani, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Nawaz Sharif and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.

3,‘Lack of tech’ keeps Pakistan from making own Covid vaccine,NIH obtaining capability to make mRNA jabs but biotech capacity still lacking; team sent to South Korea for training.,"• NIH obtaining capability to make mRNA jabs but biotech capacity still lacking
• Team sent to South Korea for training after patent waiver
ISLAMABAD: Following a waiver by the World Trade Organisation, which eases intellectual property restrictions on mRNA vaccines, Pakistan looks poised to domestically produce jabs using this advanced technology but due to lack of technical capacity this “golden opportunity” may not materialise.
The waiver provides Pakistan an opportunity to produce jabs using mRNA technology — vaccines that use a copy of a molecule called messenger RNA to build immune response — as in addition to Covid-19 jabs, this will also pave way for the production of vaccines against other viral diseases.
But there’s a major hiccup. Pakistan does not have a biotechnology plant to manufacture the latest type of vaccines, University of Health Sciences (UHS) Vice Chancellor Dr Javed Akram said.
A senior official of the Ministry of National Health Services, on condition of anonymity, said that the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver provided a “golden opportunity for Pakistan”.
The TRIPS waiver proposal was tabled by India and South Africa in October 2020. It sought to temporarily waive restrictions on patents and other intellectual property barriers, in a bid to speed up manufacturing and ease access to lifesaving products amid the Covid pandemic.

The official said the NIH was among 15 companies from as many states, which were being trained to produce the mRNA vaccines at Afrigen Biologics, a South African firm at the core of the hub, and added that maximum efforts were being utilised to avail this chance. “We have sent a three-member team to the International Vaccine Institute (IVI) of South Korea for the training,” the official confirmed.
The NIH official disclosed that the institute had a number of machines being used for the production of vaccines to combat rabies, measles and cholera. “As many as six studies have been conducted at NIH and now we have been considering manufacturing vaccines through a public-private partnership,” he said, adding, “A policy will have to be approved first.”
Dr Akram, who is also member of the Scientific Task Force on Covid-19, said that currently Pfizer and Moderna jabs were the only mRNA vaccines used in Pakistan. He expressed concerns about Pakistan’s ability to take advantage of the waiver, saying that Islamabad does not have a single biotech plant used to produce such vaccines. He advocated for the involvement of the private sector in the production of advanced jabs. According to the vice chancellor, steps taken to increase the presence of the private companies in the pharma sector were “discouraged” in the past for lack of “favourable policies and tax breaks”.
“I had contacted Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) and they made a consortium to build a biotechnology plant. Even funds were raised by the association, but the government could not give [us] assurance for favourable policies, including tax holiday,” he said, adding that then CJP Nisar had summoned him to brief the court on the issue. The issue is still pending in court, he added.
Dr Akram suggested that Pakistan should capitalise on the opportunity by involving the private sector as it was not the job of the government to establish a biotechnology plant investing billions of rupees.”
Health Services Academy Vice Chancellor Dr Shahzad Ali Khan, while talking to Dawn, said: “It is the most advanced technology in which artificially genetic material is produced and injected into the human body to reduce chances of infection.
He added, “The mRNA vaccines are beneficial for a large number of diseases and I am hopeful that in future HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) will also be controlled through these jabs.”
Tech transfer hub
According to details, while a number of countries still could not be able to vaccinate even half of their population against Covid-19, the mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub seeks to empower low and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines instead of relying on other regions of the world.
Fifteen companies from 15 countries are now learning how to make mRNA vaccines against Covid-19 at Afrigen Biologics, a South African firm at the core of the hub. These countries include Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia, Argentina, Brazil, Senegal, Nigeria, Tunisia, South Africa, Serbia, Egypt, Kenya, and Ukraine.
