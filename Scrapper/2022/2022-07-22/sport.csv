The stage win leaves Denmark’s Vingegaard with an advantage that, barring disaster or a bad fall, should see him ride up the Champs Elysees to win the 2022 title on Sunday.
“I don’t want to talk about winning the Tour yet, let’s talk about it in Paris, there are three days to go,” Vingegaard said at the line.
The pair have been shadowing each other the entire race, with Pogacar winning three stages and taking the overall leader’s yellow jersey by stage seven, before Vingegaard took it off him in the baking heatwave in the Alps.
Since then Pogacar has relentlessly attacked the Dane in a stubborn effort to close the gap.
The loss of four of his UAE team-mates to positive Covid tests and falls however hurt those chances.
On Thursday, Vinge­gaard’s Jumbo team-mate Wout van Aert acted as a sherpa for his team leader on the final climb, and it was at that moment that Pogacar finally cracked.
Earlier and likely equally as damaging, some 28km from home, Pogacar misjudged a corner and Vingegaard cut inside him, spooking the Slovenian who then wobbled and slipped off into a gutter.
The champion swiftly picked himself up, ignoring the gash on his left hand as he hammered the pedal down in pursuit.
Vingegaard, after at first attacking the opportunity, had a change of heart, waiting for his rival, before the two grasped each other’s hand as Pogacar drew up alongside.
“We like each other, we get on and we respect each other,” said the Dane.
The gesture will likely serve Vingegaard’s reputation well, within the cycling code of honour, and with the wider public.
Vingegaard now leads Pogacar by 3 minutes and 26 seconds, while Ineos veteran Geraint Thomas is still third at 8min exactly, three minutes ahead of fourth-placed David Gaudu.
This was the sixth stage finish on this iconic Pyrenean climb, with Vingegaard’s fellow Dane Bjarne Riis in 1996 and Italy’s Vincenzo Nibali in 2014 both going on to win the Tour after winning at the summit.
Stage 19 runs through the isolated Tarn region and will likely end in a bunch sprint.
Saturday’s stage however is a brutal 41km individual time trial, leaving a glimmer of hope for Pogacar.

1,Yousuf lauds Pakistan for hard-earned win at Galle,"""The credit for this win no doubt goes to our batters,"" he says.","KARACHI: Pakistan batting coach Mohammad Yousuf has praised the national team for their match-winning performance in the first Test against Sri Lanka in tough conditions at Galle.
“As the [team’s] batting coach, I feel proud the way the team played in Galle under difficult [batting] conditions,” Yousuf said in a video released by the Pakistan Cricket Board on Thursday.

 





 
“Chasing a huge 344, and that too on a square turner in Galle where before this Test big totals were never successfully achieved, when [slow left-arm spinner] Prabath Jaya­suriya and other Sri Lankan spinners were creating all sorts of trouble is indeed a massive achievement,” the 47-year-old underlined.
“The credit for this win no doubt goes to our batters.”
Yousuf, who played 90 Tests during an illustrious career, specifically commended opener Abdullah Shafi­que whose glorious unbeaten century took Pakistan to a hard-earned four-wicket victory on the last day.
“Crafting a marathon fourth-innings century on a massively turning track at a tender age of 22 in your sixth Test is a great feat indeed. I think I at this age did not batted like he did,” Yousuf said of the right-hander who now holds a handsome batting average of 80.00 in Tests.
The coach also mentioned the positive approach of the Sialkot-born batter.
“On the morning of the final day before the start of play, I asked Abdullah, who had already spent more than four hours at the crease [on the fourth day], how he was feeling [mentally and physically and what should be done next [to win the Test],” Yousuf, who according to unconfirmed reports is going to be appointed as national team’s batting coach permanently, said.
“He [Abdullah] responded in a highly positive tone saying he was absolutely fine and would try to finish the game, which shows his maturity as a batter who did not let [physical or mental] fatigue overwhelm him in any way.”
Yousuf had a special word of praise for captain Babar Azam whose century in the first innings kept the tourists, who at one stage were tottering at 85-7, alive.
“Babar is among the world’s top three batters. His classic century, which was a good blend of attack and defence, under pressure was exceptional and is very rare.”
Yousuf also applauded the cameos played by Mohammad Rizwan (40) and Mohammad Nawaz (19 not out) in the second innings, saying their contribution in very demanding batting conditions was crucial in making sure Pakistan got to the target.
“The last-day batting by Rizwan and Nawaz was priceless. Rizwan’s belligerent stance in his short yet vital knock must have given confidence to Abdullah and Nawaz’s end­u­rance and wise handling of the Sri Lankan spinners on a wearing pitch made sure we reached the target.”
He also highlighted the role played by head coach Saqlain Mushtaq for the Pakistan team.
“Credit for this victory also goes to Saqlain who enjoys a very good chemistry with Babar. Both of them combine well for the team which is doing well,” Yousuf concluded.

2,Pakistan great Wasim Akram wants ODIs to be scrapped,Says the 50-over game has no future in front of the ever-growing T20 format.,"LONDON: Pakistan pace bowling legend Wasim Akram feels ODI cricket has become “run-of-the-mill” stuff now and wants the administrators of the game to scrap the format for good.
Wasim’s comments came close on the heels of England all-rounder Ben Stokes’ sudden retirement from ODIs, which has triggered a serious debate over the existence of 50-over cricket.
“I think so [ODIs should scrapped]. In England you have full houses. In India, Pakistan especially, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa, one-day cricket you are not going to fill the stadiums,” he said in Vaughany and Tuffers Cricket Club podcast.
“They are doing it just for the sake of doing it. After the first 10 overs, it’s just ‘OK, just go a run a ball, get a boundary, four fielders in and you get to 200, 220 in 40 overs’ and then have a go last 10 overs. Another 100. It’s kind of run-of-the-mill.”
Wasim supported Stokes’ decision to quit from ODIs, citing “unsustainable” workload.
“Him [Stokes] deciding that he is retiring from one-day cricket is quite sad but I agree with him,” said the left-arm pacer, who scalped 502 wickets in 356 ODIs during his career, besides bowling Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup final.
“Even as a commentator … one-day cricket is just a drag now, especially after T20. I can imagine as a player. 50 overs, 50 overs, then you have to pre-game, post-game, the lunch game,” added the cricketer-turned-commentator.
Wasim said the 50-over game has no future in front of the ever-growing T20 format.
“T20 is kind of easier, four hours the game is over. The leagues all around the world, there is a lot more money — I suppose this is part and parcel of the modern cricket. T20 or Test cricket. One-day cricket is kind of dying.
“It is quite tiring for a player to play one-day cricket. After T20, one-day cricket seems it is going for days. So players are focussing on more shorter format. And longer format obviously [with] Test cricket,” he said.
For Wasim, Test cricket remains the pinnacle of the game for a player.
“There’s a battle within the battle in Test cricket. I always preferred Test matches. One-day used to be fun but Test matches were where you were recognised as a player … where people still pick you for the world XIs,” he said.
“OK money matters - I understand where they are coming from — but they should also remember if they want to be recognised as one of the greats of the game.”
He also called on the administrators of the game to consider a complete overhaul of the overall schedule.

3,PHF asks for time as PSB pushes for elections,LAHORE: Pakistan Hockey Federation president retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar remains de-notified by the Pakistan...,"LAHORE: Pakistan Hockey Federation president retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar remains de-notified by the Pakistan Sports Board despite his claims that matters pertaining to it had been settled. 
Earlier this month, the PSB had de-notified the PHF hierarchy for not holding its elections due on May 14 but last week Khokhar had a meeting with federal sports minister Ehsan-ur-Rehman Mazari and told Dawn on Thursday that an amicable settlement had been reached. 
“I had a good discussion with the federal sports minister and now it is the job of the PSB to take further action,” he said. 
The PSB, however, isn’t endorsing that view. PSB director general retired Col Asif Zaman told Dawn on Thursday that the de-notification hadn’t been withdrawn and the PHF was bound to hold the elections. 
Khokhar admitted that elections were due but added “it’s a lengthy process and will take time”. 
Well-placed sources have told Dawn that a change at the top of the PHF is on the cards as the PSB took the step of de-notifying Khokhar and two other officials after taking the higher authorities into confidence. 
However, it comes with Pakistan due to take part in the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham later this month. 
Khokhar has helmed the PHF since 2015 but the fortunes of the Pakistan hockey team have gone from bad to worse. Pakistan has failed to qualify for the last two Olympics and more recently failed in its bid to secure a spot at the World Cup next year.

England are due to face Pakistan in seven Twenty20 Internationals during September-October before coming back in November to play a three-Test series.
The security delegation, which included Richard Snowball, Robert Lynch, John Carr and Reg Dickason visited the home secretary office, the Punjab Safe City Project, the team hotel and the National High Performance Centre.
Having arrived in Lahore after a day-long inspection in Karachi on Wednesday, the delegation will visit the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday before heading home in the wee hours on Saturday.
England, who last toured Pakistan in 2005, were due to tour Pakistan in October last year for two T20s before withdrawing from the series.
It soured relations between the ECB and the Pakistan Cricket Board before the former agreed to compensate for that loss by agreeing to play two additional matches during its five-game tour scheduled for this year.
The PCB plans to host the Twenty20 matches in Lahore and Karachi while the proposed venues for the three Tests are Karachi, Rawalpindi and Multan.

5,India favourites in ODI series against West Indies even without stars,"The Indians have opted to rest Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah for this assignment.","PORT OF SPAIN: West Indies and India commence a three-match One-day International ser­ies in Trinidad on Friday with the visitors, even without their most prominent players, favoured to get the better of a struggling home side.
Fresh from a 2-1 series triumph in England, the Indians have opted to rest regular captain Rohit Sharma, key batsman Virat Kohli, wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant, all-rounder Hardik Pandya and pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah for this assignment.
The mega stars’ absence has presented an opportunity for eager fringe players to shine at the expense of a team that was swept 3-0 by Bangladesh in Guyana last week.
West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran complained about both the quality of pitches against the Bangladeshis at Providence and the early start time which he felt conspired to favour the team bowling first too heavily for there to be an even contest.
That speculation overlooks the reality that the two-time former World Cup winners have been consistently poor in the 50 overs-per-side format for several years, and given the unsettled weather leading up to the series-opener, it is quite possible that the playing surface will not be dissimilar to the bowler-friendly conditions in Guyana.
“We have players quite capable of batting for long periods but we need to get it together and hold strong,” said West Indies coach Phil Simmons in looking ahead to the challenges his top order is expected to face in the series.
“Players like [Shai] Hope and [Kyle] Mayers are Test batsmen so they have the temperament to bat right through the innings.”
Even with that quintet of star players opting for a rest, India enjoy an embarrassment of riches, not least in the bowling department where they possess the quality and variety to exploit both the conditions and a vulnerable West Indies batting line-up.
Pacer Mohammed Siraj, one of an array of players who responded magnificently to the challenge of filling the breach in India’s Test series triumph in Australia in 2020/21, and wrist-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal are expected to lead the effort to keep pressure on their opponents, many of whom were found wanting technically and temperamentally against Bangladesh’s spin-dominated attack.
For the home team, the one bit of encouraging news in the days since the end of the Bangladesh series is the return of Jason Holder.
Having been rested for series in The Netherlands, Pakistan and the visit by Bangladesh, the all-rounder and former captain will be looked to for inspiration with bat and ball.
Pressure is very much on current skipper Pooran though to lift his team out of the doldrums into which they have appeared to sink so rapidly following comfortable 2-0 series wins in Tests and T20 Internationals against Bangladesh.
His top-score of 73 last Satur­day at the Guyana National Sta­di­um ended a succession of mediocre contributions in ODI’s but the West Indies will need to have all hands on deck, especially opening batsman Shai Hope, if they are to get anywhere close to posting the sort of totals which could seriously challenge their opponents.
With so many big names absent for India, the likes of batsmen Ishan Kishan, Shubman Gill and Suryakumar Yadav, together with all-rounder Deepak Hooda are expected to come to the fore, and with another World T20 campaign mere months away in Australia followed by India’s hosting of the next World Cup in 2023, incentives to deliver are aplenty.
Aside from the desire for long-overdue team success, several West Indies cricketers, like spinner Akeal Hosein and batsman Brandon King, will also view these matches as opportunities to advertise their abilities to the franchise owners of the lucrative Indian Premier League as they seek to join the conveyor belt of Caribbean talent which has been on show since the advent of the IPL in 2008.
All three ODI’s will be played at Queen’s Park Oval after which the teams switch format but stay in Trinidad for the first T20 International at the Brian Lara Stadium in Tarouba. From there it’s on to St Kitts for two games before the five-match series concludes in the US with two fixtures at Lauderhill in Florida.
Teams (probable):
WEST INDIES: Nicholas Pooran (capt), Shai Hope (wicketkeeper), Kyle Mayers, Brandon King, Keacy Carty, Rovman Powell, Jason Holder, Alzarri Joseph, Akeal Hosein, Gudakesh Motie, Jayden Seales.
INDIA: Shikhar Dhawan (capt), Ishan Kishan (wicketkeeper), Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav, Shreyas Iyer, Deepak Hooda, Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Mohammed Siraj, Yuzvendra Chahal, Avesh Khan.

6,"Jeruto storms world steeple, Feng wins discus","EUGENE: Kenyan-born Norah Jeruto set a World Championships record en route to winning the women’s 3,000 metres...","EUGENE: Kenyan-born Norah Jeruto set a World Championships record en route to winning the women’s 3,000 metres steeplechase gold for Kazakhstan while China’s Feng Bin outdid Olympic champion Valerie Allman with a massive personal best to claim the discus title on Wednesday. 
While day five of action at Hayward Field featured only two finals, South African heavyweights Caster Semenya and Wayde van Niekerk were trackside along with 400m hurdles stars Sydney McLaughlin and Dalilah Muhammad in a series of high-calibre heats and semi-finals. 
Jeruto, who switched allegiance from Kenya to Kazakhstan earlier this year, clocked the third fastest time in history and a championship record of 8min 53.02sec — more than five seconds better than previous winner Beatrice Chepkoech’s mark in Doha in 2019 —for the steeplechase victory in Eugene. 
Werkuha Getachew set an Ethiopian record of 8:54.61 for silver, while her compatriot Mekides Abebe, made the most of a mistake by Kenyan-born Bahraini Winfred Mutile Yavi on the final water barrier, to snatch bronze (8:56.08). 
“At the starting line, I was afraid of my friends from Ethiopia,” Jeruto said of her competitors. “They are also champions like me so I was scared of them. I tried my best to win the race and it was not easy.” 
The discus was all but over after the first round as Feng threw 69.12m on her opening visit to the ring, improving by more than three metres her previous best of 66.00m set in Beijing in April. 
Croatia’s Sandra Perkovic, a two-time Olympic champion and also twice a world gold medallist, claimed silver with 68.45m. American Allman took bronze with 68.30m. Reigning champion Yaime Perez ended in seventh place. 
“I am so excited and I have to say all opponents did a very good job today,” said Feng, who finished 17th in Tokyo last year. “I did not expect this result coming to Eugene, I just wanted to show my best.” 
Semenya’s first appearance in a world championships in five years saw the controversy-mired South African fail to qualify for the women’s 5000m finals. 
In roasting mid-afternoon temperatures, the two-time Olympic gold medallist finished 13th in the first of two rounds in 15:46.12, more than 45sec off the 15th and final qualifying place. 
“Cooking!” said Semenya, who was forced to switch from her favoured 800m (in which she is also a former three-time champion) to the longer event due to gender eligibility rules that required her to take testosterone-reducing drugs to compete in races between 400m to a mile post-race. 
“It was hot, I could not keep up with the pace, I tried to stick as much as I can, but you know, it is a part of the game. I think it is great to be able to run here,” she added. “Just being able to finish the 5k, for me it is a blessing. I am learning and I am willing to learn even more.” 
Her time was far off the heat-winning 14:52.64 set by Ethiopian Gudaf Tsegay, fresh from her silver in the 1500m. 
Semenya’s team-mate Wayde van Niekerk qualified for the final of the men’s 400m after finishing second in his semi-final in 44.75sec. 
Van Niekerk set the world record of 43.03sec when winning Olympic gold in Rio, but then sustained a nasty knee injury that saw him sit out track for three years. 
“It is the challenge of doing this 400m and not having as many races in my legs as I would love to have by now,” he acknowledged. “But I made it through and I felt comfortable for the majority of the race. So it is about recovering now and getting ready for the final. 
“It is a learning process in every race. I am listening to my body and executing that way. It has been a challenging three years and now, I just want to come out and do my best. I need to be back with every step I take to be able to challenge my record.” 
US one-lap medal hope Michael Norman topped qualifying times for what should be an ultra-competitive final on Friday. 
Elsewhere, record-holder McLaughlin and fellow American Muhammad set up a highly anticipated showdown in the women’s 400 metres hurdles final, after winning their respective heats. 
“It’s going to be a great race, I know that for sure,” said McLaughlin. 
In the women’s 400 metres, double Olympic champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo cruised to victory in her semi-final, while Dominican Republic’s Marileidy Paulino, who won silver in Tokyo, also qualified for the finals. 
The United States’ relay hopes took a hit as 100 metres champion Fred Kerley pulled out of the 4x100 metres relay due to injury. 
Kerley was diagnosed with a “slight injury to his quad” in the semi-finals of the 200m, from which he failed to advance.

China hosted the Winter Olympics under strict health protocols in February but almost every other international sporting event in the country this year has been cancelled or postponed. 
“ATP has today confirmed the Shanghai Masters, China Open [Beijing], Chengdu Open, and Zhuhai Championships will not take place in 2022 due to ongoing restrictions related to COVID-19,” a statement for the men’s tour announced. 
“This marks the third year of cancellation for the ATP’s China swing, typically hosted in September and October and last staged in 2019, prior to the pandemic,” it added. 
The six new events are in San Diego, Seoul, Tel Aviv, Florence, Gijon and Naples between September 19 and October 23. 
All six are ATP 250 tournaments, with the men’s tour announcing that two existing 250 events in Astana and Tokyo were being upgraded to 500 level. 
“All other events for the remainder of the ATP Tour season are currently set to proceed as scheduled,” the statement read, with the season culminating at the Next Gen ATP Finals in Milan and ATP Finals in Turin. 
As of July 20, mainland China had confirmed 228,180 cases of Covid-19 with symptoms since the pandemic first struck in December 2019. 
Although the number is small by global standards, authorities in China are sticking to a stringent zero-Covid policy, while other countries have relaxed their rules and chosen to live with the virus. 
The French Open and Wimbledon were recently held without any health restrictions and it was unlikely players would have agreed to go to China if there was any period of isolation involved. 
“As a global sport we continue to manage the impacts of the pandemic,” ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said. “Event cancellations are an unfortunate reality. At the same time, it’s incredibly encouraging to have many great cities step up to host ATP Tour tennis this season.” 
The women’s tour has no events scheduled in China for 2022 as the WTA works to find a resolution to the standoff with China over Peng Shuai. 
Former doubles world number one Peng’s wellbeing became a concern for the WTA after she posted a message on social media last November accusing China’s former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault.

Earlier this week, Sky Sports said Arsenal would pay Premier League champions City 30 million pounds up front, with two million pounds in add-ons, for the 25-year-old, who will become their fifth recruit in the close season.
Zinchenko worked with Arteta when the Spaniard was an assistant to Pep Guardiola at City from 2016 to 2019.
“There are still a few formalities to get everything completed but we’re really happy to have him,” Arteta told reporters after Arsenal’s 3-1 win over Orlando City.  “I know the player really well. He’s an exceptional footballer.
“He is someone that is going to bring as well another competitive edge to that dressing room. He was a natural No. 10 early in his career and we converted him into a left back which can do a lot of things that we want in our way of playing.
“That versatility is something that is going to be important for the team because we have players in that position (left back) who are more specific full backs, so I’m really happy.”  Arsenal beat Major League Soccer’s Orlando to claim a third pre-season win, with Eddie Nketiah, Gabriel Martinelli and Reiss Nelson getting on the scoresheet for the English club, while Facundo Torres scored the home side’s only goal.
Arsenal will also take on Premier League rivals Chel­sea in the US before rounding off their pre-season preparations aga­inst Sevilla in London on July 30.
They begin their league campaign on Aug 5 with a London derby at Crystal Palace.

13,Bracewell hat-trick completes New Zealand rout of Ireland in second Twenty20,BELFAST: Michael Bracewell rounded off New Zealand’s crushing 88-run win over Ireland in the second T20 at Belfast...,"BELFAST: Michael Bracewell rounded off New Zealand’s crushing 88-run win over Ireland in the second T20 at Belfast on Wednesday with a hat-trick.
Ireland, chasing 180 to win, collapsed to 91 all out inside 14 overs at Stormont and were all but beaten when off-spinner Bracewell removed tailenders Mark Adair, Barry McCarthy and Craig Young with successive deliveries to become only the third New Zealand bowler to take a hat-trick at this level after pacemen Jacob Oram and Tim Southee. 
Leg-spinner Ish Sodhi broke the back of Ireland’s innings by removing Curtis Campher, Lorcan Tucker and George Dockrell in a return of 3-21. 
Had it not been for an eighth-wicket stand of 37 between Adair, who top-scored in the innings with 27, and McCarthy, Ireland might have suffered an even more crushing defeat. 
Ireland’s chase had started in style, with experienced opener Paul Stirling smashing spinner Mitchell Santner for a six and a four in the first over.
Stirling also struck fast bowler Lockie Ferguson through the covers for another four only to fall for 21 when he sliced the paceman to mid-off. 
His exit prompted a dramatic collapse that saw seven wickets lost for 31 runs as 23-0 was transformed rapidly into 54-7, with Jacob Duffy bowling No 3 Gareth Delany for a golden duck. 
Earlier, Dane Cleaver’s unbeaten 78 took New Zealand to 179-4 after Ireland captain Andy Balbirnie won the toss. 
Cleaver, playing only his second T20 international, faced 55 balls including five fours and four sixes after coming into bat when New Zealand were 44-1 in the fifth over. 
The series concludes when the teams return to Stormont on Friday.

14,Shaheen out of second Sri Lanka Test with knee injury,He will stay with the Test side in Sri Lanka where his rehabilitation will continue under supervision of team's medical staff.,"GALLE: Pakistan pace bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi has been ruled out of the second Test against Sri Lanka with a knee injury, the team said Thursday. 
Shaheen, a left-arm quick, played a key part in the tourists’ opening win on Wednesday in Galle as he took four wickets in the first innings. 
Shaheen, key for Pakistan in all three formats, was injured on the fourth day of the Test.
“Due to a knee injury sustained on the fourth day of the first Test, Shaheen Afridi will miss the second Test, which will be played in Galle from July 24,” read a team statement. 
He will stay with the Test side in Sri Lanka, where his initial rehabilitation and management will continue under the supervision of the team’s medical staff, the release added. 
The 22-year-old Shaheen, who has taken 99 wickets in 25 Tests since making his debut in 2018, led the Pakis­tan pace attack including Hasan Ali and Naseem Shah in the match that ended on a tense fifth day. 
Opener Abdullah Shafique hit an unbeaten 160 to anchor Pakistan’s record chase of 342 at the Galle International Stadium to lead the two-match series 1-0. 
HOSTS LOSE THEEKSHANA 
Earlier on Thursday, Sri Lanka Cricket said that bowler Maheesh Theekshana had been ruled out of the second Test with a finger injury. 
The spinner returned figures of 2-68 in Pakistan’s first innings in the opening Test. Uncapped all-rou­nder Lakshitha Manasinghe comes into the squad as replacement. 
Batsman Pathum Nissanka, who contracted Covid in the middle of the second Australia Test earlier this month, returns for the final Pakistan match starting on Sunday in Galle.
The series is of vital importance for Sri Lanka, in terms of crucial World Test Championship points. After their loss in the first Test, they slipped to the sixth position in the table, with a points percentage of 48.15. Pakistan, on the other hand, moved up to the third spot, with a points percentage of 58.33.
