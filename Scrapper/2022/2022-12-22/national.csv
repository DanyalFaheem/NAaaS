0,ANALYSIS: ‘Constitutional battle’ likely to land in court,Legal experts believe that a legal battle appears to be the only way forward for resolution of the current crisis in Punjab.,"LAHORE: The ongoing ‘constitutional battle’ between the federal and Punjab governments is likely to land in courts as some questions of law have arisen after Governor Balighur Rehman asked Chief Minister Parvez Elahi to seek a “vote of confidence” in a special assembly session.
The dispute over the previous runoff election of the chief minister was also settled by the courts after the Supreme Court observed in June that a ruling passed by the presiding officer (deputy speaker) regarding the rejection of 10 votes of the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q), polled in favour of Elahi, was in violation of its judgement and Article 63-A of the Constitution.
Punjab has not seen political stability since the ouster of prime minister Imran Khan through a “vote of no confidence” in April and several petitions are still pending before the courts relating to the chief minister’s election.
If a media statement of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan is to be believed, the coalition government in the centre is mulling over the imposition of “governor rule” in Punjab since Chief Minister Elahi has not taken a vote of confidence, as asked by the governor.
A source in Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) suggested that the governor, after denotifying the chief minister, could also ask him, under Article 133 of the Constitution, to continue to hold the office until the election of his successor.
Although the lawyers reached by Dawn for their comments differ on the governor’s orders issued to the chief minister, they are unanimous that a legal battle appears to be the only way forward for resolution of the current crisis in Punjab.
Shahzad Shaukat, a former advocate general of the province, believes that any party which feels aggrieved over the actions by the governor or the assembly Speaker is certainly going to knock at the door of the Lahore High Court as a first remedy.
He does not buy the Speaker’s argument that the governor cannot summon a fresh session when the house is already in session. He says the Constitution is superior to all the laws or rules in the country and it does not put such embargo on the governor.
Shaukat argued that the validity of ongoing sessions of the assembly summoned by the speaker can also be questioned since the session called by the governor, which was held in Aiwan-i-Iqbal, has not been prorogued.
However, Safdar Shaheen Pirzada, an advocate of the Supreme Court, disagrees and argues that clause 7 of Article 130 does not allow the governor to summon a fresh session when the house is in session.
He admitted that it is not a constitutional requirement that the speaker keep the house in session only to frustrate, on technical grounds, the governor’s directive to the chief minister to seek a vote of confidence.
According to Pirzada, the Punjab Assembly’s rules and the Constitution do not cater for a situation the province faces at present.
Misunderstanding
Talking to Geo News, retired Justice Shaiq Usmani said the Speaker had misunderstood the constitutional provisions while giving his ruling on the governor’s order.
He said Article 130 (7) says the governor can summon a session if he believes that the CM has lost majority in the house.
He argued that the Constitution has given powers to the governor to summon a session and ask the CM to show that he enjoys confidence of the house.
In reply to a question what would happen if the chief minister did not take a vote of confidence, he said the CM would cease to hold office and a new incumbent should be elected.
In another Geo News programme, a senior lawyer of the Supreme Court, Salman Akram Raja, said it is debatable that clause 7 of Article 130 says the governor shall summon the provincial assembly and require the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence.
It means, he added, the present assembly is not in session and the governor has specially summoned the assembly for a vote of confidence. “And a new session could be called for this specific purpose.”
He said the rules of the Punjab Assembly, which speak about the vote of confidence, were made before the 18th Amendment. He believed confusion abounded and the speaker could explain through ruling whether he needs a new session for the vote of confidence or not, following the 18th Amendment.
Rule 22 of the Punjab Assembly (rules of procedure) says: “If, on the day fixed by the Governor for obtaining a vote of confidence from the Assembly under clause 7 of Article 130 of the Constitution, the Chief Minister refrains from doing so, it shall be deemed that he does not command the confidence of the majority of the members.”
In the same television programme, a former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Hamid Khan, said when an assembly is already in session, the governor is unable to call a new sitting under Article 130.

1,Lahore fog forces PIA to partly shift operations,All international PIA flights between 10pm and 11am to use Islamabad airport.,"RAWALPINDI: Due to poor visibility and fog in Lahore, Pakistan International Airlines on Wednes­day decided to shift all international flight operations between 10pm and 11am from the capital of Punjab to Islamabad.
The rescheduling of flights during these hours is temporary and will be restored as soon as the foggy conditions improve, according to the national flag carrier.
A PIA spokesman said, in a press release issued on Wednesday, the in­­ternational flight operations between 10pm and 11am was moved from Allama Iqbal Inter­national Airport to Islamabad due to foggy weather conditions. The move was aimed at ensuring air safety and saving long waiting time for passengers, he claimed.
 






For timely information of flights, air travellers, as well as those visiting the airport to pick or drop passengers, have been requested to contact PIA call centre at 786786111. PIA passengers have also been requested to record their correct contact number at the time of booking so that they can be provided with timely information about changes in flight timings through call or SMS.

The PIA spokesman made it clear that the arrangement for shifting the flight operations had been made temporarily in order to avoid inconvenience of ‘prolonged wait’ to travellers. As soon as the foggy conditions improved, the operations would be restored at Lahore, he added.
Motorway closure
Not only air travellers but also motorists using GT Road and motorway were facing problems due to the foggy weather.
The motorway section from Kot Momin to Faisalabad was closed due to the severity of the fog, which started to increase at around 6pm on Wednesday, DIG Motorway Police (North Zone), told Dawn.
He said the motorway’s closure depended on visibility usually affected by fog.
Heavy fog also caused problems on the Peshawar-Burhan highway, he said.
The Swat Expressway had already been closed for all types of traffic from Colonel Sher Khan to Ismaila due to fog, according to a motorway police spokesman.
He said the public had been requested to avoid unnecessary travel in foggy weather.
In case of necessary travel, however, drivers should use fog lights and ensure the functioning of backlights and wipers and seek assistance from helpline 130 before starting the journey.

2,Special JIT records statement of Arshad Sharif’s mother,Unsolved cases cast shadow over suitability of officer investigating journalist’s high-profile murder.,"ISLAMABAD: The Spe­c­ial Joint Investi­ga­tion Team (SJIT) on Wednesday visited slain journalist Arshad Sharif’s residence to record his mother’s statement.
In addition, it was learnt that members of the probe team are planning to head to Karachi to record the statements of family members of the two brothers Khurram and Waqar, who accompanied Sharif while he was in Kenya.
The government is also said to be considering the repatriation of the two men from Kenya, Interior Minis­ter Rana Sanaullah has already indicated that the journalist was murdered and the incident requires further investigation.
Separately, questions have been raised on the suitability of an individual who was part of the SJIT to probe the high-profile killing, as one of the officers on the team has previously failed to adequately probe two high profile murders that happened on his watch.

Unsolved cases cast shadow over suitability of officer investigating journalist’s high-profile murder

The capabilities of the official, who has served on the key posts of SSP and DIG Operations in Islamabad, was leading the capital police’s investigations into the Jan 2021 murder of 22-year-old Osama Satti, who was shot in his car by police officials, as well as the rape and murder of 10-year-old Farishta, whose family were allegedly subjected to humiliating treatment by the officials tasked with probing her initial disappearance.
The inquiry conducted to probe these killings blamed the SSP and DIG Operations for failing to “observe their legal responsibility”. 
An inquiry into the 2019 murder of Farishta held the SSP Operations and DIG Operations — both posts were held by the same person at the time — responsible, along with the capital police chief, since they “failed to meticulously observe their legal responsibility”.
Since the official in question held both positions concurrently, the inquiry report said, it was his responsibility to ensure the timely registration of the case and to post efficient SHOs. 
As per the record, the report notes, neither the inspector general or the DIG (Operations) conducted even a single inspection of the police station where the maltreatment took place. It further said the spirit of Chapter 22 of Police Rules 1934 “requires the supervisory officers to personally inspect the police station and note down their remakes in register No 13”.
A judicial inquiry into the murder of Osama Satti also blamed top Islamabad police officials for deploying the “Anti-Terrorism Squad/Crises Response Team, [a] highly skilled force that was not trained to restrain itself” in areas like Srinagar Highway.
It also revealed the Rescue 1122 team was given a “wrong address” and subsequently told to go back through wireless control as if “nothing had happened”.
**Dawn* reached out to the officer in question several times for comment, but he chose not to respond.*

3,Flood-hit areas exposed to harsh winter: UN,ISLAMABAD: The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in an interim report on flood damage severity...,"ISLAMABAD: The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in an interim report on flood damage severity and propensity for severe weather says 14 districts of Sindh, 10 districts of Balochistan, nine districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and two of Punjab have been identified as the most exposed to difficult winter conditions.
The UNOCHA report, made available on Wed­nes­day, says that with the onset of winter season, stagnant receding water, displacements at inadequate and makeshift sites, damaged shelters and the lack of appropriate winter clothing, basic household items and safe heating supplies, are contributing to placing millions of people at risk of illness, disease and protection concerns, especially gender-based violence.
Currently, an estimated 14.6 million people need food assistance, while over seven million children and women need immediate access to nutrition services. This includes over 520,000 children facing severe acute malnutrition (SAM) requiring immediate treatment, and close to 80,000 children needing urgent medical interventions due to SAM-related medical complications, the report says.
Preliminary estimates indicate an increase in the national poverty rate of 3.7 per cent to 4pc as a direct result of the floods, placing between 8.4m and 9.1m people into abject poverty.
The report says the losses in food production are compounded by disruption of income and livelihood and the rising prices amid national and global inflation.
An estimated 4.4m acres of crop area, enough to cultivate crop for 14.6m people remain damaged, and more than 800,000 livestock lost.

4,Nawaz becomes latest beneficiary of amended NAB law,"Case against PML-N supremo, Zardari, Gilani about Toshakhana vehicles returned; court also lacks jurisdiction to try ex-president.","ISLAMABAD: PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif got the first benefit from the recent amendment in the accountability law when a court on Wednesday returned a Toshakhana reference to the anti-graft watchdog that had implicated him as well as PPP leader Asif Zardari and former premier Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani as accused.
The reference, relating to vehicles obtained by the two leaders from the state treasury with the help of Mr Gilani by paying small sums of money as is required by law, was returned by the accountability court to the NAB chairman citing lack of jurisdiction because of the National Accountability (2nd amendment) Act, 2022, that set Rs500 million threshold to make it triable as a NAB case.
Judge Mohammad Bashir returned another reference against Mr Zardari involving a Rs8.3 billion suspicious transaction between the account of Bahria Town and the account of an aide to the ex-president.
In the Toshakhana reference, the court had declared former prime minister Nawaz Sharif a proclaimed offender in September 2020.

Case against PML-N supremo, Zardari, Gilani about Toshakhana vehicles returned; court also lacks jurisdiction to try ex-president in reference involving Rs8.3bn

According to the reference, Mr Sharif and Mr Zardari obtained vehicles from Toshakhana by paying only 15 per cent of the price of the luxury vehicles.
NAB alleged that ex-PM Gilani had facilitated the allotment of vehicles to Mr Zardari and Mr Sharif by “dishonestly and illegally” relaxing the procedure for acceptance and disposal of state gifts vide a Cabinet Division memorandum issued in 2007.
Farooq H. Naek, counsel for Mr Zardari and Mr Gilani, argued before the court that the investigation report worked out that the national exchequer had suffered a loss of Rs118.52m whereas amendments to Section 9 and Section 10 of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999, made earlier this year, had set Rs500m minimum value for a case to be investigated by NAB.
Moreover, he said, Sections 3-4 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA), 2010, are not applicable to the case against Mr Zardari and Mr Gilani as there is no predicate offence that has been alleged against them, he said.
Mr Naek argued that since NAB lacks jurisdiction in the matter, the court has no jurisdiction in respect of the predicate offence under the NAO.
NAB prosecutor Sohail Arif, on the other hand, argued that the value of predicate offence as per the charge framed by the court is Rs118.52m, which is less than Rs500m as required under Section 5(o) of the NAO for having jurisdiction in the matter.
The court ruled: “In view of Section 5(o) of the NAO, 1999, when the value of the alleged offence under NAO is less than Rs500 million, the case is beyond the domain of NAB and trial under section 3-4 of AMLA, 2010 cannot be continued.”
It declared: “The jurisdiction of this court is as such ousted”.
The judge then returned the reference to the NAB chairman with the directive to the court staff to “return the reference books to the chairman through the investigation officer of the case”.
Suspicious transaction
The reference book pertaining to the Rs8.3bn suspicious transaction was also returned to the NAB chairman by the court.
The NAB had accused Mr Zardari of constructing his house in Clifton, Karachi, with the ill-gotten money. According to details mentioned in the reference, Mushtaq Ahmed, another accused, had provided Rs150m for the construction of the house.
The reference said that Mr Zardari could not provide proof of his claim that he had built the house through legal means.
According to the reference, an illegal transaction of Rs8.3bn was made via Mushtaq Ahmed’s bank account with the money being paid to M/s Bahria Town (Pvt) Limited.
Mushtaq Ahmed worked as a government employee in the President House from 2009 to 2013. He was recruited as a stenographer on the recommendation of Senator Rukhsana Bangash.
Another accused is Zain Malik, son-in-law of Bahria Town’s owner Malik Riaz.
Mr Naek argued that NAB had no jurisdiction to investigate this case since the “value of the offence is Rs150 million which is less than Rs500 million as required under Section 5(o) of NAO added through the NAO 2nd amendment Act 2022 and is given retrospective effect”.
The court noted that it lacks jurisdiction in this matter as well and directed the court staff to return the case file to the NAB chairman.

5,Federal govt consulting provinces on plan to save energy: Asif,QUETTA: The federal government has thrashed out a strategy for energy conservation and started consultations with...,"QUETTA: The federal government has thrashed out a strategy for energy conservation and started consultations with provincial governments in order to remove its flaws before implementation, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said during a meeting at the Quetta Airport on Wednesday.
Petroleum Minister Musadik Malik, Prime Minister’s Adviser Qamar Zaman Kaira, Maulana Abdul Wasey of the JUI-F and Energy Secretary Rashid Mahmood Langaryal accompanied Khawaja Asif.
The defence minister said the government was determined to save energy consumption by adopting drastic measures that would require the nation to make “radical changes in lifestyle”. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had directed the cabinet to share recommendations of a special committee for energy conservation with the provincial governments, the minister said.
The present government inherited a host of problems after taking over in April, a lack of money among them. “But the floods made matters worse by rendering millions of people homeless and financially vulnerable,” the defence minister observed.
Khawaja Asif said the entire world, except Pakistan, opens for business in the morning and downs shutters by sunset. “But the situation is starkly different in our country as markets remain open till late in the night, causing a colossal waste of energy.”
The minister said the special committee had suggested closure of markets and business establishments by 8pm and restaurants by 10pm. “The panel has also suggested changing the working hours of government offices.”
He expressed confidence that the nation would cooperate with the government in implementing the energy conservation strategy.
Khawaja Asif and other members of his delegation stayed at Quetta airport for several hours before returning to Islamabad. Senator Manzoor Kakar, Balochistan’s Finance Minister Zamarak Khan Achakzai and representatives of the Traders and Farmers Action Committee had a meeting with Khawaja Asif at the airport and offered suggestions for resolving the energy crisis.

6,Achakzai re-elected PkMAP chief,• Calls for handling Afghanistan situation ‘humanely’  • Party also elects central and provincial office-bearers,"• Calls for handling Afghanistan situation ‘humanely’
• Party also elects central and provincial office-bearers
QUETTA: The seventh National Con­gress of the Pashtoonkhwah Milli Aw­a­mi Party (PkMAP) on Wednesday re-elected Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the party’s chairman, Arshad Khan Sw­­abi as senior deputy chairman and Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal as general secretary.
The three-day congress, which concluded on Wednesday night, also elected central and provincial office-bearers, including Abdur Rauf Lala as deputy chairman, and Attal Khan Achakzai as senior deputy secretary.
Among the central secretaries elected were Nawab Ayaz Khan Jogezai, Jumma Gul, Rasan Safi, Nazir Jan Lala, Malik Shaukat, Talimand Khan, Dr Kaleemullah, Fazal Qadir Sherani, Dr Hamid Khan Achakzai, Musa Bacha, Jabbar Khan and Dr Jamil Khan Panizai.
The provincial presidents elected by the party congress included Abdul Qahar Wadan for Balochistan, Dr Mohammad Ali for Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa, Janan Afghan for Punjab, and Saleem Tareen for Sindh.
The congress also elected national and four provincial Qaumi Jirgas as an electoral college to elect central, provincial executives or cabinets and working committees, respectively.
The congress, attended by delegates from all provinces, discussed organisational affairs, structure and constitution, and endorsed decisions taken by the party chairman in the interim period between the sixth and seventh congresses.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Achakzai highlighted the egalitarianism of the Pakhtun society in which the noble and a commoner could eat at the same table without any discrimination.
He said Pakhtuns had contributed to human civilisation and politics by constituting states, kingdoms and governance systems on Pakhtun-Afghan land as well as in the subcontinent in various periods of history. For instance, he said, the Sher Shah Suri model of governance and administration was still a point of reference for a welfare system.
“Foreigners’ travelogues have recorded that in Pakhtuns’ land, food and boarding are free for travellers and strangers, as hospitality is enshrined in the codes of ‘Pashtoonwali’,” Mr Achakzai said and wondered how such a society could breed terrorists and terrorism.
The PkMAP chairman said that terrorism and ensuing physical, political and economic sufferings inflicted on Pakhtuns and Afghans living on both sides of the Durand Line were the direct outcome of the international and regional powers’ policies and they pursued their nefarious strategic and economic interests.
He said if the prevailing situation in Afghanistan was not handled humanely and according to principles of international justice and peaceful co-existence, its seismic effects could be felt across the region and beyond.
He said that several superpowers entered as aggressors to conquer Afghanistan, but they never succeeded in their designs.
He urged Pakhtuns to forge unity in their ranks to counter the existential threats that they currently face.
