0,Karachi court issues non-bailable arrest warrants for Waqar Zaka in cryptocurrency scam case,FIA says Zaka fraudulently and dishonestly committed the offences of virtual assets/cryptocurrency trading.,"A Karachi court issued on Thursday a non-bailable arrest warrant for television and social media personality Waqar Zaka in a case pertaining to an Rs86 million cryptocurrency scam.
Earlier this year, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had booked Zaka in connection with an inquiry into alleged virtual currency-related transactions from his bank account.
On Thursday, when the matter was taken up by the judicial magistrate, the former TV host failed to appear in court.
Subsequently, the judge directed the office to issue a non-bailable arrest for Zaka — who is allegedly absconding to avoid his arrest in the case — and adjourned the hearing till Jan 5.
Inquiry against Zaka
The FIA has said that an inquiry was initiated against Zaka upon the receipt of a source report initiated by the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU).
It stated that during the last three years the aggregated credits of Rs86.1 million and debt of Rs87.1 million were observed in his bank account, adding that the bank’s statement revealed that the funds were being credited into the accounts through foreign remittance and clearing of cheques, which were subsequently debited through internal transfer to the accounts of his different family members.
It went on to say that Zaka used social media for charity purposes and international crowdfunding — through which he received Rs6.8 million. FIA added that the money was withdrawn through a pay order and interbank fund transfer.
“Whereas, the multiple news, blogs, and videos were found on a public database which transpires involvement of accused Waqar Zaka into cryptocurrency/virtual assets”, alleged the agency.
“During the inquiry, Bitcoin/cryptocurrency-related posts were found on his Twitter account, the accused also promotes cryptocurrency like Bitcoin”, it further alleged.
The agency maintained that after examining the report, secured documents such as copies of the bank records and institutions, and oral evidence, it had been substantiated that the accused — in violation of banking rules and regulations and prescribed law of the country — fraudulently and dishonestly committed the offences of virtual assets/cryptocurrency trading and facilitating to use virtual assets for transferring funds and generating profits.
It added that after the inquiry was initiated and the accused was summoned, he initiated false propaganda against the institutions of the state and was found involved in illegal activities through social media by putting up objectionable material/remarks against the institutions, threats to the government officials and provoking the public against the state.
He was allegedly found guilty of committing the offences punishable under the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, Pakistan Penal Code, Anti-Money Laundering Act 2020 and Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1947, FIA added.

1,Setback for MQM-P as ECP wants order to appoint administrators withdrawn,"PTI's Ali Zaidi claims the appointment of such officers around 20 days before LG polls is ""blatant pre-poll rigging"".","KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan may suffer a setback as the Election Commission of Pakistan on Wednesday asked the Sindh government to reverse the appointment of three government officers, said to be party loyalists, as administrators of Hyderabad and Karachi’s East and Korangi districts.
On Dec 19, the provincial government had appointed Muhammad Farooque, Syed Shakeel Ahmed and Muhammad Sharif as the administrators of Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and district municipal corporations of Korangi and East districts in line with an agreement between the Pakistan Peoples Party and MQM-P.
Prior to their appointment, Mr Farooque and Mr Ahmed had been working as administrator of Worker Model School, SITE Hyderabad, and Korangi, respectively. Mr Sharif had earlier been working as director-charged parking at the DMC-Central.
However, their appointment is criticised by opposition parties, which termed it a pre-poll rigging attempt as local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions were scheduled to be held on Jan 15.
On Wednesday, the office of the provincial election commissioner in a letter addressed to the local government secretary said that ECP, through a notification issued on June 10, had imposed a ban on transfer/ posting during the conduct of local government elections.
It directed the local government secretary to either withdraw the order or kept it in abeyance till the culmination of the second phase of the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions.
The letter reminded the government of an earlier ECP notification that states: “For Divisions in respect of which Election schedule of Local Government Elections has been issued no transfer / posting of the Government Officers and Officials including those of autonomous bodies/ Authorities shall be made without prior approval of the Commission till the publication of Election Results”.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Ali Zaidi said in a tweet that the ECP ordered withdrawal of the notification appointing administrators.

 





 
Earlier in the day, he told a press conference that his party had written a letter to the chief secretary and informed him that the newly-appointed administrators were affiliated with the MQM-P.
He said that the appointment of such officers as administrators around 20 days before the LG polls was blatant pre-poll rigging.
Also, the Sindh United Party (SUP) raised concerns over the appointment of administrators and Hyderabad commissioner before the LG polls.
SUP chairman and convener of the Sindh Action Committee Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah demanded that the ECP declare null and void the appointment orders of the new administrator and Hyderabad commissioner.

• Muggers shoot Bin Qasim SHO, friend over resistance
KARACHI: While police claimed to have killed two alleged robbers in Korangi in an encounter, in which two policemen also suffered bullet wounds, muggers’ criminal streak in the city continued with assaults, taking lives of a young man and a policeman in the same area on Wednesday.  
The SHO of Bin Qasim police station was also shot at and wounded by armed muggers in Gulshan-i-Maymar.  
In the first incident, the police said that Qayyum Umer, 24, was gunned down by robbers when he put up resistance near Ghousia Masjid in Korangi-3.  
Korangi-SSP Sajid Amir Sadozai said armed motorcyclists were looting his cousin at some distance. Qayyum was standing outside his home and saw the robbers looting his cousin. As he yelled at the robbers, the robbers opened fire on him and fled. He died on the spot.
The body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre to fulfil medico-legal formalities.  
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the victim sustained a gunshot injury to chest and arm. His family members did not allow doctors to complete medico-legal formalities and took away the body, she added.  
The relatives told media that the victim was an orphaned child who sold vegetables in the area to earn his living. Hailing from Mansehra, he also played football at a local club in Korangi.  
Later, police intensified patrol and snap-checking in the area in search of the killers.  
DIG-East Muqaddas Haider told Dawn that two policemen of ‘Shaheen Force’ indicated two suspects to stop in Zaman Town. However, the suspects opened fire on them and an exchange of gunfire took place in which Head Constable Manzoor Ahmed, 38, was killed and the suspects managed to speed away.
However, after an interval of around 30 minutes, the Korangi Industrial Area police spotted two suspects and another encounter ensued in Mehran Town.  
After an exchange of gunfire, two alleged robbers were shot dead while two policemen, Khan Razik and Sajid, were wounded.
The DIG East said that one of the injured policemen had identified both the deceased as the same criminals who had killed the head constable during the earlier encounter.  
He said they were also probing the possibility as to whether the same suspects had gunned down Qayyum over resistance as these three incidents took place in the same vicinity of Korangi. 
The deceased suspects’ involvement in the three incidents would be verified with witnesses’ accounts and matching of spent bullet casings found from the crime scenes, the officials added.  
SHO, friend wounded by robbers 
The Bin Qasim SHO and his friend were shot at and wounded by robbers off Superhighway on Wednesday.  
The SITE-Superhighway Industrial Area (SSIA) police said that SHO Irdees Bangash and citizen Asif Ibrahim, 36, got injured in the firing at an estate agency in Ahsanabad.  
East-SSP Syed Abdul Rahim Shirazi said that the SHO had gone there for some personal work. He was sitting with his friends when armed muggers arrived and attempted to snatch cash and other valuables from them.  
The SHO overpowered one suspect, but his accomplice opened fire resulting in bullet injuries to the police officer and his friend.  
One suspect, later identified as Nadeem, was also wounded by the firing of the SHO and arrested by a police patrol that reached the scene after hearing gunshots.
The SHO was taken to the Aga Khan University Hospital. SSP Shirazi said he suffered a bullet wound near the abdomen.
Bangash had served as SHO of the SITE-Superhighway Industrial Area police station and was recently transferred to the Bin Qasim police station.

3,Consumer court in Karachi issues notices to telecom firms over service disruptions,Petitioner says companies are under obligation to provide smooth and uninterrupted cellular services to their consumers.,"KARACHI: A consumer court on Wednesday issued notices to the chief executive officers of four cellular service provider companies over disruptions in their services in areas around city courts and high court.
Judicial Magistrate Saifullah Phulpoto of the Consumer Protection Court (South) directed the counsel of Jazz, Ufone, Telenor and Zong to submit their respective replies before Dec 23, the next date of hearing.
The magistrate also clubbed together other individual complaints filed by the Karachi Bar Association and lawyers for a joint hearing on the next date.
Advocate Sardar Liaquat Ali Gabol, who filed the complaint under Section 20 of the Sindh Consumer Protection Act, 2014 cited the CEOs of Jazz, Ufone, Telenor and Zong as defendant.
He submitted that the defendant companies were under obligation to provide smooth and uninterrupted cellular services to their consumers.
However, he alleged that the cellular service of these four companies mostly remained disrupted in the areas of the Sindh High Court and the City Courts from 9am till 7pm, which is a violation of the Consumer Protection Act.
He argued that such disruption of services was badly affecting the staff, lawyers as well as their clients, which amount to disrupting the process of dispensation of justice. 
He claimed that these companies had not installed their signal towers both at the high court and district courts. 
He said that their officials had not visited these places for the purpose of inspection of signals strength despite lodging numerous complaints over the months.
He pleaded to the court to direct the defendants to improve their services at the high court and city courts by installing their mobile towers to ensure smooth and uninterrupted services to their consumers in these localities.

6,KU told to implement SHC order on lecturers’ appointment in three days,Bench warns varsity administration of action if order on contempt plea not complied with.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday directed Karachi University to convene a meeting of its syndicate within three days to implement an earlier court order about appointment of lecturers to the mass communication department.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Irfan Saadat Khan directed the KU to file a compliance report till Jan 5 and warned that in case of non-compliance, an appropriate action would be taken against the contemnors.
Rizwan Tahir and three others, through their counsel Asim Iqbal, filed an application seeking contempt proceedings against the KU vice chancellor and the registrar for defying an earlier order of the SHC.
The lawyer submitted that the petitioners had applied for the post of lecturers (BPS-18) and passed written tests and interviews as well as the NTS exam with flying colours and the selection board in its meeting held in May 2019 had recommended them for the posts.

Bench warns varsity administration of action if order on contempt plea not complied with

However, he argued that the appointment letters were not issued and the petitioners had approached the high court. In May, the SHC had declared that the impugned decision of the KU syndicate had no legal effect and directed it to take a fresh decision in respect of majority decision of selection board in 15 days.
The bench in its order noted that the SHC’s order was challenged by the KU administration before the Supreme Court and the apex court on Nov 10 had also directed the KU to give effect to the order of the SHC while an undertaking was also given before the top court that the syndicate would comply with the court orders.
On Wednesday, the lawyer for the KU filed a statement before the SHC along with deliberations made in the special meeting of the syndicate held on Dec 17 in the light of the order of the apex court to decide the issue in question.
However, the counsel for the petitioners argued that despite giving undertaking before the apex court as well as the order of SHC, the contemnors had yet to make compliance.
The bench noted that as per the record produced by the university, deliberations had taken place without making reference to the order of the SHC and instead the syndicate had given direction that selection board should be reconvened to consider the cases of petitioners afresh.
It further said that apparently, no stone was left unturned in denying relief to the petitioners, which clearly amounted to contempt of court.
“The respondent being educational institution, as a matter of grace, we are giving three days’ time for respondent/Karachi University to convene a fresh meeting of the syndicate to give effect to the order of this court dated 13.5.2022 in letter and spirit and uphold the decision of the selection board as directed through the order of this court dated 13.5.2022 and file compliance report in the first week of January,” the bench in its order concluded.
Earlier on Dec 17, the KU held a special meeting of its syndicate had decided that all candidates aspiring for the posts of lecturer and assistant professor reappear before the selection board.
However, four syndicate members — Dr Mohsin Ali, Prof Haris Shoaib, Ateeq Razzak and Dr M. Hassan Khan — submitted a note of dissent wherein they urged the university authorities to implement the SHC order.
It was also pointed out during Saturday’s syndicate meeting that the three-member committee set up in the last syndicate meeting included a member whose brother was among the candidates rejected in the 2019 selection board.
It’s important to mention here that the 2019 selection board of the department of mass communication ran into a controversy following the death of KU’s vice chancellor. The university declared it null and void which was later challenged by some candidates who appeared in the selection board.

KARACHI: While the world is moving ahead at breakneck speed with technological developments making the future of mankind look increasingly startling, the artist community is trying hard not to sever its relationship with tradition and history. Make no mistake, it’s a healthy omen. 
The latest example is of an exhibition of renowned artist Ghulam Mohammad’s (GM) artworks titled Continuance (which in Urdu has been translated as tasalsul) that concludes on Thursday (today) at the Canvas Art Gallery.
The name of the show reminds this writer of the famous opening lines of a poem by Mohsin Bhopali:
Na chhedo khilti kaliyon, hanste phoolun ko
In urti titliyon, aawara bhnavron ko
Tasalsul toot jaey ga
[Don’t touch these blossoms or disturb the smiling flowers
Let the fluttering butterflies and stray black bees be
Otherwise, it’ll break the continuation…]


Some of the artworks displayed at the exhibition. —Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

 
What is this continuation that the poet is talking of? Well, it is about the pristine quality of nature essential for man’s growth. GM is also trying to suggest the same but the route that he has taken to do so is different, and visually opulent. 
He says, “Carving out words and recomposing them is a cathartic act, in which I try to break language down into its most basic constituents and attempt a reconstruction of language and identity, trying to arrive at something more than just itself. The rediscovery of language by freeing it from the page where it is composed in a particular fashion and then recomposing it, changing its meaning, its character as language is an act of plasticizing language to see what it has the potential to lead to. I would call it no less than a journey in itself.”
Notice how the artist puts emphasis on the prefix ‘re’ in the statement — (re)compose, (re)construct. It means to go back or do something again. That in turn implies a relationship with the days gone by.
Now language, apart from being a mode of communication, is an integral component of our traditional values. GM knows it very well. What he does so beautifully is to turn this means of verbal and textual communication into a delightful form of visual interaction. 
To understand, nay feel, this concept time spent with his exhibits such as ‘Pesh Manzar’ and ‘Pas-i-Manzar’ (Iranian ink and paper collage on wasli) is essential. It’s thoughtful art.

Customs department’s deputy collector Saifullah Khan Niazi and preventive officer Rana Azeem Sarwar were exonerated from the charges of looting cash, gold ornaments and 25 falcons from the house of Basheer Ahmed in DHA’s Phase-IV in October 2020. 
The ATC-XV judge, who conducted the trial in the judicial complex inside the central prison, pronounced his verdict reserved after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides during two-year-long trial. 
The judge noted that the complainant had miserably failed to bring home the charge against both the officers. Hence, the judge acquitted them by extending the benefit of doubt in the case to them. 
The judge cancelled bail of both the officers, who were present in the courtroom, and discharged their sureties. 
According to the prosecution, Ahmed lodged a direct complaint alleging that the customs officials – Niazi, Sarwar, Malik Iftikhar alias Billa along with their four unknown subordinates – barged into his house on the night of Oct 14, 2020 and looted Rs500,000 cash, five mobile phones and 25 falcons at the gunpoint. 
It added that the complainant showed the officers a valid licence to do the expensive birds business, but they allegedly demanded Rs10 million extortion to allow him to carry out his business. 
In their statements, recorded under Sections 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the customs officers denied the allegations of intimidating the complainant and demanding extortion to allow him continue the rare birds’ trade. 
Defence counsel Abid Zaman produced the photographs of one Sanwal showing a notice duly issued to the complainant under the Section 163 (power to search and arrest without warrant) of the Customs Act, 1969. 
However, accused Malik Iftikhar had absconded during the trial. 
A case was registered under Sections 149 (unlawful assembly), 337-H(2) (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent act), 342 (wrongful confinement), 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion), 395 (dacoity), 457 (house trespass) and 506(2) (criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with section 6(2)(k) of The Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.

The officer stated this in a report submitted in compliance with the bench’s directive to verify employees lists and find out if there were any ghost employees in the departments of education, health and police. 
The division bench, comprising Justices Shamsuddin Abbasi and Amajad Ali Sahito, had issued the directives while hearing a petition filed by advocate Mumtaz Ali Jesar. 
The director general of the Sindh monitoring and evaluation cell was directed to appear in person and file a detailed report regarding procuring the attendance of teachers and the process of issuance of form-II to stop the salaries of the absentees. 
But he was called absent while the deputy director of the cell said he had received the direction in late hours; therefore, the DG did not turn up. At this juncture, the director of school education said the DG was in contact with them.
The bench observed: “We [bench] are noticing this act of the DG with dismay, as he is deliberately avoiding appearing before this court and warn him to remain careful in future.” 
The medical superintendent of Chandka Medical College Hospital said he had issued a letter to the Larkana DAO for blocking the IDs’ of the ghost employees. 
“We have also noted with dismay that the secretary education, Sindh IGP and health department secretary, who were asked to upload the lists of their employees with names, parentage and CNICs on their official website but still compliance had not been made by them,” the two judges bench observed. “Once again we are directing them to upload the list of the employees and furnish report within a month’s time,” it added.
The court found the replies of the show-cause notices issued to the project director (PD) and registrar of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Medical University (SMBBMU), for not appearing in hearing on Dec 14, satisfactory and vacated the notices, directing them to remain careful in future. 
The PD in his report said that the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and Sindh government were approached for a grant-in-aid of Rs1,820.124 million to complete their (varsity) projects, but they did not receive any response yet. 
The bench directed the HEC and Sindh government to provide required funds to the university for completion of their projects.

The commission’s member judicial-I retired Justice Arshad Noor Khan said at a press conference held at Darbar hall here the other day that it was regrettable that despite passage of five months to heavy rainfall, rainwater had still not receded from talukas of Sindhri, Jhuddo, Digri, Kot Ghulam Mohammad etc.
He said that similar flood situation might recur over succeeding years due to climate change. “We should therefore adopt a procedure to save population from big disaster in future and in this connection the district administration should perform its duties towards people with honesty and sincerity,” he said.
He said that even if they succeeded to persuade 50 per cent people they could save a large population from disaster. “We have discussed problems of masses particularly flood victims,” he said.
He urged the commission officers to go into the field to listen to grievances of masses and flood victims and resolve their problems by taking drastic measures within available resources.
Later, he held an open kachehry where social workers and villagers alleged that relief goods, ration, tents and food were distributed on the directives of political personalities and elected representatives while genuine victims, who were still living in makeshift huts along roads under open sky, were deprived of all government help.
They deplored that officers concerned of the district administration did not visit many flood hit areas to assess damage from the disaster and meet flood victim families. Most school buildings had suffered damage after flood and heavy rainfall, he said.
They claimed that blankets meant for flood victims were supplied to bungalows of feudal lords and were not distributed among flood victims.
They said that saline water was being drained with heavy pumping machines into West Jamrao canal, which was causing different diseases among masses.
They objected to a survey of damage to houses and crops carried out under supervision of army and revenue officials.
They accused deputy commissioner and other officers concerned of obeying orders of local ruling party MNAs and demanded authorities launch rehabilitation work and distribute wheat seed among victims without any discrimination.
They demanded the government immediately remove illegal encroachments from all waterways.

14,"Court drops terrorism charges against ‘protesting’ PTI MPA, workers",Rules political activities within bounds of law healthy for society...,"HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad circuit bench of the Sindh High Court has ordered that the case against a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf parliamentarian and party workers be transferred from anti-terrorism court to an ordinary court and ruled that “political activities carried out within the bounds of law are healthy and could/should not be discouraged”.
The division bench comprising Justices Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Mohammad Saleem Jessar said that in view of definition of terrorism settled by Supreme Court “we are of the view that accused MNA Lal Chand Malhi or PTI workers cannot be termed terrorists on the basis of allegations of lobbing stones at policemen, a charge which is yet to stand the test of the trial”.
The bench was reading out the verdict authored by Justice Kalhoro on Wednesday that it had reserved on Dec 14 on a revision application filed by Ishrat Lohar advocate on behalf of the applicants, who were booked in an FIR lodged by Umerkot police in the wake of Imran Khan’s call for long march.
The bench said that disobedience of section 144 CrPC was visit-able by section 188 PPC mainly, and/or any other relevant provisions of law but not by the provisions of Antiterrorism Act, at least.

Rules political activities within bounds of law healthy for society

“We, therefore, allow this application and (order) withdrawal of the case from anti-terrorism court Mirpurkhas and its transfer to [court of] sessions judge Umerkot for trial in accordance with law,” said the bench.
The court noted it was evident in the FIR and the recorded evidence that PTI workers had gathered outside press club to agitate for some cause and not to create any law and order situation. 
The court said that the accused did not coerce and intimidate or overawe government, public, a section of public or community or sect, nor their action was for the purposes of advancing a religious, sectarian or ethnic cause or intimidating and terrorizing the public, social sector, media persons etc in order to be bracketed as terrorists.
The order said that even the FIR did not allege that any act of the accused created any terror or their action was designed and motivated to create terror in society or advance any religious agenda or any other purpose which could be labelled as terrorism as defined above.
It said that merely mentioning allegations could not transform the applicants’ act into terrorism. “Non-use of weapons by police in retaliation to alleged stone-pelting itself is signature that police force did not feel even threatened, not to say even terrorized,” said the court.

15,Academics urge country to seek Chinese help in higher education,HYDERABAD: Speakers at a seminar have urged national universities to identify new areas of cooperation with China in...,"HYDERABAD: Speakers at a seminar have urged national universities to identify new areas of cooperation with China in higher education and research and underscored the need for collaborative efforts to build the China-Pakistan Econo-mic Corridor (CPEC) and promote the spirit of friendly cooperation betwe-en the two neighbouring countries. 
They were addressing a seminar on the “Strategic and Economic Dimensions of Pakistan and China Relations Amid Deepening Global Geopolitical Divide” at Sindh University on Wednesday. 
SU Thatta campus Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Rafique Ahmed Memon in his presidential address said that there were vast opportunities for cooperation in the field of higher education and research in China. 
He said that Chinese varsities could admit a large number of Pakistani students. Chinese educational institutions should register themselves with Pakistan accreditation bodies to resolve problems faced by Pakistani students on their return after obtaining higher degrees from various Chinese varsities. 
Pakistan Ambassador to China Moinul Haque said China’s production of Al-Khalid tanks and GF-17 Thunder fighter jets with Pakistan was actually a great proof of extraordinary defense cooperation between the two countries. 
He said that a cynical propaganda was being spread that the CPEC project would push Pakistan deeper into the debt mire, but it was not the case at all. 
Mr Haque said that it was important to open the CPEC project to public so that no propaganda could affect the friendship between the two countries. 
The two countries would soon start working on an important project to prepare submarines for Pakistan Navy and China would ensure access of Pakistani engineers to its manufacturing plant. 
He announced that the SU would be provided with opportunities to enter into educational agreements with top varsities of China so that it could advance in the field of higher education and research being an old varsity of Pakistan. 
Centre for International Strategic Studies Sindh (CSSS) Executive Director and former ambassador Kazi M. Khalilullah said: “Pakistan has a successful foreign policy, which we have to trust,” he said. Both countries had supported each other in testing times while in terms of defense, China had always helped Pakistan to stand on its own feet, he added. 
Former Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) chairman Dr Ansar Pervez said that Pakistan initially bought a nuclear power plant from Canada, but due to Canada’s coldness, the project could not go ahead and then China started the same project and it assisted Pakistan. 
He said that 325 megawatt nuclear power plant provided by China was successfully operationalized, adding that China’s cooperation was continuing to meet energy needs of Pakistan. 
Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed and others also made speeches online.
