• Interior ministry asks Rangers, FC to perform security duties in Punjab
LAHORE: In a tit-for-tat move, Governor Balighur Rehman on Wednesday termed the ruling of Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan disposing of his directives regarding the vote of confidence “unconstitutional”, whereas the coalition government hinted at the imposition of governor’s rule in Pakistan’s largest province.
The PML-N government initially hinted that governor’s rule could be imposed for two months through a resolution in a joint session of parliament, but the period could be extended to six months.
“Since the chief minister on Wednesday failed to take the trust vote in the Punjab Assembly in compliance with the governor’s order, legally he ceases to hold his office. And now any time... probably on Thursday (today), the governor can issue an order de-notifying the CM,” Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said earlier in the day.
This view was echoed by SAPM Attaullah Tarrar, who told reporters late on Wednesday night that the governor had discretionary powers to de-notify the CM and it was up to him whether he wanted to do it “tomorrow or the day after”.
Another option, Mr Sanaullah said, is governor’s rule by the Centre. “In the wake of the constitutional crisis, the government may get a resolution passed from the National Assembly and Senate to impose governor’s rule in Punjab for two months initially — the period can be extended to six months as well,” the minister added.
He was of the view that “all was not well” in the camp of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Punjab parliamentary party. “Had the PTI been confident that CM Elahi could secure the support of 186 MPAs in the PA he would have gone for the trust vote on Wednesday in compliance with the governor’s order,” he said, adding that the CM could have gone for PA’s dissolution after the vote in line with Imran Khan’s plan for the dissolution of assemblies. “But the PTI chose otherwise because it knew it did not have the required number,” Mr Sanaullah claimed.
Governor’s order on PA speaker ruling
In the late evening, Governor Rehman wrote a three-page order in response to PA Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling which had termed Mr Rehman’s order seeking vote of confidence from Mr Elahi ‘illegal’.
In his order, the governor said under Article 130(7) of the Constitution that PA speaker’s ruling had no bearing on his order and termed it unconstitutional. The governor said the speaker’s ruling was also in violation of Rule 209 of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.
“The speaker’s ruling, consequent acts and omissions constitute and result in enabling the chief minister to refrain from obtaining a vote of confidence in terms of Article 130(7). Helping and aiding the CM in refraining from fulfilling his duty and preventing the constitutional process from proceeding to its logical end leads to the consequences stipulated in Rule 22 (7) of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.”
Meanwhile, taking a screenshot of the governor’s reply, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry, in a tweet, asked Mr Rehman not to make a mockery of his office. “Dear Governor! Do not make a mockery of your office, the speaker’s ruling is final as far affairs of the Assembly are concerned and do not expose yourself to misconduct proceedings. Respect the Constitution,” he added.
Earlier in the day, the governor held a meeting with the PML-N and PPP leaders and legal experts to discuss the strategy of the federal government. Federal ministers Rana Sanaullah and Saad Rafique, premier’s special assistants Attaullah Tarar and Malik Ahmed Khan, and PPP Punjab parliamentary party leader Hasan Murtaza were present in the meeting.
Separately, the federal government on Wednesday decided to deploy Pakistan Rangers and Frontier Constabulary (FC) across Punjab, interior ministry sources said, adding that the federal agencies would ensure law and order in the province and work for implementation of laws and Constitution.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah directed the Punjab chief secretary and inspector general of police to maintain law and order, protection of the life and property of the people, and perform their duties as per law and Constitution, sources said.
The interior minister also warned officials not to become part of any process that was against the law and Constitution.

1,‘Unconstitutional’ removal of chief minister to be opposed: PTI,Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today.,"• Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today
• Fawad claims Zardari offered PTI women MPAs Rs50m each to abstain from voting
• As per agreement with PTI, PML-Q to get 30 PA, 15 NA seats 
LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has announced that it will challenge any “unconstitutional” move of de-notifying Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, and asked its leadership, parliamentarians and party workers to reach the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today) to ‘block’ the governor from taking any such action.
PTI Chairman Imran Khan will address the protesters through video link and announce the party’s next line of action in the face of the provincial opposition’s moves to save the Punjab Assembly.
Earlier on Wednesday, Governor Balighur Rehman had declared Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling regarding CM Elahi’s vote of confidence “unconstitutional” and “illegal”.
On Tuesday, the speaker had termed the governor’s orders — to the CM to obtain a vote of confidence from the provincial assembly by 4pm on Wednesday — as “illegal, against the provisions of the Constitution and thus stand disposed of”, and issued a ruling in this regard.
The PTI leadership on Wednesday maintained the speaker had ruled that the assembly was in session and until the session was prorogued, the governor could not summon a fresh session, citing a 1997 ruling by the Lahore High Court. They said the court had ruled that “not less than 10 clear days” must be granted to the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence.
PTI Central Punjab General Secretary Hammad Azhar gave a call to PTI leaders, lawmakers and party workers and supporters to reach outside the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today).
“The masses can no longer remain silent spectators while an unconstitutional game is being played,” he remarked.
Meanwhile, the federal government has sought deployment of Rangers to beef up security of the Governor House “till further orders under sections 7(b) and 10 of the Pakistan Rangers Ordinance, 1959 and Section 4(3)(i) of Anti-Terrorism Act 1997”.
“The Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) is requested to immediate necessary action with regard to beefing up the security at the Governor’s House, Lahore, in coordination with the office of the governor,” said the Interior Ministry.
PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry told the media outside party chief Imran Khan’s Zaman Park residence that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) parties were ‘scared of’ holding general elections, adding they would be violating the Constitution’s Article 109 by asking the chief minister to take a vote of confidence immediately. 
He said the governor should give 10 clear days for the vote or challenge the Punjab Assembly speaker’s ruling in court.
He further said the PTI had called its parliamentary party meeting on Thursday (today) and stressed its 177 as well as the PML-Q’s 10 MPAs were available to foil a no-confidence motion submitted by the PML-N and the PPP separately against the chief minister as well as the Punjab Assembly speaker and deputy speaker.
Mr Chaudhry also claimed that the party’s women MPAs had told Mr Khan that they were receiving offers from former president Asif Zardari to abstain from voting for Rs50 million each.
“The people of Sindh should know that Asif Zardari is spending their welfare money to buy loyalties of PTI MPAs,” he said.
Claiming that some other MPAs had also received threatening calls to abstain from voting, he demanded the superior courts take notice and identify those who were trying to terrify the party legislators.
“As soon as the vote of no-confidence fails, the Punjab Assembly will be dissolved and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly will follow suit,” he declared.
On the other hand, a three-member committee of the PTI held a meeting with CM Elahi and his party members and discussed seat adjustment prospects in detail.
As part of a formula, sources said, the PTI agreed to offer 30 Punjab Assembly and 15 National Assembly seats to the PML-Q. The party of the Chaudhrys had sought seats in the newly created Gujrat division – their hometown -- that included Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad and Hafizabad districts, some parts of south Punjab as well as Sialkot.
PTI leader Shafqat Mahmood later confirmed that both the allied parties had mutually agreed over giving 30 Punjab and 15 National Assembly seats to Mr Elahi’s party.
Meanwhile, the PML-Q held its parliamentary party meeting, chaired by CM Elahi and parliamentary leader Sajid Bhatti, and discussed the current political situation and decided their future course of action.
The chief minister has also called the provincial cabinet’s seventh meeting at his office on Thursday (today) at 1:30pm with 21 items on the agenda.
Soon afterwards, PML-Q MNA Hussain Elahi tweeted that all 10 PML-Q MPAs had announced complete support for PTI chief Imran Khan and Chief Minister Parvez Elahi in the meeting.
Responding to the PDM government’s claim that it had won the loyalties of six PML-Q MPAs, Mr Hussain asserted that the federal ruling coalition would not be able to fool anyone with its propaganda, and commented: “They (PDM) talk about six MPAs when they can’t even break one.”
A PML-Q spokesman said the parliamentary party had delegated complete authority of making all the decisions to CM Elahi and resolved to vote in favour of the CM, speaker and deputy speaker when a vote of no-confidence was taken up in the house.
Mr Elahi also asserted that the PML-Q would continue standing by Imran Khan and that his party was united and would remain so to bulldoze any propaganda or rumours being spread by the PDM government in the Centre.
Earlier in the day, as Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah had claimed he would seal the Chief Minister House if Mr Elahi didn’t take a vote of confidence, the CM’s son, Moonis, said he had “reached 8-Club CM House and waiting for you”. A few hours later, he tweeted: “Rana sb am bored now. Heading home but pls do let me know when you plan to come.”

2,"PTI set to approach SC, not speaker, for resignations’ acceptance","“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” says Senator Shibli Faraz.","ISLAMABAD: Contra­dicting the announcement it made only days ago that PTI members of National Assembly are ready to appear before Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf for verification of their resignations, the party on Wednesday changed its stance as senior party leader Senator Shibli Faraz declared that the lawmakers would not go to the Parliament House, and instead, the PTI would approach the Supreme Court to seek acceptance of the mass resignations.
“We had decided to go to the assembly for acceptance of our resignations. But this is not the way and MNAs, who are elected by the people, cannot be asked to keep standing in a queue for acceptance of their resignations … The government is doing all this [handling the resignation issue] with a mala fide intention,” said Mr Faraz, alleging that the speaker wanted to “humiliate” the PTI lawmakers by treating them as “charity seekers”.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Faraz said they would approach the Supreme Court and ask it to direct the speaker to accept the resignations submitted some eight months ago.
“We will go to the SC in a day or two,” he said.
The party is going to the apex court where this issue has already been discussed during the hearing of various petitions and even the judges had observed that PTI should reconsider its decision of quitting the assembly.
When asked if it was not a U-turn as PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi had written a letter to the speaker only six days back, asking him to allocate some time for the party’s MNAs to verify their resignations, Mr Faraz said they wanted to do so, but the government did not seem to be serious which was evident from the fact that it had convened a session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) on a one-day notice despite the fact that the speaker was not even present in the country.
“This is not a U-turn. Look at the spirit of the matter. Why is the government delaying acceptance of our resignations? Why has the speaker adopted a pick-and-choose policy by accepting the resignations of only 11 members?” he said, adding that submission of mass resignations was part of the party strategy to force the government to hold early elections in the country. Otherwise, he said, the party MNAs could have been asked to submit resignations in groups.
When his attention was drawn to the assembly rules under which the speaker is required to individually call the members for verification of resignations, Mr Faraz posed a valid counter-question, saying: “Under which law did the speaker accept the resignations of the 11 MNAs who had also not appeared before him for verification [of their resignations]?”
“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” the PTI senator alleged, questioning the logic behind the speaker’s decision to accept the resignations of 11 members out of 123 who had submitted the resignations en masse at the time of the election of Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister in April.
On Dec 15, while talking to reporters in Lahore, Mr Qureshi had expressed his party’s resolve to dissolve the assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and get the MNAs’ resignations accepted after appearing before the speaker.
“We have already made our decision. We will execute it,” he had stated, adding that party Chairman Imran Khan had given him the letter for sending it to the speaker.
He also waved the ‘letter’ bearing the subject “Resignations of MNAs of PTI” to the media and chided the speaker for being “selective” while accepting the resignations of 11 MNAs “illegally”.

3,"Onus on Centre to fight militancy, says KP",KP govt's spokesperson says the police’s job is to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ is beyond their mandate.,"PESHAWAR: As some semblance of normalcy returned to Bannu on Wednesday, a day after an operation against terrorists, the under-fire KP government refused to accept the blame for the resurgence of terrorism, saying it was the responsibility of the Centre to tackle the issue.
Chief Minister Mahmood Khan in a media talk declared that ‘fighting militancy’ was the mandate of the federal government.
Meanwhile, President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir, separately, paid tribute to the soldiers who took part in the operation at the CTD centre in Bannu on Tuesday.
The KP chief minister explained that it was the Centre’s job to fight militancy since the institutions fighting [against militants] fell within the jurisdiction of the federal government.
“Crime and law and order situation is the provincial government’s job but militancy falls within their [federal government’s] domain and hence this is their responsibility,” he maintained.
Besides, the chief minister claimed that the federal government was reluctant to release funds for both current and developmental expenditures. “Neither do we receive the current nor the developmental expenditures [funding],” he said and alleged that the funds were being diverted to the federal government’s members of parliament.
Endorsing the CM’s views, the KP government’s spokesperson told a press briefing that the police’s job was to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ was beyond its mandate.
He said the incident that took place inside the Bannu CTD centre fell within the definition of ‘national security’ which was the federal the government’s domain.
“This is not something about general law and order…it falls within the domain of the national security which is the responsibility of the federal government,” CM Adviser on Information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said.
In reply to a question about the recently held talks with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan, the special assistant said that war had never ended since 2001 and dialogue was an attempt to further improve the situation but a permanent solution [to militancy] could not be found.
“The reason for dialogue with them [TTP] was to improve the situation,” Mr Saif said, adding that war never ended, though its intensity fluctuated. “We wanted a permanent solution but it did not happen,” he said while explaining the reason for holding talks with the Taliban.
A KP minister, however, appeared to have a different stance, reported APP.
Kamran Bangash at a presser reiterated the provincial government’s resolve to eliminate terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations and said the government was taking pragmatic steps to improve the capacity of police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD).
Referring to the terrorist attack on the CTD compound, he said police and security forces had already shared information about the possible terrorist attacks.
Meanwhile, Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir met the officers and soldiers, who were injured during the Bannu operation, at the CMH Rawalpindi, according to an Inter-Services Public Relations release.
The COAS remained with them for some time and inquired about their well-being.
He appreciated their high spirit and morale and lauded their professionalism during the operation against the terrorists.
Pledge against terrorism
President Alvi lauded the security forces for carrying out a successful operation against terrorists in Bannu and expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country’s soil, APP reported.
The president, in a statement, termed the success a result of the professionalism of security forces and their unwavering commitment against terrorism.
In separate remarks, Prime Minister Sharif said the state would not surrender to any terrorist group or organisation and vowed that militants would be dealt with according to the Constitution and law.
Strongly condemning the activities of terrorists, he said such attempts would be crushed.
“We will not let the sacrifices of the martyrs go to waste,” he said and mentioned the military operations of Raddul Fasaad and Zarb-i-Azb as significant measures to eradicate terrorism.
The prime minister said that though main responsibility for law and order lies with the provinces, the federation could not turn a blind eye to such problems.
He assured the provinces that the federal government would work along with them in fighting terrorism and vowed to fully implement the National Action Plan to eliminate terrorism.
PM Shehbaz said the federal government would assist the provinces in improving the professional capacity of the anti-terrorism force and departments.

4,SC overturns verdicts in favour of khula,"Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes.","ISLAMABAD: In a family suit, the Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the Peshawar High Court (PHC) and appellate court decisions for dissolution of a marriage by way of khula and restored the decree of a family court to dissolve the marriage on the basis of cruelty inflicted by a man on his wife.
While the family court after recording of evidence and hearing both sides had dissolved the marriage due to cruelty on a suit moved by Tayyeba Ambareen against her husband Shafqat Ali Kiyani demanding dower amount, dowry articles, medical expenses and maintenance for herself and their daughter, the appellate court on Nov 10, 2015 overturned the decree and converted it into khula with the direction to the woman to refund five-tola gold to her husband. The high court also upheld the appellate court decision.
Headed by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, a three-judge Supreme Court bench then took up an appeal against the PHC verdict.
In its decision, the apex court observed that husband’s claim of conjugal rights — despite his ‘ruthless, tyrannical and oppressive’ conduct or behaviour — seemed to be motivated by the sole intention to avoid paying maintenance allowance and the dower amount and he ultimately succeeded in his effort when the appellate court dissolved the marriage by way of khula with the direction to the wife to refund the dower amount.

Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes

Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, a member of the SC bench, in a judgment he wrote, observed the main disagreement or source of discord between the parties was whether petitioner Tayyeba Ambareen was entitled to claim a decree for dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty and whether the appellate forum rightly converted the dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty to dissolution by way of khula.
The SC noted that the family court unequivocally articulated that the petitioner discharged the burden of proving cruelty on part of the husband by quoting many incidents while her evidence was not shattered during her cross-examination and thus the family court rightly dissolved the marriage on account of cruelty after a thorough examination and consideration of evidence.
Justice Mazhar observed that the appellate court could modify or set aside the judgment of the family court if it was found contrary to the evidence since the purpose of appellate jurisdiction was to reappraise whether the lower court committed any error. Likewise, he noted, the high court affirmed the findings of the appellate court without realizing that the allegations of maltreatment and cruelty had been satisfactorily proved by the petitioner during the trial.
The matrimonial bond between a man and woman is a pious relationship that plays an important part and also nurtures between the husband and wife happiness and compassion, the lineage and family heredity also depends on it, Justice Mazhar observed, adding the connubial affairs are based on gentle, human and emotional affiliation which requires mutual trust, regard, respect, love and affection and the relationship should also be in accordance with social norms.
As Islam ordains husbands to provide food, clothing, accommodation and all other necessities of life to the best of his capability and capacity, a man is expected to treat his wife nicely, with love and affection, Justice Mazhar observed. A conduct or behaviour that inflicts upon the wife mental pain and anguish makes it impossible for her to continue matrimonial relationship, the verdict explained.
Justice Mazhar recalled how the family court decision depicted different acts which caused mental anguish and torture to the wife, as only a week after their marriage, the husband started pressurising his wife to arrange money to get a house on rent. The husband and his family members also levelled false accusations at her, alleging that his daughter was not their child, with the result that the petitioner suffered severe mental agony, the court noted.
While she was in the family way, the man left her instead of supporting his wife, the court observed. He did not turn up at the crucial time; neither did he pay any maintenance allowance nor delivery expenses, it was recalled.
Also, the husband and his family members imposed a harsh condition on her that she should deposit her salary into a joint account with her husband and seek his permission for personal use.
Despite filing the family suit, the husband’s behaviour did not change rather he caused more mental anguish and started levelling false accusations, imposing condition that the amount for the house purchased by the wife be reimbursed by her father to the husband.
But the apex court noted that the appellate court, instead of considering the evidence reached a conclusion without any reason that no solid piece of evidence was brought to show physical torture or mental agony and held the allegation was exaggerated, adding that the “acts of cruelty were common” in nature and were “found in every family”.
On the basis of the observations, the Supreme Court set aside the judgments of the high court and the appellate court and restored the decree passed by the family court.

5,SBP slashes GDP growth forecast to below 3-4pc,"Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation.","KARACHI: The central bank has lowered its projected GDP growth from the previously announced range of 3-4 per cent for the current fiscal year, citing flood-induced destruction and the stabilisation policy as major factors in its flagship economic health report released on Wednesday.
However, in its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy, which mostly discussed the previous financial year that ended on June 30, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said economic growth was stronger than expected in the 2021-22 fiscal year as real GDP increased by 6pc compared to 5.7pc a year ago.
The primary drivers of this growth were a broad-based expansion in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) and improved agricultural output, the report said.
“A combination of adverse global and domestic developments led to the re-emergence of macroeconomic imbalances during FY22,” it said.

Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation

The SBP said that the economy was already in a stabilisation phase when widespread flooding hit a large part of the country at the start of the current fiscal year.
It said the flooding was likely to impinge on the country’s real economic activity through various channels, fearing that losses in agriculture emerging from the damages to crops and livestock were likely to transmit to the rest of the economy through various backward and forward linkages.
 
 

The large-scale destruction of infrastructure in the affected provinces might also undermine the country’s growth prospects during the year, the bank said.
The SBP avoided providing any range for the growth rate of the current financial year apparently due to the worsening economic situation. Industries have either shut down or drastically cut their production due to high inflation and the unavailability of gas and electricity.
One major reason is the cork put by the SBP on the opening of letters of credit (LCs) for imports in an attempt to save dollars.
The All-Pakistan Textile Mills Association has threatened to announce lay-offs within days if the gas supply is not restored and LCs are not opened.
The textile industry claims that up to 500,000 people, who were associated with the sector directly or indirectly, have lost their jobs. No official data is available in this regard.
International credit rating agencies have slashed the credit rating of Pakistan and predicted an economic growth rate of around 2pc for the current fiscal year.
The SBP report said that several corrective and other measures were likely to slow the momentum of economic activity during FY23, including a hike of 675 basis points in the policy rate, demand management measures announced in the previous fiscal year, and the government’s decision to unwind the fiscal package for fuel and electricity subsidies towards the end of FY22.
The report noted that the expansionary fiscal stance in FY22, an upsurge in global commodity prices, and the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict led to a marked deterioration in the current account deficit.
 
 

In addition, the delay in the resumption of the IMF loan programme and political instability exacerbated the country’s vulnerability through the depletion of foreign exchange reserves.
The resulting rupee depreciation “amplified inflationary pressures by magnifying the effect of global price increase”, the SBP report said.
It said the experience from FY22 brought to the fore once again the need to address the country’s structural weaknesses, such as a narrow base of foreign exchange earnings and meagre inflows of foreign investment.
“A concerted approach is required to encourage increased localisation of the manufacturing base, along with the lowering of energy intensity of the economy by ensuring energy efficiency and conservation,” the report said.
Moreover, amid the growing issues related to climate change and inadequate food security situation, there is an urgent need to formulate a well-thought-out strategy to meet these challenges, it said.
It stressed that priority should be given to producing new varieties of seeds that are suitable to varying weather conditions and to devise a framework that emphasises water management strategies to increase agricultural productivity.
“The losses to agriculture produce induced by the recent floods is likely to step up the import of agriculture commodities, particularly cotton,” the report said.
It said the government has targeted to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.9pc of GDP in FY23 from 7.9pc in FY22. “This outcome would be achieved through both revenue and expenditure measures,” it said.
In fact, the fiscal deficit exceeded in the first quarter of FY23, annoying the IMF, which demanded more measures to reduce the gap.

6,PM promises Rs5bn to reconstruct flood-hit homes,Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors.,"SUKKUR/ISLAMABAD: As he assured Sindh that the federal government would not leave flood survivors in a lurch, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the Centre would spend at least Rs5 billion to construct houses for flood victims in the province.
After his visit to rain-hit areas in Khairpur on Wednesday, the prime minister said that Rs4.80 billion had been donated to the prime minister’s account for flood survivors and added that more funds were expected to be donated.
According to PM Sharif, the rehabilitation process was already underway across the country, but there were still several areas in Khairpur and Dadu which were underwater. 
He added that the government would move towards reconstruction and rehabilitation works, but at present, at least eight million families were rain-affected. 
He elaborated that at least 20m people, including nine million children, were waiting for the government to help them.

Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors

Drainage plan
He said that the government would build houses for the affected people and added that the chief minister would provide plots for the construction and the same process would be followed in other provinces as well.
“A donors conference is going to be held in Geneva next month,” said PM Sharif and added that he would go to the moot fully prepared to present Pakistan’s case for aid in light of massive destruction due to floods. The PM also announced the establishment of a campus of COMSATS University in Khairpur.
Speaking at the residence of PPP leader Manzoor Wassan in Khairpur, Shehbaz Sharif said that his government would “positively consider” the master plan for drainage on the left bank of the River Indus proposed by a foreign consultant, Louis Berger.
Mr Sharif said that the scale of the disaster was massive so Pakistan would require plenty of resources to tackle this challenge.
During the visit, the premier was also briefed by Chief Engineer Development Region-I Mansoor Memon in Pir Gaddo, Kot Diji about inundated areas in the province.
The chief engineer said that out of 3.3m acres of area, 2m acres were inundated on the right bank and 1.3m acres on the left bank of the Indus till Aug 31.
In Khairpur, 141,000 acres of land was submerged till Aug 31 but now only 7,800 acres of land needed to be dewatered, Mr Memon informed. He maintained that field drains on an area of 200 square kms were created to drain rainwater.
According to the chief engineer, Khairpur was a victim of a “poor drainage network” and the only drainage system that existed in the area pertained to salinity control and water-logging issue. He informed when the Sukkur barrage was built, the flow of natural watercourses in the area was obstructed. 
“Even this area where we are standing is an old waterway,” Mr Memon said while showing the site on a satellite image.
He said that floodwater from the mountainous range stretching over 75,000 sq kms in Balochistan reached Qambar Shahdadkot and Dadu districts in recent floods and 600,000 acres and 400,000 acres of the area was inundated respectively in Qambar and Dadu districts. This meant that out of 2m acres, 50pc of the area was affected in these two districts, he added.
Speaking about the Berger plan regarding drainage, the engineer urged that the scheme was of paramount importance for left bank areas. CM Murad agreed. The Sindh CM said the provincial government wanted to use funds deposited with the apex court in the Bahria Town case for the execution of this scheme.
‘4RF plan’
Separately, the government launched a comprehensive plan prepared by the planning and development division for the rehabilitation of flood victims. 
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Prime Minister Shehbaz launched the ‘Resilient, Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework’ (4RF) which envisaged short, medium, and long-term strategies to rehabilitate the survivors.
A copy of the 4RF report was presented to the prime minister by Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Planning Development and Special Initiatives (MoPD&SI) during a meeting. 
Mr Iqbal apprised the prime minister that the document was based on the loss and damage estimated in the post-disaster needs assessment report, which was launched in October this year.
PM Sharif directed that necessary efforts must be made for the effective pitching of this framework in the upcoming donors’ conference, scheduled to be held on January 9, 2023, in Geneva, Switzerland.
He directed that the planning ministry in coordination with the foreign ministry, climate change ministry, and economic affairs division may take necessary steps for the effective dissemination of the document to all the stakeholders at home and abroad.
