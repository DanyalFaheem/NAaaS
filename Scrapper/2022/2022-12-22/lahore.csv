This civilisation is far ahead of all explored civilisations of the world.  
These views have been expressed by German research scholar Ms. Karola Schmidt, who is doing her doctorate-level research on Corpus English in collaboration with the University of Sahiwal.
It is learnt Ms. Schmidt collected research data on Corpus English during her stay. Talking to Dawn, Ms. Schmidt says she is specifically interested in the status of spoken English in Pakistan and “I am here to collect the primary data for my doctorate research.”  
Ms. Schmidt says she is engaged in an academic pursuit to examine the manner in which the English language is utilised in society within Pakistan.
“For the last two weeks as part of my dissertation work, I obtained primary data from university students, faculty members and public officials,” she says.  
Ms. Schmidt has conducted a couple of seminars and workshops at the universities of Okara and Sahiwal. She has made an appearance at 1st PAK TOSEL conference hosted by the University of Okara.

5,Irregularities in Daska by-poll: LHC sets aside ECP action against election officials,"Court says after poll, duty staff no longer remains within ECP purview.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has set aside the proceedings against more than a dozen officials of the provincial departments initiated by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for their role in the alleged rigging committed in the 2021 by-poll of NA-75, Daska.  
“Despite repeated queries, learned counsel for the commission has not been able to convince this court that as to what is cavil with the commission to refer the matters of the petitioners for disciplinary action against them by their parent departments, especially, when they do not fall within the definition of election officials,” Justice Shujaat Ali Khan observed in his verdict allowing the writ petitions filed by Asif Hussain and 20 other officials.  
The petitioners challenged the show-cause notices and the subsequent proceedings against them by the ECP.
Senior lawyer Hafiz Tariq Naseem mainly represented the petitioners while other counsels adopted his arguments with little additions.

Court says after poll, duty staff no longer remains within ECP purview

The main argument presented by the petitioner’s counsel was against the competence of the ECP to issue the show-cause notices.  
Justice Khan observes that a person, who has been assigned any election duty, does not remain under the control and superintendence of the ECP upon declaration of fate of an election in a constituency simply for the reason that once fate of an election is declared the hiring staff lose their status as election official and the ECP does not enjoy jurisdiction to proceed against them.
He states that according to section 55(1) of the Election Act, 2017, a person can be deemed to be under the control, superintendence and discipline of the ECP for the period commencing from his date of appointment or deputation till publication of name of the returned candidate in the official gazette.  
“A cursory glance over section 55 of the Act, 2017 shows that the ECP has been empowered to proceed against an election official under the applicable disciplinary law,” he adds.  
The judge says it is very ironical on the one hand the counsel for the ECP took a specific plea that matters pertaining to pre- and post-election issues, including initiation of departmental proceedings against any delinquent official, are to be seen in the light of the referred provisions of the Constitution but has not been able to give any justification as to why impugned show-cause notices have been issued while relying on section 55 of the Act, 2017.  
Commenting on the case of one of the petitioners, the judge notes that the departmental proceedings against a government servant stand abated in the event of his retirement but initiation of the proceedings against the petitioner by the ECP, despite his retirement, speaks volumes about the fact that it proceeded to initiate proceedings against the petitioner without affirming as to whether he is in service or not.
Justice Khan maintains that upon declaration of fate of the election in the constituency, the petitioners no more remained the election officials, hence, the ECP has no jurisdiction to initiate proceedings against them.
“Resultantly, all these writ petitions are accepted and impugned disciplinary proceedings initiated by the Commission against the petitioners are declared coram-non-judice, thus, set aside,” the verdict reads.  
However, the judge, before parting with the judgment, observes that if the ECP thinks that the petitioners were involved in any subversive activities during their deployment in election duty, it would be at liberty to refer their matter to their parent departments for initiation of proceedings under the relevant law.

6,LHC’s power to review SC judgement on JIT questioned,The LHC bench will resume the case hearing today.,"LAHORE: Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, who represents the daughter of a woman killed in the Model Town firing, argued on Wednesday before a Lahore High Court larger bench that it did not have jurisdiction to review a judgment of the Supreme Court to constitute a joint investigation team (JIT) to reinvestigate the 2014 incident.
He contended that the merits of the case were discussed before the apex court.
He argued that the reinvestigation can indeed occur because the law makes no prohibition whatsoever on the extent or number of JITs that can be constituted, and therefore, a new independent investigation could be initiated to ensure that justice is served.
The bench is headed by Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti with Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, Justice Aalia Neelum, Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi, Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf and Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh.
Barrister Zafar pleaded before the bench that it had been impossible for the victims to expect justice when the investigating agencies were all headed by those who were directly linked to the perpetrators of the heinous act.
He alleged that as the ruling party at the time (i.e., PML-N) was directly involved in the Model Town massacre, its failure to hold anyone to account for this heinous crime must not be ignored.
The bench would resume further hearing on Thursday (today).
Khurram Rafiq and several other police officials facing trial in the private complaint by the PAT challenged the new JIT formed by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led provincial government. 
A three-judge bench had on March 22, 2019, suspended the new JIT.

7,Abdullah Sumbal posted as regular chief secretary,LAHORE: The federal government on Wednesday posted Abdullah Khan Sumbal as the Punjab chief secretary after a delay...,"LAHORE: The federal government on Wednesday posted Abdullah Khan Sumbal as the Punjab chief secretary after a delay of over three months when sitting CS Kamran Ali Afzal went on leave.  
Since then, the Punjab government has given look-after charge of the top administrative office to Mr Sumbal which was extended thrice. The PTI-PMLQ’s coalition government in Punjab views the development as a “serious move” at this critical juncture. However, it believes that the new chief secretary now commanding all administrative powers would not denotify chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi if the governor asks him to do so since Mr Elahi did not take vote of confidence on the advice of the Punjab governor.
However, sources in the bureaucracy say the chief secretary is bound to do what the law says, regardless how stakeholders interpret the constitutional provisions.
Earlier, the federal government notified the transfer of Kamran Ali Afzal, who is currently on 130-day ex-Pakistan leave, and transferred Abdulah Khan Sumbal from the Chairmanship of Punjab Planning and Development Board and posted him as regular chief secretary.Mr Afzal had earlier this month requested the Establishment Division to grant him 130-day ex-Pakistan leave as he wanted to travel to Australia. Eventually, the federal government accepted his request and assigned Mr Sumbal current charge of the office for three months with effect from Dec 7.
Mr Sumbal’s name was on the three-member panel sent by the PTI-PMLQ government to the federal government for the posting a regular chief secretary.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government transferred finance secretary Dr Wasif Khurshid and posted him as P&D Board chairman in his own pay and scale against a vacant post – after the posting of Mr Sumbal as chief secretary.
Punjab communications and works secretary Mujahid Sherdil has been transferred and posted as finance secretary. The additional charge of the C&W department has been assigned to Punjab housing urban development and public health engineering secretary Ahmed Mustajab Karamat in addition to his own duties till further order.

8,Officials booked in passports fraud case; two detained,"GUJRAT: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has booked some officials of the regional passport office, including...","GUJRAT: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has booked some officials of the regional passport office, including its former assistant director (AD), on charges of issuing passports to a man and his three children fraudulently on the basis of fake documents.  
FIA Gujrat Deputy Director Ghulam Sarwar Warraich confirmed the registration of a case and said at least two of the suspects had been detained and an investigation was under way.  
The passport office’s former AD Saeed Abbas, data entry operator Zaheer Sial, clerk Shakoor Haider, a citizen Abid Hussain of Nankana Sahib and some other officials were among those booked under different sections of the PPC.  
The officials allegedly issued passports to Abid Hussain and his three children on the basis of fake documents. Using those passports, Hussain had flown abroad along with his children to avoid their possible handing over to their mother while a case was being heard in court.  
The Lahore High Court had ordered the FIA to investigate the matter and take legal action on the application of the children’s mother.  
Mr Warraich said the scope of investigation had been broadened to probe more officials.  
Hussain had first got registration documents of his children issued through the National Database and Registration Authority by showing someone else as his wife on an address in Gujrat, and later managed to get their passports processed with the alleged abetment of passport officials.  
A few weeks ago, the Interior Ministry had removed the entire staff of the passport office on charges of corruption and malpractices, and posted their replacements.  
The incumbent assistant director at the passport office, Hayat Tarrar, said his office had nothing to do with the case as the matter was already being investigated by the FIA.  
The next date of hearing of the case is Thursday (today) where the FIA officials would present the details of the investigation and action taken so far.

10,Amir Zulfiqar appointed Punjab IGP,"LAHORE: Ending the uncertainty with regard to the appointment of new head of Punjab police, the federal government...","LAHORE: Ending the uncertainty with regard to the appointment of new head of Punjab police, the federal government late on Wednesday posted Muhammad Amir Zulfiqar Khan as provincial police chief.
The federal government has issued the notification for appointment of Mr Zulfiqar as Punjab inspector general of police, who was deputy director general of the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF). He has previously held the posts of National Highways & Motorway Police IG, Islamabad police IG and Additional IG Operations, CPO Punjab, Lahore.  
Mr Zulfiqar, as an assistant superintendent of police (ASP), won both top police honours -- the Quaid-e-Azam Police Medal and the Pakistan Police Medal. He belongs to Lahore and joined the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) in 1991 and belonged to 19th Common.
He also served as Toba Tek Singh SSP, Special Branch Punjab SSP and Special Branch Lahore Region SSP, besides serving as Lahore DIG operations, Multan regional police officer (RPO), CTD Punjab DIG. He has served in Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and federal government.Earlier, a summary of seven police officers was forwarded to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for considering one of the officers for the Punjab IGP slot.
The BS-22 police officers who made a ‘late entry’ in the race for the Punjab’s top police slot are AD Khwaja, Rao Musthaq Ahmed Mehr, Rao Sardar Ali Khan and Ali Aamir Malik.The Punjab government had recommended the names of Fayyaz Ahmad Dev, Amir Zulfiqar and Ghulam Mahmood Dogar, all BS-21 officers for the Punjab IGP post.  
An  official privy to the process says the posting of regular IGP in Punjab was delayed because of the persisting political crisis in the  province. 
He  says that earlier the PML-N had almost agreed on the name of former Lahore capital  city police officer (CCPO) Fayyaz Ahmad Dev for the Punjab IGP slot as  PML-Q leader Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, who recently joined hands with  the Shehbaz-led federal government, favoured the officer. Punjab Chief  Minister Parvez Elahi had also not objected to Dev’s posting, he adds.       
The official says that when the appointment of Mr Dev was  about to be made, suddenly the political situation in the province  became volatile in the aftermath of the PTI’s announcement to dissolve  the Punjab Assembly.
Meanwhile, he says, some of the BS-22 police  officers also geared up their efforts, using their political  connections, to be considered for the Punjab police’s top slot.  
Consequently, the PML-N government halted the process and added the  names of four senior police officers to the summary to the premier.
The  official source says the issue of appointment of regular IGP in Punjab  has been in the limelight since the PTI came into power in the Centre  and frequently changed provincial police chiefs during its more  than three-year long tenure.  
The crisis further  deepened when another provincial police chief, Faisal Shahkar, refused  to serve in Punjab in the wake of the political tussle between the PML-N  and the PTI-PMLQ governments in the Centre and Punjab, respectively. Mr  Shahkar had sent a written request  to the Establishment  Division to transfer him to the federal government, saying he was unable  to perform his duties in Punjab due to “personal reasons”. 
However, the  federal government asked him to retain his posting till the appointment  of new provincial police chief.
On Tuesday last, Mr Shahkar relinquished his charge as Punjab IGP, as he has to leave Pakistan for the United Nation where he has been selected for the top police slot.
The Punjab government had on Wednesday appointed BS-21 police officer Ghulam Rasool  Zahid, an officer of 19th Common, as acting police chief of the province.

The event, jointly organised by the Punjab University (PU) and GCU, received an enthusiastic and overwhelming response from the students of both varsities. Hundreds of graduates and final-year students flocked to the expo to explore employment and internship opportunities in reputed international and national companies.
Besides software houses and clothing brands, a large number of banks and student start-ups also set up their stall and interviewed the students for different jobs. Special recruitment information stalls set up by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and the Pakistan Navy remained the centre of attraction for the youth.
GCU Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi said career expos are usually underrated and misunderstood in Pakistani universities, adding that such events have a wider scope than only offering jobs and internship opportunities. “I urge even my first-year students to spend time with their future employers as they can help you network with people in the industry and you become more aware of the skills your industry values in an employee,” he said.
He said multiple job fairs are held in top universities of the world where students are encouraged to meet their future employers.
Information Technology University VC Dr Sarfraz Khurshid advised the students to never fear rejection, especially in job interviews, saying that many students don’t even try or appear for interviews just because of this fear.
Later, Prof Zaidi visited stalls of different companies and discussed with the executives their recruitment policies and criteria. He told the company executives that GCU not only focused on theoretical teaching, but also laid particular stress on the confidence and character building of its students so that they could perform exceptionally well in their professional lives.
Symposium: The Fatima Jinnah Medical University (FJMU) concluded its annual international scientific symposium on Wednesday. Prof Yasmin Rashid, Punjab health minister, said the occasion allowed teachers and graduate and undergraduate students learn more about current scientific research, which will ultimately help patients.
According to her, the FJMU and the associated Sir Ganga Ram Hospital effectively ran a number of health programmes.
For the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of genetic and hereditary blood illnesses, she claimed that the Punjab Thalassemia and Other Genetic Disorder Prevention and Research Institute, which was created here, offered the best resources.
The Fatima Jinnah Institute of Mother and Child Health, she insisted, was running smoothly.
The facility treats mothers and children, she said, adding that it would undoubtedly help reduce the province’s maternal and child mortality rate.
Health Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi, Federal Secretary Dr Ijaz Munir, FJMU Alumni Association of North America president Dr Fizza Zahid Rafique, King Edward Medical College Alumni Association of North America Dr Muhammad Fateh Shahzad, Allama Iqbal Medical College Alumni Association of North America president Dr Nusrum Iqbal, vice chancellor of the King Edward Medical University Prof Mehmood Ayaz, Allama Iqbal Medical College principal Prof Nadeem Hafeez Butt and Post-Graduate Medical Institute principal Prof Sardar Farid Al-Zafar were present.

— Dawn

 
RAHIM YAR KHAN: ‘Illegal’ fishing in different sections of the Indus in Rahim Yar Khan district continues due to non-issuance of tenders by the Punjab Fisheries Department (PFD).
According to sources in the PFD, the limits of the district starts from Panjnad and ends at Machka near Guddo, a long strip of almost 178 kms. The tenders for fishing in four sections of the Indus, including Samakka in Liaqatpur tehsil, Chachran Sharaif in Khanpur, Bangla Dilkusha in Rahim Yar Khan and Machka in Sadiqabad tehsil, are issued after a bidding process
The fisheries department issues tenders for permission of fishing to contractors in August every year but the PFD banned fishing this year to save the rare species of fish in the Indus. But many people started fishing in these sections of the river despite ban.  
Sources say the department [in Rahim Yar Khan] earns almost Rs20 million revenue from contractors by issuing tenders but current year tenders have not been issued as a result locals continued with ‘illegal’ fishing.  
After some complaints from the locals, the department has lifted the ban from fishing. Fisheries Assistant Director Ameer Nawaz Khan told Dawn that the secretary had banned fishing in August 2022 for 10 years but later due to some ‘unknown reasons’ he removed the restriction.  
He said during the ban, he along with his vigilance team raided different locations in the Indus and confiscated two hunting boats, four nets and six trappers. 
He said when his team tried to arrest illegal hunters, they escaped to the other side of the Indus but “my team always continues patrolling.”
