The Pakistan Cricket Board also named Khyber Pakhtunkhwa batter Kamran Ghulam as the replacement of veteran Azhar Ali, who retired from international cricket following the recently concluded series against England.
Hasan is touted to play the first Test in Karachi — which starts on Monday — after last playing a red-ball match for Pakistan against Sri Lanka in July. Following the away series against the Sri Lankans, the right-armer had lost his place due to injuries and lack of form.
Despite having taken 14 wickets in six Quaid-i-Azam Trophy matches this season, Hasan wasn’t picked for the Test series against England, which Pakistan lost 3-0 — their first-ever Test whitewash at home.
The national selectors, instead, preferred uncapped pacer Mohammad Ali over Hasan, despite their fast bowling resources already depleted due to the absence of spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi, who is nursing a knee injury.
Ali was picked on the basis of a decent show in the Quaid Trophy — 24 wickets in as many outings as Hasan — but the right-armer struggled to cause trouble against the England batters on placid tracks.
Pakistan also gave Test caps to T20 mainstays Haris Rauf and Mohammad Wasim with Naseem Shah as the leader of the national side’s pace attack. Naseem and Haris picked up injuries following the first Test in Rawalpindi while Wasim took one wicket in his only Test in Karachi.
While Naseem returns for the New Zealand games after recovering from a shoulder niggle, Haris stays on the sidelines. Pace all-rounder Faheem Ashraf, who had forgettable outings against England has been “advised to participate in the ongoing Pakistan Cup” along with Ali according to the PCB.
For middle-order batter Kamran, this is the second time to be called up in a Pakistan Test squad. The right-hander’s maiden call-up was when he was picked for the home series against South Africa in 2021. He, however, did not play in any of the three matches.
Kamran accumulated an impressive 597 runs in eight Quaid Trophy matches this season and boasts a brilliant average of 47.36 in first-class cricket. The 27-year-old brings the experience of 44 first-class games into the Pakistan Test squad.
After the first Test, Pakistan and New Zealand will take on each other in the second and final game in Multan from Jan 3-7. The Tests will be followed by a three One-day Internationals — to be played in Karachi on Jan 10, 12 and 14.
Squad: Babar Azam (captain), Abdullah Shafique, Abrar Ahmed, Hasan Ali, Imam-ul-Haq, Kamran Ghulam, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Naseem Shah, Noman Ali, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Salman Ali Agha, Saud Shakeel, Shan Masood, Zahid Mehmood.

1,"Bangladesh look to bounce back, India aim at clean sweep","With Rohit Sharma ruled out of the second Test with an injured thumb, KL Rahul will lead the team.","DHAKA: As Bangladesh look to bounce back after a 188-run defeat in the first Test at Chittagong, India will keep in view crucial world Test Championship points during the second Test starting here at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Thursday.
Apart from inflicting a 2-0 whitewash, India will look to consolidate their second place on the World Test Championship points table when they take on Bangladesh.
With Rohit Sharma ruled out of the second Test with an injured thumb, KL Rahul will lead the team and the possibility of the management tinkering with the winning combination is very less.
However, the entire focus will be on senior batter Virat Kohli, who managed to score only 20 runs in India’s 188-run win in 1st Test.
INDIA UPBEAT OVER RAHUL
Meanwhile, Rahul suffered a blow to his hand during practice but the touring side are optimistic the opener will play the second Test.
“It doesn’t [look serious],” India batting coach Vikram Rathour told reporters on Wednesday. “He [Rahul] seems to be fine. Hopefully he’ll be okay. The doctors are looking at it, but hopefully he’ll be okay.”
Should Rahul miss the second Test, vice-captain Cheteshwar Pujara is likely to lead the side.
Rahul’s injury could mean a Test debut for opener Abhimanyu Easwaran who was added to the squad following Rohit’s injury.
India’s pace duo of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami and all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja are among the several frontline players missing the series with injuries.

2,PM forms Sethi-led interim body to run PCB affairs; elections within four months,"The new committee will manage PCB affairs with full executive powers, says one of the board members.","ISLAMABAD: In a major top-level change in Pakistan cricket administration, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday nominated a 14-member management committee headed by Najam Sethi to run the affairs of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) till the elections to be held within the next four months.
“The Prime Minister has seen and is pleased to approve the proposal at  para 7, of the summary with the stipulation that names of the Management  Committee, to be placed before the Federal Cabinet,” said the notification issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. 

 





 
The Sethi-headed committee includes Shakil Sheikh (ex-PCB  BoG), Gul Zada (ex-PCB BoG) Nauman Butt (ex-PCB BoG), ex-Test  cricketers  Haroon Rashid, Shahid Khan Afridi and  Shafqat Rana, Sana Mir (ex-Pakistan women team’s captain), Aized Syed  (ex-PCB director NHPC), Tanvir Ahmed (ex-president Larkana Region),  Advocate Supreme Court Mustafa Ramday and Chaudhry Arif Saeed (CEO  Service Industries).

 





 
One of the members of the new management committee, requesting anonymity, said this committee had been formed in the light of PCB’s Constitution of 2014.
“This [management] committee will work till the elections of PCB Board of Governors and Chairman which will be held within 120 days,” the said member said.
“Now, after a formal approval from the Federal Cabinet anytime soon as a summary has been moved for getting [this] approval through circulation, the PCB Constitution of 2019 will be formally repealed and the Constitution of 2014 will be formally revived.”
The 2019 Constitution was approved by former prime minister Imran Khan.
This committee will manage PCB affairs with full executive powers with the aim of effecting the restoration of departmental cricket structure and allied matters, including the nomination of Board of Governors and the election of chairman, as stipulated in the 2014 Constitution, within 120 days.
According to sources, there were strong chances that after repealing the Constitution of 2019, Sethi would formally take charge as PCB  chairman after the completion of relevant legal formalities. 
The Ministry of Inter-provincial Coordination (IPC) the other day had moved a summary to include two new PCB BoG members — Sethi and Shakil — in place of incumbent PCB chairman Ramiz Raja and another member Asad Ali Khan. 
Ramiz was elected as PCB chief in September last year.
Late on Wednesday, sources added, the IPC Ministry moved a summary to Cabinet Division for its approval through circulation. 
It is relevant to note here that Ehsan Mani replaced Sethi as PCB chief following the latter’s resignation in 2018 after the formation of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government which was replaced in April this year following Imran’s removal as PM through a no-confidence motion in the Parliament.

3,Babar Azam rises to career-high Test batter ranking,"Babar, who is ranked first in ODIs and fourth in T20Is, trails Australia’s Marnus Labuschagne by 61 points in the Test rankings.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan captain Babar Azam has attained a career-best second position in the latest International Cricket Council (ICC) men’s Test player rankings after notching two half-centuries in the final Test of the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) series against England in Karachi.
Babar’s knocks of 78 and 54 have helped him overtake Steve Smith, who managed 36 and six in a low-scoring game between Australia and South Africa in Brisbane. Babar, who is ranked first in ODIs and fourth in T20Is, trails Australia’s Marnus Labuschagne by 61 points in the Test rankings.
Australian batter Travis Head, whose first innings score of 92 was the highest in the Brisbane Test, has gained three slots to reach a career-best fourth position as he crosses the 800-rating point mark for the first time in his career. His previous best was fifth position in January this year.
In the latest weekly update that also takes into account performances in the first Test of the WTC series between Bangladesh and India in Chittagong, Cheteshwar Pujara’s knocks of 90 and 102 not out have lifted him 10 positions to 16th while Shreyas Iyer (up 11 places to 26th) and Shubman Gill (up 10 places to 54th) have also gained after some fine performances in the match.
England captain Ben Stokes (up places to 23rd), South Africa’s Temba Bavuma (up eight places to 24th) and Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan (up four places to 37th) are some others to move up the batters list. England’s Harry Brook is in the top 50 for the first time after scoring centuries in all three Tests in Pakistan.
In the bowlers rankings, South African quick Kagiso Rabada has gained four spots to reach third position after grabbing four wickets in each innings at the Gabba. Rabada, a formerly top-ranked bowler, was third in August this year before slipping down the table.
India spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel have made rapid progress after helping win the Chittagong Test. Yadav’s man-of-the-match effort of 8-113 has lifted him 19 places to 49th while Patel’s five scalps in the match see him jump 10 places to a career-best 18th position.
Other bowlers to move up the list include Marcon Jansen, Jack Leach, Mark Wood, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Scott Boland and Mohammad Siraj.

4,MCG under pressure to deliver contest after Gabba let-down,"“We expect our curators, again, to find that balance between bat and ball at the pitch,” says CA official.","MELBOURNE: The Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) is under pressure to produce a pitch that delivers a fairer contest between bat and ball in the Boxing Day Test between Australia and South Africa after the series-opener at the Gabba was over within two days.
Australia won the Brisbane Test by six wickets as batters struggled on a green-top pitch that was criticised by South African captain Dean Elgar and earned a  “below average” rating by the International Cricket Council.
Along with fans denied action lasting up to five days, broadcasters also lost out on advertising revenue.
Cricket Australia operations chief Peter Roach said the governing body had no control over MCG curator Matt Page and his work on the pitch but would engage with him in the lead-up to the test starting Monday.
“We expect our curators, again, to find that balance between bat and ball given the unique characteristics of the venue they are at,” Roach told reporters on Wednesday.
Last year’s Boxing Day Test was over within three days, as Australia thrashed England in a one-sided Ashes contest.
Australian vice-captain Steve Smith said he hoped Melbourne would be kinder to batsmen, rating the Gabba pitch as  “probably” the most difficult he had ever played on in his home nation.
“Some balls were sitting in the wicket, making divots, some were zinging through and it was just incredibly hard to bat against,” Smith said on Wednesday.
“Whether it was unsafe or not, it’s not really my place to judge, but it certainly wasn’t easy to bat.
“As a batter I’d like [the wicket] to do a little bit less. I think it’s a fine balance just trying to get that even contest between bat and ball.”
Australia will look to seal the three-match series with another victory in Melbourne.

5,Rivals lack batters to copy England’s ‘Bazball’: Atherton,LONDON: England’s entertaining brand of Test cricket will be difficult to imitate because other teams do not boast...,"LONDON: England’s entertaining brand of Test cricket will be difficult to imitate because other teams do not boast of a similar group of swashbuckling batters, believes former captain Mike Atherton. 
England’s 3-0 series sweep in Pakistan on Tuesday is further validation of their ‘Bazball’ approach under the dynamic coach-captain duo of Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes. 
Under them, England have now won nine of their 10 Tests playing fearless cricket, especially with the bat. 
“There is no question other teams have taken note, the more interesting question is whether other teams will get sucked into trying to copy England,” Atherton told Sky Sports. 
“My own view is as a captain, you try to work out what your resources are and the best way to win a game. 
“Other teams may not have the kind of gung-ho batsmen England have and may not be able to replicate that kind of approach.”
Stokes has said England are just not interested in draws and would not mind an occasional defeat in their single-minded pursuit for victory. 
“Whether other teams will get sucked in remains to be seen, but certainly the days of England and others playing really attritional, dead cricket are gone — and people will probably say thank goodness for that,” Atherton added. 
While many believe England are about to revolutionise how teams play test cricket, former captain Nasser Hussain was not so certain. 
“I’m not sure what bearing England’s style will have on how other teams play,” Hussain told the Daily Mail. 
“It’s hard enough changing the culture of one side, let alone everyone else.”

6,England cap revival year with Pakistan whitewash,LONDON: The completion of England’s 3-0 series success over Pakistan on Tuesday was the latest chapter in a...,"LONDON: The completion of England’s 3-0 series success over Pakistan on Tuesday was the latest chapter in a remarkable revival, all the more extraordinary for the woeful run of red-ball results that preceded the ‘Bazball’ era.
Inflicting the first home whitewash suffered by Pakistan in Test history, courtesy of an eight-wicket win in Karachi on Tuesday, was striking enough in itself.
It also gave England their ninth win in 10 matches at this level, with Test world champions New Zealand, India and South Africa also among the vanquished, since captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum took charge in May.
When they joined forces, however, England had won just one of their 17 previous Tests.
So how to explain the stunning turnaround? The answer begins in April, when the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) appointed Rob Key, a former England batsman with a modest Test record, as their new director of cricket.
The 43-year-old, previously a television pundit, has since seen his judgement vindicated repeatedly.
As New Zealand captain, McCullum provided the template for England’s resurgence in 50-over cricket that culminated in their 2019 World Cup final win.
Key backed him to have a similar impact on the Test side when he named him as a permanent replacement as coach for Chris Silverwood was sacked after England’s 4-0 thrashing in Australia.
Star all-rounder Stokes, 31, not long back from a mental health break, replaced close friend Joe Root as England captain, with the outstanding batsman drained by leading a losing side playing under severe Covid restrictions.
Numerous observers noted how the form of England all-rounders Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff had slumped during their unsuccessful spells as Test captain.
Nevertheless Key, preferring his opinion to the weight of history, said:  “I believe in Brendon and Ben Stokes... Time for us all to buckle up and get ready for the ride.” And what a ride to date, with Stokes and McCullum capitalising on the feel-good mood created by the end of ‘bubble’ life.
In the new environment players are encouraged to enjoy cricket and not fear failure.
England’s attacking approach, dubbed ‘Bazball’ in honour of McCullum’s nickname, although he dislikes the term, has been based on aggressive run-scoring that allows bowlers the time to take the 20 wickets needed to win a Test.
McCullum has realised advances in limited overs run-scoring — on show in England’s recent T20 World Cup win under white-ball coach Matthew Mott — can be applied to Test cricket.
That expanded range of strokeplay, allied to classical shot-making, saw England become the first team to score 500 runs on the first day of a Test when Zak Crawley, rising stars Harry Brook and Ollie Pope, as well as Ben Duckett, all made hundreds in the Pakistan series opener in Rawalpindi.
England’s new attitude is also evident in Stokes’ willingness to risk losing a match in pursuit of a win.
In Rawalpindi, Stokes’ bold declaration, that left Pakistan needing 343 to win in four sessions, was rewarded with victory shortly before bad light threatened to end the match.
England’s willingness to defy their traditional conservatism was equally visible when 18-year-old leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed became the youngest Test debutant from any country to take five wickets in an innings during the Karachi finale.
Stokes has also proved himself an astute man-manager, reinvigorating veteran quicks James Anderson and Stuart Broad, while giving a much-needed confidence boost to left-arm spinner Jack Leach.
Have England changed Test cricket? Perhaps not but former captain Michael Atherton, noting how the current England team’s approach had faced scepticism at every turn, wrote in The Times on Tuesday that Stokes’ men had won in Pakistan by  “playing with more verve and attacking intent than any England team, surely, has ever done”.
For some the acid test remains next year’s Ashes series at home to arch-rivals Australia.
Stokes acknowledges that winning makes it easier for England to  “enjoy” themselves and is doing his best to head off the doubters.
“The real test will be when things don’t go so well,” he said.  “And that will be the time to make that [enjoyment] even more of a thing for us to take out there. But I hope we don’t come to that.”

8,Argentina’s World Cup heroes forced to abandon bus parade,BUENOS AIRES: Argentina’s World Cup heroes had to abandon an open-top bus parade in Bueno Aires on Tuesday as...,"BUENOS AIRES: Argentina’s World Cup heroes had to abandon an open-top bus parade in Bueno Aires on Tuesday as millions of ecstatic fans flooded onto the streets and brought the city to a standstill, with Lionel Messi and his team-mates whisked into helicopters to complete the celebrations.
The players who were triumphant in Sunday’s World Cup final in Qatar were unable to reach the central Obelisco monument as planned because the route was completely blocked by the heaving crowd, estimated by local media at four million people.
With social media footage showing some fans trying to jump onto the team’s bus when it passed under a bridge, the scheduled eight-hour journey was cut short due to security fears. The players were transferred from their parade bus and into helicopters.
“The world champions are flying over the entire route in helicopters because it became impossible to continue on land due to the explosion of joy,” presidential spokeswoman Gabriela Cerruti wrote on Twitter.
Television images showed people all over the city, including those waiting around the Obelisco and on surrounding highways trying to catch a glimpse of their returning champions.
“It’s crazy, it’s incredible, it’s the best thing that can happen to you in life,” said 25-year-old metalworker Matias Gomez.
“It is an enormous joy to see all these happy people, all together, one with the other, holding hands, giving each other hugs, kisses. We are all one today.”  The team had arrived in the early hours of Tuesday at Ezeiza airport. Thousands were waiting with banners, flags and flares and howling with joy after Messi and his team-mates ended the country’s 36-year wait to win the World Cup.
By around midday millions had already congregated in downtown Buenos Aires, with major roads shut down for the parade. People held up banners of Messi and late icon Diego Maradona, played instruments or climbed lamp-posts or bus stops.
Roads started to clear after the players took to the sky in helicopters, with some people left disappointed not to see the team.
The Argentine capital has been in party mode since the dramatic victory over France in Sunday’s final in Qatar, which has helped mask economic woes in the South American nation battling one of the world’s highest inflation rates.
The penalty shootout victory made the country world champions for the first time since Maradona hoisted the trophy in 1986 and the third in total.
The government made Tuesday a national holiday to allow fans to celebrate the win.
As the open-top bus snaked through the city, players danced and cheered with fans who circled the bus. Police were having to hold people back to allow the vehicle to move forward on its slow journey towards the centre of town.
But eventually they could go no further.
“They don’t let us get to greet all the people who were at the Obelisco. The security agents that escorted us won’t allow us to move forward,” tweeted Chiqui Tapia, president of the Argentine Football Association (AFA).
“A thousand apologies on behalf of all the champion players.”At times it has felt that the whole country has been partying through the night from Sunday onwards in the southern hemisphere summer, the joy of victory infecting everyone with cars regularly blaring their horns in celebration.
“There are people lying on the floor who came straight from the last party to get up and keep partying,” said Elio Maisares, 25, as he celebrated in the city where everyone and everything was covered in the white-and-blue of the  “Albiceleste”.
“It’s really impressive, it’s unique, what a way to cry. I cried this morning, yesterday, the day before yesterday, I can’t cry anymore, it’s incredible!”

Kamran, who was named in the Pakistan Test squad for the upcoming two-match series against New Zealand earlier, helped Khyber Pakhtunkhwa post 351-4 against Northern, a target they fell short of by 83 runs at the State Bank Stadium. 
The right-hander smashed 118 off 92 balls — an innings studded with four fours and eight sixes. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were further boosted by half-centuries from Mohammad Haris (61 off 25), Sahibzada Farhan (58 off 59), Khushdil Shah (52 off 49) and Waqar Ahmed (50 off 75).
In response to the mammoth total, Northern were dismissed for 268 runs with three overs to spare as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Ihsanullah took five wickets. 
The pick of the batters for Northern was Pakistan discard Umar Akmal, who added 76 off 71 balls with the help of five fours and three sixes. All-rounder Mubasir Khan’s 49-ball 63 also went in vain for the side.
At the NBP Sports Complex, Saim’s ton saw Sindh chase down a 254-run target by Balochistan in just 42 overs and with the loss of six wickets.
The left-handed opener took just 99 balls to plunder the Balochistan bowlers for 102 runs, striking nine fours and a six during the knock. Following the end of a 54-run opening partnership with Sharjeel Khan — who hit 36 runs of 16 balls — Saim saw two off his partners depart on the other end, leaving Sindh at 111-3.
The stylish batter then combined with Mohammad Suleman for 105 runs for the fourth wicket. After Saim lost his wicket as the scorecard read 216-4, Suleman went on to chase down the remaining target with Danish Aziz and returned undefeated at 66 off 75 balls. 
Earlier, Balochistan opener Haseebullah’s scored 107 off 110 balls before Balochistan were bowled out for 253 in 48 overs. Danish bagged three wickets with his left-arm spin and pacer Shahnawaz Dahani claimed two victims.
At the UBL Sports Complex, Southern Punjab defeated Central Punjab by 97 runs, thanks to an all-round performance from Hassan Khan.
Hassan first helped Southern Punjab post 274-8 with a quickfire 48 off 22 balls before taking two wickets to help his side bundle out Central Punjab for 177.
Zain Abbas was the top-scorer for Southern Punjab with 69 off 80. Sharoon Siraj, meanwhile, added 45 off 67. Later, Arafat Minhas took four wickets to wrap it up for the side.
Summarised scores: 
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa beat Northern by 83 runs. 
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA 351-4 in 50 overs (Kamran Ghulam 118 not out, Mohammad Haris 61; Mehran Mumtaz 2-45); NORTHERN 268 in 46.2 overs (Umar Akmal 76, Mubasir Khan 63; Ihsanullah 5-49)

13,Lopetegui makes winning start as Wolves boss in League Cup,LONDON: Julen Lopetegui made a winning start as Wolves manager after late goals from substitutes Raul Jimenez and...,"LONDON: Julen Lopetegui made a winning start as Wolves manager after late goals from substitutes Raul Jimenez and Rayan Ait-Nouri secured a 2-0 victory at home to Gillingham in the English League Cup fourth round on Tuesday.
Gillingham defied their position as the bottom club in all four tiers of English league football against top-flight strugglers Wolves.
The deadlock at Molineux was not broken until the 77th minute when Jimenez scored from the penalty spot before Ait-Nouri ensured Wolves’ place in the quarter-finals with a stoppage-time goal.
Former Sevilla and Spain boss Lopetegui was appointed by Wolves last month after Bruno Lage was sacked in October following a run of one win in 15 Premier League matches, going back to last season.
The 56-year-old will begin his quest to lift Wolves away from the foot of the Premier League against Everton on Dec 26.
“For me it is a very special day and, of course, I am very happy — but above all it is for the team because we wanted to be in the next round,” he said.
“We worked with good concentration and focus and in the end we are very happy.
“Now we have to look forward to the next matches. We have a hard task ahead but we have to be ready for it. We have a lot of things to improve.”
Newcastle edged their all top-flight clash with Bournemouth 1-0 at St James’ Park after England defender Kieran Trippier provided the cross from which the Cherries’ Adam Smith headed into his own net in the 67th minute.
Southampton came from behind to see off third-tier Lincoln 2-1.
Goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu’s second-minute own goal gave Lincoln the lead at St Mary’s before two goals from Che Adams, one in each half, saw the Saints into the last eight.
On a night where Bournemouth were the only Premier League club to suffer a defeat, Leicester proved too strong for Milton Keynes Dons as they won 3-0 away to the League One strugglers.
Youri Tielemans, involved with Belgium at the World Cup, opened the scoring in the 18th minute before Ayoze Perez doubled the lead.
Former England forward Jamie Vardy completed the scoring when the veteran striker was on target early in the second half.

14,Mbappe returns to training after disappointment,Mbappe returns to training just three days after he ends up on the losing side despite scoring a hat-trick in the World Cup final.,"PARIS: France star Kylian Mbappe returned to training with Paris St-Germain on Wednesday just three days after he ended up on the losing side despite scoring a hat-trick in the World Cup final.
The 24-year-old cast a despondent figure in the aftermath of France’s loss to Argentina — led by his PSG team-mate Lionel Messi — in a penalty shootout, despite his goals twice bringing the 2018 champions level.
However, although PSG players have been given 10 days off Mbappe was pictured at the French champions training ground.
“Kylian Mbappe returned to training on Wednesday,” tweeted PSG.
Mbappe, who finished top scorer at the World Cup with eight goals, was not expected back till January and PSG did not say whether he would be available for selection for their Ligue 1 match with Strasbourg on Dec 28.
His return to training comes the day after a documentary on France’s campaign shows Mbappe giving his team-mates a rousing half-time talk in Sunday’s final following a limp first-half which saw them trail 2-0.
“It is the World Cup guys, it is the match of a lifetime!” says Mbappe in French broadcaster TF1’s documentary.
“In any case we could hardly play worse than we have already done.
“We are going back on the pitch and either we carry on playing like idiots or we up the intensity.
“It is the World Cup Final! We are losing 2-0 but we can come back.
“Hey guys, this only comes around once every four years.” Although Mbappe led the fightback it took till the 80th minute — when he scored a penalty to make it 2-1 — for the team to really find the fighting spirit.
Mbappe was to go on and score his penalty in the shootout but, with Kingsley Coman and Aurelien Tchouameni both missing, Argentina were not to be denied, Gonzalo Montiel tucking away the winning spotkick.

15,Morocco’s World Cup squad arrives home to heroes’ welcome,"RABAT: Tens of thousands of Moroccans thronged the capital on Tuesday to welcome home their national football team,...","RABAT: Tens of thousands of Moroccans thronged the capital on Tuesday to welcome home their national football team, the first Arab or African squad ever to reach the semi-final of a World Cup.
The team and their coach Walid Regragui waved from an open-topped bus as they were driven from the airport and around central Rabat, accompanied by dozens of police cars and motorbikes with flashing lights and wailing sirens.
The crowd cheered and some waved flares as fireworks crackled in the sky over the seaside capital, AFP correspondents said.
“I’m so proud of our team. Who knows -- maybe next time they could win the cup,” said Adam Najah, a 27-year-old waiter from the city of Meknes.
He said he had travelled over 150 kilometres (90 miles) to  “experience this historic day” and  “celebrate the beautiful story of Morocco at the World Cup”.
Many supporters, clad in the team’s kits and waving red flags, had waited hours to see their heroes.
“I can’t describe my joy! They made us Moroccans, Arabs and Africans proud,” said Abdeljabbar Bouroua, 54, as the bus passed through central Rabat.
Morocco finished top of a group including Croatia and Belgium, who came third at the 2018 World Cup, before knocking out Spain and Portugal to reach the last four.
The Atlas Lions lost Saturday’s third place play-off 2-1 against 2018 runners-up Croatia, but captured the imagination in Qatar.
“I would have liked to take them in my arms and kiss them,” said 19-year-old law student Leila Messour, who came to watch the team with her friends.
“They passed by quickly but we saw them — I haven’t been so happy for a long time.”
The team later headed to the royal palace, where they were received by King Mohammed VI  “in recognition of the historic achievement”.
The king, alongside crown prince Moulay Hassan, handed out awards to the president of the Moroccan football federation, the team coach and the players, country’s national news agency MAP reported.
The players’ mothers also accompanied them to the palace, MAP added, saying it was in recognition of their efforts to  “instil in their children the values of patriotism, sacrifice and national belonging”.
