0,"Plan afoot to merge units for health sector reforms, monitoring in KP",Concept paper to be put up to minister next week for consent.,"PESHAWAR: The health department has planned to merge the Health Sector Reforms Unit and Independent Monitoring Unit to “ensure evidence-based approach for policy-making and make recommendations for its implementation on health-related issues”in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, say officials.
They told Dawn that a concept paper for the initiative was being developed for approval by the health minister that was likely to come next week.
Officials said that the HSRU was established in 2003 to carry out research on the province’s health matters backed by statistics and formulate policies to improve patient care, while the IMU was set up in 2016 to monitor health facilities and point out missing facilities, including manpower, medical supplies, equipment and toilets.
They said that the health secretariat had recommended a combined structure for both units provided with data and insights to devise policies and implement them for improving patient care in the province.

Concept paper to be put up to minister next week for consent

The officials said that it had been realised making these units into one was needed because it would strengthen policy-making, implementation, health economics, human resources and other aspects of the department.
They said the IMU had all data of health facilities and the HSRU that of the policy-making and coordination with the centre and donor agencies about healthcare in the province.
The officials said that the proposed Health Sector Reform and Monitoring Unit (HSRMU) would suggest broad-based policies to the government and recommend implementation.
They said that a BPS-20 doctor from the administrative cadre would head the unit, which was to operate as an advisory body driven by scientific researches to develop policies for the provision of better care to patients in line with the deficiencies to be recorded by current IMU staff members, who were set to become part of the proposed entity.
The officials said that the IMU inspected public sector health facilities and prepared monthly and quarterly reports about missing facilities.
They said that the proposed HSRMU would be responsible for the overall leadership, supervision, management, and monitoring affairs to achieve the objectives.
According to officials, the health department wants to come up with innovative healthcare measures as suggested by the proposed body.
They said that the HSRMU would lead, supervise and contribute in all technical areas ranging from identification of policy issues to guiding towards drafting of policy documents in the areas identified in project documents and would convene and direct technical meetings as required.
The officials also said that the unit would play the overall leadership and supervisory roles besides performing communication functions in addition to scrutinising the quality of reports for accuracy and present the monthly and quarterly progress reports to the health secretary and minister as well as the chief minister.
They said that the HSRMU would examine matters relating to policy and strategic planning and advice on policy, strategy frameworks and health systems at provincial and district levels, and would plan, manage and implement the overall procurement strategy for the health department.
The officials said that the proposed body would prepare a policy implementation roadmap and monitor progress of all policy changes and human resource strategy for the department, including standardisation of recruitment process and term of reference of all personnel.
They also said that the HSRMU would have the services of primary and secondary healthcare specialists to give technical support on designing and implementation of primary and secondary healthcare reforms, and get the services of infrastructure specialists for infrastructure revamp strategy, oversee implementation and budget utilisation.
The officials said that the proposed unit would have broader responsibilities which included legal drafting for reviewing contracts besides carrying out economic evaluation of health interventions, formulating recommendations, and liaising with partner organisations for implementation.

1,KP ministers blame ‘regime change’ for security issue,Taimur Saleem Jhagra says security challenges surfaced in KP after the removal of Imran Khan from office.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Wednesday blamed the security issue in the province on the ouster of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government in April this year.
It also flayed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s administration on the criticism of the province’s police and counter-terrorism department over the seizure of the CTD centre in Bannu.
Accompanied by adviser to the chief minister on home Babar Salim Swati and higher education minister Kamran Bangash, finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra told reporters here that security challenges surfaced in the province after the removal of Prime Minister Imran Khan from power and that the “regime change” was responsible for the current law and order situation in the province.
He said a comparison of the security situation before and after the Shehbaz-government in the centre was enough to confirm his assertion.
The minister said terrorist activities on the country’s western borders began in 2001.
He said the post-2001 deaths in the province’s tribal districts (erstwhile Fata) outnumbered those reported nationwide during the period showing how ‘ignorant’ interior minister Rana Sanaullah and defence minister Khwaja Asif were about such casualties.
“It’s very sad to hear [remarks of members of the federal cabinet],” he said.
Mr Jhagra said the security situation had improved after the fencing of western borders and that was maintained by the centre and not KP.
He blamed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s administration for the province’s financial challenges.
The minister said in the third letter to former adviser to PM Shehbaz Sharif on finance Miftah Ismail, he had warned that the continued denial of funds by the centre to the province could lead to security challenges in the province.
He said his government had to make “compromises on different things” due to those funding denial.
Aide to the chief minister Babar Saleem Swati said the “regime change” had led to “security pressure”, so he wondered why the state institutions continued to support Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s administration.
“What is happening right now [in the province] is just because of the regime change in the country,” he insisted.
He said KP acted as a buffer zone on the Western border.
Mr Swati said the sacrifices rendered by the province showed that its forces and residents continued to stand firm against militancy.
He said the provincial government had established CTD regional offices and would set up a few more soon.
Minister Kamran Bangash said there was a huge difference between the law and order situation in the province before and after 2013.
He said the federation should behave like a federation.
Mr Bangash said the provincial government, police and CTD were vigilant and were taking all necessary steps to maintain the law and order situation in the province.
‘We will fight militancy together,” he said.

2,House fire kills man in Mansehra,MANSEHRA: A man was burnt to death when his house caught fire in Mohallah Lughmani in Baffa town here in the early...,"MANSEHRA: A man was burnt to death when his house caught fire in Mohallah Lughmani in Baffa town here in the early hours on Wednesday. 
“The man stated to be the owner of the house was burnt to death in his room. We have retrieved his charred body from the rubble and shifted it to hospital for autopsy,” Amir Khadam, a Rescue 1122 official, told reporters. 
The fire, which according to conflicting reports broke out either due to electricity short-circuiting or gas heater leakage, engulfed the double-storey house within no time, reducing household goods, including cash, gold ornaments and other valuables, to ashes. 
Fire tenders and ambulances of Rescue 1122 and tehsil municipal administration, Baffa-Pakhal, immediately responded to calls made by a women living in the adjacent house, and put out the flames after hectic efforts of many hours.  
The family of house owner, Mohammad Ijaz, had gone to his in-laws’ house, and he was alone there, sleeping in a room, Mr Khadam said, adding the charred body was shifted to the King Abdullah Teaching Hospital. 
The police, after registering an FIR, started investigation to ascertain the exact cause of the fire.  
Meanwhile, unknown assailants killed a young boy, namely Mohammad Rizwan, in Kirpai area of Oghi. 
The police said the boy was standing outside his cattle pen when assailants showed up there and opened indiscriminate fire on him, leaving him seriously injured. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. 
The police, after lodging FIR, started making efforts to arrest the culprits. 
Separately, the people on Wednesday complained millers were selling low quality wheat flour to them under the government’s subsidised flour scheme. 
“The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government is providing subsidy to millers to supply wheat flour at subsidised rate, but the latter are selling inferior quality commodity to consumers,” Mohammad Ajmal, a local, told reporters. 
He said the food department should check the quality of wheat flour being sold in Mansehra under the government’s relief package. 
“The subsidy being provided by the government on wheat to millers is only meant to provide relief to people, but millers are fleecing consumers,” he said.

3,Extortionists threaten Swabi lawyer,"SWABI: Mohammad Rashid Advocate, a former chairman of the Public Safety Commission, has received threatening letters...","SWABI: Mohammad Rashid Advocate, a former chairman of the Public Safety Commission, has received threatening letters from unknown persons, asking him to pay extortion or face “dire consequences.”
It has been learnt that he is not the only prominent figure having received a threatening letter as various other leaders have also been threatened of consequences, but they have remained tight-lipped.
When contacted, Mr Rashid Advocate confirmed to Dawn the receipt of such a letter, saying he had informed the district police about it.
However, an advisory note issued to him by DSP Swabi tehsil says he should take precautionary measures for his security. He has been told to avoid unnecessary movement; keep a licensed weapon, if any, for his defense/protection and maintain security on his part. The note, however, said policemen in plainclothes ‘will frequently be active in the surroundings of his house’.
He has been asked to contact immediately the Swabi district police officer, DSP headquarters, SHO Swabi city police station and the police control room in case he spots any suspect around.
Meanwhile, former Topi tehsil naib nazim Mohammed Younus, who also remained part of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, said on Wednesday Imran Khan’s threat to dissolve the provincial assemblies was his final card he wanted to use, but like his previous tactics it would also meet with a dead end.
Talking to mediapersons, he said the former PTI government in the centre had pushed the country’s economy into deep crisis.
Mr Younus insisted Imran Khan did not have sustainability in his policies and changed his positions repeatedly, harming the nation and future of younger generation.
He claimed the nation was no longer interested in following the former prime minister. He said Pakistan needed ‘serious’ leaders to tackle the issues in a prudent manner.

4,Rs3.23 billion uplift projects inaugurated in Peshawar,CM threatens sit-in outside NA over ‘denial’ of dues by centre.,"PESHAWAR: Chief Minister Mahmood Khan said here Wednesday that the members of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly would stage a sit-in before the National Assembly if the centre failed to release the province’s withheld due share of Rs189 billion.
