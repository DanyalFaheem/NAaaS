1,Tomato price shoots up to Rs480 a kilo as damaged roads hit supplies,"Floods destroy standing crops in Sindh, Balochistan.","KARACHI: The devastation of crops due to floods in Balochistan and Sindh has resulted in shortage of vegetables in Karachi taking prices to new heights as rate of tomato has gone up to Rs480 per kilo and onion price has reached up to Rs200kg in city markets.  
In third week of this month, onion and tomatoes were available at Rs60-90 and Rs110-150 per kg, respectively, amid looming fear of flooding based on heavy rain forecasts.  
A customer told Dawn that one kilogram of tomatoes was available at Rs480 at a leading superstore in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday evening.  
From July onwards vegetables were in short supply from Balochistan and Sindh to city markets mainly due to damages to road infrastructure caused by heavy rains.  

One kg of onion now costs Rs200; flood destroys standing crops in Sindh, Balochistan

Recently, devastating floods in both the provinces have further damaged the supply situation adding more price pressure on consumers.  
Retailers, who had lifted stocks at old rates a few days ago, are now cashing in on the situation.  
The skyrocketing inflation has also hit consumers who are worried about further price hike fearing severe shortages of vegetables, especially onion and tomato which are essential cooking ingredients, next month.  
Most consumers have also reduced their daily purchases because to skyrocketing prices of various commodities.  
Only potato is relatively within the reach of the common man’s purchasing power, as it is selling at Rs50-60 per kg.  
The rates of all other vegetables are already on fire before cooking in household kitchens.  
Other vegetables rates 
The price of capsicum, ridge gourd and bottle gourd is Rs320 per kg, Rs200 and Rs160 respectively while cabbage is selling at Rs240 per kg. Cucumber costs around Rs200 per kg. One bunch of green coriander and mint are available at Rs30. Ladyfinger is selling at Rs250-320 per kg.  
President of Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market Superhighway Mandi, Haji Shahjehan said the arrival of tomato and onion from Balochistan had confined to only 10 per cent while only 30pc green vegetables of Sindh were finding way into the wholesale market due to crop losses, standing flood water in fields and huge damage to roads leading to Karachi from Balochistan areas.  
A grower in Surab district, Union Council Mara, Balochistan, Abdul Hameed claimed that only 10pc of onion and tomato were reaching Karachi because many growers had lost their 90pc standing crops due to heavy rains and floods.  
He said growers were also struggling to build their houses which had been washed away by heavy floods and rains. 
“We do not have any support in rebuilding houses nor getting any incentive for crops revival,” Mr Hameed added while referring to high input costs of urea and di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) urea bag, which is selling at Rs2,400 and Rs12,000 per 50kg bag as compared to last year’s Rs1,780 and Rs6,000 followed by huge increase in labour rates and transportation charges of goods.  
A vegetable grower in Nagarparkar and Tondo Allahyar in Sindh, Vicky Jaipal said rains and floods had destroyed 75pc of crops of vegetables in many producing areas of Sindh and only 25pc were left which were being transported to Karachi.  
He said growers were waiting for drying up of land in many areas followed by efforts in rebuilding their houses.  
The new crop of onion and tomato usually arrives in September to October. However, some growers are trying a second attempt at growing new seeds but the crops are feared to get delayed.  
He said import of tomato and onion from neighbouring countries can help resolve any serious food crisis.

4,Hindus’ fasting month Shravan concludes with prayers for flood victims,Shravan or Sawan Maas is the fifth month in the solar calendar followed by the Hindus.,"KARACHI: Monishka Sharma wakes up at 4am in the morning, performs ablutions, covers her head with scarf and reads her holy book, the Bhagavad Gita. Lastly, she sings prayers and goes back to sleep. When she wakes up later in the day, she doesn’t eat anything till dusk.
“I have been observing a 24-hour fast for the last one month. I have observed 30 fasts during our holy fasting month of Shravan,” the teenage girl tells Dawn.
“I break my fast at sunset with simple food. There is no special one to break the fast. That’s it. With this meal, the fast starts again till the evening the next day,” she explains.
“My mother and father have also observed all the 30 fasts of Shravan,” she adds smilingly.
Like Muslims, Christians and Jews, the Hindus also have a fasting month in their religious calendar.
Shravan or Sawan Maas is the fifth month in the solar calendar followed by the Hindus during which they observe fasts for 30 days every year.
The religious events during the month mark the special event of the birthday of their Supreme Lord Shiva, who, according to the Hindu mythology, creates, protects and transforms the universe.
The religious minority community celebrated the birthday of the Lord Shiva on 19th of this month – the core of the whole month of fasting, praying and seclusion. And this is the month of seeking one’s wishes fulfilled too.
“There had been some problems in my family, so I observed the fasts with a wish to our Lord Shiva to resolve them,” says Sharma.
“I also prayed for Sukh and Shanti (peace and prosperity) as there had been the incidents of killings of our community members over petty issues and kidnappings of the Hindu girls,” she added.
Indirectly, the girl referred to the incidents of forced conversion of the Hindu girls, many of her age, and torture or lynching of the members of her community over the allegations of blasphemy.
Ms Sharma, along with her family, heads to the historic Shri Ratneshwar Mahadev Mandir in Clifton, where special puja was being held to mark the end of the fasting month. 
Her third wish is for her future. “I also prayed for my studies,” says the Grade-VIII student,” adding: “I also want to do my own business of computers, so I also prayed for this as well.”
Lord Shiva’s eye on sea disasters
The Hindu community believes that the third eye of the Lord Shiva watches the sea and prevents sea disasters like floods from happening.
It is believed that Lord Shiva used to live in this cave, and also that Guru Nanak used to meditate there, where the Shri Ratneshwar Mahadev temple is made.
Special puja at the end of the month was being held at the temple, which is said to have been built around 300 years ago in a cave, which still exists.
The staircase leads down to the cave and opens up to the Arabian Ocean, which is why this temple has also significance since the prayers at the sea are considered more important.
On the first floor, the special puja was held with a big Hawan (bonfire) in the middle.
Hundreds of worshippers, mostly fasting, attend the puja, where they break their fast as well.
Parsad is considered a sacred edible made from wheat loaf mashed with sugar or gur and asli ghee is distributed at the end.
“This is the first or probably the second largest temple in the metropolis,” young worshipper Ravi Waghela told Dawn, who supervises a live streaming of the puja on Facebook.
During the puja, the temple’s priest Maharaj Ram Nath delivered a sermon highlighting the significance of the month.
“I pray for our people, especially our youngsters, to spend their lives according to the teachings of our religion,” the priest told Dawn, sitting at the corner of the big bonfire.
Also, he pleads the Lord Shiva to control the gushing water, which is causing floods and disasters across the country.
“We offered special prayers to our Lord Shiva, who controls the sea disasters, to help our brothers and sisters affected by the floods in our country,” the priest told Dawn.
In the cave, the worshippers pour milk on the Shivling.
Hours-long puja comes to an end with the distribution of Bhandara (free food) among the worshippers so that they can break their day-long fast.
Sharma and hundreds of other worshippers leave for their homes, content that their Lord Shiva has taken up all their worries and threats of any disasters in the future.

5,"This week 50 years ago: Nationalisation of colleges, Ghalib Library and Mr Misquita",THE reverberations of the violence that had erupted in Karachi because of the language strife in the province were...,"

13th mayor of Karachi Manuel Misquita

 
THE reverberations of the violence that had erupted in Karachi because of the language strife in the province were still being felt. The verbal tit-for-tat showdowns among legislators who were for and against the language bill hadn’t yet lost steam. On Aug 29, 1972, the leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly, Shah Faridul Haq, criticised the Chief Minister of Sindh, Mumtaz Bhutto, for declaring that his stance on the language issue was right ‘even if the whole world was on the other side’. In a statement he argued that such things showed that the party in power [PPP] had no faith in democracy. He added that Mr Bhutto had also said on the floor of the house, “If we will not sit [in assembly] then nobody will,” which had created doubts in the minds of the people about the implementation of the language accord. 
The leader of the opposition also made his dissatisfaction known about a matter that week concerning educational institutions. 
On Sept 3, Mr Haq expressed serious doubts about the sincerity of the government in nationalising private colleges in Sindh. He was speaking at a reception given in his honour at a local hotel by the teaching staff of the Liaquat College on his retirement as principal of the institution. He pointed out that the manner in which the government was conducting the affairs of educational centres called for caution and vigilance on the part of teachers and students.
It needs to be mentioned here that a couple of days earlier, on Sept 1, the special committee appointed by the Directorate of Education, Karachi, completed the ‘takeover’ of all the private colleges of the city numbering 45, claiming it was smooth and peaceful. According to the procedure adopted, the committee consisting of four persons with a convener visited the colleges and asked the principals to submit resignation from their present posts. After the formal resignation, they were given fresh appointments on an ad hoc basis. In turn, all the teachers were asked by the acting principals to fill out the prescribed performa indicating they had resigned. 
Education and libraries go hand in hand. On Sept 2, the first anniversary of Ghalib Library in Nazimabad was celebrated when a cake was cut by the seasoned writer Nurus Sabah Begum and the eight-year-old Firoza, daughter of renowned poet Himayat Ali Shair, representing two generations of literature lovers. Speeches were made and a progress report was read by the secretary of the Anjuman Yadgar-i-Ghalib, Mirza Zafrul Hasan. Eminent scholar Sibte Hasan commended the venture and appealed to the lovers of Ghalib to enrich the library.
That being said, the week started on a sad note. On Aug 29, Dawn reported that the previous day, Manuel Misquita, former mayor of Karachi and a leader of the Christian community, passed away. He was 86 and had been ill for some time. Born in 1886, Mr Misquita was the son of J C Misquita, a businessman and landlord. He was associated with the cantonment board and served on various KMC committees before being finally elected the 13th mayor of the city.

7,Plan launched to prevent millions from getting diabetes across country,KARACHI: Leading endocrinologists and senior diabetologists have joined hands to launch a nationwide diabetes...,"KARACHI: Leading endocrinologists and senior diabetologists have joined hands to launch a nationwide diabetes prevention programme (DPP) to prevent millions of “pre-diabetics” from having “full-blown diabetes”.
They believe that people at the risk of becoming diabetic would be approached through mass media and apprised to adopt Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) to remain fit and healthy throughout their lives.
“The national diabetes prevention programme (DPP) is the project of Pakistan Endocrine Society (PES), which is concerned about growing number of diabetics in the country,” experts said.
PES president Dr Ibrar Ahmed said: “If immediate preventive measures are not taken, Pakistan will become the largest nation of sick people by 2045 with 65 million persons living with diabetes.” 
“At the moment, we have around 33 million people living with diabetes and around 10 million who are unaware of their health condition. There are millions who are pre-diabetics or at the risk of getting diabetes in the years to come,” he added.
He said: “As we can’t treat all of these people in our lifetime, we have decided to launch the DPP to prevent millions from getting this chronic illness.”
Dr Ahmed said that the programme had officially been launched to prevent millions of pre-diabetics or those going to become diabetic in the years to come through awareness, guidance and regular counselling.
Prof Abdul Basit of the Baqai Institute of Diabetology and Endocrinology (BIDE) said that the launch of such a programme was a first step in the right direction.
“It would take at least two decades and billions of rupees to reverse the trend of diabetes in Pakistan where nobody was taking the epidemic of diabetes seriously at the moment,” he said.
“We keep appealing to the government to increase taxes on sugar sweetened beverages to make them unaffordable for children and teenagers in the country. Pakistan can generate at least Rs60 billion annually by increasing taxes on such products, which can be used for the prevention of diabetes by launching awareness campaigns, promoting primary healthcare and improving existing healthcare facilities in the country,” he added.
Dr Nazish Sarwar, a researcher associated with the programme, said they were launching a three-year open study to assess the impacts of lifestyle medication on prevention of diabetes.
Initially, she said, the programme would be recruiting 2,600 pre-diabetics as volunteers to evaluate if lifestyle medication prevented them from becoming fully fledged diabetic or not.

11,"Amid heavy flooding, over 0.5m people had to contend with encroached drain in Hyderabad",The drainage of rainwater through the only wastewater drain for Latifabad is extremely slow.,"HYDERABAD: After suffering under continuous rain for over two months, over 500,000 residents of city, Latifabad and Qasimabad areas have now to contend with streets and roads flooded with stinking water as sewage has mixed with the stagnant rainwater due to chocked drains.
The drainage of rainwater through the only wastewater drain for Latifabad is extremely slow as the drain is clogged at some places and needs to be cleared after dismantling structures built over it.
Hundreds of thousands of people living in units-2, 8 and 12 of Latifabad taluka, several areas of Qasimabad and city share the same ordeal due to the faulty drainage system.
“We can’t leave the area for several days. The stagnant rainwater had turned blackish after sewage mixed with it,” said a resident of unit-8 pointing towards a section of flooded Autobahn road outside Sindh Regimental Centre (SRC).
Javed, another resident of the area, agreed with him and said the unit’s drainage was dependent on the drain’s smooth functioning. “Rain has stopped but our miseries are not over yet and they seem to be multiplying by each passing day,” he deplored.
One could hardly enter units-12 and 8 from the flooded Autobahn road as the drain has become overloaded and have started flowing back in these areas. The drain passing outside SRC is said to have clogged which needs to be cleared.
The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) had to install heavy machines to lift the wastewater from one end of the drain and throw it to the other end as an ad hoc arrangement lately.
Road infrastructure, nurseries, a filling station operated by a law enforcement agency and parking areas of commercial projects have been built over a considerable stretch of the drain.
The district administration has opened some portions of the drain by dismantling parking areas and other structures of commercial plazas. But some portions mentioned above have been left standing. The filling station’s space covering the drain has not been touched yet.
“We need to provide some respite to people right now who are suffering due to this problem in units 8 and 12 of Latifabad,” said Hyderabad deputy commissioner Fuad Ghaffar Soomro.
Hyderabad’s General Officer Commanding (GOC) Maj Gen Dilawar Khan visited the area the other day following residents’ complaints. Pakistan Peoples Party’s member of Sindh Assembly from Latifabad Abdul Jabbar Khan and deputy commissioner briefed him about the problem.
The military officials from station headquarters along with deputy commissioner and MPA Jabbar Khan again visited the area the following day. They told the MPA and district administration to carry out their work without any hindrance and mobilise machinery for dismantling the drain outside SRC and no one would object to it.
They said that if they needed machinery it could be made available by Cantonment Board Hyderabad (CBH) to assist the administration.
According to MPA Jabbar Khan, the SRC authorities have no objection if the route of the drainage has been cleared by dismantling any concrete structure outside SRC as it involves public interest.
The MPA said that the filing station’s portions or any other area blocking the drain could be dismantled. “We can’t leave people in the lurch. They have been suffering for almost past two weeks since the rains have started,” he said.
Almost all streets and main roads are flooded with rainwater which has mixed with sewage. Main bazaar in unit-8 of Latifabad near Ayesha Park remained closed and life remained paralyzed in the area. Nusrat Colony and Hali Road areas are still under rainwater.
The situation in Qasimabad and parts of the city was similar. The areas of Gulistan-i- Sajjad, Citizen Colony, Abdullah Homes, Qasimabad phase-I, Anwar Villas, Sehrish Nagar are worst hit by drainage issues.

Several hundred starving families gathered outside the Mirpurkhas commissioner’s office before arrival of Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah late Saturday evening and raised slogans against the provincial government, elected representatives and district administrations of the division for their failure to pay any attention to them during and after the heaviest ever rainfall in the province last week. 
The gate of the Commissioner Complex was closed and a strong contingent of police was deployed there to prevent the protesters from entering the complex. 
Speaking to local reporters, the protesters said that they had been rendered homeless by several spells of downpour and flooding. They said they had lost all their belongings, household articles and even edibles including grains. “Many days have passed but no one came to us for help and now we are starving,” they moaned, and appealed to the authorities concerned to ensure provision of relief goods to them for their survival. 
Separately, hundreds of people blocked the Tando Jan Mohammad bypass leading to Digri on Sunday over the same issue.
The protesters put hurdles to block the road causing suspension of vehicular traffic for about nine hours causing great hardship to commuters stuck in the snarl-up.
The protesters also expressed their disappointment over being ignored by CM Murad Ali Shah who did not visit him during his visit to Umerkot, Thatta, Sujawal and Mirpurkhas.
SUKKUR: A large number of rain-affected Hindu families staged a protest demonstration against Khairpur district administration over its failure in draining out stagnant rainwater from their area and neglecting them in relief and rehabilitation process in this difficult time.
Talking to the media, they said that they had to leave their area of residence because over three-foot rainwater had accumulated in their villages and many houses had collapsed in Meghwar village of Gambat.
They said that their temples and religious places like Ram Pir, Samadhi of Saint Adu Ram and other holy places had also submerged.
They complained that the municipal officials were not doing anything to clear the area of rainwater and sewage due to which other houses and temples were facing threat of collapse. 
They said they had not been provided food, tents, mosquito nets and other relief goods as yet.
LARKANA: Traders of Resham Gali held a demonstration over stagnant water in the trade centre making it difficult for them to do their business. Murtaza Shaikh, Yousuf Bhutto and others accused the municipal machinery of ignoring their hue and cry, and called for early removal of rainwater from the trade centre. 
A large group of people under the banner of Larkana Social Alliance also held protest demonstrations outside the local press club and Jinnahbagh gate to deplore the slow pace of relief work.

The floodwater also surrounded Qubo Saeed Khan town. It was cumulative pressure of breaches from east-north side and breaches in Saifullah Magsi branch coupled with deluge from RBOD from Balochistan side that was forcing people to flee, said local journalists.
Water had entered certain parts of Warah town after breach in Ghar drain which had forced the population to migrate. 
Mor Chandio, a resident of the town, confirmed that water from saline water drains, rain and hill torrents had increased pressure in the Ghar drain, which resulted into the breach. 
However, a cut was made in the drain’s dyke at Garhi village to decrease the pressure in Dhamraha Wah near Nasirabad, allowing water to flow to its natural course. Now it was moving towards Mehar, said sources in Nasirabad.
PPP MPA Sardar Khan Chandio and secretary of irrigation visited Zero Point of Flood Protective Bund in Qambar-Shahdadkot to assess water situation at the spot.
