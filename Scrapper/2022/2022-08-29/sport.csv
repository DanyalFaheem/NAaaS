1,FIFA’s reprieve for India too late for Gokulam Kerala women,BENGALURU: India’s football fraternity breathed a sigh of relief as FIFA lifted the suspension imposed on it after...,"BENGALURU: India’s football fraternity breathed a sigh of relief as FIFA lifted the suspension imposed on it after 11 days, but the decision came too late for Gokulam Kerala whose hopes of playing at the AFC Women’s Club Championship were shattered.
FIFA suspended the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Aug 15 for undue third-party influence leading to Gokulam Kerala being banned from the club championship — a pilot tournament before the launch of the AFC Women’s Champions League in 2024.
The team, winners of the top-flight Indian Women’s League, travelled to Uzbekistan to play their group-stage games in the championship’s west zone, but were forced to return home due to the ban.
“The news of the ban came as a shock to us in Uzbekistan,” winger Kashmina Devi told Reuters on Sunday.  “All players were really hurt... I haven’t been so upset before.
“The ban and the timing of lifting it is unfair to Gokulam Kerala because we had been preparing for the tournament for about two months.” For midfielder Ratanbala Devi, it was the second continental tournament she missed this year after India were also kicked out of the Women’s Asian Cup following a Covid-19 outbreak.
“The ban barely lasted a few days. Had it been lifted earlier we could have won our group games,” Ratanbala said.  “We were confident of making the final.”  Gokulam Kerala club president VC Praveen said the club felt let down.
“We feel that everybody let us down, from FIFA to AIFF to even the Supreme Court because the talks of the ban took place when we were in transit,” Praveen said.
The lifting of the ban also meant the Under-17 women’s World Cup in India from Oct 11-30 will take place as planned.
“We knew the World Cup would happen for sure because FIFA needs it, the Indian government needs it. Our club are the only sufferers,” Praveen added. The AIFF said it felt  “extremely sorry” for Gokulam Kerala.
“It remains Indian football’s greatest loss in the last 11 days, and Indian football owes an apo­logy to the talented girls who had trained so hard for this event,” the federation said.

2,Maxwell’s cameo gives Australia five-wicket win over Zimbabwe,TOWNSVILLE: Glenn Maxwell smashed an unbeaten 32 off nine balls to take Australia to an easy five-wicket win over...,"TOWNSVILLE: Glenn Maxwell smashed an unbeaten 32 off nine balls to take Australia to an easy five-wicket win over Zimbabwe in the first of three One-day Internationals at Townsville’s Riverway Stadium on Sunday.
Chasing 201 for victory, the Australians reached their target with more than 16 overs to spare to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.
All-rounder Cameron Green ripped out the Zimbabwe tail with 5-33 as the visitors collapsed from 185-4 to 200 all out, a total that was never going to be enough against a full-strength Australia.
Australia captain Aaron Finch and David Warner started the run chase positively, scoring at six runs an over until Finch played on to Richard Ngarava for 15, with the score on 43, continuing his recent run of poor form.
Warner was joined by Steve Smith and the pair cruised to 78-1 when Warner was dropped at backward point off Sikandar Raza.
The left-hander rode his luck and raced to 57 before being bowled by Raza, tro leave Australia 108-2 in the 23rd over.
Despite a stutter as Alex Carey, Marcus Stoinis and Mitchell Marsh fell to Zimbabwe’s spinners Raza (1-45) and Ryan Burl (3-60), the steady Smith and bludgeoning Maxwell saw their side home without further alarm.
Smith accumulated 48 not out off 80 balls while Maxwell clubbed 32 off nine deliveries faced with three fours and three sixes — two coming from the last two balls — to race to the target.
Finch said it has been difficult playing against unfamiliar opponents, with Zimbawe playing their first series in Australia since 2004. 
“You do your due diligence beforehand and watch a lot of footage, and when you get to the ground in the morning you watch a few actions to try and get a feel of what you might be facing in the middle,” he said. 
“I thought we did that really well and I thought our bowlers executed exceptionally well.” 
Zimbabwe scored steadily in their innings but only opener Tadiwanashe Marumani, who scored 45, and Wessly Madhevere, with 72, were able to get on top of the Australia attack.
Leg-spinner Adam Zampa caused the early damage, taking three of the first five wickets to fall as Zimbabwe reached 185-5.
The visitors would have been hoping to reach at least 240 to set a challenging target, but the tail had no answer to the pace of the towering Green as they lost their last six wickets for 15 runs to be all out in the 48th over. 
“I just got a bit lucky at the end there, I was just at the right place at the right time,” Green said. 
“Trying to bowl back of a length on a wicket that was kind of going up and down I didn’t really have to change what I was doing too much.”
Zimbabwe captain Regis Chakabva conceded that his side’s batting was below par.
“I thought that the wicket was a little bit tricky early on and I thought the boys did well to soak up the pressure, but we just didn’t have enough runs on the board,” he said.

3,"Kane fires Spurs, West Ham win piles pressure on Gerrard",Aston Villa boss Steven Gerrard is under intense pressure after a 1-0 defeat against West Ham United.,"LONDON: Harry Kane’s double earned a 2-0 win at Nottingham Forest that lifted Tottenham Hotspur to third in the Premier League, while Aston Villa boss Steven Gerrard is under intense pressure after a 1-0 defeat against West Ham United on Sunday.
Antonio Conte’s side have made an encouraging start to the campaign. Kane ensured they maintained that momentum at the City Ground.
The England captain put Tottenham ahead with a clinical finish after collecting Dejan Kulusevski’s pass just outside the Forest area in the fifth minute.
It was Kane’s 200th league goal, including his Tottenham career and loan spells at Millwall, Leicester and Leyton Orient.
Kane wasted a chance to increase Tottenham’s lead 11 minutes after half-time when Steve Cook handled Ivan Perisic’s cross.
Dean Henderson saved Kane’s penalty as he missed from the spot in the league for the first time since 2018.
Kane made amends with his fourth goal this season in the 81st minute.
Richarlison won the ball back and crossed for the striker to head into the empty net.
With three wins from four games, Tottenham are level on points with second placed Manchester City and two points behind leaders Arsenal as the two north London rivals set the early pace.
West Ham arrived at Villa Park bottom of the table after losing their first three games without scoring.
Pablo Fornals’ goal late in the second half ended West Ham’s wait to get off the mark as they climbed out of the relegation zone.
Fornals’ shot deflected off Villa defender Ezri Konsa and looped over keeper Emiliano Martinez to break the deadlock with 15 minutes left.
The Hammers, beaten by Manchester City, Nottingham Forest and Brighton, are now level on points with Villa, who have lost three of their first four matches.
Villa’s latest setback will only add to the scrutiny on Gerrard amid talk of dressing room unrest with the former Liverpool and England midfielder.
A midweek League Cup second round win at third-tier Bolton had given Gerrard a little breathing space.
But Villa fans are growing increasingly restless with Gerrard, who has struggled to make a sustained impact since leaving Rangers to succeed Dean Smith last season.
“I have got two ears and I hear a lot of things. I heard the fans’ frustration and last time I checked my ears were still working so, yeah, I pick up on everything,” Gerrard said.
“I’ve been in the game long enough. If you lose three games out of four it is not the start the supporters wanted and certainly not the start that I wanted, so of course I understand.
“We certainly share our supporters’ frustration and there is no one more frustrated than me.”
With matches against Premier League leaders Arsenal and champions Manchester City looming as their next two fixtures, Villa could be deeper in trouble by early September.
“The only thing we can do now is act and try to put it right. I am all in to make that happen and my staff are but it has to come from within the players as well,” Gerrard said.
West Ham boss David Moyes added:  “The performance was really in truth not the most important thing today, the result was.” At Molineux, Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves gave his side the lead seven minutes before half-time when he drilled a superb strike into the bottom corner from 25 yards.
But Allan Saint-Maximin matched Neves’ goal as he blasted a brilliant volleyed equaliser from 20 yards in stoppage-time to rescue a 1-1 draw.
Newcastle are up to seventh after an unbeaten start which has extended to four matches, a sequence that includes three successive draws.
Second-bottom Wolves remain without a win in the league after two draws and two losses.
ARSENAL MAINTAIN PERFECT START
Arsenal preserved the Premier League’s last remaining 100 per  cent record as they came from a goal down to beat Fulham 2-1 thanks to a  late winner by Gabriel Jesus at The Emirates Stadium on Saturday that kept  the Gunners top of the table.
The home side enjoyed overwhelming  possession but a dreadful mistake by Gabriel allowed Aleksandar Mitrovic  to give previously unbeaten Fulham a 56th-minute lead.
It was  Mitrovic’s 100th goal for Fulham but Arsenal were behind for only eight  minutes as captain Martin Odegaard’s deflected effort levelled it up.
Mitrovic  was close to putting Fulham back in front with a diving header but  Arsenal’s pressure finally told as a fumble by their former goalkeeper  Bernd Leno from a corner allowed Gabriel to make ammends with a simple  tap-in.
Arsenal were not at their best against well-drilled  Fulham, who should have equalised through Nathaniel Chalobah late on,  but they stay in first place with 12 points from four games, two more  than champions Manchester City and Brighton & Hove Albion.

4,US Open readies for Serena Williams retirement party,Serena signalled her intention to retire in a Vogue article in early August.,"NEW YORK: Serena Williams will take her final bow on tennis’s biggest stage at Flushing Meadows but the US Open is unlikely to provide a fairytale finish for one of sport’s most fascinating figures.
Tennis has been preparing for this moment for a while, watching as Serena transitioned from champion, to mother, wife, entrepreneur and finally tennis part-timer but in some ways her decision seemed to catch everyone off guard. Even Serena herself.
Serena signalled her intention to retire in a Vogue article in early August, saying she was “evolving away from tennis” but never confirming the US Open as her final event.
The tennis world, however, is preparing a massive retirement party at Flushing Meadows.
Certainly there could be no more fitting place to bring the curtain down on one of tennis’s great careers in a city that has been in her corner from the very beginning, fuelling runs to six US Open crowns.
It is the place where Serena won the first of 23 singles Grand Slam titles in 1999 and if Hollywood were writing the script, it would also be where she would win her last, an elusive 24th major that would pull her level with Margaret Court at the top of the all-time list.
But even the most hardcore Serena supporters will find it difficult to believe the 40-year-old can conjure up that kind of magic.
Serena’s recent results indicate the pessimism is well-founded. In her first match after her retirement announcement, Serena lost 6-2, 6-4 to Belinda Bencic in Toronto.
In her next outing, in Cincinnati, she was routed 6-4, 6-0 by reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu, the British teenager who was born three years after Serena’s first Grand Slam victory.
With Serena not expected to mount a sustained challenge, all eyes will be on Poland’s world number one Iga Swiatek in the women’s draw.
The 21-year-old was the form player in women’s tennis earlier this year, reeling off victories at the Qatar Open, Indian Wells and Miami Open before claiming wins on clay in Stuttgart and Rome en route to her second Slam singles title at the French Open.
However, Swiatek has struggled to recapture that dominance during the North American hardcourt season, making early exits at both the Cincinnati Masters and Canadian Open.
One player to benefit from the Serena hysteria will be Raducanu, who captivated tennis fans last year with her Cinderella run from qualifier to Grand Slam champion.
Without a title since her US Open victory, the 19-year-old has been under tremendous scrutiny and she will no doubt be happy for Serena to hog all the limelight as she eases into her title defence.
Twice US Open champion Naomi Osaka cannot be overlooked but has struggled for fitness after sustaining an Achilles injury at Wimbledon and has also not found any success on the hard courts.
The form player ahead of the year’s final Grand Slam is big-hitting Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia, who emerged from the shadows in spectacular style by becoming the first qualifier to win a WTA 1000 event. She eliminated three top 10 opponents en route to capturing the Cincinnati Open.
NADAL EYES 23RD MAJOR
In the men’s draw, Rafael Nadal targets a fifth US Open and 23rd Grand Slam title with his path to the title no longer blocked by Novak Djokovic, whose refusal to get vaccinated has ruled him out of a second major this year.
Nineteen years after making his debut, the 36-year-old Nadal drags his injury-prone body into a tournament he won in 2010, 2013, 2017 and 2019, the year of his last appearance.
The Spaniard has had to sit out the US Open four times in his career and there are once again fresh doubts over his physical ability to survive a gruelling two weeks at Flushing Meadows.
Since an abdomen injury forced him to hand Nick Kyrgios a walkover into the Wimbledon final, Nadal has played just once — a first-up loss to Borna Coric in Cincinnati — but his return is a big boost to the men’s draw which has been depleted by the absence of Djokovic and Alexander Zverev.
Nadal admitted on Friday that he had been protecting his injury in Cincinnati but had been able to practice with intensity in the build-up to the US Open.
I take it very easy in the Cincinnati, too, in the practices. The match, I try my best without putting all the effort there on the serve,” Nadal said. I hope to be ready for the action. That’s the only thing that I can say. Taking care with the serve, being honest. But in general terms, yes, I am practicing at high level of intensity.”
Dominic Thiem, the men’s 2020 champion, will also return to Flushing Meadows after his absence last year due to injury.
Without a clear favourite in the men’s draw, Nadal’s biggest threat is expected to come from reigning champion and world number one Daniil Medvedev.
The Russian went down in five sets in the 2019 final to Nadal and has also finished runner-up on the hardcourts of the Australian Open in the last two editions.
World number two and 2020 runner-up Zverev misses out through injury while fourth-ranked Carlos Alcaraz, a quarter-finalist in 2021, looks to convert potential into a maiden Slam triumph at 19.
I feel stronger and more prepared than the last year,” Alcaraz said.“I have played long matches, tough matches this year against the top players. I think I’m more ready in this tournament than last year.”
Apart from Felix Auger-Aliassime, a semi-finalist last year, the rest of the current top 10 have endured a bittersweet relationship with New York.
Stefanos Tsitsipas, Casper Ruud, Cameron Norrie and Hubert Hurkacz have all yet to make the second week.

5,Dominant Verstappen goes from 14th to first in Belgium,The win is Verstappen's ninth from 14 races so far this season.,"SPA FRANCORCHAMPS: Red Bull’s Max Verstappen went from 14th to first to take a dominant one-two win in Sundays Belgian Grand Prix and accelerate his run towards a second Formula One title.
The Dutch driver took the chequered flag 17.8 seconds ahead of his Mexican team-mate Sergio Perez, with Spaniard Carlos Sainz a distant third in his Ferrari after starting on pole position.
“Max was on another planet today, he was flying, he was untouchable,” said Perez.
The win was Verstappen's ninth from 14 races so far this season and put him a massive 93 points clear of Perez, who moves into second place overall behind his team-mate with eight rounds remaining.
Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, who started one place behind Verstappen in 15th after collecting similar engine and gearbox-related grid drops, finished fifth on the road but was demoted to sixth after a penalty for speeding in the pitlane.
The Monegasque is now third overall, 98 points behind Verstappen who also took a bonus point for the fastest lap.
Verstappen’s home Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort follows next weekend.
“The car was a rocket ship all weekend,” he said after his second successive win at Spa, although last year’s victory was after just three laps splashing through the rain behind the safety car.
Verstappen had been comfortably quickest in Saturday’s qualifying but grid penalties meant Sainz inherited pole position. 
The Spaniard kept the lead at the start, with Perez slow in getting away alongside as Alpines Fernando Alonso and Mercedes Lewis Hamilton slotted into second and third.
The former McLaren team-mates then made contact as seven-times world champion Hamilton tried to overtake around the outsides into the Les Combes chicane.
Hamilton, who drew a rebuke from Alonso, accepted responsibility for the collision and retired due to damage from the incident.
Further behind, Valtteri Bottas beached his Alfa Romeo in the gravel while trying to avoid the spinning Williams of Nicholas Latifi in an incident that brought out the safety car.
Verstappen, meanwhile, rocketed off the line and was 10th shortly after the start.
He was eighth by the second lap when the safety car came out and swept past Perez to lead after 12 of 44 laps.
George Russell was fourth for Mercedes, with Alonso fifth.
Esteban Ocon took seventh for Alpine, ahead of Aston Martin’s Sebastian Vettel and AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly with Alex Albon securing the final point for Williams in a race he ranked as one of his toughest.

6,Stokes sets up England’s series-levelling win over South Africa,MANCHESTER: Eng­land captain Ben Stokes struck twice shortly after tea to pave the way for his side’s...,"MANCHESTER: Eng­land captain Ben Stokes struck twice shortly after tea to pave the way for his side’s series-levelling innings and 85-run win over South Africa inside three days in the second Test at Old Trafford on Saturday.
After all-rounder Stokes had removed well-set batsmen Rassie van der Dussen and Keegan Petersen, the Proteas collapsed against the new ball, losing five wickets for seven runs in 31 balls against the new ball as they slumped to 179 all out.
England’s margin of victory was even greater than South Africa’s innings and 12-run success at Lord’s in the first Test of this three-match series.
Stokes starred with both bat and ball during a player of the match display in Manchester, having made 103 — his first century since succeeding Joe Root as permanent Test skipper — in England’s 415-9 declared, an innings that also featured wicketkeeper Ben Foakes’s Test-best 113 not out.
Petersen and Van der Dussen, battling a finger injury that has now ruled him out of next month’s deciding third Test at the Oval, had batted through Saturday’s second session to take World Test Championship leaders South Africa to 141-3 at tea.
But Stokes, who has now won five of his six Tests as full-time captain, ended their 43-over stand while pushing himself hard in a 14-over spell either side of tea as he removed Van der Dussen and Petersen for their interval scores of 41 and 42 respectively.
“It has been incredible,” said Stokes, who in addition to his century had match figures of 4-47, at the presentation ceremony. “To come back from last week’s disappointment at Lord’s and put in the performance we have this week, it gives us a lot of confidence back and set things up nicely for the last game at the Oval.”
Just three balls after tea, Van der Dussen pushed well outside off-stump to a Stokes delivery he might otherwise have left and was caught behind to end a stand of 87 with Petersen.
But there was little Petersen could do other than glove a simple catch to Foakes when Stokes, still operating with the old ball, got a delivery to rear off a length and cut away to end a gutsy 159-ball innings that featured just one four.
South Africa were now 151-5, with all of their specialist batsmen dismissed.
Stokes then gave the new ball to 40-year-old England great James Anderson and recalled seamer Ollie Robinson.
Robinson, in his first Test in seven months, took 4-43 and Anderson 3-30.
Anderson’s haul, taken from the end named after him at his Lancashire home ground, saw him surpass Australia’s Glenn McGrath as international cricket’s most prolific fast bowler across all formats, taking his combined tally to an astounding 951.
“It’s been a hard few days — we had to work really hard on that pitch,” Anderson told the BBC. “Every time I play cricket it could be the last so I just enjoy the experience. We have had a shift in mindsight, I could retire tomorrow and be delighted but I’m not!
“Ollie Robinson bowled brilliantly. He could have had more wickets in the first innings and he got better and better.”
Proteas captain Dean Elgar may well rue winning the toss and electing to bat first under overcast skies on day one, which now looks a poor decision.
Van der Dussen will be replaced in the squad by all-rounder Wiaan Mulder, which might earn a reprieve for batsman Aiden Markram, who failed again on Saturday with a score of six and is on a poor run of form.
“England were far better than us through the three days,” Elgar said. “We had a plan coming here, but first innings runs are important in Test cricket. We have a lot of learnings and quite a few days before the next Test, so we will go back to the drawing board.
“England were far better than us to the last three days so I have to give it to them. Cricket is such a funny thing. I think England batted well. The game is small margins at the moment and we’re playing against a side that doesn’t give you much.”

BERLIN: Bayern Munich forward Leroy Sane scored a late equaliser to help the German Bundesliga champions claim a 1-1 draw at home against Borussia Moencheng­ladbach and maintain their unbeaten start to the campaign after it came under serious threat on Saturday.
Sane curled in his effort into the bottom corner in the 83rd minute as Bayern were rewarded for their relentless pursuit of a leveller after squandering several chances and being kept at bay by the impressive Yann Sommer in the Gladbach goal.
Earlier, Moenchengladbach went ahead in the 43rd minute when striker Marcus Thuram slid the ball past goalkeeper Manuel Neuer for his sixth goal in all competitions but Bayern had themselves to blame with Dayot Upamecano failing to deal with a long ball.
Bayern were a constant threat before the opener and Sane wasted two chances before new signing Sadio Mane had two goals chalked off for offside after he twice tapped in from close range, much to the frustration of the home fans.
Julian Nagelsmann’s side came into the clash on the back of a 7-0 hammering of VfL Bochum which made it three wins in their opening three games of the campaign but they struggled at times to find a way past Gladbach before Sane struck.
“We had 35 shots on goal, that’s not a bad number,” said Nagelsmann.  “I’m annoyed because we played well... the only thing I can blame my team for is not converting our chances.”
“Despite the result, I actually think this was our best game so far this season.”  Sommer produced a brilliant double block to keep a Mane shot out following a quick counter following the restart and produced a string of saves to deny Sane, Benjamin Pavard, Thomas Mueller, and Serge Gnabry to earn his team a point.
The Swiss International set a new single-game Bundesliga record with 19 saves, bettering Alexander Schwolow’s previous mark of 14 for Hertha Berlin against the same opposition in January this year.
“It takes a lot for something like this to happen. As a goalkeeper, you need to have a good day,” said Sommer.  “Bayern are really in an unbelievable form and put on a lot of pressure.”
MODESTE SCORES FOR DORTMUND
French  striker Anthony Modeste thanked Dortmund manager Edin Terzic after his  first-half goal gave his side a narrow 1-0 win away at Hertha Berlin on  Saturday. 
Modeste headed in a cross from Salih Ozcan, who also arrived from  Cologne this summer, in the 32nd minute to put Dortmund 1-0 up. 
Modeste, who is known for his theatrical celebrations which often  involve dancing and even props, ran emotionally to Terzic and embraced  him after scoring. 
“I’m so glad to score my first goal. It took its time, but it was  really important.”
“I’ve copped so much (since arriving at Dortmund),  but the manager was always there for me.” Elsewhere, RB Leipzig gained  their first Bundestags win of the season with a 2-0 home victory over  Wolfsburg. 
Leipzig’s French forward Christopher Nkunku converted a penalty after five minutes to open the scoring. 
Former Chelsea striker Timo Werner, who started from the bench after  an infection, set up Nkunku’s second in the 90th minute to relieve some  pressure from Leipzig coach Domenico Tedesco. 
Bayer Leverkusen picked up their first points of the season with a 3-0 win away at Mainz. 
Leverkusen, who had scored just one goal in three Bundesliga games  and had already been eliminated from the German Cup, scored three  first-half goals, including a brace for Dutch wing back Jeremie  Frimpong. 
Hoffenheim won their third game of the season with a hard-fought 1-0  home victory over Augsburg, thanks to a first-half goal from Dennis  Geiger.

Geo Baba, who created quite a stir by upsetting the odds in his last outing, is pitted alongside eight other aspirants in the cup race under combined scale order II, III, IV and V to be run over four furlongs. It is also the day’s feature event.
The Monsoon Cup features prominently in a four-race card that has been drawn for the day.
Mare Sweet Golden and dark bay horse Robert look smart to occupy the next two places on board respectively.
The staging of Monsoon Cup second time in two months has raised quite a few eyebrows which reflects mismanagement.
Bay horse Daffodles Wave seems to be the best bet in the fourth and supporting race under combined scale order V and VI.
Daffodles Wave had returned with flying colours in his last outing by getting the better of Princess of Hope by five-and-a-half lengths.
He is expected to be followed by mares Stella and Princess of Hope respectively. The race will go over four furlongs.
Gelding Ayyan Prince looks poised to make amends by winning the opening race under lowest scale order VIII to be contested over four furlongs.
Dark bay horse The Company (formerly Black Apple) and bay horse Money Shower should follow in the footsteps of Ayyan Prince among a field of nine horses.
The second race under scale order VI and VII appears to be a two-horse race between chestnut horse Faster Than You and bay horse Deewana and whosoever is on job should win hands down. Both have won their last races.
They are likely to be chased by bay horse Denzo among eight contestants.

9,"Milan brush aside Bologna, Abraham snatches point on Dybala’s Juve return",MILAN: AC Milan continued their unbeaten start to their Serie A title defence with a 2-0 win over Bologna on ...,"MILAN: AC Milan continued their unbeaten start to their Serie A title defence with a 2-0 win over Bologna on Saturday as Tammy Abraham earned Roma a 1-1 draw at Juventus on Paulo Dybala’s return to his old stomping ground.
Champions Milan eased to a routine win at the San Siro with goals either side of half-time from Rafael Leao and Olivier Giroud to go top on goal difference.
Stefano Pioli’s side took full advantage of Inter Milan’s lose at Lazio on Friday night to move a point above their local rivals.
“We’re more concentrated and have more self-belief than in the past, we played with a real commitment to attacking and defending as a unit,” Pioli told Sky Sport Italia.
“I am happy with our performance but I know we can still get better.” Milan are one of four teams locked on seven points, with Roma, Lazio and Torino — 2-1 winners over promoted Cremonese.
Leao gave the hosts the lead in front of over 60,000 fans with his first goal of the season, the Portugal winger fortunate to see his duffed shot squirm past Lukasz Skorupski in the 21st minute after good play by debutant Charles De Ketelaere.
The 23-year-old Leao, who has been linked with Chelsea, should have added to Milan’s lead before the break, missing a one-on-one with Skorupski in first half stoppage time.
However, he set up Giroud’s opening strike of the campaign in the 58th minute with a perfectly clipped pass which the France International guided home with a beautifully-placed volleyed finish.
Nicola Sansone smashed the upright 10 minutes later for Bologna who are hovering above the drop zone with a single point.
Andrea Pinamonti scored his first goal for Sassuolo after moving from Inter, rolling home following a defensive mix-up to give his new team a 2-2 draw at Spezia.
Jose Mourinho said he was  “ashamed” of his Roma players’ performances before they fought back to draw through Abraham’s first goal of the season.
England International Abraham headed home from Dybala’s knock-down in the 69th minute at the Allianz Stadium to maintain Roma’s unbeaten record.
Mourinho used the vulgar Italian expression  “culo” to describe their good fortune at being only a goal down at the break after being given a lesson by Juve.
Roma escaped Turin with a point despite being second best for long periods.
Dusan Vlahovic put Juve ahead with a stunning free-kick after barely a minute.
“I told my players at half-time that I was ashamed of them... We can’t come here and play like this,” he said.
“We did absolutely nothing, it was pure luck. It was a very different team in the second half.” Massimiliano Allegri’s side stay unbeaten on five points but will be disappointed to not have taken all three on Saturday.
The good result at a place Roma have an awful record also masks a poor display from Dybala, who appeared overwhelmed on his first appearance at Juve since leaving as a free agent in the summer.
The Argentina forward won five Serie A titles and four Italian Cups in seven years with the Turin giants and was warmly applauded by home supporters before the match.
However there were some boos and whistles from the stands when he was eventually substituted with 12 minutes remaining having helped deny his old team the win.

10,French police open investigation into Pogba claims of extortion,ROME: French police have opened an investigation into World Cup winner Paul Pogba’s claims he is being threatened...,"ROME: French police have opened an investigation into World Cup winner Paul Pogba’s claims he is being threatened and targeted for extortion by gangsters, a source close to the case told AFP on Sunday.
Pogba’s allegations came after his brother Mathias published a bizarre video online — in four languages (French, Italian, English and Spanish) — promising  “great revelations” about the Juventus star.
A statement signed by his lawyers, his mother Yeo Moriba and current agent Rafaela Pimenta said that the videos published on Saturday night  “are unfortunately no surprise”.
“They are in addition to threats and extortion attempts by an organised gang against Paul Pogba,” read the statement. “The competent bodies in Italy and France were informed a month ago and there will be no further comments in relation to the ongoing investigation.” Mathias Pogba, 32, promised  “great revelations about (his) brother Paul Pogba and his agent Rafaela Pimenta”, who took over as head of the company of former agent Mino Raiola who died in April.
He said the  “whole world, as well as my brother’s fans, and even more so the French team and Juventus, my brother’s team-mates and his sponsors deserve to know certain things”.
Also a professional footballer, Mathias Pogba said people needed to know what he knew in order to judge whether his brother  “deserves his place in the French team and the honour of playing in the World Cup. If he deserves to be a starter at Juventus.”
“All this is likely to be explosive,” he concluded without adding any substance to his  “revelations”.
According to two sources close to the Pogba family contacted by AFP, large sums of money are being demanded from Paul Pogba if he wants to avoid the dissemination of the allegedly compromising videos.
Paul Pogba, who won the World Cup with France in 2018, returned to Juventus on a free transfer this summer after six years at Manchester United, and is currently sidelined with a knee injury.
The 29-year-old is expected to return to action next month.

TOKYO: Danish badminton ace Viktor Axelsen said he could still  “become a better player” after winning his second world title on Sunday, but brushed off comparisons with Chinese great Lin Dan.
Reigning Olympic champion Axelsen crushed Thailand’s Kunvalut Vitidsarn 21-5, 21-16 in Tokyo to add another world title to the one he claimed in 2017, cementing his place at the top of the sport.
The 28-year-old did not lose a single game at this week’s world championships and he believes he has the potential to improve further with  “a long road ahead” of him.
“I want to become as good as I possibly can,” said the world number one, who has lost only one singles match this year. “I try to take every day as it comes and try to get better and better every day. I still feel like I can become a better player and that’s my main goal.”
Axelsen will try to emulate Lin in winning back-to-back Olympic titles when the Paris Games get underway in 2024. Lin won two Olympic golds and five world titles during his storied career but Axelsen refused to be compared to a player he believes is badminton’s greatest of all time.
“For me, Lin Dan is the best player who has ever been — he’s the GOAT,” said Axelsen. “I just try to focus on myself and try to do as good as I possibly can, and I’m really proud about where I am right now.” 
In women’s singles, Japan’s Akane Yamaguchi retained her title in front of her home crowd with a 21-12, 10-21, 21-14 win over China’s Chen Yufei.
Top seed Yamaguchi had not dropped a single game on her way to the final but she had to dig deep to beat Olympic champion Chen after the momentum shifted in the second game.
“With the fans being here in the arena, the support they gave me really gave me strength,” said the 25-year-old Yamaguchi. “Maybe that was the reason I was able to stay very positive throughout the tournament.”
