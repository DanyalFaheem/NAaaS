Successive spells of torrential rains in Sindh have spelt disaster for the agriculture sector. The economic cost of the disaster would run into billions if the value chain is anything to go by. Among summer crops, cotton is the worst hit, bananas and mango orchards have been damaged and vegetables, particularly onion, have been washed away.
These rains are considered a repeat of 2011 when rains triggered similar flooding in lower Sindh after the 2010 super floods that destroyed seven to eight districts in upper Sindh owing to a breach in the Indus river’s dyke.
One or two pickings of cotton were carried out in the early sowing areas of Sindh. The downpour destroyed almost the entire crop in Sanghar, Naushahro Feroz, Khairpur, Nawabshah, Tando Allahyar, Mirpurkhas, Matiari and Tando Mohammad Khan. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) says 2.082 million acres of the cropped area have been damaged across Sindh.
“I believe 80 per cent of the cotton crop has been simply washed away and in terms of money, losses to the cotton crop will be no less than Rs70bn,” said Nadeem Shah, Sindh’s member of the Cotton Crop Assessment Committee and Pakistan Central Cotton Committee of the federal food security ministry. He is from the lower Sindh rain-hit Matiari district which has no drainage system to dispose of rainwater.

Earnings of cotton pickers, domestic edible oil production, and livestock feed are all casualties of the deluges, along with the textile industry

“Cotton plants are submerged under massive amounts of water and they are not likely to survive. Once the sun makes its presence felt, it will blacken the plant. In some areas cotton plants are already blackened,” he said.
A visit to the rain-hit lower Sindh districts reveals that rains that continued until August’s third week left the farming community and residents of urban centres high and dry. It forced the Sindh government to declare 23 districts to be calamity hit.
There seems to be no probability of water receding from fields quickly and easily as rainwater stagnates. Irrigation officials and growers are struggling to ensure drainage of rainwater by diverting it from one end to the other as part of ad-hoc arrangements for disposing of it through irrigation channels.
After a period of continuous decline in the cotton crop, it witnessed growth recently in Sindh, leading to the production of 3.5m bales in the 2021-22 season when compared to 1.8m bales in 2020-21. It was grown over 539,000ha against the sowing target of 640,000ha. Losses to the cash cotton crop mean economic losses to farm labour as well as cotton pickers. The pickers, mostly women, will lose an important source of seasonal earnings.
Some picking this season was done before the rains. Sindh agriculture department assesses close to 100pc losses to the remaining cotton crop. Delay in dewatering from farmlands will have serious implications for the sensitive cotton crop. Standing water blackens the crop. Those still having clean picking will be among the luckier ones. They would be getting Rs10,000 plus rate for 40kg.
Widespread damage to the cotton crop will certainly undermine the entire value chain. Seed in phutti will be lost besides the crop. The seed is a source of domestic edible production. Its waste (oilcake) is a source of livestock feed.
Cotton seed or benola is a vital source of edible production domestically. According to the former chairman of Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC), Dr Yusuf Zafar, cotton crop seeds provide 70pc of total domestic edible oil production.
“Only 30pc of Pakistan’s edible oil is achieved domestically and the rest is imported. Of domestic production, 70pc is achieved using cotton seeds. This is alarming as the food and edible oil import bill continues to rise,” contends Mr Zafar.
He said estimates showed that the recent damages, inclusive of losses to Balochistan’s organic cotton crop, indicate around 6-7m bales will have to be imported, costing $6-$7 billion.
Devastating rains have undermined the rural community’s economic well-being as well as inflicted mental agony and psychological trauma. Farmers will still be preparing to meet the challenges of the upcoming Rabi sowing season, provided the water recedes from fields. About 89,622 livestock has perished as per the PMDA situation report of Aug 24 in view of rains. Roughly 84,783 of 89,622 livestock has perished in the upper Sindh Kashmore district.
Herds of livestock are mostly managed by the peasantry, who have a 50-50 share in farmlands with the growers. The downpour has rendered this peasantry displaced. They have shifted to roadside improvised tents along with animals including cows, buffaloes, goats and sheep of their own.
Their villages, located on farmlands, have been inundated and their houses made of thatched straw have collapsed. Their livestock is now exposed to diseases. Carcasses of cattle were seen on the Miprukrhas-Jhuddo route which was badly hit by the overflowing canal.
About 310,039 acres in Sanghar — Sindh’s home of cotton production — followed by 247,659 acres in Shaheed Benazirabad and 247,607 acres in Naushahro Feroz districts were damaged. Khairpur district reported damages to agriculture of 214,626 acres, resulting in the loss of its date palm crop in July’s spell of monsoon rainfall.
Among veggies, the onion crop is lost. It was at bulb formation but has fallen prey to rains. Sindh makes up half of the total onion production in the country. The same goes for chilli. Its required acreage was not achieved due to water shortage, said a chilli grower Karamullah Saand from Mirpurkhas.
Irrigation authorities are struggling to cope with the situation triggered by recent rains. All off-taking calls, 14 in all, of Sindh’s three barrages remained closed due to the flood situation in the Indus river. Indus remained at high flood at Guddu and Sukkur barrages since Aug 23 till this piece was written on Friday. Up and downstream flows at the two barrages remained the same.
Farmlands were under water till Aug 27 in lower Sindh. If timely dewatering of farmland is not done it could undermine wheat sowing. The wheat crop is already facing issues. Sindh was not able to meet the procurement target of 1.4m tonnes this year. Sindh food officials were said to have taken away the 2021-22 crop from small- and medium-scale growers to meet the procurement target, leaving them without seeds to be used for cultivation this year. This would put them in quandary.

1,Nowhere to turn amidst devastation,"With the rich countries focused on the Ukraine war as they cope with recessionary pressures and donor fatigue, international help","With more than half of the country already underwater, Pakistan’s flood emergency continues.
Urban flooding generated by the unprecedented Monsoon rains — mostly in Sindh, Balochistan and parts of South Punjab — in the last several weeks is aptly described by climate change minister Sherry Rehman as the ‘climate-induced humanitarian disaster of epic proportions’. Over the last few days, the scope of coverage of this humanitarian disaster has also extended to other parts of the country like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa which had initially escaped the devastation caused by torrential rains and consequent flash floods.
According to a National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) flood alert issued last weekend, the River Indus was expected to flood to very high levels with the releases from Tarbela amid reports of exceptionally high flooding in the Kabul River at Noshehra, with calls to citizens to evacuate as soon as possible.
So far, the floods have killed close to 950 people, left millions homeless, perished around 800,000 livestock, destroyed livelihoods, as well as extensively damaged 4,100 kilometres of the road network, 149 bridges, power and telecom infrastructure, and still counting. Cotton and rice crops in Sindh are also badly hit, which will significantly shrink the national production.

With the rich countries focused on the Ukraine war as they cope with recessionary pressures and donor fatigue, international help will be little and slow to come

The government says the floods that have inundated most parts of Sindh and Balochistan as well as parts of South Punjab, Gilgit Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, were estimated to have affected at least 30 million people, or 15 per cent of Pakistan’s population, in ‘different ways’ by last Friday.
Farmers from Sindh are reporting massive destruction of their cotton and rice crops due to knee- to waist-high standing rainwater in some areas. That the water accumulated in large swathes of Sindh and Balochistan is unable to drain because of repeated heavy monsoon spells shows that damages will be massive.
The government says that the current deluge is more severe than the 2010 floods, which were the second deadliest in the country’s history with a death toll of 1,985 and infrastructure losses of more than $15 billion.
Islamabad has already sought international humanitarian assistance to help the affected population as rescue and relief operations are ramped up to minimise the loss of life. In response, the government has received commitments worth half a billion dollars from the World Bank, the World Food Programme (WFP) and others. With the rich countries focused on the Ukraine war as they cope with recessionary pressures — not to mention donor fatigue — international help will be little and slow to come.
The present floods, more devastating than those in 2010, could not have come at a worse time. The economy is facing one of the worst balance of payments crises and one of the world’s highest inflation rates in a highly polarised and tense political environment. This presents the Shehbaz Sharif government with a huge challenge.
Analysts are of the view that the 2010 deluge followed by less devastating but two major floods in the next two years didn’t derail the economy. GDP growth increased to 3.6pc from 2.6pc in 2010, with agriculture also posting positive growth as the drop in cotton and rice production was more than compensated by the increase in wheat, sugarcane and maize production. The current account, according to a note on floods by Ismail Iqbal Securities, saw a surplus of 0.1pc of GDP as exports and remittances soared. Led by food prices, inflation did inch up but only for a few months.
The full extent of the likely economic losses still isn’t known as the situation is continuously evolving, with river flooding adding to water in the system. It, however, is clear that the devastation being caused by the deluge is going to heap upon the economic woes of the country.
Unlike 2010, we may see the present floods leave deeper negative stress on the budget and macroeconomic fundamentals as funding and reconstruction efforts will be a challenge for the cash-strapped government at a time when it is required to cut spending to keep the deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on track.
The most immediate impact is being seen in food prices as inflationary pressures from floods are growing due to supply chain disruption. The crop and livestock loss would also lead to higher inflation in the coming months with the floods coinciding with high international commodity prices. Analysts are expecting inflation to surge in the band of 26-27pc over the next few months before coming down.
There would also be some pressure on the external account in the shape of higher cotton imports and lower rice exports unless it is fully or partially offset by foreign aid, higher remittances to support families and a reduction in the import bill due to further demand slowdown in the economy.
The damage to cotton and rice crops means the foreign exchange reserves could come under pressure on account of imports of raw materials for the textile industry (the 10pc decrease in cotton output means imports of $418m or so on, according to Ismail Iqbal Securities) and a potential dip in rice exports. Depending on how long it takes the land to dry, the wheat sowing could get delayed at the expense of a depressed harvest next year. Increased wheat imports will bring additional pressure on the current account.
Overall, the floods would further slow down the economy, hitting income from agriculture and corporate profits. The State Bank of Pakistan has also highlighted floods as a major downside risk to the economy and external sector along with elevated international commodity prices in its last monetary policy statement.
Given its weakened fiscal and external account position, the economic analysts are unanimous in their opinion that the scope of devastation from the floods will heavily increase Pakistan’s reliance on foreign loans and humanitarian assistance from the multilateral and bilateral agencies in the near to medium term, both for rehabilitation of the displaced populations and keeping afloat the struggling economy.
In 2010, Pakistan received $4.5bn in cumulative foreign flood-related assistance. The prospects of that much aid money flowing in its way this time around aren’t that bright despite the initial projections of much higher economic losses.

2,Inflation is a tough nut,The central bank believes that a gradual easing in inflation can be expected from October onwards.,"In August 2021, annual inflation in the US was 5.3 per cent. It rose gradually to hit a 40-year high of 9.1pc in June 2022 before slipping to 8.5pc in July. Similarly, the inflation rate in the UK began rising from 3.1pc in September last year and also hit a 40-year high of 10.1pc in July this year.
These two examples show how fast inflation has been rising for some time bringing under question the ability of monetary authorities to manage it. In Pakistan, annualised inflation rate took off from 8.4pc in August 2021 and reached a terrifying height of 24.9pc in July 2022. This happened despite the fact that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) increased its policy rate cumulatively by 800 basis points to 15pc in less than a year — between 21st September 2021 and 13th July 2022.
In its latest monetary policy meeting on 22nd August the central bank, however, decided to hold the interest rate at this level. The central bank believes that a gradual easing in inflation can be expected from October onwards.
Regardless of whether inflation has already peaked or would peak in August or September, its easing from October is only expected — not at all guaranteed. “This baseline outlook remains subject to uncertainty, with risks arising from the path of global commodity prices, the domestic fiscal policy stance, and the exchange rate,” according to the SBP. Add to it the risks arising out of growing political instability and floods in Sindh and Balochistan that will affect fiscal operations and you get a better idea of how inflation will likely move from October onwards.

While there is some expectation in official quarters that the rise in prices will ease in the coming months, the calculations are optimistic and contingent on factors beyond the government’s immediate control

During FY22 ended in June, Pakistan witnessed a whopping fiscal deficit of Rs5.26 trillion or 7.9pc of the recently rebased GDP against the initial target of Rs3.4tr or 5.1pc of the rebased GDP. The government missed the deficit target both due to the mobilisation of lesser-than-targeted net revenue and higher-than-targeted current expenses. Now, it is naïve to expect that in a year of floods and political instability the government will keep the FY23 deficit within the targeted limit of 4.9pc of GDP.
Revenue collections could be affected noticeably following the floods in Sindh and Balochistan that caused heavy losses to agriculture, livestock, wholesale and retail trade besides damaging houses, roads, railways and other infrastructure.
On the other hand, the federal and provincial governments will need lots of money for carrying out the rescue and rehabilitation work in the two provinces. The money to be spent under this head would obviously be in excess of the budgeted expenditures and would, thus, lead to expansion in the overall federal budget deficit. This means the government demand for bank borrowing would remain strong, crowding out the private sector. That is one thing the central bank will take into account in resetting its monetary policy in October.

It is naïve to expect that in a year of floods and political instability the government will keep the FY23 deficit within the targeted limit of 4.9pc of GDP

Floods in Sindh and Balochistan and the consequent damages caused to agriculture and livestock sectors are sure to push food inflation up and keep them high if not throughout this fiscal year — at least till December. Further pressure on food prices may come in the form of costlier food imports in case of higher food commodity prices or the rupee depreciation. This is another thing the SBP will watch carefully before revisiting its monetary policy.
Moving forward, the health of the external sector should improve with the expected inflow of about $1.2 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the approval of the IMF Board on August 29. That, together with some conditions still applied on imports of luxury items and linking of the opening of imports of letters of credit of fuel oil with the prior approval of the SBP, may help keep the current account deficit in check.
And, forex liquidity thus improved in the interbank market may enable the central bank to avoid any speculative attack on the rupee and the local currency may either make some modest gains or at least avoid a massive fall.
If things go well and reality meets the above anticipation, then that should help contain imported inflation and contribute a bit to the easing of headline inflation providing the central bank room for keeping its key policy rate intact.
The current account deficit fell to $1.21bn in July this year from $2.187bn in June, but it remained higher than the deficit of $851 million in July last year according to the balance of payments statement released recently. However, the contraction of the current account deficit in July compared with June is entirely due to the decline in imports and not at all because of growth in exports. (In fact, export earnings decline marginally).
This is a disturbing element. Restrictions on luxury imports are already being lifted gradually and the central bank has told domestic oil companies that the condition of prior approval for the opening of LCs is temporary. Depending upon how soon restrictions on imports of luxury items are removed and oil import LCs are allowed to be opened without prior approval of the central bank, import-led demand for foreign exchange is bound to grow in the coming months.
On the other hand, there is little hope that exports would grow fast enough to make a significant impact on the current account primarily due to structural weaknesses and the high cost of energy and capital. So, the current account deficit can be expected to rise on a year-on-year basis in the near future, more so because we are also witnessing a declining trend in home remittances.

3,Bracing for a second wave of the lumpy skin disease,The problem will multiply when the virus mutates in the local host and enhances its immunity.,"


 
Cattle farming is an important activity for an agrarian economy like Pakistan where the livestock sector contributed approximately 61.9 per cent to the value-added agriculture sector and 14pc to the national GDP during 2021-22.
More than eight million rural families engaged in livestock production in the country are deriving around 35-40pc of their income from this sector. Gross value addition of the sector has increased by 3.26pc in a year — from Rs5.269 trillion in 2020-21 to Rs5.441tr in 2021-22 as per the latest Economic Survey of Pakistan.
Realising the importance of the sector the federal government in the last budget intended to develop export meat processing zones, disease-free zones (foot and mouth disease, Peste des Petitis ruminants, highly pathogenic avian influenza), facilitate the setting up of modern slaughterhouses and offer it financial sector support.
The livestock sector had already been facing constraints, including high feed and energy prices, a lack of credit and training facilities, poor advisory, breeding and veterinary services, as well as exploitation by the middle man, etc, when it was hit hard by the Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) in large animals devastating many small farmers in Sindh, Punjab and elsewhere.

The problem will multiply when the virus mutates in the local host and enhances its immunity against the drugs and vaccinations so far used against it

Neither the federal nor the provincial governments made any financial allocations in their respective budgets for controlling the LSD, which had been first reported in the Jamshoro district of Sindh last November. The governments had ample time to make the financial and administrative arrangements for effectively overcoming this looming threat in their respective budgets presented in June.
First observed in 1929 in Zambia, the LSD is a viral infection that causes fever and nodules on the skin and mucous membranes of animals. The non-zoonotic disease is transmitted by bloodsucking insects like ticks and mosquitoes and can also prove fatal.
Dr Abdur Rehman, director-general (research) of the Punjab livestock department, says that the LSD was non-existent in the subcontinent and was first observed in India in 2019.
He says they had been alerted when the first case was reported in November in Sindh but its prevalence could be verified only by March after lengthy microbiological testing processes.
As sheep-pox and goat-pox have been there for decades, the department was producing vaccines for the two diseases and around 30,000 of them were immediately given to Sindh with encouraging results.
However, the use of the sheep-pox and goat-pox vaccines has generated controversy among animal health authorities and the farming community. Dr Rehman claims that the step had not been taken on a hit and trial basis; rather both the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) recommend particularly the use of the goat-pox vaccine for large animals in emergency cases.
However, farmers say that the officials are delaying the import of the appropriate (Heterologous) vaccine and thus causing irreparable loss to the farming community and the country. “The FAO and WOAH recommendations are only for emergency use purposes, while we have raised an alarm much before the disease hit Punjab farms,” says Dairy and Cattle Farmers Association leader Shahbaz Rasool.
“The LSD has destroyed the sector in Punjab, which contributes 70pc to the national livestock, particularly hitting small farmers as not a single cattle farm has been spared by the disease. We had highlighted the problem in February in direct meetings with Punjab authorities as well as through news conferences but the authorities concerned did little to save the sector.”
Both sides also clash on the mortality ratio and the mechanisms adopted to calculate the losses.
Dr Suhail Manzoor, director of the Animal Disease Diagnostic & Reporting Centre, says they have so far recorded only 29,620 cases of LSD since the outbreak of the disease with just 765 deaths in Punjab.Explaining the methodology adopted to collect the data, Dr Rehman says that with the emergence of the first case, a contingency plan was devised and a core team was formed with an information technology system to document the prevalence of the disease and take appropriate measures accordingly.
“As we need traceability up till farmer level, a mobile phone user-friendly application was launched in which the farmer was required to upload his and the affected animal’s pictures, whereas a parallel information collection mechanism was also activated to cross-check the situation through the department’s union council level infrastructure.” The data is being daily updated and its analysis suggests that the prevalence of the LSD is on the decline after hitting its peak, he adds.
Expecting an illiterate, or poorly literate, resource-less farmer to use an app for getting his problem documented could only be an imaginary plan, objects Mr Rasool. “In the absence of any promise of compensating for the financial loss, one cannot expect that a resource-constraint farmer will be doing anything to upload pictures of his ailing cattle.
“He will rather conceal the prevalence of the disease at his farm so that his customers may not stop purchasing milk from him to avert catching the LSD as has been seen in Karachi, where beef and milk sales plummeted after the outbreak. And this led to under-reporting of the otherwise much higher ratio of casualties.”
Though the livestock authorities claim that the LSD ratio is on the decline, partially because of their efforts and partially because of nature’s help, there is no time to take a sigh of relief. Rather, the worst is feared when the virus, after its development in the local host (animal), will recur in the second wave.
“The problem will multiply when the virus mutates in the local host and enhances its immunity against the drugs and vaccinations so far used against it,” says Dr Sajjad Hussain, director of the Veterinary Research Institute, Lahore. “The animals not covered during the ongoing vaccination drive and the calves that are going to be born in the near future will be at more risk of the feared new strain of the virus.”
He says that with the available sheep-pox and goat-pox vaccines, they have vaccinated around 15pc of the cattle population only in the province and are in the process of importing 6m doses of (heterologous) vaccines to improve the vaccination coverage. Besides, he says, his institute is working round the clock and seven days a week to prepare local heterologous vaccines by December this year to counter the onslaught of the new strain(s).

6,The controversial disbandment,The impression of the CPEC slowdown under former prime minister Imran Khan’s government is hard to contest.,"The Sharif government in the third week of the current month decided in principle to scrap the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Authority terming it ‘redundant’ and ‘obstructive’.
It has decided to revert to the earlier arrangement of routing CPEC projects through the planning ministry to line ministries for execution for revitalising the country’s biggest, most prestigious bilateral economic development project.
The implementation of the decision (Repealing CPEC Authority Act), however, was made conditional to Chinese consent. Talking to this scribe over the phone, Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Reforms Ehsan Iqbal said that he had multiple interactions with Chinese officials since the cabinet decision and they seemed perfectly indifferent over structural settings on Pakistan’s side as long contractual commitments are honoured and the work on CPEC projects is accelerated.
“Chinese friends say they are happy to see our actions and the new momentum. They are not interested in details of how we implement CPEC. In their opinion that’s Pakistan’s internal issue,” he responded in writing.

The debate over the disbanding of the CPEC Authority largely depends on which side of the political fence one is sitting on

“We are going back to the 2013-18 model of CPEC implementation which brought in investments worth $29 billion. Since the authority was created, not a single dollar worth of new investment has flowed in. Only projects in the pipeline continue but at a slower than anticipated speed. The CPEC Authority was a non-starter and proved to be a failure,” he added.
Rubbishing the perception of second thoughts in the government over CPEC and its worth, he vowed to silence elements trying to peddle a false narrative by delivering on the CPEC promise.
“Disbanding the CPEC Authority is pro-CPEC because the authority blocked progress by adding a new bureaucratic layer. All the good work on the CPEC happened before the authority was created. All it did was to stall the CPEC,” he wrote.
A high-placed source, who sat in the Senate Committee on CPEC and saw developments over the past decade from close quarters, took strong exception. Without getting into the details of the motivations for the creation of the CPEC Authority in 2019, he considered its scrapping ill-timed, ill-advised and based on weak logic.
“How can a one-stop shop that resolves all issues pertaining to CPEC projects be a bad idea, especially in the second phase where a higher robust engagement of Chinese private companies in multiple sectors is expected?” he asked. “Can lethargic ministries and sub-federating units with their own set of problems be assumed to be more effective in dealing with investors?” he mocked.
“Before anything else it’s personal. Honestly, it’s sad to see the nation’s interests compromised to service the egos of political pigmies. How else can you explain channelising energy in cancelling instead of building on at the current critical juncture?” he said narrating instances of PML-N’s opposition at every step of the way in the National Assembly and the Senate.
Another senior source familiar with CPEC affairs shared his insight. “Initially even PTI legislators were reluctant to support CPEC Authority as it was seen as a move by the deeper establishment to assume the charge of the flagship Chinese One Belt One Road initiative. The resistance dissolved as the Chinese threw their weight behind such a platform.
The impression of the CPEC slowdown under former prime minister Imran Khan’s government is hard to contest. Some experts attributed it more to the pandemic that paralysed the world. Others did blame the last government that took too much time to digest the value and the politics surrounding CPEC after assuming power.
“Some faint light started flickering on the CPEC playboard after the induction of a top business executive as a special assistant to the prime minister in 2021. A nice pitchbook to lure private Chinese investors was developed and contact channels were opened to mend the ties. Just when things finally started looking up the regime change happened and things came to nought once again,” an informed source active in CPEC circles observed.
“Ask the Chinese if you don’t trust us. Check the Chinese media which made its displeasure public even during Imran Khan’s tenure. They were upset over the statements of government ministers casting aspersions on the transparency of CPEC deals. They were uncomfortable with changes in the taxation regime, frustrated over delays in payments to power producers and opening of a revolving account and resented any further talks on sealed deals,” a senior officer in the Ministry of Planning said discussing the issue.
“The authority was established to locate new drivers of growth and unlock the potential of value chains through regional and global connectivity. The efforts of the authority mobilised $1.5bn investment by medium-sized Chinese companies in Pakistan collectively. It got the cabinet approval of compliance in place of the approval regime for Chinese investors who were required to acquire 37 no-objection certificates for investment in Pakistan.
“A research publication of the authority projected competitive and comparative edge in seven key sectors including IT, textiles, footwear, agriculture, auto, pharma and furniture. It engaged 19 top Chinese firms with a potential collective investment of whooping $30bn in Pakistan,” says a supporter of the CPEC Authority defending its performance.
Earlier Ehsan Iqbal reminded us that Special Economic Zones were supposed to be ready by 2020 and held former prime minister Khan’s government for the neglect and lack of progress.

7,Virtual clashes of India vs Pakistan,"While in some ways, esports trends run parallel in both countries, Pakistan outranks India in terms of prize money.","The glow of Pakistan’s cricketing triumph over India, be it the Championship trophy or the World Cup, does not fade away with time. But the clashes between the age-old rivals are not limited to the cricket field, extending into the virtual world.
Esports are multiplayer video games played competitively by professional gamers and watched by spectators. It’s a $1 billion-plus market globally, growing at a double-digit compound growth rate annually.
It comes under the wider auspices of video gaming, an industry that is projected to reach $227 million by 2026 in Pakistan, according to Singapore-based Intenta Digital. To put it in context, this is roughly the value of exports generated by the famed Sialkot sports goods.
“Esports is close linked to gaming. Pakistan is amongst the highest countries ranking in terms of league sports. There are people like Ash who come from humble backgrounds but have made their mark internationally,” says Samar Hasan, co-founder of Epiphany Games.

While in some ways, esports trends run parallel in both countries, Pakistan outranks India in terms of prize money

In most cases when it comes to tech, India’s spending and investment are ahead of Pakistan’s by leaps and bounds. In the case of gaming, however, the average spend per person in Pakistan is $5.67 which is lower than most countries but at par with India, claims Intenta Digital.
However, ranked 34 with $5.2 million in prize money, Pakistan is 10 points — $1.7m — ahead of India in terms of esports earnings, according to esportsearnings.com. But the industry is not flouring as it could be.
Industry mistrust
While the industry is growing, it contends with the inefficiency and corruption that are endemic to most sectors of the economy.
“There have been cases where the tournament registration fees (usually about Rs1,000-1,500) have not been enough to cover the cost of prize money,” says Mahreen “EngineerBunny” Butt, Esports host, analyst and caster.
The money is spent on fancy settings and lightning equipment instead of substance, she rants. A lot of the tournaments are more about marketing than about the sports which is hampering its growth.
Another example is the case of a local company breaking a non-disclosure agreement with an international company to make a quick buck.
“We are not trusted,” says Ms Butt. “A foreign company’s desktop graphics card that had not been formally launched into the market was made available to a local company under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). Breaking the NDA, the graphic card was sold at a much higher value than the price at which it was supposed to be sold. Since then, the industry has lost the trust of international companies.”
State patronage or the lack thereof
What does Arshad Nadeem, Sialkot’s FIFA football and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy have in common? Global acclaim without state patronage.
Pakistan’s former federal minister for science and technology Fawad Chaudhry had last year announced that esports will be recognised as a sport for which a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Pakistan Sports Body and the Pakistan Science Foundation.
Mr Chaudhry announced the Free Fire Pakistan League (FFPL) — the first national esports initiative in Pakistan, sponsored by Singaporean game developing company Garena. The fourth season of FFPL kicked off this month.
However, speaking to stakeholders, these developments seem to have limited traction in developing virtual sports in the country. The kudos achieved by Pakistanis that allow it to rank ahead of India and be among the top countries in the world belongs to the efforts of individual players rather than systematic support.
In India, an Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming and Comics taskforce has been created in the 2022-23 budget. A whole host of organisations such as the Electronic Sports Federation of India and the Esports Development Association of India exist to govern and promote the sport. Not surprising since, according to Forbes India, their esports industry is expected to touch INR11bn by FY25.
Second-tier appeal
“We see a lot of gamers and developers coming from second-tier cities. A lot of indie games are being made there,” says Ms Hasan talking about the ongoing Ephiphany Game Jam. Indie games are short independent video games usually created by one or two people.
This experience seems to be echoed across the border where India’s tier-III cities and towns witnessed a significant rise in the number of gamers according to the Times of India. Some of the small towns have witnessed 100-200 per cent growth in gamers since 2020.
Skills not money
India’s Board of Control for Cricket, commonly known as BCCI, is worth $2bn — an amount nearly double what Pakistan is pleading for from the International Monetary Fund to stabilise the spiralling economy. Yet, the big bucks have not stopped Pakistan from winning several times in the past. Similarly, Pakistan outranks India in terms of esports earnings and may continue to do so time and time again.

8,Eyes opening for inclusivity,The citizen’s role will widen over time in shaping the nation’s democratic and prosperous future,"In recent reviews of the stellar performance as well as dismal failures over the last 75 years of Pakistan’s independent existence one can discern a notable, evolving, long-lasting trend: an increasing awareness among citizens about how their lives and livelihoods are affected by the developments in the country’s current state of affairs.
And more importantly, the economic, social and technological progress so far made is stated to have empowered individuals (youth, the middle class and society) with the potential to make a difference in shaping the future.
A youth survey conducted by the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) in April 2022 shows their future and the country’s economic progress are among the foremost concerns of young people, says the organisation’s joint director Assiya Riaz. In the opinion of young people, key challenges facing Pakistan are ranked in the order of inflation, followed by unemployment, poor quality of education, population growth, religious extremism, climate change, questionable quality of political leadership and threat from India.
A whopping majority of 84.9 per cent of the young respondents believe that, despite weaknesses, democracy is the best system for Pakistan. And 95.9pc are of the view that strong and empowered local governments are the key to managing public problems.

The citizen’s role will widen over time in shaping the nation’s democratic and prosperous future

In the views of United Nations experts, it would very difficult to develop ‘sustainable cities and communities’ in the absence of vibrant local bodies. In Pakistan, this has become abundantly clear from the failure to provide civic facilities and other infrastructure in major cities and towns. The damage from the monsoon rains has further exposed how things are being mismanaged sans empowered representative local bodies system being in place.
The popular imagination is hooked on politics, says an analyst. With unbounded political polarisation, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Central Depository Company cautions: ‘’We (the public) need to use logic over emotions and start questioning the leaders we support.”
When asked in Pildat’s Youth Opinion Survey “what is the most important factor that influences you to support a political party?” the respondents’ choices were as follows: 37.9pc of them said it was the party’s past performance, 36.5pc looked at election manifestos, 17.5pc followed charismatic leaders and 3.8pc voted under influence of local leadership.
To spur economic progress, social scientists in Europe had identified a cardinal principle in the pioneering stage of industrialisation that every individual had the right to mould the quality of life as he deems fit but he did not have the right to usurp the rights of others. In other words, it meant the harmonisation of individual and collective interests.

Military rule has ceased to be an option owing to industrial development and the resultant social consciousness

And now through an evolutionary process in both semi-industrialised and industrialised countries, one can witness a surge of individual self-assertion and persistent efforts to exercise the right to self-determination.
Here an illustrative quote from eminent analyst F.S.Aijazuddin is pertinent: “Come to think of it, every achievement that Pakistanis can be proud of — whether it is mountain climbing, javelin throwing, weightlifting, or winning Oscars — is the reward of individual effort. Pakistanis achieve whatever they do, not because of state patronage, but despite it.”
The country’s rapid industrialisation of the 1960s created an environment for the various segments of the population to demand individual, regional and provincial autonomy and the need for institutional autonomy for different sectors of the economy, free from centralised regulations and patronage that stifled the growth of a competitive modern economy. The problem then highlighted included the concentration of wealth in 22 families. This was followed by the 1973 Constitution, the delayed 18th Constitutional Amendment and the 7th National Finance Commission award, which together laid the roadmap for a federal, democratic and egalitarian system.
Though constitutional and democratic norms are not being strictly observed, direct centralised military rule has ceased to be an option owing to the industrial development and social progress made since then and the social consciousness it has generated.
And a growing number of the professional middle class is projecting emerging trends with the potential to resolve the current crisis and put it on the path of inclusive and sustainable development.
The global digital revolution is also serving as a catalyst for transformational change in this country. It is now well recognised that IT interventions are adding to internal distribution, efficiency and exports at the fastest pace. Notwithstanding the official policies, this phase of industrialisation, with its multi-facet dimensions and impacts, is widening the space for building a strong middle-class economy.
Pakistan’s youth will be at the forefront of economic and social transformation, says analyst Mosharraf Zaidi and adds: “This is guaranteed not because there is any sign of creative life in the Pakistani state, but because there isn’t. Starved of fairness, equal opportunity and capable governance, young Pakistanis are going to build the ecosystem they need from scratch.”
Our individuals are more empowered today than they were a few decades ago, says Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri. The internet, smartphones, and social media have made information (and disinformation) much more accessible than we had ever imagined. People are more aware of their rights and are empowered enough to challenge the status quo.
Now various power centres and a vibrant civil society is contesting for their space in decision-making. These trends are reminders that one cannot ignore individual ownership while taking any initiative about Pakistan’s future. The analyst believes that citizens can certainly influence the game changers to at least do better than business-as-usual.
By the time we celebrate one hundred years of Pakistani freedom, mr Zaidi says, the most talked about story will be of the economic independence of Pakistani women, men and children that will define the next quarter of a century. And to quote Aqdas Afzal, raising the living standards of Pakistanis requires a democratic turn, and we have to make democracy the starting point for all social change.
What’s appears to be certain, one may point out, is that the citizen’s role will widen over time in shaping the nation’s democratic and prosperous future.

It’s not just the cricket megastars who can win hearts with their memorable shots. Now, even ordinary gamers in India can ‘Hit and Earn’ through cricket, albeit in matches played in the metaverse, with a chance of winning up to $500 per day. Jump.trade, a Sports NFT marketplace by GuardianLink, organised its first Meta Cricket League (MCL) tournament finale in August, which was played in the virtual world. MCL is a ‘Play to Earn’ (P2E) blockchain game, where users can create teams of batsmen and bowlers to participate in real-time player-versus-player matches. Users can also form a team and earn rewards. “To begin playing the MCL game, users need to buy a combination of 1 Batsman NFT and at least 1 Bowler NFT from the platform,” explains Kameshwaran Elangovan, co-founder and chief operating officer at GuardianLink. Jump.trade is currently home to over 1,000 users who play MCL games every day, earning up to $500 a day. It sold 55,000 NFTs within nine minutes of going live, contrary to the subdued market interest for cryptos and NFTs this year.

The future of robotic furniture
Inventors, architects and designers worldwide have lately converged on ways to create technology that can make parts of apartments and homes, and all their contents, slide out of view at the touch of a button. Former researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ex-Apple and Tesla engineers and a design and architectural firm in Spain are among those devising what can only be described as robotic furniture. The systems include beds that, on voice command, float into the ceiling to reveal couches, and artificial-intelligence-enabled cameras to track where your belongings are stored. For now, most of these playthings are for the rich, with some of the installations costing $40,000 for a single room. But the goal of many of the people involved is to make this technology ubiquitous. Some of these home systems can cost as little as $5,000 apiece and are already installed in apartments with rents as low as $1,000 a month, in places like Durham, N.C. and Buffalo, New York.

Gender equity and climate change
A comprehensive report from United Nations Women found that women are disproportionately impacted by most if not all of the challenges highlighted in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Here are a few strategies that can empower women and address environmental challenges: 1) Promote women’s representation in climate policy and decision-making. 2) Craft narratives that inspire girls and women to pursue STEM careers. Today, women make up just 27pc of the STEM workforce. 3) Report on your performance for ESG, and get creative, identify the specific ESG metrics relevant to your businesses. 4) Normalise men caring about climate. In many cultures, people are socialised from early childhood to view caring about environmental issues as feminine. 5) Self-educate. Ignorance is no excuse for inaction.

Forgetting Zika virus
The Zika virus, a mosquito-borne illness that caused an epidemic in Brazil in 2015 and 2016, infected many pregnant women. Their babies were sometimes born with microcephaly, unusually small heads that hinted at the devastating brain damage the virus caused while they were still in utero. Seven years later, the babies are now children, many of them nearly as big as their mothers. But after the Zika epidemic did not turn into a pandemic that swept the globe, Brazil and the rest of the world moved on. The virus is still circulating at a low level in Brazil, elsewhere in Latin America and Southeast Asia. But funding for research dried up after global concerns faded, leaving many families struggling for support. The few virologists and infectious disease specialists who continued to work on Zika after the epidemic subsided were forced to set it aside when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Many children have significant hearing and visual problems and a majority need feeding tubes.

10,"Well done, but no more",Pakistan is now compliant or largely compliant with 38 out of 40 FATF recommendations,"


 
Pakistan continues to make strides in its commitments to meet international standards on anti-money laundering and combating financing terror (AML/CFT) and being acknowledged by the international community.
Last week, the Asia Pacific Group (APG) on Money Laundering rated Pakistan ‘compliant’ or ‘largely compliant’ on 38 out of 40 technical recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) against money laundering and terror financing. It, however, retained the country on ‘Enhanced Follow-up’ until further progress was made on the two remaining recommendations. Pakistan’s next progress report is due on February 1, 2023.
Since February 2021, Islamabad improved its standards on a total of four recommendations and was upgraded to full ‘compliant’ status on one and ‘largely compliant’ on two counts and became ‘partially compliant’ on another item from the ‘non-compliant’ position.
The acknowledgement by APG is a good omen as it coincides with the ongoing onsite verification process of the FATF to hopefully exclude Pakistan from its ‘grey list’ of countries under ‘increased monitoring’.

Pakistan is now compliant or largely compliant with 38 out of 40 FATF recommendations

The fourth Follow-Up Report (FUR) on Mutual Evaluation of Pakistan released by the APG — a regional affiliate of the Paris-based FATF — welcomed “the steps that Pakistan has taken to improve its technical compliance with R.28, R.33, R.37, and R.38”, adding that “overall, Pakistan has made good progress in addressing the technical compliance deficiencies identified in its mutual evaluation report (MER) and has been re-rated on Compliant with R.33, Largely Compliant with R.28 and R.37 and Partially Compliant with R.38.
Overall, Pakistan is now fully ‘compliant’ with nine recommendations and ‘largely compliant’ with 29 others. The country is ‘partially compliant’ with two recommendations and ‘non-compliant’ with none out of a total of 40 recommendations. All in all, Pakistan is now compliant or largely compliant with 38 out of 40 FATF recommendations.
The reporting date for this evaluation was February 2022, which means Islamabad may have made further progress since then that would be evaluated after February 2023. It may be noted that some of the very important items that APG has highlighted as ‘deficient’ related to supervision for lawyers and their associates, the scheme for providing restraint orders ex-party in all circumstances in matters of predicate offences for mutual legal assistance and lack of legal basis to confiscate the property of corresponding value.
The APG rating improved after Pakistan took steps to address shortcomings in relation to designated non-financial business and professions (DNFBP) supervision, including the establishment of an AML/CFT supervisory framework. Deficiencies, however, still remain with fit and proper requirements and the implementation of risk-based AML/CFT supervision for DNFBPs.
According to the APG mechanism, there are three categories of follow-up for a gradual tightening of monitoring based on MERs: regular, enhanced and enhanced (expedited). Pakistan had been included in the enhanced (expedited) monitoring category in 2019 but with concerted efforts and improved legislation, regulations and institutional monitoring graduated to the enhanced monitoring category in October 2020.
Regarding recommendation No 28, the Ministry of Law and Justice is empowered as the oversight body for the Self-Regulatory Body (SRB) of lawyers. Pakistan has also further amended its AML Act to designate the Pakistan Bar Council, Provincial Bar Councils and Islamabad Bar Council as the SRBs of lawyers. Regulations were also issued on these SRBs’ AML/CFT obligations to monitor the compliance of lawyers.
These regulations require SRBs to apply suitable market entry controls to ensure that it does not professionally accredit lawyers that are criminals, acting as an associate of a criminal, or whose beneficial owner is a criminal or criminal associate.
Pakistan’s Bar Council, the SRB for lawyers, has updated its enrolment procedures to incorporate criminal record checks prior to the issuance of enrolment certificates or licenses. The requirement however does not extend to associates of criminals.
Also, amendments to the Federal Board of Revenue AML/CFT regulations for DNFBPs were issued under which criminals and their associates are now clearly restricted from holding a significant or controlling interest in DNFBP, being a beneficial owner of a DNFBP, or being part of the senior management of the DNFBP.
These amendments apply to the supervision of real estate agents, dealers in precious metals and stones and accountants which are not members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) and Institute of Cost and Management Accountants (ICMAP).
The ICAP and ICMAP are required to submit a criminal check declaration at the time of issuance and renewal of a certificate of practice. The directive and declaration form does not extend to associates of criminals, and therefore this deficiency remains.
In February 2022, Pakistan has approximately 186,956 registered lawyers, with 130 confirmed to be offering regulated services under the AML/CFT regime. Considering the size and business of the sector, Pakistan has commenced supervision of lawyers based on three categories.
“Pakistan has implemented fit and proper controls for DNFBPs, however minor deficiencies remain with respect to the controls for accountants supervised by ICMAP/ICAP and lawyers as they do not extend to cover associates of criminals,” APG noted.
The Mutual Legal Assistance Act (MLAA) was further amended in July 2021 and the Interior Ministry issued updated MLA Guidelines in 2022, which apply to all law enforcement agencies and relevant federal authorities to support expeditious processes. The MLAA provides a basis for Pakistan to take expeditious action in response to requests by foreign countries to identify assets ex parte.
In cases where a country seeks a restraint order and where a confiscation order has already been issued, the MLAA requires prior notice to be given. The MLA Guideline requires implementing authorities to go back to requesting foreign partners in such circumstances to obtain a restraint order. However, requesting jurisdictions may not be able to do so in all circumstances. The MLAA is silent on Pakistan obtaining a domestic restraint order upon request in a case where the requesting jurisdiction does not have either a restraint order or a confiscation order. This is also a deficiency.

Forest area as a % of land

 
It sounds goods: one billion trees. A nice big number that evokes visions of vibrant leafy forests as far as the eyes can see. Under the green ‘tsunami’, 350,000 hectares were planted.
Over the last three decades, a quarter of Pakistan’s forest cover has been lost. Currently, the country has 4.2 million hectares of forests and planted trees. The applaudable initiative of planting trees accounts for roughly 10pc of forests, indicating the wide swathes of deforestation that have taken place for which a billion trees cannot make up the loss.
Deforestation plays an important role in the flooding equation as trees prevent sediment runoff and forests hold and use more water than farmlands. Tree roots absorb water from the soil, making it drier and more able to store access water. Their extensive root systems allow them to act as massive sponges that soak up water. Rainwater that stays on leaves evaporates directly into the air.
Be it the urban flooding of Karachi, or the heartbreaking images of riverine floods of KP, the effects of flooding could have been tempered if tree cover would not be consistently eroding over the years. It cannot be a coincidence that about 90pc of all tree cover loss in Pakistan between 2001 and 2021 was from the KP region.
