QUETTA / DERA ALLAHYAR: With many still marooned in flood-affected regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and a significant number of people airlifted to safety on Sunday, the prime minister and the army chief made an attempt to bring a healing touch for a nation in grief. 
Shehbaz Sharif announced a grant of Rs10 billion for Balochistan to cope with the destruction caused by floods and Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa spent the day with troops carrying out relief operations in Sindh. 
The premier announced the relief package during a day-long trip to the flood-hit areas of Nasirabad division, including Haji Allah Dine village where he interacted with the affected people and assured them that the government would help rehabilitate all the flood victims. 
Talking to the media after the visit, he said he had never witnessed a destruction of this magnitude in his life. “The devastation caused by floods and persistent rains is horrifying,” PM Sharif observed. He said the impact of natural calamities could not be overcome just by sloganeering, making statements and levelling allegations. 
Mir Jan Mohammad Khan Jamali, the acting Governor of Balochistan, Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, provincial ministers, Chief Secretary Abdul Aziz Uqaili and officials of the NDMA and PDMA were present on the occasion. 
Mr Sharif underlined the need for working hard and shedding sweat and blood to overcome the flood havoc across the country. He regretted that “false statements” by certain political figures would not mislead the nation. 
He called upon the rich to support the flood-affected people with generous donations. He said during an aerial view he had seen huge chunks of land inundated by torrents, and likened the phenomenon to an overflowing ocean.
“In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, downpours led to swollen rivers and water channels in Swat and Kalam, sweeping away hotels and homes within the blink of an eye,” he said, adding that hundreds of people lost their lives and crops were damaged.
The prime minister said the federal government was providing Rs25,000 each to flood-affected families out of an allocated grant of Rs38bn through the NDMA and Benazir Income Support Programme. 
In Sindh, he said, he had already announced a grant of Rs15bn. 
PM Sharif said he had directed the federal energy minister to supervise restoration of power supply in the affected areas. He said he would preside over a meeting in Islamabad to review the situation and take further decisions.
Earlier, the chief secretary informed the prime minister that 20 districts in Balochistan were badly affected by floods and about 1.3 million people had braced themselves for the worst. 
He said that about 65,000 houses were completely destroyed and the Quetta-Sukkur road link was cut off due to collapse of bridges. “A total of 25 small dams in the province were breached and 78 others had developed cracks,” he said. 
Earlier, the prime minister took an aerial view of flood-hit areas of Sindh and Balochistan and participated in the aerial relief support operation in the affected areas.
Gen Bajwa visits Sindh
Army Chief Gen Bajwa visited troops busy in relief activities in far-flung flood-affected areas of Khairpur and Qambar-Shahdadkot, in Sindh. According to the ISPR, the COAS spent the whole day with flood victims housed in relief and medical camps. 
The flood victims thanked the army chief for reaching out to them and hearing their problems and discomfort caused by floods. He met troops on the ground and appreciated their efforts for comforting the people awaiting their support.



 
“Helping the people of Pakistan in need is a noble cause and we must take pride in serving them to the best of our abilities,” the COAS emphasised. 
Meanwhile, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif has urged all political parties to shelve their activities and focus their efforts and energies on relief and rehabilitation of hundreds of thousands of people. 
In a brief speech from London on Sunday, the PML-N supreme leader said although flood was a natural calamity, it was a time of “soul searching” about whether “our actions and mistakes” were responsible for the nation’s sufferings.  “We cannot rule out these things,” he added. 
Mr Sharif urged the nation, especially the rich, to shoulder their responsibility and extend their all-out help so that people in need could be rehabilitated.

 





 
Separately, President Dr Arif Alvi reinforced the government of Pakistan’s appeal for international assistance and relief to support the flood-affected people. On his Twitter handle, the president also appealed to the people in the country to donate generously to help support the flood victims.
Meanwhile, the aviation minister has directed PIA to lift NDMA’s aid for relief of flood victims free of cost. Khawaja Saad Rafiq said all national institutions had to do their duty together for the relief and rehabilitation of flood victims.
Several airlifted, many still stranded
With Pakistan Army and KP’s rescue teams continuing to rescue scores of stranded people, mostly tourists, in the flood-hit areas of Swat, Dir Upper and Kohistan, still many were reported stuck up in these districts.
Three more people drowned in rivers in Dir Upper and Charsadda. Fear among the people living in low-laying areas of Charsadda and Nowshera continued as a massive flow of 336,461 cusecs was reported in Kabul River near Nowshera on Sunday evening. 
Several areas of both districts remained submerged with the district administration requesting people to move shift to relief centres mostly set up in government schools and colleges. 
According to the PDMA, about 21 houses were destroyed in Babozai area of Charsadda. In the same area, 1,860 people were rescued. According to the PDMA data, 60 people were rescued in Dir Upper. 
Garhi Momin, Jabba Daudzai, Mohib Banda, Banda Mullah Khan, Banda Sheikh Ismail, Choki Drab, Choki Mamraiz, Pashtoon Garhi, Nowshera Kalan, Pir Sabak, Aman Garh and other areas of Nowshera district remained submerged for the third consecutive day on Sunday.
According to the Swat district administration, 172 tourists were stranded in Asrarit area and 150 others, including tourists and hotel staff, at famous tourism spot Mohodand. Similarly, 60 tourists were stuck in the Bahrain village of Swat.
In Lower Kohistan, army’s helicopter rescued a young boy stranded at a rock amid the floodwater. 
In the scenic Kalam valley of Swat, the army and provincial government airlifted scores of tourists, including a Spanish couple. 
In Balochistan, several families stranded in floodwater wait for relief and rehabilitation operations in Daak and Anambostan areas of Noshki district. Noshki Deputy Commissioner Khurram Khalid told Dawn that so far 133 stranded people had been rescued and the rest were given ration along with cooked food by helicopters on Sunday.
River flows still rising
Currently at medium to high flood levels, river flows in the Indus are still rising between Tarbela Dam and Taunsa Barrage, while Nowshera witnessed ‘very high flood’ on Sunday with further increasing trend.
The Federal Flood Commission (FFC) said flows from Guddu to Kotri barrages was receding at the moment, but would experience higher flows over the next eight-12 days as floodwaters now in the upper area flow down. The water flows in all other rivers in the Jhelum-Chenab zone are normal.
The FFC said flood flows in River Swat (Khwazakhela, Chakdara and Munda head works) were gradually receding. On Sunday afternoon, it was flowing in ‘low flood’ at Khwazakhela as flows receded from 246,000 cusecs to 32,000 cusecs, while ‘medium flood’ was reported at Chakdara where flows dropped from 275,000 to 56,000 cusecs. Flows were classified as ‘medium flood at Munda head works where the flows receded from 260,000 to 72,000 cusecs. 
The FFC said river flows at Tarbela were recorded at 302,000 cusecs, 423,000 cusecs at Kalabagh, 502,000 cusecs at Chashma and 516,000 cusecs at Taunsa Barrage and all were well below the 650,000 cusecs classified as ‘very high flood’. Flood level at Chashma-Taunsa Reach was ‘high’ and at Sukkur, in ‘medium flood’ at Kalabagh, Guddu and Kotri, respectively. 
River Kabul was flowing in “very high flood” at Nowshera with discharge of 309,000 cusecs on Sunday, significantly higher than 200,000 cusecs benchmark for very high flood classification for this river. At Warsak (upstream of Nowshera), River Kabul was also flowing in ‘high flood’ at 120,000 cusecs on Sunday and was receding. The Indus at Khairabad (junction point after merging River Kabul in the Indus) was flowing in ‘high flood’ with discharge of 531,000 cusecs. It had experienced a peak discharge of 602,400 cusecs on Saturday.
Other main rivers of the Indus River System — Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej — continued to flow normal.

1,Situationer: Unsung heroes in challenging times,Families rise to the occasion in areas that still await official help.,"LAHORE: Maryam Jamali and her family have been engaged in relief activities for flood victims in Balochistan since this year’s monsoon began last month and a dam burst in Quetta and Qila Abdullah. The responsibilities are divided: Maryam is looking after fundraising, her mother does the purchasing in Quetta, and on the ground in flooded Jaffarabad, Jhal Magsi, Nasirabad and Dera Bugti districts are her landlord father and uncles ensuring incoming refugees from other villages get shelter and food.
Flash floods and torrential rains since June have inflicted massive destruction on almost all the provinces. The government has declared a national emergency in view of this humanitarian crisis of epic proportions brought about by the effects of climate change. 
Pictures and videos floating on social media daily from south Punjab, Sindh and the hardest-hit Balochistan show large swathes of land completely inundated, gushing floodwater washing away mud houses, cattle and roads, and destroying anything in its path, including millions of acres of agricultural land that many locals lived on, depriving millions of any form of shelter and food. Many remote areas have been cut off from the rest of the country, while some have reported a breakout of waterborne diseases also. 
Read: Flooded lower Sindh reels in pain and destruction
As per the climate change minister, over 20 million people have been rendered homeless or without shelter and around 1,000 killed, and the country’s weather forecast division doesn’t see the monsoon ending any time before end-September.

Families rise to the occasion in areas that still await official help

While the government, aided by the army and the National Disaster Management Authority, scrambles to provide relief to as many flood-affected areas as possible, there are villages and settlements that nobody even knows exist. In these circumstances, some local families and youths, as the Jamali family, have stepped up to help their communities in this hour of need by collecting donations and providing basic necessities such as food, shelter and clean drinking water.
“We always thought the 2010 floods were the worst for Balochistan, but this time it’s much higher than that, which is telling, because of a lot more rains. Every single house has been destroyed, 95 per cent of the people in Jaffarabad are affected, every single district mentioned is flooded, dermatitis and other skin infections are spreading fast. In Dera Bugti, water is just accumulated with no outlet because the area is inaccessible in general, so we can’t get resources there. We’re using trucks and tractors to transport food and evacuate people,” Maryam, a native of Jaffarabad’s Chowki Jamali village pursuing her A-Levels in Islamabad, but currently busy coordinating relief efforts with her family from Quetta, told Dawn over the phone.
According to a Balochistan Provincial Disaster Management Authority report on Tuesday, 234 people — 110 men, 55 women and 69 children — have been killed since the start of the monsoon.
The situation in interior Sindh is starkly similar, where the PDMA reported 263 deaths, including 120 children and 35 women. Shanza Faiq, her husband Minhaj Mahdi Memon, both civil servants, and her father-in-law are joined by 37 volunteers in providing direct relief to flood-affected people of several villages in Naushahro Feroze district.
“We are centred around Naushahro Feroze, specifically Darbelo village that my father-in-law belongs to and where around 70pc of the houses have been destroyed. We’re also working in Gopang village, which has been wiped off as well as Kandiaro, Muncht, Sodhar. We’ve camped 3,500 residents of these villages in four government schools as well as mosques and Imambargahs of Darbelo where they’re being provided cooked meals thrice a day. 
“We need medicines for gastro problems, and mosquito nets. We got 200 ration packs prepared for Rs5,000 each on subsidised rates and transported them from Sehwan to Naushahro Feroze, Darbelo and Gopang in trucks offered by a friend,” Ms Shanza explains.
She also complains of a province-wide shortage of basic ration and hoarding. “Flour mills across Naushahro Feroze have stopped working, so there is a dearth of wheat flour.”
Similarly, Maryam says their priority is also providing food and shelter, but their efforts are being hampered by the damage to road infrastructure across the province as well as the density of the districts they’ve targeted. “We are providing tarps, plastics, and 100 tents to Jaffarabad with a capacity of six charpoys each. We have so far helped 500 families in Jaffarabad with food, shelter, evacuation and medical care; we’re also serving food to refugees in Dasht town, and setting up telemedicine and medical camps in cut-off villages. My village of Chowki Jamali is hosting 1,000 people from other villages and more are coming. Later, they will all be evacuated to Saifullah Canal where a tent village will be set up. We’re providing cooked meals and medicines to people. There’s no drinking water, baby milk, medicines are depleting. And we need to keep in mind the affected areas are the most populated in Balochistan.”
KP, Punjab
While not as severe as Sindh and Balochistan, the incessant rains and floods haven’t spared Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab either. Houses have been destroyed, animals washed away, shops collapsed, standing crops damaged and over 300 killed in both provinces. Some of the affected areas are so far from the mainstream even in normal days that in times of a natural calamity getting help to them is unthinkable. 
Ehtesham Hassan, a Dera Ismail Khan native, has engaged 10 student and volunteers, including medical technicians, for providing ration and medicines in Daraban Kalan tehsil, Chaudhwan and Musa Zai Sharif villages, around 70km from DI Khan city.
“Houses in these remotest areas have washed away, crops destroyed, animals gone. The people there have nothing, clothes, shoes, utensils, drinking water. Someone even told me they were drinking flood water. And since it’s extremely dangerous to travel in some areas, we have prepared a ‘boat’ by inverting a charpoy onto an inflated truck tyre to transport resources. In some cases, my team members have walked a couple of kilometres in the villages that don’t have roads in normal circumstances,” he says while collecting donations in Lahore to send to his team in DI Khan.
He says they have so far distributed resources among 50 families that needed immediate help. “Since they have no shelter and a place to cook, we’re providing them clean drinking water, dry food such as dates, chickpeas and rusk to survive, in addition to medical help.”
Over in the flood-ravaged southern belt of Punjab, social and political activist Nadir Gopang and some students have initially set up a small camp in his hometown of Rohilanwali in Muzaffargarh district, and in a couple of days will move to Fazilpur, which is completely inundated.
“We collected ration, drinking water, clothes and medicines from the limited resources we have and distributed them in Hajipur Town Committee of Fazilpur, and are also setting up a medical camp there. We initially set up a relief camp in Muzaffargarh to provide medicines and ration from there. We want to move towards very remote areas such as Lundi Syedan village, Tibbi Lundan, Dajal to the west of Indus Highway by the Sulaiman Mountain Range. But, there are many areas where no one has reached yet, and can’t be approached until the state provides logistic support. Some small villages have been completely damaged because of floods from the mountains. Things are so bad that now a canal is flowing through Basti Jalluwali in Taunsa tehsil. Some areas are so inundated that there is no dry space to bury bodies.” 
Amid all the relief efforts, the very pertinent women’s menstrual hygiene needs haven’t been ignored. Shanza says they’re providing medicines, sanitary pads and cotton roles among women, procured from different areas of the province owing to a shortage, while Ehtesham has distributed around 500 pads in the areas of DI Khan district he’s operating in.
Faizan Mazari and his brother have also started raising funds to help provide shelter in their hometown of Rojhan Mazari in south Punjab. Once they have a significant amount, their father will purchase some basic essentials and personally distribute them in the area. “It’s completely flooded. People are homeless, wheat stocks and cattle have drowned, hundreds and thousands of people are on roads. The Indus Highway is destroyed. Some villagers have moved to safer places, but some are still stuck there. Our plan is to initially provide tents because it’s been raining constantly for a week and more has been forecast so they need shelter.”
And all of these people were clear they couldn’t wait for the respective administrations to come to their rescue. The central and provincial governments, it seems, have only been able to get to a limited number of flood-affected areas. Shanza, Maryam, Ehtesham, Nadir, Faizan all told Dawn they haven’t seen state presence in any of the regions they’re working in.
“In our area, it’s been accepted that the deputy commissioner is a figment of our imagination; he has vanished. I begged the PDMA and NDMA for help but they asked us to go to the DC office. These are really big districts and since roads are damaged and inundated, it’s not easy to travel,” laments young Maryam.
Nadir and Ehtesham say many small local organizations have made some efforts to provide food and shelter in both south Punjab – such as Dajal and Jampur tehsil of Rajanpur -- and DI Khan, but there’s been no government help. “Some officials come to meet the feudals and pirs for photoshoots, fulfil formalities and leave,” they both said, while at the same time, the latter feels the government doesn’t have enough resources to handle the scale of the destruction.
Faizan says since his was a feudal area, the lawmakers tried to aid their constituents at the beginning of the monsoon, but “when things got out of hand, they officially said everyone was on their own”.
And this is just the tip of the relief iceberg. Several other individuals, especially youths, are collecting donations and supplies to help flood victims across the country in any little way they can. Young artist Bisman Marri in Quetta is selling his paintings, a freelance journalist in Zehri is selling clothes she’s made with Balochi embroidery, photographers are selling prints of their photos.

2,Taliban accuse Pakistan of allowing US drones; FO rejects claim,KABUL: The Taliban’s acting defence minister accused Pakistan on Sunday of allowing American dro­nes to use its...,"KABUL: The Taliban’s acting defence minister accused Pakistan on Sunday of allowing American dro­nes to use its airspace to acc­ess Afghanistan, a charge Pakistan has recently denied following a US air strike in Kabul.
Acting defence minister Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob said at a news conference in Kabul that American drones had been entering Afghanistan via Pakistan.
“According to our information, the drones are entering through Pakistan to Afghanistan, they use Pakistan’s airspace, we ask Pakistan, don’t use your airspace against us,” he said.
Pakistan’s foreign office released a statement saying it noted Yaqoob’s comments with “deep concern”.
“In the absence of any evidence, as acknowledged by the Afghan minister himself, such conjectural allegations are highly regrettable and defy the norms of responsible diplomatic conduct,” the statement said.
Authorities in Islamabad have already denied adva­nced knowledge of the drone strike that the US said it carried out in Kabul last month that killed Al Qaeda leader.

3,Crucial IMF meeting for renewal of loan plan today,"If the board approves the deal, the IMF will immediately disburse about $1.2 billion to Pakistan.","WASHINGTON: The executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meets on Monday (today) to consider a bailout package for Pakistan as Islamabad claims tying up at least $37 billion in loans and investments.
If the board approves the deal, the IMF will immediately disburse about $1.2 billion to Pakistan and may provide up to $4 billion over the remainder of the current fiscal year, which began on July 1. 
“The board is likely to approve the disbursement of the 8th and 9th tranche (over $1.2 billion) on Monday,” an IMF source told Dawn. “Not doing so will send a negative signal, particularly during the floods.”
Pakistan, he said, could also request emergency help from the IMF’s Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI), which may bring additional funds of up to $500 million.
In April 2020, the board approved the disbursement of $1.386 billion to Pakistan under the RFI to address the economic impact of the Covid-19 shock.
Also, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sunday that in recent weeks Pakistan “has tied up at least $37 billion in international loans and investments, pulling the country away from the kind of financial collapse seen in Sri Lanka”.
Both WSJ and Voice of America (VOA), a semi-official broadcasting service, confirmed that the board is meeting on Monday to consider Pakistan’s request.
The VOA reported that in the last six weeks Pakistan has secured “loans, financing, deferred oil payments and investment commitments close to $12 billion from China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE” to avoid a default. But such commitments will become available only after the IMF board approves the package.
The VOA quoted experts as telling its correspondents that “Pakistan’s economy is broad and deep and its geostrategic position strong enough for it to avoid default.”
Tamanna Salikuddin, director of South Asia programs at the United States Institute of Peace, told VOA that despite differences Washington “still supports the loans through the IMF because a crisis on Afghanistan’s border is not something that the US wants to see.”
She identified “Counterterrorism, nuclear security and stability” as being the main factors for continued US interest in Pakistan.  But Salikuddin noted that “this geostrategic importance (often) leads Pakistan to make irresponsible economic policies as the leadership perhaps believes the country is too big to fail.”
The WSJ noted that the IMF had asked the country to first arrange additional funds to cover the rest of its external funding shortfall for the fiscal year, pointing out that Islamabad appears to have met that target.
Among allies, “China led the way, providing more than $10 billion, mostly by rolling over existing loans,” the report added.
In an interview to WSJ, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said Saudi Arabia was rolling over a $3 billion loan and was providing at least $1.2 billion worth of oil on a deferred payment basis. Riyadh would also invest $1 billion in Pakistan.
The UAE will invest a similar amount in Pakistan’s commercial sector, and it is rolling over a $2.5 billion loan. Last week, Qatar announced it would invest $3 billion in the country.
But the WSJ report warned that the scale of the flooding from heavier-than-usual monsoon rains “means that the country will need more financing than it had planned for.”
The IMF source that spoke to Dawn said that the opposition and government forces in Pakistan “also need to end fighting each other over everything if they want to stabilize the economy.

4,Islamabad assures LNG bidders of timely payments,Pakistan LNG Limited seeks 72 cargoes over next six years (2023-28).,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has assured international LNG suppliers of timely payments for their spot cargoes over the next six years through standby letters of credit (SBLCs) to top-ranking international banks.
The state-run Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) has given the assurance to international bidders, seeking 72 cargoes over the next six years (2023-28) at the rate of one cargo per month.
The company floated tenders on Aug 6 with a bidding deadline of Sept 13. However, international firms sought payment assurances or sovereign guarantees because of prevailing balance-of-payments challenges.
“The PLL will issue an SBLC from a scheduled bank with a long-term credit rating of at least AA from Pacra/JCR-VIS or equivalent from a reputable international credit rating agency … PLL may issue an SBLC through United Bank Limited (UBL),” the company said, asking the bidders to also seek confirmation of the SBLC through top international banks, namely JP Morgan, Citi Bank and Deutsche Bank but declined to provide a sovereign guarantee from the finance ministry.

PLL seeks 72 cargoes over six years

The company has also explained that bidders under the eligibility criteria could provide documentary evidence in the form of a supporting letter from an LNG supplier or producer, clearly stating that the supply of at least one million tonnes per year of LNG from 2023 to 2028 was available to the relevant entity for delivery to Pakistan under the tender.
This must be supported by a copy of the bill of lading, the final discharge report or other similar document proving LNG cargo delivery to confirm that the bidder was a supplier. However, the PLL has declined to make any changes to wider LNG specifications, including higher gross heating values or higher ethane content other than those sought in the tender.
It also turned down suggestions to accept bids in pricing benchmarks other than linked to Brent, different sizes of cargoes or any offer for less than 72 cargoes spread over six years, or one cargo per month. The delivery period for these 72 cargoes is also inflexible starting with January 2023 and ending December 2028.
Pakistan has not been able to secure any spot cargo over the past few months as international prices surged beyond expectations following the Ukraine-Russia war that forced Europe to switch its gas supplies mostly from the international spot market to make up for energy shortages owing to Russian gas disruptions.
Under the two-part tender, PLL has invited bids for 12 cargoes for the first year (January-December 2023) and then 60 cargoes for the next five years, starting January 2024 and until December 2028.

5,Pandya helps India edge Pakistan in Asia Cup thriller,DUBAI: Hardik Pandya starred with bat and ball to lead India to a five-wicket win over Pakistan in a last-over...,"DUBAI: Hardik Pandya starred with bat and ball to lead India to a five-wicket win over Pakistan in a last-over Twenty20 thriller in the Asia Cup at Dubai on Sunday.
Chasing 148 for victory, Ravindra Jadeja, who hit 35, and Pandya, unbeaten on 33, put on a key fifth-wicket stand of 52 as India achieved the target with two balls to spare.
Pace bowlers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Pandya shared seven wickets to set up victory for India in their opening match after they bowled out Pakistan for 147.
Pandya, who returned figures of 3-25 with his medium-pace bowling, then stood calm to hit the winning six in a tense chase in the six-nation tournament. The event acts as a tune-up for the T20 World Cup in Australia in October-November.

India, who lost their previous match to Pakistan by 10 wickets in last year’s T20 World Cup at the same venue, improved their win-loss record to 8-2 against their opponents in Virat Kohli’s 100th T20 international.
Debutant pace bowler Naseem Shah stood out for Pakistan with figures of 2-27, but a foot injury in the final overs had him limping. India then took control with the right-left batting pair of Pandya and Jadeja.
Pakistan kept chipping away with wickets as Naseem bowled Suryakumar Yadav for 18 and Mohammad Nawaz rattled the stumps of Jadeja in the final over.
Virat Kohli scored 35 before falling to Nawaz’s left-arm spin that also claimed skipper Rohit Sharma for 12.
Naseem struck early with the wicket of K.L. Rahul for nought as the opener dragged an express delivery on to his stumps.
The 19-year old Naseem nearly got Kohli out two balls later only for Fakhar Zaman to drop a catch at second slip.
Kohli, who has endured a prolonged lean patch and recently spoke of his mental health struggles, overcame initial jitters and seemed to find his flow with a few convincing boundaries, including a wristy drive over mid-on before getting out.
Earlier, Kumar set the tone for India’s dominance as he dismissed skipper Babar Azam for 10 in the second over and returned figures of 4-26.
Pandya rattled Pakistan’s middle-order with his three wickets, including the dangerous 
wicketkeeper-batsman Mohammad Rizwan after he had hit 43 off 42 balls.
Kumar returned to take two wickets in two balls in the penultimate over, but was denied a hat-trick by number 11 Shahnawaz Dahani.
Dahani smashed two sixes in his six-ball 16 before being bowled by left-arm medium-pace bowler Arshdeep Singh, who took two wickets as Pakistan’s innings folded in 19.5 overs.

The director general of Civil Aviation Authority, Khaqan Murtaza and deputy director general Nadir Shafi Dar would lead the first team, federal Minister for Aviation Saad Rafique was informed during a briefing by the PIA management. 
The PIA was restricted from flying to EU countries in July 2020 after the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) suspended the national flag carrier’s authorisation to operate flights to EU member states.
A PIA spokesman said that another team comprising officials of PIA and the ministry of aviation would leave for the US in early September to discuss their aviation security, safety and operational issues. Also, a third team will go to the UK to secure London Heathrow airport’s slots and return after completing work on the issue.
