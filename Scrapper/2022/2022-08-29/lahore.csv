0,Railway to receive 46 Chinese passenger coaches by December,The railway is working to upgrade the dilapidated track as the Khanpur-Kotri section is not fit for high-speed train operation.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Railways (PR) will receive 46 coaches, of 230, from China in December. The coaches will have the capacity to run at the train’s speed of 160 kilometres per hour. PR teams are in China for the inspection of the prototypes of the coaches as well as the modern high-capacity wagons (goods/freight wagons) and to receive training on manufacturing of such rolling stock, Dawn learnt on Sunday.
An official source in the department said the first batch of high-capacity freight wagons would also be ready by January or so as their prototypes are not ready.
The railway is working to upgrade the dilapidated track as the Khanpur-Kotri section is not fit for high-speed train operation.
“But most of the ML-1 parts are fit for the 120km per hour train operation, and after the completion of the ML-1 project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the entire ML-1 track would have the capacity to bear the rolling stock operations at the speed of 160km per hour,” the source claimed, adding that the work on the upgrade of the track, especially the Khanpur-Kotri, would be launched soon. 
Under $140 million contract (Rs31 billion, approximately), the Chinese company is to manufacture 230 state-of-the-art passenger coaches, of which 46 will be provided as completely built units and the remaining 184 will be manufactured in Pakistan by the PR engineers and technical staff under the supervision of the Chinese experts. 
Under another similar nature contract, a Chinese firm will manufacture 800 freight wagons and 20 brake wagons. The manufacturing of 184 coaches in Pakistan will be under the ‘Transfer of Technology’ project. For the coaches planned to be manufactured in Pakistan - PR Carriage Factory, Islamabad - the Chinese firm will provide spare parts and raw materials. 
The PR teams left for China in the second week of August consisting of 18 officials for design inspections, 20 for other inspections and the others for participating in the training related to the transfer of technology. 
The dilapidated condition of the railway tracks and rolling stock, faulty signalling/interlocking system, officials’ negligence, speeding, unmanned railway level crossings, poor maintenance, financial crises and shortage of staff have caused a number of fatal accidents during the last couple of years.
The year 2019 was the worst for the railways in terms of accidents, including the horrible Tezgam fire tragedy, which occurred in October 2019. Over 100 accidents besides 111 incidents of engine failure were reported in 2019 alone. Over 100 people also lost their lives. The main accidents included the derailment of eight wagons of a freight/container train near Rahim Yar Khan (Taranda) on April 1, the derailment of a goods/container train near Padedan Station (Sindh) on May 18, derailment of Thal Express near Kundian on May 21, derailment of Jafar Express near Gujjar Khan on May 30, the fire incident in Jinnah Express dining car near Harappa (Sahiwal) on June 18, accidents of Jinnah Express near Hyderabad on June 20, parting of a running Pakistan Express train in two portions near Khanewal on July 11, accident of Akbar Express and goods train at Walhar station on July 12, derailment of Zakariya Express and a goods train near Kotri and Rohri stations on July 23, Tezgam train fire tragedy on Oct 30, accident of Sargodha Express with a dumper truck on Dec 10 and derailment of Jinnah Express near Lahore Railway Station on Dec 17. 
Similarly, in 2020 train accidents continued, including a collision between Sir Syed Express and a mini truck at an unauthorized level crossing/passage, and the ramming of a train at an unmanned level crossing into a passenger coach near Sucha Soda. Up to 22 people died in the accidents. Likewise, in 2021 (especially from January to May), 64 accidents were reported. However, the railway authorities claimed that the accident ratio declined by 23 percent, while comparing the data with 2020’s first five months. However, on June June 6, 2021, up to 55 people lost their lives while nearly 100 others were injured after two passenger trains (Millat Express and Sir Syed Express) collided near Daharki, a city located in the Ghotki district of upper Sindh.

1,Parvez asks Mianwali admin to be alert,All resources should be utilised for timely evacuation of people. he says.,"LAHORE: Chief Minister Parvez Elahi on Sunday directed the Mianwali administration and the departments concerned to remain alert in the wake of flood threat.  
Mr Elahi directed officials to complete preparations to cope with any untoward situation. All resources should be utilised for timely evacuation of people, he said. He directed the administration to ensure surplus stock of medicines, clean drinking water, fodder for the livestock and other necessary items, adding that the flow of Indus river should be monitored round-the-clock.  
The chief minister also directed the officers concerned to visit the site and review the river dykes and the safety gates. He said the boats, dewatering sets and other necessary gadgets should remain functional.  
Meanwhile, the chief minister has welcomed PTI chairman Imran Khan’s initiative to hold an International Telethon to help the flood-hit. He hoped that the funds and material collected through the telethon would greatly help the hapless people in Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.  
The chief minister stressed that the flood affectees should be supported without any discrimination. He urged the philanthropists to generously contribute their donations in the accounts of Punjab and KP chief ministers’ relief funds.  
LCCI PRESIDENT: The chief minister met a delegation led by Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Nauman Kabir who presented him a cheque of Rs10 million for the CM Relief Fund on behalf of the LCCI. 
The chief minister appreciated the spirit of the office-bearers of LCCI to help the flood affectees. He said the traders and industrialists had always played their role in every difficult and emergency situation.  
The chief minister said parking plazas would be constructed near the famous business centres in Lahore. A plan had been chalked out to construct a parking plaza at Anarkali for the convenience of the traders and the consumers. He also stated that a revenue record desk would be set up for the facilitation of the traders and industrialists at the LCCI. 
Nauman Kabir extended an invitation to the chief minister to participate as a chief guest in the Export Trophy Award ceremony, which was duly accepted.  
ADVISER: Adviser to  Chief Minister on Information Omar Sarfaraz Cheema says the Taunsa city  has been protected due to timely measures taken by the Punjab  government.

He said  people were protesting against inflated electricity and fuel prices in  Punjab, adding that no protest was made by the people over flood in  Punjab.  
Cheema said the incompetent federal  government could realise the gravity of the flood after one month.

2,CSA places PAS trainee officers in schools of S Punjab,"LAHORE: The Civil Services Academy (CSA), Lahore, in collaboration with the School Education Department (SED) south...","LAHORE: The Civil Services Academy (CSA), Lahore, in collaboration with the School Education Department (SED) south Punjab, has launched a project, ‘The Aligarh Movement 2.0,’ to place under-training assistant commissioners (ACs) of Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) as teachers in the public schools as a part of their specialised training programme (STP). 
The initiative is aimed at sensitising the next generation of bureaucrats of the value of education and the condition of the education sector. Around 40 officers, 28 men and 12 women, have been deputed for the one week in primary, middle and high schools of eight districts of south Punjab, including Multan, Lodhran, Vehari, Khanewal, Rahim Yar Khan, Muzaffargarh and Layyah. Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur districts were excluded due to closure of schools during floods while Bahawalnagar did not have any rest house for the stay of the officers. The officers would start working from Monday (today). 
It is expected that the trainee officers would get a better understanding of the problems of the education sector and the corrective measures through the project. 
At the end of the attachment, each officer would present a ‘school transformation plan’, which would eventually constitute an ‘education transformation plan’ for the benefit of policy-makers. 
Talking about the project, South Punjab Education Secretary Ehtasham Anwar said they were trying to accomplish the unfinished agenda of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan started more than 150 years ago. He said the actual Aligarh Movement addressed the Muslim masses while the newer version would focus on those at the helms of affairs as they had never given education its due importance. He said the 40 officers would monitor the working of schools, deliver lectures, develop budget and check administration, quality of education and facilities for the students.  
Mr Anwar said the officers would be sorted out in groups of five to give presentations on the experience and the recommendations in the coming weeks. He said the SED secretary would be among the audience for the presentations of all eight groups and the CSA could invite other persons concerned from private as well as public sector to attend the presentations. It’s worth mentioning that the PAS has made probationers’ civil servants appointment at schools a regular component of the specialised training programme (STP).

3,Punjab Notes: Flood: natural or man-made calamity?,More than half of the country is under water. More than thirty-five million people are trapped in the furious...,"More than half of the country is under water. More than thirty-five million people are trapped in the furious currents with nowhere to go as nowhere that could be safe is neither visible nor approachable.  
The rain continues to pour down and soil refuses to absorb what falls from above. The land is an apocalyptic scene that defies description.
Words fail. “What can be said at all can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent,” said Ludwig Wittgenstein. Irony is that in our situation one can neither say anything clearly nor can afford to be silent. Language of image is what can help us understand the watery hell people are in. One finds it hard to choose a few images to illustrate the point as they are so many and are equally excruciatingly painful. A boy crossing a highway in D. G Khan district, battered by floodwater, tries to drag his two small goats to the other side. He is swept by the currents and is forced to let go his goats. He has lost all he had. Another boy, his brother or a friend, dashes to save him. A little girl in the town of Taunsa tries to retrieves her book from the mud of her destroyed home. Can you imagine what will it take for our girls to keep their dream of education alive? A man in Sindh hauls a raft made of ordinary cot with his children on it in his desperate bid to reach some safe corner. “Deep is the stream, rotten is the raft and on the banks lions roar,” says Shah Husain.  
Five young brothers in Kohistan trapped in a roaring stream with water rushing at the bullet speed stand on a rock for five hours. People watching the hapless young men try their best to contact the provincial government to send its chopper for rescue. The crowd watches the four of them being swallowed by furious waves right before their very eyes. Balochistan is a desolate land with bridges destroyed, roads washed away and mud houses ruined. So far more than one thousand have died in different regions. Agriculture has suffered a mighty blow. Greed (in over-exploiting the nature), predator elite and top and bottom heavy administration, and atrocious governance have created this Armageddon. All this is a result of power struggle driven by no holds barred attitude. The only hope we have is embodied by our struggling people who, in the words of poet Brecht, are “like a man who took a brick to show / how beautiful his house used once to be.” Beauty lies in the people’s potential to build. The ugliness of devastation we see around is neither the first nor the last though such an official indifference has never been seen before. 
Scenes of people and places devastated by incessant rains and floodwater in the length and breadth of the country remind us of the deluges we have read in the books. Their accounts may look exaggerated but when we glance our own landscape these days in our thunderously extended monsoon, they appear credible. Three flood narratives are quite well-known; Epic of Gilgamesh, Noah’s Ark and the myth of Matsya (Machhi / Fish). In the Epic of Gilgamesh, we find that gods are unhappy with the noise humans make that disturbs their sleep. So they decide to destroy the clamouring humans by unleashing flood. In Noah’s Ark we see the flood the reason for which is stated in the Bible: “So God said to Noah, I am going to put an end to all the people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.”  
Noah being righteous is forewarned of impending disaster and he escapes in a boat with a handful of other creatures. In the first myth heavenly forces are extremely annoyed with humans for the noise they make. Noise needs to be interpreted as a metaphor; it may be strife on earth which humans are wont to indulge in. The noise becomes egregious when humans oppress one another, fight and wage war leading to massacre and carnage which offends gods. Hence the punishment!  
In the second myth the violence done by humans invites God’s wrath. Violence has multiple forms; it can be against fellow human beings, against other creatures, and against nature and its working. In both the cases evilness of humans is held responsible for their destruction on a large scale. Evilness has to be understood as human acts,viz. crimes against nature and society which violate the fundamental laws of life on this planet.  
In the third myth Matsya (fish) is one of the incarnations of god Vishnu. Matsya appears as a saviour. Manu, the first man, is collecting water when he sees a small fish being pursued by bigger one that wants to devour it. He saves it by catching it in his vessel. The little one grows into a fish of colossal size. One day the fish reveals its identity and says to Manu: “Know that soon storm clouds shall gather over the world. Rains will fall the likes of which no one has seen before. They will destroy all living beings and the world. So build a great boat and fill it with good people, and plants and animals of every kind. When the rain starts, I shall guide you to safety.” So Manu ties his boat to the horns of the fish and saves the world from destruction. In our sub-continental myth cause of the flood is violence per se, violence as it’s found in the process of nature. The flood is a natural act of of creating balance by shedding off fat and a sign of course correction.
But let it be remembered that in our times things are quite different because of unnecessary human intervention in the process of nature. The unusual monsoon rains and ensuing flooding is not something natural; it’s a mad-made calamity. The elites of developed nations are the main culprits as they have played a leading role in damaging our climate in their corporate greed. Nincompoops of developing countries have followed suit. So beware of the god-men who declare this catastrophe a natural calamity which would be tantamount to absolving the elites, local and international, of their crimes against nature and masses. — soofi01@hotmail.com

6,PMC abolition may deny ‘dream careers’ to medics,"Last week, a Senate committee approved the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council Amendment Bill, 2022, with a majority vote.","LAHORE: The PML-N government’s decision to reinstate the Pakistan Medical & Dental Council (PMDC) after abolishing the Pakistan Medical Commission may lead students aspiring to the medical profession abroad in a blind alley.  
The development came a few weeks after the PMC (now PMDC), after years-long delay, had reportedly applied for the accreditation by the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME). As the process of accreditation was just in its initial phase, the Senate Standing Committee on Health on Tuesday last approved the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council Amendment Bill, 2022, with a majority vote, after which the legal status of the PMC ceased to exist. 
The medical fraternity fears that the council may again delay the process as it had done in the past, putting the future of young aspirants at risk.  
An official said the country’s top regulatory body had not taken steps to get itself accredited by the WFME despite federation’s several reminders since 2014 to the national accreditation bodies throughout the world to comply with their standards by 2024. He said frequent changes of political governments in Pakistan hardly augur well for the regulatory body of the country and those wishing to serve as doctors abroad.  
He said Pakistani doctors enjoyed a good reputation the world over and it could be borne out by the fact that most advanced countries had a significant number of healthcare providers from Pakistan. “They not only support their families back home with foreign remittances but also play a pivotal role in the world’s healthcare system by performing high-end research,” he said.  
In the US, the Association of Physicians of Pakistani Decent of North America (APPNA) has thousands of Pakistani doctors as its members with a huge base of donations for charity, social and diplomatic work.  
He said that in response to the PMC’s request for accreditation, the WFME had a couple of weeks ago conveyed to the commission that its team of 10 delegates may visit in March 2023. This development  brought a little bit of relief and raised hope for the Pakistanis willing to move abroad.  
However, with the restoration of the PMDC and current political volatility, they feared that the process could either be ignored or delayed.  
“The government should immediately communicate to the WFME about the restoration of the PMDC as the process itself entails a lot of legwork that has already been pending for years,” said the official. He added that any further delay could result in missing the deadline of 2024. 
The official said the WFME’s goal was to make the world equipped with the doctors of acceptable standards through a regulatory process that ensures that any doctor who intends to enter the workforce internationally has the similar competence no matter which geographic location or country he/she hails from. He lamented that Pakistan was still politicising the medical regulatory body, though most countries with a decent workforce in international  healthcare, started the process of compliance many years ago.

The proposed names in the board will be sent for approval to the minister for culture and to the chief secretary, Punjab, and later on for final approval to the chief minister.  
This year the names which have been proposed are Muhammad Ali Baloch, Attaul Haq Qasmi, Mian Nauman Kabir, Irfan Gill, Javed Iqbal, Prof Dr Rahat Naveed Masud, RM Naeem, Tariq Saeed Sehgal, Gohar Ijaz, Sajida Haider Vandal, Asghar Nadeem Syed, Amjad Islam Amjad, Sohail Sarwar Warraich, Asif Raza Sana and Shoaib Bin Aziz.
The six official members will be the secretary to the information and culture, the deputy commissioner, the Lahore PTV general manager, the principal of the College of Art and Design, University of Punjab, and the executive director of the Lahore Arts Council.
Among the non-official members, the chairman of the board would be elected. To many art critics, the proposed board does not have any performing artists or journalists who report art and culture. There is an issue of relevance when it comes to the board. There are four visual artists on the proposed board -- Mr Naeem, Mr Masud, Mr Iqbal and Ms Vandal and four writers and poets Mr Syed, Mr Amjad, Mr Aziz and Mr Qasmi. Mr Qasmi also is the former chairman of the board.
However, the proposed board does not have any performing art artists or senior journalists who write on culture. Both performing artists and cultural journalists are the most relevant entities for the board.
Watercolourist and art historian Dr Ajaz Anwar commented on the disproportion in the board of governors of the LAC, saying, “We’re a nation of quakes as we like to be experts in every other field rather than ours.” He said that arts councils are meant for cultural activities, therefore the board should have artists and relevant people from journalism.
Visual artist and art educationist Saleema Hashmi said, “The original vision of the Board of Lahore Arts Council is to represent all the arts, the visual and performing arts, literary people and the people who write on art.”

The protestors declared the encounter extrajudicial killing, alleging that the Lahore Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) police officials murdered two young men, Naqash and Abdul Rehman, in custody for not paying Rs1m bribe they had demanded for their release. They alleged that the families could hardly manage to pay Rs150,000 as bribe to the CIA officials but they later murdered them in a fake encounter for not paying the demanded amount. 
“I gave Rs150,000 to the CIA police official, Rana Akram, in the presence of some witnesses when my son was in his custody,” an elderly man told the media persons. 
In the video statement, he said his son was in CIA custody for the last two months and then the police sent him to jail. 
Meanwhile, he added, he met Rana Akram through a lawyer, Shahid, and negotiated with him for the release of his son. 
Akram demanded Rs1m from him and the lawyer offered him Rs200,000 to involve his son in a petty case, the old man said and added that he paid Rs150,000 to the CIA police and Rs50,000 to the lawyer. Even after getting money, the elderly man alleged, the CIA police brought his son out of jail and shot him dead near his residence in Green Town along with another suspect, declaring them notorious robbers. 
He claimed that the CIA took the bodies of the both the victims to the Chuhng area and declared later that they had been murdered in a police encounter. 
The elderly man claimed to have a video footage of the CIA police when they brought his son in custody to his home a few hours before his murder in the staged encounter. 
Another man alleged that the CIA officials, including Rana Akram and Younus, had got Rs100,000 from him for the release of his son who was still in his custody and feared that they would also kill him in a fake encounter. 
A young man, who was among the protesters, claimed that his brother, Danish, and his friend, Shahid, were also in the CIA police custody and feared that the police officials would kill them in an encounter. 
The protesters appealed to the police higher-ups and the Punjab government to take notice of the extrajudicial killings and take action against the CIA police officials involved in the incident. 
They blocked the road for traffic for many hours before dispersing. They warned to expand agitation if their demand was not met.

This was a consensus among the speakers at 32nd Bulleh Shah Conference held on the Shahbaz Khan Road on Sunday, the concluding day of the three-day celebrations of 265th Urs of the Punjabi classical poet.
The speakers demanded the provincial government make the study of Punjabi language compulsory at least at the primary level.
They included Punjab Institute of Language Art and Culture Director General Sughra Sadaf, Pakistan Punjabi Adabi Board Director Perveen Malik, Mudassar Iqbal Butt, Ilyas Ghuman and former MNA Chaudhry Manzoor Ahmed.
While throwing the light on various aspects of the life and teachings of Bulleh Shah, the speakers said he was a poet, philosopher, teacher and a rebel who raised his voice against the ruling classes and tried to inculcate awareness among the common people by the means of his poetry. 
The Bulleh Shah Conference provided a platform for the Punjabi poets to present their literary ventures to get applause from the audience every year. The poets included Tajamal Kaleem, Noreen Shakar, Younas Tahseen, Baba Ghulam Hussain Anjum, Fida Bukhari, and Rana Saeed. 
The prose writers also presented their research-based thesis, highlighting glaring aspects of the life and poetry of the Sufi poet of the subcontinent. A large number of devotees, including women and children, attended the Urs celebrations, laid chadars on the grave of Bulleh Shah and offered prayers. 
The Urs remained colourful and the number of devotees was much higher as compared to the previous year when the event was confined to only one day in the wake of the Covid-19 restrictions. 
In the previous years, the activities were made reduced to a limited scale in the name of terrorism.

SCCI president Mian Muhammad Imran Akbar said Sialkot was the largest export district in Punjab and the second largest in Pakistan after Karachi. 
It was strengthening the country’s economy by bringing $13 billion foreign exchange to Pakistan annually but it was ignored at the time of elevation as division, he said.  
He said Gujrat’s elevation was not a wise decision. The trade unions of SCCI and Daska Engineering Association demanded that Sialkot should be given the status of a division and Daska should not be included in Wazirabad to make it a district.

20,‘Rs1.05bn at BVH disposal to provide free medicines’,BAHAWALPUR: The Punjab government has released Rs1.05 billion to provide  free medicines to the patients at the...,"BAHAWALPUR: The Punjab government has released Rs1.05 billion to provide  free medicines to the patients at the Bahawal Victoria Hospital (BVH) in the current financial year. 
BVH Medical Superintendent Dr Aamir Bokhari told Dawn on Sunday that the budget was meant to supply free medicines to the patients at the emergency ward and OPD but the institution was currently facing liabilities of Rs290 million which it would clear out of the amount. He said that despite financial constraints, free medicines would be provided to  the patients.  
Answering a question, he expressed his inability to provide medicines to the  in-door patients. Efforts were being made, he said, to minimise burden  of medicines on the patients. 
He claimed that there was ample  stock of medicines at the BVH emergency ward where more than 5,000 patients daily visit. He said the patients at the emergency ward and  OPD were being given free medicines including life-saving drugs.  
The medical superintended lauded the government’s Sehat card scheme under which 200 people daily get the benefit of free treatment  at the hospital. He said the  cardholders were administered treatment of any disease free of cost by producing their CNICs. 
The increasing flow of the patients seeking treatment under the Sehat card initiative prompted the government to reactivate it, he said. He said it was equally helpful for the doctors who got their share out of the government expenses.  
Dr Bokhari said the State Life Insurance Corporation (SLIC) had paid Rs50 million to the BVH as its share of the  last four months for treatment of patients. 
He said the amount would be utilised for the betterment of the patients as well as human resource besides improvement of sanitation and potable water  facilities.  
He said the BVH had an ample stock of the anti-rabies vaccine and it had not refused treatment to any patient in need of the drug.  
RELIEF GOODS: The divisional administration  has dispatched six trucks laden with thousands of flour bags and dry ration in addition to other articles of use for the flood-affected people  of Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur and Taunsa Sharif. 
The  trucks have been sent under the supervision of Divisional Commissioner Raja  Jahangir Anwar and Deputy Commissioner Zahid Parvaiz Warraich from  commissioner’s office.  
The commissioner and the deputy commissioner told media that more edible items and ration would be  dispatched in the next few days.  
Meanwhile, on the directive of COAS Gen Qamar Javed  Bajwa, the Pakistan Army Corps 31 has established 10 flood  relief camps in the city, says an ISPR  press release. The camps are collecting edibles and other goods for transportation to Ahmedpur East and other places.  
The relief camps have been set up at Fowara Chowk, Noor Mahal check post  and other places in addition to Yazman city and adjacent Lodhran city. The Markazi Anjuman-i-Tajran has  also set up a relief camp in the city.  
Meanwhile, expressing  sympathy with the flood-affected people of Ahmedpur East tehsil, Prince Bahawal Abbasi demanded that people of around 100 villages around the Chenab river should also be given financial assistance. He said thousands of people had vacated their homes and moved to rural areas of Ahmedpur  East. 
ACCIDENT: A woman was killed while another person was injured when a coach hit their motorcycle on Stadium Road on Sunday.  
The deceased was identified as Sammiya Bibi. Police  impounded the coach and arrested the driver.
