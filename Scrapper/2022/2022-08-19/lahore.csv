0,Punjab govt at its wits’ end regarding chief secretary’s matter,"Federal govt refuses to transfer Kamran Ali Afzal, citing ECP rules.","LAHORE: Getting rid of Punjab Chief Secretary (CS) Kamran Ali Afzal seems to have become an uphill task for the incumbent Punjab government. 
“Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi has desired that one of the officers – Ahmad Nawaz Sukhera (BS-22), Abdullah Khan Sumbal (BS-21) and Babar Hayat Tarar (BS-22) – may be considered for the posting of the Punjab chief secretary in order of priority,” the CM’s principal secretary Muhammad Khan Bhatti wrote to the secretary Establishment Division whose copy was also forwarded to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. 
The CM reportedly shortlisted the panel of three candidates for the CS’s post after consultations with Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan. 
An official source told Dawn on Thursday that the federal government did not oblige the Punjab government, citing that it could not allow transfers and postings as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had already announced the by-polls schedule in the province.  

Federal govt refuses to transfer Afzal, citing ECP rules

The Shehbaz government is reportedly unwilling to oblige CM Elahi by appointing his nominee against the chief secretary’s slot. In spite of being appointed by Imran Khan’s federal government, Kamran Ali Afzal as head of Punjab’s civil bureaucracy was retained by the PML-N government and he had shown a tilt towards it when it gained support of 25 PTI turncoats, hoping to form the government in Punjab. 
The then Punjab Inspector General of Police Rao Sardar Ali Khan had made a quiet exit as he had himself requested the federal government for his transfer from the province soon after the PTI won 15 seats in the July by-election in Punjab, inflicting a crushing defeat on the party of the Sharifs. He was transferred on July 22. 
In order to facilitate the PML-N leadership, the top civil bureaucrats, including the CS, IGP, ACS (Home), Lahore commissioner and deputy commissioner, had got the Punjab Assembly cordoned off on April 16 during the election of the chief minister and sent police on the floor of the provincial house in an unprecedented move. Both the PTI and PML-Q had boycotted the voting for the election of the chief minister and subsequently Hamza Shahbaz became the chief minister. 
The very next day (on April 17), the Governor House was cordoned off and even the then governor Umer Sarfraz Cheema was not allowed to enter the premises to facilitate the administration of oath to Hamza as CM by National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf. 
Parvez Elahi had vowed not to spare CS Afzal and IGP Rao Sardar for becoming more loyal than the king. Both the officers; however, have managed to save their skin so far with the ‘blessing of the PML-N top leadership’. 
Ousted premier Imran Khan was so annoyed with them (Sardar and Afzal) that he had openly warned them that their ‘names had been noted’ and that they would be taken to task. 
Mr Elahi after becoming the CM completely bypassed CS Afzal in postings and transfers of bureaucrats in the province after which he (Afzal) requested the federal government to withdraw his services from the province. 
In his letter to the Secretary Establishment, CS Afzal had said: “I am writing to convey that owing to personal reasons, it is not possible for me to continue on my current assignment”.

Presiding Judge Adnan Mushtaq heard initial arguments on the complaint of Fareeha Farooq against Dr Abid Hussain of Abid Pet Clinic situated in Phase 5 of the Defence Housing Authority and adjourned the hearing till Sept 15.  
The complainant submitted that she took her two-year-old healthy cat named Simba to the clinic of the vet (defendant) for a minor surgery of teeth extraction in June. She said the defendant after charging his fee performed the surgery. However, she alleged, the cat died two days after the surgery following sudden vomiting. She contended that gross medical negligence due to high doses of antibiotics and steroids resulted in the death of her healthy cat.  
She claimed that her cat was perfectly healthy with no previous history of health issues before it was treated by the defendant for the teeth surgery.  
The complainant asked the court to recover damages of Rs900,000 from the defendant. The woman also filed a complaint against the vet with the Pakistan Veterinary Medical Council (PVMC) on the charge of showing medical negligence while treating her cat.  
Dr Abid Hussain in his reply filed before the council denied the charges of the complainant. He said the complainant was fully satisfied when she visited the clinic with the cat a day after the surgery. The next day, the vet saw the text messages of the complainant about the death of her cat.  
The defendant said he asked the woman to have a postmortem of the cat conducted to determine the cause of death but she refused. He said the complaint against his clinic was malicious and based on mala fide intention.  
A similar complaint against Gulberg branch of the same vet clinic is pending with the consumer court. Fatima Binte Adeeb claims damages of Rs5 million while Dr Hussain denies the charge of medical negligence. The woman alleges that her five and-a-half year old cat called Muezza died due to liver failure following excessive administration of antibiotic injections advised by the defendant vet.

In Rahim Yar Khan, the farmers gathered under the banner of the Kissan Board Pakistan (KBP), the Progressive  Growers Association Punjab (PGAP) and the Kissan Bachao Tehreek Pakistan  (KBTP) and blocked the national highway at Iqbalabad for several hours. They had come from all tehsils.

The protesters, holding banners and placards, demonstrated at Iqbalabad Chowk and threw traffic out of gear on both sides of the highway.  
The farmers said that owing to continuous rains in the area, most tubewells were not functional but bills were dispatched to them. The authorities ignored their previous demands and issued inflated bills, they said, adding that the government had put the farmers in a tight spot.  
The government should immediately waive the Fuel Price Adjustment (FPA) and increase in per unit cost on agricultural electricity bills, said the framers.  
The Saddar DSP and Iqbalabad SHO tried to disperse the farmers after negotiation but to no avail. Later, Mepco SE Abdul Aziz Sheikh, Sadiqabad EXEN Mumtaz Kalwar and RYK Assistant Commissioner Sarmad Ali Bhagat reached there and negotiated with the farmers who ended their protest with a threat that they would protest in Islamabad if their demands were not met by Aug 29.
