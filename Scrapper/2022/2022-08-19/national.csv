0,Senators spar over anti-army campaign amid PTI walkout,Bill for protection of persons in custody from torture lands in house; Faisal Javed calls for stopping proceedings against Gill.,"ISLAMABAD: Barbs flew in the Senate on Thursday as lawmakers from treasury benches criticised the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) for allegedly running a campaign against the Pakistan Army, whereas the opposition accused the government of creating a rift between the PTI and the military.
The opposition senators also staged a walkout against the alleged torture of PTI leader Shahbaz Gill who has been in jail for making ‘seditious’ comments relating to the military.
During the session, Federal Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman praised the army for risking lives in relief and rescue operations in flood-hit areas and slammed PTI over alleged trends against the armed forces.
“Other political leaders have compromised and spent years in jails: Asif Ali Zardari spent more than 11 years in jail, his sister Faryal Talpur was picked up in a military-grade vehicle in the middle of the night from the hospital like a terrorist; Maryam Nawaz, too, had a similar experience,” she said while questioning special treatment meted out to PTI chairman Imran Khan. 

PPP leader slams PDM over treatment meted out to Gill

“PTI’s gross hypocrisy has been exposed even more acutely. They hired an American consulting firm Grenier Consulting in 2021 run by a former CIA station chief in Islamabad to lobby and advise the party on Pak-US relations. Remember that this was when the PTI was still in power while Imran Khan was making speeches against the US and slowly isolating Pakistan, with a foreign policy in ruins,” Ms Rehman said. 
These “shocking details” of PTI’s deals kept on surfacing, she said, adding that first it was Grenier Consulting and recently it is Fenton Arluck, and also questioned the ‘real freedom’ campaign by Mr Khan.
Earlier, a bill seeking to provide protection to a person during custody from all acts of torture perpetrated by public officials (The Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Bill, 2022) landed in the house. The bill, already passed by the National Assembly, was referred by the chair to the standing committee concerned.
Leader of Opposition Dr Shahzad Waseem vehemently criticised the government for the alleged torture on Mr Gill and wondered what the anti-torture bill stood in this regard.
He claimed Mr Gill was finding it hard even to breathe. “When it comes to its political designs, the government can go to any extent. The message is clear; he must be subjected to so much torture that a statement of their choice could be extracted from him to use it against Imran Khan and PTI,” he claimed during the speech.
‘Legal way adopted’
Leader of the House and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar insisted that legal recourse was being adopted to obtain the physical remand of Shahbaz Gill, but the Punjab government was standing against the federation instead of complying with the court’s orders. He agreed that in the Constitution and the law, there was no room for torture and added that it was “wrong to run away from investigation in the name of torture”.
PTI Senator Ijaz Chaudhry said the ruling coalition leaders including Asif Zardari, Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz, Khawaja Asif, and Ayaz Sadiq had used “harsher language” against the army compared to the remarks made by Mr Gill.
Meanwhile, PTI Senator Faisal Javed appeared to have changed his earlier position on the issue and said proceedings against Mr Gill should be stopped till all other political leaders who have made such remarks were brought to the dock. Earlier, he had endorsed legal action against the PTI leader while speaking in the House and said that Mr Gill had committed a blunder as he should not have made such remarks.
PPP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar also shared his two cents on the alleged torture faced by Mr Gill. He tweeted: “Have seen very disturbing pictures of physical torture on Shahbaz Gill. No matter how much you disagree with or dislike him, a man’s dignity should not have been violated like this. Either the govt of Mian Shehbaz [Sharif] is complicit or spineless to prevent such atrocity! Shame on us.”
He added: “Include the so-called Pakistan Democratic Movement in it too. Serving democracy by torturing political opponents. What a farce!”

1,COMMENT: How going digital can bridge  the external financing gap,Most critical element to limiting external financing gap is ensuring that recent growth in exports is sustained over medium term.,"THE digital revolution is truly transforming Pakistan’s economy and has become an important source of income from abroad. 
In the last fiscal year, total exports of digital services stood at $2.6 billion with an average of 40pc growth per annum over the last four years. The growth in the digital ecosystem is still in its early stages and Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce & Industry (OICCI) estimates its potential at $10bn.   
In comparison, India leads the world with information technology (IT) exports of $150bn, while Phili­ppines’ annual IT exports were $30bn in 2021. This sector should be a priority and the government must focus on addressing key areas rela­ted to payment gateways, tax treatment and international certifications. 
The government has revoked the tax exemption given to the IT sector till 2025, which will be counterproductive to the growth of this priority sector.
One way the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) can bring down the money in circulation is through digital financial inclusion and incentives for mobile banking solutions. 
They also need to bring to the table solutions for how large onshore dollar holdings (discussed in detail in yesterday’s article) can be brought into the banking sector without causing a flight of capital. 
One possible solution can be a limited-time exemption for citizens to invest in Roshan Digital Account (RDA) products. We need to recognise and appreciate the fact that policy concessions shall be driven by the country’s economic needs, with export and forex flows being at the centre of the plate. Unfortunately, we didn’t see these aspects being pronounced in previous policy actions or stimulus packages. Future policy actions shall revolve around such obvious economic compulsions.

Not only do the IT and digital sectors offer immense potential for foreign currency flows through service exports, but with Web 3.0 becoming a reality, we need to be prepared to explore possibilities of harnessing those foreign exchange flows through regulatory actions, which are currently out of reach for the formal system.
While there are no specific regulations required for Web 3.0 as such, central banks are, however, working on Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) or writing regulations on crypto currencies and their use-cases. In fact, several countries have started pilots, including China, Sweden, Nigeria, India, etc. 
Regarding regulations on crypto currencies, there are a few countries that are looking to attract digital asset owners into the formal forex system. For example, Switzerland introduced crypto banks and a couple of pilots are underway. This is being tested mainly to solve the issue of digital custody and legal ownership of crypto currency. In addition, an amendment in the regulation on electronic money and payments is being proposed to include crypto by use of Stablecoins or Bitcoins for payments in UK.

Interestingly, Visa and Mastercard payment networks are also starting to experiment with issuing cards for specific crypto currencies in selected countries for premium clients, e.g., Visa had started bitcoinblack in Dubai and Mastercard is piloting a similar idea in Indonesia. 
Digital currency is the future, particularly in our case, where 68pc of the population is below the age of 30 and we need to gear up for it. In fact, there is a need to work on regulations to make this reality deliver in our favor if we are to meet our exceeding foreign currency requirements. 
However, the most critical element to limiting the external financing gap is ensuring that the recent growth in exports and remittances is sustained over the medium term. FY2022 was a landmark year for Pakistan, as both exports and remittances were recorded at around $31bn each. There are concerns that we will not be able to sustain these levels in the current year due to fears of global recession, growing power shortages and roll back of subsidies. 
According to the World Bank, Pakistan’s export potential is over $88bn, but we are hampered by low productivity in agriculture and manufacturing. The report identifies power tariffs as a major impediment, saying that average tariffs on final goods in Pakistan are 50pc higher than the average for South Asia, and almost three times higher than the average for East Asia. 
The other major area identified is the cost of doing business, with customs tariffs and duties escalating input costs for our export industry. All these measures are, at best, medium term in nature. The immediate requirement, however, is to identify opportunities which provide a much-needed breather in financing external account deficits. 
While we wait on the IMF and friendly countries to bail us out one more time, we must develop a homegrown reform agenda. Our charter of the economy must focus on boosting our productivity and competitiveness, leading to sustained growth in the exports of goods and services. The charter of the economy must also commit to ensuring policy consistency, especially in priority sectors, such as IT and light engineering/export industries.
In the short term, we must address our large external financing needs by boosting inflows into RDA accounts, giving incentives to both overseas Pakistanis and onshore holders of foreign currency. 
This is the second of two articles; the writers are a former governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, and the president and CEO of the Bank of Punjab, respectively.

2,Jail officials asked to show cause for delay in Shahbaz Gill’s handover,"IHC asks Adiala superintendent, medical officer to submit written replies.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday issued show-cause notices to the Superintendent and Medical Officer of Adiala Jail for delaying handing over custody of Mr Shahbaz Gill to Islamabad police for physical remand and directed them to submit written explanations before the next date of hearing of the case. 
The Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) of Islamabad, Zeba Chaudhry, granted two days’ physical remand of Mr Gill to Islamabad police in connection with First Information Report (FIR) registered against him for allegedly inciting mutiny among armed forces.
Mr Gill, through his counsel advocates Faisal Hussain and Shuaib Shaheen, challenged the grant of remand in the IHC. However, through a miscellaneous application, the petitioner alleged that he had been subjected to torture while in custody of Islamabad police.
Acting Chief Justice of the IHC Justice Aamer Farooq took up the application and summoned the inspector general of Islamabad police, SP and medical officer of Adiala Jail the same day.

IHC asks Adiala superintendent, medical officer to submit written replies

He inquired from the IG of Islamabad about alleged torture on Mr Gill. The IG categorically denied the allegation and said the accused had been kept in police custody in accordance with the law.
However, Mr Gill’s counsel insisted that the police manhandled and tortured his client during the physical remand.
Justice Farooq perused medical report of Mr Gill and asked the counsel to point out if the report substantiates the allegation of torture of Mr Gill.
At this, the counsel referred to the social media reports, including tweets of some journalists, and said that these were the proof of the alleged torture.
The acting chief justice, however, remarked that only medical experts could bring facts on record. He, however, ordered a preliminary inquiry into the matter and tasked the IG with probing as to whether Gill had been tortured while in custody of police.
In response to the request of Mr Gill’s counsel of conducting a judicial inquiry of Mr Gill’s torture, Justice Farooq remarked that the decision in this regard would be taken in the light of the preliminary report to be conducted by Islamabad police IG.
The learned judge inquired from the Additional Superintendent of Adiala Jail as to why he did not hand over Mr Gill to Islamabad police despite release of Robkar at 4:30pm on Aug 17.
The court also inquired from him as to when Mr Gill had been handed over to Islamabad police. On this, the official replied that it was around 9pm.
Justice Farooq also inquired from the medical officer the same question. He informed the court that Mr Gill had been suffering from asthma since his childhood and his medical condition was not stable.
The court termed these replies “unsatisfactory” and directed them to submit written explanations on their behalf, along with relevant record, before the next date of the hearing of the case.
He warned the two officials that the court would start a contempt of court proceedings against them if their replies did not justify the delay in handing over Mr Gill to Islamabad police.
The court allowed the request of Mr Gill to meet his counsel.
Further hearing of the case was adjourned till Aug 22.

3,‘CPEC body brought no investment’,"“Not a single dollar has been invested” in the CPEC project after the creation of CPEC Authority, he says.","ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Prof Ahsan Iqbal on Thursday eulogised China’s continued support for Pakistan, saying Beijing had been supporting infrastructure development since President Xi Jinping during his visit to Islamabad in 2014 announced investing $46 billion under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). 
However, for a second day running, the minister castiga­ted the CPEC Authority, saying the entity has not been able to attract any investment ever since its inception three years ago, APP reported. A news report on Wednesday had quoted him as calling for the dissolution of the CPEC Authority. 
Talking to journalists on Thursday, he said “not a single dollar has been invested” in the CPEC project after the creation of this authority. 
The CPEC Authority was formed in 2019 to ensure uninterrupted progress on its projects and coordination among the departments concerned. 
Mr Iqbal claimed that earlier an investment of $29 billion had come into the CPEC project. 
“That is why now we are going to adopt the same mechanism which had been followed from 2013 to 2019 so that this project can be implemented in the best possible way.”  
He disclosed that China had agreed to bring more investment into the CPEC project.  
Earlier, speaking at ‘China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Green Development High Level Policy Dialogue’, organised by Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), Mr Iqbal said the CPEC agreement was followed by an investment inflow of $29 billion. 
China’s Ambassador to Pakistan Nong Rong said the focus of Belt and Road Initiative and CPEC was on sustainable initiatives in green infrastructure, green energy, green finance and modern agriculture.  
Separately, APP quoted the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson as saying on Thursday that CPEC  was an important pilot programme under Belt and Road Initiative and China  would continue to work with Pakistan to ensure that the cooperation  outcomes were better delivered to the Pakistani people. “It  focuses on development and people’s livelihood and has got wide command  and recognition from outside,” Wang Wenbin said during his regular  briefing.

4,"Pakistanis seeking work in UAE must have relevant visa, 5,000 dirhams","Development comes after 80 Pakistanis deported for having dummy return tickets, visit visas, inadequate cash.","RAWALPINDI: After 80 Pakistanis were deported from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for having dummy return tickets and other reasons, the Pakistani consulate in Dubai has informed Islamabad that Pakistanis visiting Dubai should have a valid work visa, 5,000 dirhams and a return ticket with them while travelling to the UAE.
In a letter to the Foreign Office on Saturday, the consulate conveyed that entry of these passengers was denied for various reasons and urged the ministry to educate Pakis­tani passengers, seeking employment in the UAE, to acquire a proper work visa.
It said the passengers should hold valid return tickets with a visa and 5,000 dirhams with them when travelling to the UAE. After receiving a query from a passenger at Dubai Airport, the consulate staff visited the airport to find out that the UAE immigration authorities had stopped the entry of around 80 Pakistanis for multiple reasons.

Development comes after 80 Pakistanis deported for having dummy return tickets, visit visas, inadequate cash

Of the deported citizens, 40 were sent back to Pakistan on the same flight they travelled to Dubai while the remaining half returned on various available flights.
The immigration authorities in the Emirates said Pakistani citizens were deported for having visit visas instead of work visas, dummy return tickets and inadequate cash to sustain in the United Arab Emirates.
Most of the deported people reportedly informed the UAE immigration authorities that they had come to the Emirates for employment on visit visas.
The Pakistani mission said it had requested the UAE immigration authorities to allow entry to Pakistani passport holders with valid visas into the UAE, but it was informed that the entry of these passengers was denied because of the above reasons.
The UAE authorities said that all of them should be holding valid return tickets and should be having a minimum amount of AED5,000 in cash.

A delegation of provincial business leaders, headed by Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry (QCCI) President Fida Hussain Baloch Dashti, met Mr Sanjarani to discuss the problems faced by the business community.
Mr Dashti drew the Senate chairman’s attention towards the closure of the bazarcha, saying that despite the availability of every facility, the gateway was not functional.
“[The] delaying tactics in making the bazarcha functional is very disappointing,” said Mr Dashti, adding that it was incurring huge losses for the business community and depriving locals of employment opportunities.
The delegation said the gateway played a key role in the economic development of Balochistan.
The meeting also discussed the issues related to trade with Iran and Afghanistan and suggested various measures to boost bilateral trade.
Mr Sanjarani lauded the role of the QCCI in solving the problems faced by the business community.

8,"LHC dismisses petition for ouster of PM Shehbaz, ministers","PTI's plea stated that PM misused his powers by allowing son, nephew to meet Saudi crown prince during an official visit.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Thursday dismissed as withdrawn a petition filed by the Pakistan Te­­hreek-i-Insaf (PTI), seeking the disqualification of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Fo­­reign Minister Bilawal Bhut­to-Zardari and Interior Mini­ster Rana Sanaullah Khan.
Earlier, Justice Shahid Waheed asked the counsel of the petitioner under what law the respondents could be disqualified. The counsel sought time to prepare his arguments, but the judge turned down the request of the counsel, reminding him that he first got the petition fixed in sum­mer vacations and was now seeking time for arguments.
At this, the counsel sought permission to withdraw the petition, which the judge allowed and dismissed the petition as withdrawn.
The petition was jointly filed by PTI’s former MNA Andleeb Abbas and Advo­c­a­­te Hassaan Khan Niazi plea­ding that the prime minister misused his powers and violated the Constitution by al­­lowing his son Suleman and nephew Hussain Nawaz, both proclaimed offenders, to meet the Saudi crown prince during an official visit.
The petitioners said the PM took his cabinet me­­m­b­ers to London to meet former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and former finance minister Ishaq Dar, both proclaimed offenders before the courts of the country. They submitted that the PM and his cabinet members violated the Official Secret Act, 1923.
They asked the court to disqualify the respondents and also direct the police to initiate criminal proceedings against the prime minister and his cabinet members.
