0,‘Tornado of fire’: Algeria forest blazes kill 38,Deadly forest fires have become an annual scourge in the North African country.,"EL KALA: Algerian firefighters on Thursday battled two dozen blazes fanned by hot winds that have killed at least 38 people and left destruction across the drought-hit North African country.
Deadly forest fires have become an annual scourge in the North African country, where climate change is turning large areas into a tinderbox in the baking summer months.
As residents have lost their homes to the flames, authorities have been accused of being ill-prepared, with few firefighting aircraft available, despite record casualties in last year’s blazes.
The justice ministry has launched an inquiry into the possibility that some of the blazes were started deliberately, after comments to that effect by Interior Minister Kamel Beldjoud. At least 38 people have been killed including more than 10 children, according to multiple sources, including local journalists and the fire service.
Most were in the El Tarf region near Algeria’s eastern border with Tunisia, an area which has been sweltering in 48 degree Celsius (118 Fahrenheit) heat.
At least 200 more people have suffered burns or respiratory problems, according to various Algerian media. Algerian television showed people fleeing their burning homes, women carrying children in their arms.
A journalist in El Tarf described  “scenes of devastation” on the road to El Kala in the country’s far northeast. “A tornado of fire swept everything away in seconds,” he said.  “Most of those who died were surrounded while visiting a wildlife park.” A team in El Kala saw burned-out cars, exhausted people and charred trees amid the strong smell of smoke.
A witness, who asked not to be named, said 12 people had been burned to death in their bus as they tried to escape when the fire ripped through a wildlife park.
The fire service said Thursday afternoon that 1,700 firefighters had been deployed to battle the fires, of which 24 were still raging.
A journalist in the mountainous area of Souk Ahras said that a huge blaze in a forest nearby had sparked panic in the city of half a million people, where nearly 100 women and 17 newborn babies had to be evacuated from a hospital.
The scenes sparked fears of a repeat of the large-scale fires of last year which killed at least 90 people and ravaged 100,000 hectares of forest and farmland in the country’s north. That disaster provoked bitter criticism of authorities over the lack of fire-fighting aircraft.
Authorities have rented a Russian Beriev BE 200 water bomber plane, but it has suffered a breakdown and is not expected to be operational again until Saturday, Interior Minister Kamel Beldjoud said.
The civil protection service and the army do have access to several firefighting helicopters. Experts have called for a major effort to bolster the firefighting capacity of Africa’s biggest country, which has over four million hectares of forest.
One specialist, who asked not to be named, said that in the 1980s the country had 22 Grumman aircraft for battling forest fires but that they had been  “sold on the cheap, without any alternative solution being proposed”.
Algeria had agreed to buy seven firefighting aircraft from Spanish firm Plysa, but cancelled the contract following a diplomatic row over the Western Sahara in late June, according to specialist website Mena Defense.

1,Indian gang ran fake police station,The gang would charge money from locals coming into the fake station to file complaints and cases.,"PATNA: An Indian gang operated a fake police station from a hotel for eight months where they dressed up as officers and are believed to have extorted money from hundreds of people, an official said on Thursday.
Incidents of fraudsters pretending to be police or soldiers are common in India, where there is widespread fear and respect for those in uniform, but setting up a phoney police station takes the scams up a level.
The gang in Bihar state set up shop barely 500 metres (yards) from the home of the actual local police chief and wore uniforms with rank badges and carried guns, police official — a real one — D.C. Srivastava said. 
They would then charge money from locals coming into the fake station to file complaints and cases, while pocketing cash from others by promising to help them secure social housing or jobs in the police.
But the scam fell apart when a genuine police officer spotted two members of the gang carrying guns made in local workshops instead of service-issue weapons. At least six members of the gang including two women were arrested but the ringleader is still at large, Srivastava said.

2,"Russian ship carried ‘stolen’ grain to Syria, alleges Ukraine",Says the vessel was initially destined for the Lebanese port of Tripoli.,"BEIRUT: A Russian cargo ship allegedly carrying stolen Ukrainian grain has reached Syria, Kyiv’s embassy in Beirut said on Thursday, the latest in a series of contested shipments arriving in the war-torn country.
“According to our information, SV KONSTANTIN has docked in Syria,” the embassy said in a statement.
It said the ship was carrying  “grains that were plundered and illegally transported by the Russian occupation authorities”, adding that the vessel was initially destined for the Lebanese port of Tripoli.
Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russian forces of ransacking its grain warehouses since they invaded the country in late February.
The embassy’s statement came as another cargo ship carrying the first shipment of grain allowed to leave Ukraine under a UN-backed deal reportedly unloaded its cargo at the Syrian port of Tartus, which is managed by a Russian firm.
The Sierra Leone-flagged vessel Razoni was expected to arrive in Lebanon, but the shipment’s five-month delay prompted the Lebanese buyer to cancel the deal once the ship was already at sea, Ukrainian officials had said.
According to Samir Madani, co-founder of oil shipping monitoring website TankerTrackers.com, the vessel docked in Tartus earlier this week.
Satellite imagery appeared to show that the ship — which was carrying 26,000 tonnes of corn — was unloading its cargo, Madani tweeted on Thursday.
Earlier this month, a Syrian-flagged ship was briefly seized by Lebanese authorities following similar claims by the Ukrainian embassy that it was laden with stolen cargo.
Lebanon later released the Laodicea vessel after investigations failed to prove it carried stolen goods, drawing criticism from Kyiv’s embassy. The Laodicea started unloading its cargo at Tartus on August 8, according to Syrian state media.
Syria is a staunch ally of Russia, which intervened in the country’s civil war in 2015 to support President Bashar al-Assad’s government.
Moscow has lent Damascus very limited amounts of financial aid, but it has supplied Syria with wheat as a form of assistance.
The Syrian government relies on Moscow for the bulk of its wheat imports.

3,Trump firm’s official pleads guilty to tax fraud,Allen Weiss­elberg served as CFO of the Trump Organisation from 2005 to 2021.,"NEW YORK: Allen Weiss­elberg, the long-time chief financial officer of the Trump Organisation, pleaded guilty on Thursday to tax fraud and agreed to testify at an upcoming criminal trial of the former US president’s real estate company.
The 75-year-old Weiss­elberg, who served as CFO of the Trump Organisation from 2005 to 2021, pleaded guilty to 15 counts of tax fraud, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement.
Weisselberg admitted his involvement in a 15-year scheme with co-defendant the Trump Organisation to defraud federal, New York State and New York City tax authorities, Bragg said.
Weisselberg is to serve five months in prison contingent on his testifying truthfully at the October criminal trial of the Trump Organisation on tax fraud charges, Bragg said.
Weisselberg has steadfastly refused to deliver testimony against Donald Trump personally. The 76-year-old Trump served as president and owner of the Trump Orga­nisation until 2017, when he entered the White House.
But the former Trump Organisation executive could face additional prison time if he fails to testify at the criminal trial of the real estate company. Jury selection in the Trump Organisation trial on tax fraud charges is scheduled to begin October 24, Bragg said.
In the plea agreement, Weisselberg admitted evading payment of taxes due on $1.76 million in unreported income. He will be required to repay nearly $2 million in taxes, penalties and interest.
“Today Allen Weisselberg admitted in court that he used his position at the Trump Organisation to bilk taxpayers and enrich himself,” Bragg said.
“Weisselberg had the Trump Organisation provide him with a rent-free apartment, expensive cars, private school tuition for his grandchildren and new furniture — all without paying required taxes,” he said.
“This plea agreement dir­ectly implicates the Trump Organisation in a wide range of criminal activity and requires Weisselberg to provide invaluable testimony in the upcoming trial against the corporation,” he said.  “We look forward to proving our case in court against the Trump Organisation.”

4,India needs long time to move away from Russia: US,"We recognise every country is going to make its own sovereign decisions, US State Dept spokesperson says.","WASHINGTON: The United States does not see the world “in zero sum terms” and understands that countries like India will need a long time to reorient their policies towards Russia, says the US State Department. 
The department’s spokesperson Ned Price made these remarks at a Wednesday afternoon news briefing in Washington when reminded that India has recently increased its imports of Russian oil and fertilisers and is holding joint military exercises with Moscow. They’re also buying Russian air defence systems. 
“It is not that we see the world in zero sum terms, all or nothing, all in with the United States or not at all,” Mr Price said. “We recognise that … every country around the world is going to make its own sovereign decisions based on its own assessment of its interests and its values.”

The United States, he said, should make it “clear how our shared interests and our shared values often do align, and the dividends that countries around the world could reap from partnership”. 
Mr Price was responding to an American journalist who interpreted India’s refusal to back the US position on Russia as a failure of Washington’s policymakers. “We have seen countries around the world speak clearly, including with their votes in the UN General Assembly, against Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. But we also recognize...that this is not flipping a light switch,” Mr. Price said while answering a question on Russian oil imports by India. 
“This is something that especially for countries that have historical relationships with Russia, relationships that, as is the case with India, extend back decades, it is going to be a long-term proposition to reorient foreign policy away from Russia,” he added.

The YouGov survey of Tory party members for the broadcaster found 66 per cent are voting for Foreign Minister Truss, while 34pc back former finance minister Rishi Sunak. The breakdown only includes those who have voted or plan to. 
As the Conservatives currently have a majority in the UK parliament, either Truss or Sunak will become the country’s prime minister when current leader Boris Johnson leaves early next month.  The poll reported that more than half (57pc) had already cast their votes ahead of the ballot closing September 2. Just over a quarter of those who still intend to cast a vote said they had not yet decided who to back. 
The poll showed Sunak’s support had climbed by two per cent since a similar poll two weeks ago, but the “incremental improvement... would be nothing like enough to rescue the contest for him,” Sky News said.

6,Rogue seal on inland trek through Australian paddocks,SYDNEY: Australian farmers are puzzling over a seal’s curious inland expedition far from its watery home as...,"SYDNEY: Australian farmers are puzzling over a seal’s curious inland expedition far from its watery home as rescuers work to save the marine mammal, local media reported on Thursday.
A dairy farmer in the country’s southeastern Vict­o­ria state said she first spotted the seal galumphing past bemused cows on Sunday. “We went in the tractor down to the paddock and first thought it was a pig.
When it got up and started moving, we saw it was definitely not a pig, it was a seal,” Karli McGee told Australia’s national broadcaster ABC.
The seal is thought to have travelled about 30 kilometres (19 miles) from its coastal habitat before surfacing on a property in Simpson — about two and a half hours from the city of Melbourne.
“All the locals are in shock. A lot of (the seals) know where we live. We are not near the beach, so it is a bit of a surprise,” McGee told ABC.
She said she had contacted authorities and had been told the Melbourne Zoo would assess the animal’s health and carry out its rescue.
It was unclear how the seal travelled so far inland, with McGee saying that it may have navigated local rivers before coming ashore in search of food.

7,Erdogan warns of ‘another Chernobyl’ after talks in Ukraine,"UN chief, Turkish president meet Zelensky; Ukrainian leader ‘surprised’ to hear of Russian peace overtures.","LVIV: U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Russia and Ukraine on Thursday to show a “spirit of compromise” to ensure the continued success of a UN brokered deal, even as Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned of an impending nuclear disaster in Ukraine during his first face-to-face talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky since the invasion began.
“We are worried. We don’t want another Chernobyl,” Erdogan said during a press conference in the eastern city of Lviv, during which he also assured the Ukrainian leader that Ankara was a firm ally.
“While continuing our efforts to find a solution, we remain on the side of our Ukraine friends,” Erdogan said.
Guterres said he was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: “We must tell it like it is — any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide”.

UN chief, Turkish president meet Zelensky; Ukrainian leader ‘surprised’ to hear of Russian peace overtures

Erdogan, who has major geopolitical rivalries with the Kremlin but maintains a close working relationship with President Vladimir Putin, met with the Russian leader less than two weeks ago in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
The Turkish leader along with Guterres were key brokers of a deal inked in Istanbul last month allowing the resumption of grain exports from Ukraine after Russia’s invasion blocked essential global supplies.
Ahead of the press conference with Zelensky, Ukraine’s port authority announced that the 25th cargo ship under the deal had departed for Egypt carrying 33,000 tonnes of grain.
Guterres said after talks in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv that 21 ships had departed from Ukrainian ports under the deal in less than a month, and 15 vessels had left Istanbul for Ukraine to load up with grain and other food supplies. 
“Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I have been clear: There is no solution to the global food crisis without ensuring full global access to Ukraines food products and Russian food and fertilisers,” he told reporters in Lviv. 
“But it is only the beginning. I urge all parties to ensure continued success.” He said the signatories to the agreement had worked professionally and in good faith to keep the food flowing.

8,‘Spanish Stonehenge’ emerges from drought-hit dam,The circle of dozens of megalithic stones is believed to date back to 5000 BC.,"CACERES: A brutal summer has caused havoc for many in rural Spain, but one unexpected side-effect of the country’s worst drought in decades has delighted archaeologists — the emergence of a prehistoric stone circle in a dam whose waterline has receded.
Officially known as the Dolmen of Guadalperal but dubbed the Spanish Stonehenge, the circle of dozens of megalithic stones is believed to date back to 5000 BC.
It currently sits fully exposed in one corner of the Valdecanas reservoir, in the central province of Caceres, where authorities say the water level has dropped to 28pc of capacity.
“It’s a surprise, it’s a rare opportunity to be able to access it,” said archaeologist Enrique Cedillo from Madrid’s Complutense University, one of the experts racing to study the circle before it gets submerged again.
It was discovered by German archaeologist Hugo Obermaier in 1926, but the area was flooded in 1963 in a rural development project under Francisco Franco’s dictatorship. Since then it has only become fully visible four times.
Dolmens are vertically arranged stones usually supporting a flat boulder. Although there are many scattered across Western Europe, little is known about who erected them. Human remains found in or near many have led to an often-cited theory that they are tombs.
Local historical and tourism associations have advocated moving the Guadalperal stones to a museum or elsewhere on dry land.
Their presence is also good news for Ruben Argentas, who owns a small boat tours business.  “The dolmen emerges and the dolmen tourism begins,” he said after a busy day spent shuttling tourists to the site and back. But there is no silver lining for local farmers.
