Both Bilawal and Wajid shot to fame through social media

“Atif Aslam and Haroon Bacha are my ideal music icons. My maiden attempts were singing Ghani Khan, Sahib Shah Sabir and my poet father Layaqzada Layaq but my album contains Pashto poetry of Dr Kazim Niaz with English subtitles. It received stunning appreciation,” he stated.
Wajid Layaq said that he would continue contributing to Pashto folk music. He said that internet provided a wonderful platform to music enthusiasts. He added that young music buffs should come up with innovative ideas to enrich Pashto folk music charts.
“All my productions have earned fans viewership in over thousands which encouraged me and my music band to explore further symphonies that could sweeten ears of the audience online but local flavour must be there with a modern touch,” he said.
Bilawal Sayed is another young music proponent. He graduated in material engineering. He is fast rising to top music chart online due to his weird compositions. Most fans, especially young buffs, are rating him among the best because of his innovative style and strong passion.
Presently staying in Germany in connection with his advanced studies, Bilawal Sayed told this scribe that singing numbers of Ghani Khan, Sahib Shah Sabir and other progressive Pashto poets catapulted him to online popularity.
“Pashtun audience gave serious attention to my experiments with folk music. Music is my passion. I have strong desire to promote Pashto folk music to reclaim peace as identity of land and people,” he said.
He stated that despite hectic study routine, he would devote his strength to contribute to Pashto folk music.

4,Shah Farman gets FIA questionnaire as part of PTI funding probe,"Asad Qaiser skips hearing, saying notice already challenged in court.","PESHAWAR: Former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governor Shah Farman on Thursday appeared before a Federal Investigation Agency team probing a bank account of his party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, operated by him here.
The FIA team handed him over a form containing 23 questions and asked him to fill and return it by Aug 22.
The questions mostly pertain to an account opened in a branch of the Bank Islami (erstwhile KASB) in Peshawar cantonment area on Jan 23, 2010, with the title of the PTI Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and jointly operated by Mr Farman and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser.
Mr Qaiser skipped the hearing and asked the FIA to withdraw the call-up notice until the Peshawar High Court decided his petition against the FIA’s jurisdiction on the matter.

Qaiser skips hearing, saying notice already challenged in court

A high court bench had stopped the agency on Aug 11 from taking ‘any adverse action’ against him.
The bank account in question was disowned by the PTI before the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), which later placed it in the category of ‘unknown’ accounts.
The FIA deputy director (commercial banking circle), Peshawar, had ordered the inquiry in the wake of the Aug 2 ECP pronouncement that the PTI had received funds from prohibited sources.
The call-up notices were issued to Mr Farman and Mr Qaiser by the FIA inquiry officer, sub-inspector Irfanullah, asking them to appear in connection with the inquiry.
Some of the questions put forward to Mr Farman are: “Do you own the bank account in Bank Islami (ex-KASB) Peshawar? 
What was the purpose of opening the account? Being general secretary of PTI KP, part from the above account did you open any other bank accounts for PTI?; before passing resolution for making the bank account have you sought approval from PTI central secretariat, Islamabad?; whether amount was credited in the above account from central account or otherwise?; As per central finance board policy, have you submitted any annual external audit report to CFB regarding fund collections and disbursement?; have you ever declared the above account in Provincial Election Commissioner, KP or ECP Islamabad?; and, why PTI didn’t declare the said bank account before the ECP.”
The former governor was also asked about his profession before the joining of politics, the source of his income before and after beginning his political career, yearly tax payments, and bank accounts operated by him individually or jointly.
According to the ECP’s order, Rs2.11 million was withdrawn and Rs2.127 million was deposited in the bank account.
After appearance before the FIA, Mr Farman told reporters outside the FIA’s headquarters here that he appeared before the inquiry team as he respected national institutions.
He wondered how corruption would be eliminated if politicians didn’t respect institutions and said he would respond to all FIA questions.
The former governor said the bank account in question was never used to receive foreign funds and that Akbar S Babar, who was complainant on the matter with the ECP, was the first to deposit money in that account.
He added that like the former National Assembly speaker, he, too, could move the high court against the FIA inquiry but preferred to appear before investigators.
QAISER PLEA: Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, who was also asked to appear before the FIA team in the case at 2pm, did not turn up.
His lawyer sent a letter to the inquiry officer saying the inquiry’s legality has been challenged in the Peshawar High Court as the FIA doesn’t have jurisdiction on it.
The letter was sent by Barrister Gohar Ali Khan asking the inquiry officer to withdraw the call-up notice.
Mr Gohar said in the letter that his client had filed a petition before the PHC against the ‘assumption of jurisdiction’ by the FIA and a division bench of the court had framed six questions for determination including whether the FIA has the jurisdiction to take cognisance of the matter. He added that as a state functionary, the inquiry officer was bound to wait for the outcome of that petition to be heard on Aug 31.

6,TTP warns nationalists against levelling allegations,Banned outfit says it’s neither anti-state nor working for anti-Pakistan powers.,"PESHAWAR: Showing keenness for the success of the ongoing peace talks with the government of Pakistan, the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has warned ‘secular’ and nationalist groups to stop levelling allegations against the banned outfit.
In a statement issued here on Thursday, TTP said that some pro-western groups were frustrated as situation in Pakistan showed signs of improvement owing to its peace talks with the government.
“These people do not want Pakistan to be peaceful and prosperous. That’s why these groups are trying to create an impression from different platforms that Taliban are being brought to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including the merged districts, 
under the garb of negotiations,” said the statement.
It said that TTP had reiterated its stance on many occasions that it wanted real peace in the country. It added that TTP was neither anti-state nor was it working for anti-Pakistan powers.

Banned outfit says it’s neither anti-state nor working for anti-Pakistan powers and it doesn’t want to clash with any religious or political party

The statement said that TTP did not want to clash with any religious or political party. It warned liberal, secular and nationalist groups to refrain from making baseless propaganda and levelling allegations against it. It added that those parties, keeping under consideration its policies, should not choose the path of confrontation.
“These parties suffered losses in the past because of their wrong policies,” it claimed.
The statement did not threaten any specific nationalist or secular group for spreading baseless allegations against the proscribed outfit. Awami National Party recently highlighted the issue of extortion and resurgence of militants in the province. The party also blamed members of the provincial cabinet for paying extortion to Taliban.
TTP recently denied its involvement in extortion, amid resurgence of armed group in Swat, Dir and other parts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The outlawed group alleged that nationalist and secular groups, who were enemies of the religious values and unity of Pakistan, were spreading disinformation regarding TTP’s involvement in extortion in order to please their masters.
“We (TTP) appeal to all patriotic and Islam loving people to not to pay attention to the baseless propaganda of the atheist elements. These secular and nationalist elements are the enemies of Islam and this country. These groups do not want the supremacy of Islam,” said the statement.
A political analyst, while commenting on the TTP statement, said that the entire world was wondering as to how a particular group could fight against a state for such a long time without any substantial financial resources. 
“Is it possible to continue such a long conflict against the state, without resources,” he questioned.
Commenting on the statement of the proscribed organisation, ANP provincial general secretary MPA Sardar Hussain Babak said that his party had no enmity with any group. He said that the party was following its hundred-year-old narrative that was peace, democracy and development. “Our policy is very clear, and we do politics under these guidelines,” he added.
He said that terrorism had plagued Pakhtun’s land for the last five decades and people had migrated to other parts of the country and abroad because of lawlessness. He said that terrorism affected every sector including economy, education and social values. He added that it was a known fact that ministers of PTI had been paying extortion for long time.
“Only ANP is not party to this conflict. Every Pakhtun should play his role to end this war,” said Mr Babak. He added that violence, suicide attacks and extortion had a severe effect on the society and economy.

10,Christian convert to Islam gets bail in ‘adultery’ case,Peshawar court also confirms his wife’s pre-arrest bail,"PESHAWAR: A local court has granted bail to a man charged with committing adultery following his conversion to Islam from 
Christianity and marriage to a Muslim woman here in 2020.
The additional district and sessions judge also confirmed the pre-arrest bail of his wife,who was also named in the case, directing the police not to arrest her.
The male petitioner, who is the prime accused in the case, was initially charged with kidnapping the woman but the police removed the charge and accused him of committing adultery.
Initially, the woman’s mother had alleged that the main accused, his brother and parents had kidnapped her daughter in Peshawar’s Saddar area on Oct 13, 2020, to force her into marriage.

Peshawar court also confirms his wife’s pre-arrest bail 

She had told police that she had left home to take her little children to school but found her daughter (petitioner) missing on return.
The police later booked the complainant’s daughter on ‘adultery’ charge for marrying the ‘Christian’ prime accused. However, the accused claimed that he had converted to Islam ahead of the marriage.
Advocate Nauman Muhib Kakakhel appeared for both petitioners and contended that the charge against his clients was baseless.
Referring to fatwas (edicts) issued by various schools of Islam, he insisted that after conversion of a non-Muslim man to Islam, a Muslim woman could marry him.
The lawyer insisted that the husband of the petitioner was Muslim and therefore, their marriage was lawful.
He also said that the nikkah (marriage) of his client and her husband was solemnised in accordance with the teachings of Islam.
The counsel said the husband of the petitioner changed his name after conversion to Islam, while their child, too, had a Muslim name.
He argued that the man was a convert to Islam, so he should be considered to be a Muslim in line with the teaching of the Holy Quran and Hadees and that nobody could accused him of holding old faith, Christianity.
He argued that the woman was 19 years of age and was an adult and had married the main accused with her own free will.
He pointed out that the charge of adultery against the couple was baseless as they were legally wedded.
BAIL GRANTED: The Peshawar High Court has granted bail to a man arrested by the counter-terrorism department (CTD) on the charge of keeping explosive substance in his house.
Justice Syed Arshad Ali of a single-member bench accepted the bail petition of the suspect, Noor Janan, on the condition of furnishing two surety bonds of Rs300,000 each.
The CTD personnel had arrested the petitioner on June 8, 2022, during a raid on his house in Kohat and had allegedly recovered 30kg explosives.
He was charged under different provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act and Explosive Substance Act.
Earlier, his bail petition was turned down by Kohat’s anti-terrorism court.
Lawyer Yousaf Khan Mirzader appeared for the petitioner and contended that his client was falsely implicated in the case. He added that the evidence available on record didn’t connect the petitioner with the commission of the offence.

14,Restoration of senior positions streamlines health dept affairs,Posts of additional director-general health services were abolished last year,"PESHAWAR: Restoration of positions of additional director-general health services (ADGHS) has led to streamlining the affairs of the sprawling health department in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, acoording to sources.
The four positions of additional ADGHS were abolished in September which created a lot of problems as it was difficult to run the affairs of the department in their absence.
The director-general health services is required to attend high-level meetings held under the chief minister, health minister and health secretary in addition to travelling to Islamabad for important parleys with federal level health programmes as well as keeping liaison with the international donor agencies.
The top position is meant to implement the government’s policies due to which its occupant remained too busy to look into other matters relating to the employees, procurements, public health and others issues emerging from time to time. The four positions of ADGHS were abolished in September last year due to which there were lot of issues prompting the health department to restore the posts and cope with the affairs effectively, according to sources.

Posts of additional director-general health services were abolished last year

They said that the four ADGH, one each for human resource management, administration, monitoring and evaluation and services worked under the DGHS due to which the latter found time to focus on the main issues. They said that the department had more than 70,000 employees in more than 2,600 health facilities in the province so it was not possible for one DGHS to tackle all the issues efficiently.
Sources said that health was the second largest department after elementary and secondary education with dozens of different cadres having different issues. They said that there were 14 categories only in paramedics in addition to IT section, nursing and doctors, specialist doctors, ad hoc doctors, dentists, district health officers, medical superintendents, requiring different officers at the top level to streamline their affairs.
They said that the importance of the positions was realised by the health minister and health secretary so the posts were restored in June. Four doctors of management cadre in BPS-20 were appointed against the posts. Now one ADGHS looks into the affairs relating to the service matters of the employees and his three colleagues focus on other areas under the direct supervision of the DGHS.
“DGHS, the top implementing officer of the health matters in the province, is still the highest authority but work has been streamlined as the four ADGH perform their assigned duties and send the same for approval to the former,” said sources.
After the abolition of these four positions, the employees of health department faced problems in connection with their service matters whereas different sections of the department also encountered issues, which hampered their progress in various areas.
Sources said that the DGHS remained preoccupied with top level meetings, attended courts when summoned by the judges in connection with matter relating to the health-related programmes, employees and epidemics, so the restoration of those positions were desperately needed to enable him to concentrate on high level matters.
Any of the four ADGHS can participate in meetings and inquiries because they were senior officers and most often the government orders that officers not less than BPS-20 of health department should attend meetings. After merger of health facilities of the erstwhile Fata, the ADGHS played important roles to look into the affairs in the far flung areas, they said.
The reduction in workload enabled the DGHS to focus on overall monitoring of the health situation in the province and issue orders from the government and secretariat to the ADGHS. The DGHS still performs all the work but after receiving complete files from the relevant ADGHS.

WATER SHORTAGE: The residents of Garden Colony here on Thursday urged the Water Supply and Sanitation Company (WSSC) to resolve the problem of severe water shortage in their area. They also demanded construction of a tubewell announced by MPA Ziaullah Bangash last year following their protests. 
Addressing a press conference, Karwan-i-Kohat chairman Saeed Akhtar and secretary general Farhat said WSSC was supplying water from Jarwanda, but denied it to Garden Colony and its streets No 2 and 3 were the most affected. 
When contacted, in-charge of water supply at WSSC, Azmat Shah, challenged the residents’ claim, saying the area of Garden Colony near central Jarwanda was being supplied water two times a day, and the Garden Colony for one and half hours in the morning.
