LAHORE: The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is confident Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan is going to be disqualified in the Toshakhana reference as he has not declared in his assets the amount he received from the sale of state gifts.
“Imran Khan is certain to be disqualified in the Toshakhana reference as he did not declare in his assets the millions of rupees he rece­ived from the sale of state gifts. This is a two-plus-two case. He has done an illegal and immoral act and will be disqualified,” Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said while talking to journalists in Faisalabad on Monday.
Citing the case of his party supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, the minister said: “A standard has been set by disqualifying Nawaz Sharif for not receiving salary from his son’s company. If he can be disqualified over it then Imran Khan is certain to face the same fate for not declaring millions of rupees in his assets that he got after selling the Toshakhana gifts,” he stressed.
Last week, the PML-N-led coalition government filed a reference with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) seeking disqualification of ousted premier Khan from holding public office for allegedly acquiring gifts from the Toshakhana state repository.
The reference demanded the ECP disqualify Imran under sections 2 and 3 of Article 63 of the Constitu­tion, read with Article 62(1)(f). Article 62(1)(f) is the same provision under which former prime minister Nawaz was disqualified in 2017.
A group of MNAs associated with the ruling Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) had filed another reference with the ECP seeking Mr Khan’s disqualification from holding public office for receiving prohibited funds from a number of foreign donors.
On the other hand, PTI senior leader and former minister Pervaiz Khattak said the so-called plans to oust Imran Khan from politics would not succeed. “Only the public can oust Khan from politics and no one else,” he said and declared there was nothing “concrete” against the PTI chairman in the prohibited funding and Toshakhana cases.
Interior Minister Sanaullah further said when a watch gifted to Imran by the ruler of a country was taken to a Dubai market the latter was contacted and asked whether it was stolen. “This was not only an illegal and immoral act, but it also affected Pakistan’s relations with that country,” he claimed.
Arrests in funding, chopper probes
Mr Sanaullah further asserted that the government would make arrests in the Federal Investigation Agency probes into the PTI’s prohibited funding and the malicious social media campaign against the army helicopter crash.
“The government has formed two committees of the FIA -- one probing into the social media smear campaign in the wake of the army’s chopper crash in Lasbela, and the other into PTI’s prohibited funds. Those found guilty in the investigations will be arrested,” Sana announced.
Former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry reminded Sanaullah to go after those (Shehbaz Sharif and Hamza Shehbaz) who were alleged to have laundered billions of rupees instead of forming several committees to probe into Rs20 million charges.
“The coalition government made Hamza Shehbaz, a Rs24 billion money laundering accused, flee to London, but formed five FIA teams to investigate Rs20m charges (against the PTI). Do Shehbaz and company consider the public fool? After Muharram, accountability of the suspects of May 25 will begin and the nation should start preparations for the final round of struggle for real independence,” Chaudhry announced.
PTI warned against violence
The interior minister warned that stricter action than that of May 25 (during the PTI’s long march on Islamabad) would be taken against Imran Khan and the PTI if they resorted to violence in the name of protests to press the government to call early polls.
“The PTI is allowed to hold peaceful protests as it is the constitutional right of the people, but if it resorts to violence or blackmail, the government will take stronger action than that of May 25,” he said, while referring to the PTI’s one-month ultimatum to the government for fresh elections.
Sana’s warning comes a day after former premier Khan said he would announce a strategy to “counter the fascism” of the coalition parties and not budge from his stance of fresh polls being the only solution to steer the country out of the economic crisis.
Sana also taunted Khan for pressing the government to announce a date for elections and at the same time demanding removal of the chief election commissioner (CEC). “You (Imran) should first remove the CEC before demanding fresh elections. You should stick to one stance. Also, you should dissolve the assemblies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab and then ask us for dissolution of the National Assembly,” he commented.
He also blamed Imran Khan for the hateful online campaign against martyrs of the army helicopter crash. He said Afghanistan had not yet blamed Pakistan for a drone attack on its soil in connection with the killing of Al Qaeda leader Zawahiri, but Imran was doing so.
‘Military not angry with PTI’
Meanwhile, former defence minister Pervaiz Khattak of the PTI claimed on Monday that he had been in touch with the military establishment and there was no animosity between the PTI and the army.
Talking to reporters in KP, Mr Khattak claimed: “I am in contact with the army and it is not angry with the PTI.”
He further said the government should first dissolve the Sindh and Balochistan assemblies after which the PTI would follow suit in Punjab and KP. He also asked Nawaz Sharif to return to Pakistan and face Imran Khan one-on-one.

1,"Army unwilling to allow rally at Islamabad's Parade Ground, alleges PTI","Reached conclusion that permission was conditional to 111 Brigade's nod that is not willing to allow rally, says PTI's Ali Awan.","ISLAMABAD: After failing to get permission for its public meeting scheduled for the eve of Independence Day despite proposing three venues in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has decided to shift the event to Lahore.
“We have been told that the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) has already applied for its public meeting at Parade Ground on Aug 13. However, we have reached the conclusion that the permission was conditional to the nod of the 111 Brigade that is not willing to allow us. Otherwise, we would have been allowed one of our proposed venues,” PTI Islamabad president Ali Awan said while talking to Dawn.
On Aug 6, the PTI’s political committee had announced plans to hold a power show in the federal capital on Aug 13, the eve of Independence Day. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by PTI chairman Imran Khan and attended by its senior leadership, including Asad Umar, Fawad Chaudhry, Shireen Mazari, Omar Ayub, Saifullah Niazi and others. Mr Khan had also stated that he would announce his party’s future strategy during the event, and that is why directions were issued to party leaders to ensure an “impressive” show of power.
Mr Awan said the PTI had sought permission from the district administration to hold its public meeting at the Parade Ground, but it was informed that the TLP had already applied for the venue.

Aug 13 power show moved to Lahore

“Then we requested [the administration] to shift the public meeting to Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, but the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) objected to it and we were told that their curators were working there as a security team is expected to visit before the English team’s visit to the country,” he maintained.
“Then we started considering holding the public meeting at Liaquat Bagh, but were told that recently, plantation has been undertaken at the park and there will be very little space for the public meeting,” he added.
The PTI leader further said he reached the conclusion that it was not possible to get permission in the twin cities, as the nod of the army’s 111 Brigade was also required.
“Although we have been told that confirmation has not been given to the TLP yet, it is strange that the TLP can hold a public meeting at the Parade Ground, but not the PTI. So now we have decided to hold the public meeting at Hockey Ground, Lahore,” he announced.
He further said that former premier Imran Khan will address the Lahore gathering, which will be telecast across the country.
“The party chairman will announce a future strategy and we will hold a fireworks display and a flag-hoisting ceremony at midnight,” Mr Awan said.

3,SC says police personnel must be upright,Observation made by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar on appeal against Punjab Services Tribunal's rejection of plea to reinstate ASI.,"ISLAMABAD: The Sup­reme Court has held that police personnel should be upright and have an unimpea­chable cha­r­acter, as well as clean antecedents, since the job demands accountability at every step and places a tremendous responsibility on them.
The observation came in a judgement authored by Jus­tice Muhammad Ali Maz­har on an appeal against a decision by the Punjab Services Tribunal which rejected a plea by an assistant sub-inspector of police on Sept 22, 2020.
The Supreme Court bench comprised Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Sajjad Ali Shah and Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar.
Faraz Naveed was appo­inted as assistant sub-inspe­ctor through the Punjab Public Service Commission.
He was charged with murdering Tufail Haider Naqvi at a police station in Gujrat in Nov 2014 after keeping him in illegal confinement.
He was indicted under Section 302 PPC and the Anti-Terrorist Act (ATA), read with Article 155-C of the Police Order, 2002.
On Nov 5, 2014, the petitioner along with other police officials Thereafter, the petitioner murdered him with a hatchet in a room within the premises of the police station.
An anti-terrorist court (ATC) awarded Faraz Naveed the death sentence under Section 302 PPC and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorist Act. He was also sentenced to three years in jail under Article 16 (d) of the Police Order 2002. The ASI then took his appeal to the Punjab Services Tribunal (PST), but it found the petitioner guilty and recommended departmental action against him.
Faraz Naveed was later dismissed from service.
He challenged his conviction in the Lahore High Court, which acquitted the petitioner by giving him the benefit of doubt.
While he was in jail, he was served a show cause notice on Nov 8, 2014, and dismissed from service on Jan 10, 2015, after departmental inquiry.
But after he was acquitted, the petitioner filed a departmental appeal, but it was rejected. He then filed an appeal with the Punjab Service Tribunal, but it too dismissed the plea on Sept 22, 2020.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar of the Supreme Court observed in the judgement that despite acquittal, it was the prerogative of Faraz Naveed’s employer, the Punjab Police, to reinstate or disregard his request for reinstatement.
It is for the department to examine equitably whether the petitioner has been completely exonerated or not and to satisfy itself that his reinduction would not become a threat to discipline in the police force.
A person having criminal antecedents would not be fit to be reinstated to his previous position, the judgement observed.
It further said the apex court did not find any illegality or perversity in the dismissal order. Therefore, the present petition is refused, the verdict explained.
The benefit of doubt, as of right, should be given to an accused when there is an equal possibility of the accused being guilty or not guilty, the Supreme Court said.
Two interpretations
The benefit of doubt, according to the judgement, can be extended to an accused only if the facts and circumstances of the prosecution case were susceptible and amenable to two interpretations, one in favour of the prosecution and the other in support of the accused,
But an employer, while considering the issue of reinstatement as aftermath of acquittal of an already dismissed employee, will have the unbridled right and authority to dwell on and appraise the antecedent and fitness of the employee, the judgement said.
In the absence of any provision in the service rules for reinstatement, if an employee is honourably acquitted by a court, no right is conferred on the employee to claim any benefit, including that of reinstatement.
The reason is that the standard of proof required for holding a person guilty by a criminal court and the inquiry conducted by way of disciplinary proceeding is entirely different.
The rationale of initiating disciplinary proceedings by the employer is to see whether the charges of misconduct levelled against the delinquent are proved or not and in case his guilt is proved, what action should be taken against him, the judgement explained.
It is a settled exposition of law that the prosecution, in criminal cases as well as in a departmental inquiry on the same allegation, can be conducted and continued concurrently at both venues without having any overriding or overlapping effect.
The object of a criminal trial is to award punishment of the offences committed by the accused while the departmental inquiry is initiated to investigate allegations of misconduct, the judgement said.
In the departmental inquiry, the standard of proof is that of “balance of probabilities or preponderance of evidence”, but not “proof beyond reasonable doubt” – a strict proof required in a criminal trial because the potential penalties are severe, the verdict explained.

4,"Commanders of Peshawar, Bahawalpur reshuffled","With his latest posting, it appears Gen Faiz has been taken off from the overall Afghan and TTP-related matters.","ISLAMABAD: Three lieutenant generals were transferred and posted on Monday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) announced.
Corps Commander Peshawar Lt Gen Faiz Hameed was appointed Bahawalpur corps commander, replacing Lt Gen Khalid Zia, who has been appointed the military secretary GHQ. Military Secretary Lt Gen Sardar Hassan Azhar Hayat has been appointed as the Peshawar corps commander.
Gen Faiz Hameed’s transfer is a bit surprising as he had served less than a year as Peshawar corps commander. Earlier, he had served as the director general of Inter-Services Intelligence, where he unnecessarily got embroiled in a controversy over the then prime minister Imran Khan’s refusal to post him out from ISI.
Gen Hameed had remained involved in striking a deal with the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, as well as in Afghan affairs, both as head of the ISI and as Peshawar corps commander.
With his latest posting, it appears he has been taken off from the overall Afghan and TTP-related matters.

5,Khorasani among three TTP men killed in Afghan blast,Hardline ‘commander’ was part of Taliban team holding talks with govt,"

Omar Khalid Khorasani

 
NORTH WAZIRISTAN: The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pak­is­tan lost one of its most hardliner ‘commanders’, Abdul Wali alias Omar Khalid Khorasani, in a bomb blast in the Afghan province of Paktika, the proscribed group and security sources across the border in Afghanistan confirmed on Monday.
Two other ‘commanders’ of the outfit were killed in the bomb attack that occu­rred in Saraki village of Birmal tehsil of Afghanis­tan, near the Pakistan border, on Sunday.
While confirming the incident, TTP spokesman Mohammed Khorasani said Omar Khalid Khorasani, Mufti Hassan and Hafiz Dawlat were killed in the bombing.
According to TTP sources, an improvised explosive device (IED) hit the vehicle carrying Khorasani and the other ‘commanders’. Funeral prayers were held in Afghanistan on Monday. Khorasani’s death occur­red at a time when the outfit has been enga­ged in extensive peace talks with the government of Pakistan in the Afghan capital, in order to end the two decades long militancy in the region.

Hardline ‘commander’ was part of Taliban team holding talks with govt

The Taliban interim government has been facilitating talks between the two sides. Islamabad has sent several delegations, comprising religious scholars and tribal elders, to convince the TTP leadership to give up armed struggle.
Khorasani, who belonged to Mohmand tribal district, was also a member of TTP’s powerful Guidance Council. Sources said he was part of the TTP delegation that is holding peace talks with the Pakistani government. Khorasani has seen as more extreme than the hardliners within the TTP.
The talks between the two sides remained inconclusive so far.
“He (Khorasani) had taken a hawkish position in peace talks in Kabul and the TTP leadership was made aware of this fact,” said one source. TTP has lost several of its key commanders, including its chief Maulvi Fazlullah, in mysterious blasts or drone attacks in Afghanistan.
Khorasani became member of TTP in 2004-05. He claimed responsibility for various attacks on security forces, schools and suicide bombings in Mohmand district in which scores of people were killed and wounded.
Initially, he was head of Tehreek-i-Taliban Mohmand (TTM). Later, the group joined TTP. In 2014, he formed his own group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) and was ousted by the Mullah Fazlullah-led group. The same year JuA swore allegiance to the militant Islamic State group. However, a year later he rejoined TTP.
It may be mentioned that Khorasani was one of the founding members of TTP. He had strong links to Al Qaeda and Ayman al Zawahiri.
Sources said Hafiz Daulat, who belonged to Orakzai tribal district, had also affiliation with IS’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter while Hassan hailed from Malakand Division.
Pakistani officials said Omar Khalid Khorasani’s death could deal a blow to nascent peace talks with TTP, according to Reuters.
JuA was designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations and United States, which had offered $3 million for information leading to Khorasani’s capture or death.

6,Probe team on online drive now a JIT with intel officials,"Six-member team comprises four FIA officers, one each from ISI and IB; PTI’s Asad Umar warns against targeting party.","• Six-member team comprises four FIA officers, one each from ISI and IB
• PTI’s Asad Umar warns against targeting party
ISLAMABAD / KARACHI: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) team — formed to trace and arrest those running a negative social media campaign on the tragic army helicopter crash in Balochistan — has been reconstituted and converted into a joint investigation team (JIT) with representation from the premier intelligence bodies, besides the four FIA officials announced on Sunday.
According to a notification issued by the Interior Ministry on Monday, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the six-member JIT includes Lt Col Saad from the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Intelli­gence Bureau (IB) Deputy Director Waqar Nisar Chaudhry.
The four FIA members on the team were Additional Director General (Cybercrime Wing) Muhammad Jaffar, Director (Cybercrime, North) Waqar­uddin Syed, Islamabad Addi­tional Director (Cybercrime Wing) Ayaz Khan and Assistant Director Imran Haider.
The JIT has been tasked with identifying and taking legal action against those involved in running a negative social media campaign on the helicopter crash. After the accident, some social media activists and political zealots launched the deplorable hate campaign online to advance their personal and political malice, which drew a strong reaction from the general public, political leadership and the state institutions.
While the FIA is said to have started putting in place a monitoring system to gather all relevant data, the PTI has warned that any attempts to malign the party under the cover of this malicious campaign would elicit a strong response.
The agency has apparently mobilised all its cybercrime centres in its north zone and deployed its experts, who in the first phase had started acquiring relevant data from social media platforms.
“The teams are using all necessary tools and software for result-oriented efforts,” said an FIA source. “There are known social media platforms, which were used for this negative campaign, and are being monitored. Even the negative posts that were later deleted after public outcry are being retrieved to get an idea of the origin of this content and the people behind their generation.”
PTI vows to prove lies
On the other hand, the PTI vowed that if it was attacked in the name of the FIA probe, it had all the due “capability, skills and human resources” of social media to prove the lies and bring forth the truth.
“We have all the skills and resources to carry out the forensic analysis of any social media campaign,” PTI Secretary General Asad Umar told Dawn. “It’s ridiculous to blame and target the PTI for this campaign. We have a very strong social media team, which has always worked for awareness and respect of the institutions. We have the capability to determine and trace who’s behind all this negative campaign.”
The former minister welcomed the move to penalise those who were running the negative campaign against the institutions, but demanded that any move should be in line with the defined rules and not intended for political vendetta.
He then referred to a youth, who was identified as one of those behind the smear campaign against the army and had later apologised in a video statement for the “objectionable” posts on his accounts.
“That particular boy didn’t have many followers nor was a known person,” he said. “But to make a case, his unnoticed tweets were used by some influencers and media professionals with hundreds of thousands of followers. This proves that it’s more to settle scores than showing respect for any institution.”
The PTI’s response comes in the wake of the ruling coalition in the Centre blaming the social media team of the party for launching the hate campaign at the behest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan. The PTI leadership was also accused of not attending the funeral of Lt Gen Sarfaraz Ali and other martyrs of the chopper crash. However, they attempted to negate the impression, as President Arif Alvi telephoned the families of the martyrs, while Mr Khan visited the residence of Lt Gen Ali.
President Alvi also came under sharp criticism for not attending the martyrs’ funeral being the supreme commander of the armed forces.
Some social media users had alleged the helicopter crash was ‘orchestrated through a conspiracy by the establishment’, however the Pakistan Army spokesperson condemned the negative online propaganda.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general had on Friday condemned the “highly unacceptable and regretful social media campaign” after the unfortunate incident. “The online campaign caused deep anguish and distress among the families of martyrs and rank and file of the armed forces,” the ISPR in a statement.
“While the whole nation stood with the institution in this difficult time, certain insensitive quarters resorted to hurtful & derogatory comments on social media,” it said.
