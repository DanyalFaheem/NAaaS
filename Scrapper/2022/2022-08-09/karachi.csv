1,Victim families await justice as 2009 Ashura blast case file gathers dust,"13 years on, no progress made to arrest absconders; three ‘Jundullah militant’ reportedly killed.","KARACHI: Senior journalist and Karachi bureau chief of Geo News Faheem Siddiqui is busy in planning for the coverage of the religious events of Ashura in the city. However, the activity every year reminds him of the painful events of 2009 Muharram he would never want to repeat in his life as a father, but has to go through as a newsman. 
“Obviously, it causes pain. I lost my first child on this day. I lost my niece too,” says Mr Siddiqui referring to the Ashura bomb blast in which more than 45 people were killed on M.A. Jinnah Road on December 28, 2009. Mr Siddiqui’s six-year-old son, Bazil Ahmed Siddiqui, and 13-year-old niece, Anzalna Hanif, were among those killed in the attack. 
“We remained issueless for five years after the martyrdom of our son,” the 49-year-old tells Dawn in a gagged voice. Then, Allah, the Almighty, blessed us with three kids, all of them are boys,” he says. “But, the pain for losing our firstborn still haunts us. If Bazil were alive, he would have been 19 today,” adds the father, helplessly. 
Mr Siddiqui is among dozens of families of the victims of the tragic incident that shook the nation in general. And they are all awaiting justice for the past 13 years, as the country’s security establishment fails to re-arrest the three Jundullah militants allegedly involved in the bombing, who had escaped from the custody of the police days after their arrest. 

13 years on, no progress made to arrest absconders; three ‘Jundullah militant’ reportedly killed

The high-profile Ashura bombing case files are gathering dust in the storeroom of an antiterrorism court (ATC) as Rangers and police are yet to re-arrest the suspects, who had escaped from City Courts. 
Four Jundullah men — Murtaza alias Shakil, Mohammad Saqib Farooqui, Wazir Mohammad and Murad Shah — were arrested in January 2010 and booked in four cases pertaining to a series of attacks on Muharram processions in Karachi in 2009.
“The four cases pertaining to the targeted attacks on the mourning processions, including the one on the main Ashura procession, remain shelved in the court’s custody since October 2010 for want of accused,” judicial staffers told Dawn. 
Witnesses had reportedly identified four detained suspects during an identification parade held before a judicial magistrate at a pre-trial stage in the cases, according to prosecution officials. 
The Jundullah militants, who were arrested after a shoot-out at Hawkesbay in 2010 and had allegedly confessed to the attacks, had escaped from the City Court the same year. 
All the suspects were reportedly got freed from police custody by their accomplices after a gun attack on the premises of the crowded City Courts judicial complex on M. A. Jinnah Road, where the police had produced them in another case registered against them by the Anti-Car Lifting Cell on June 20, 2010. 
Case still on dormant file
One of the four suspects, Murad Shah, was killed while fleeing, but his alleged accomplices were never caught again. 
“After the suspects managed to flee, the investigating officer (IO) informed the ATC-III about it,” said an official. 
“Subsequently, the court kept the cases ‘dormant’ because the police and other law enforcement agencies have yet to show any progress regarding the arrest of the suspects, who remain at large after a decade,” added the official. 
“The case is still ‘dormant’, as there is no progress till the day,” a judicial official at the trial court told Dawn. “It means the accused are still absconding and have not been brought to the court,” the official added. 
The trial court had issued life warrants for the arrest of the three suspects on Oct 7, 2010 directing the police to produce them in court “as soon as possible”. 
The Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of police had at the time of their arrest claimed that the suspects were ‘high-profile’ criminals associated with the proscribed outfit. However, they were not tried in a court inside the central prison and jail authorities sent them to the city courts without making proper security arrangements. 
It was the responsibility of the IOs to ask or recommend to the home department through a letter to notify the jail trial of hardened criminals in high-profile cases or if the jail authorities had insufficient security arrangement to take them to courts. 
Delay favours accused
Legal experts believed that the prolonged suspension of the proceedings in such high-profile cases always benefited the accused party as prosecution witnesses might change their residences or go underground. 
Also, it is hard for a witness to remember the exact evidence for years while it is also a difficult task for the IOs to maintain the case property, police files and stay in touch with their witnesses, they added. 
The SIU arrested the suspected militants following a shoot-out on Hawkesbay Road on Jan 23, 2010 and claimed that they had allegedly confessed to have carried out the attacks on the Muharram processions. 
Subsequently, they were charge-sheeted under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and their cases were sent to the ATC-III for trial. However, they escaped before their indictment. 
Murtaza and Saqib were booked for killing over 45 people and wounding about 100 others in the bomb attack on the main Ashura procession on Dec 28, 2009. 
Police filed a charge sheet against the duo in the Paposh Nagar blast that took place on Dec 26, 2009 when an 8th Muharram procession was passing by and it left 13 people wounded. 
They also filed a charge sheet against deceased Murad Shah in a case pertaining to a low-intensity blast that targeted a 9th Muharram procession in Qasba Colony on Dec 27, 2009. 
Besides, the four suspects were also booked in a case registered under Sections 4/5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 read with Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the ATA at the Sir Syed police station, as the police claimed to have recovered explosive material on a lead provided by them. 
Prosecutor general says absconders killed Sindh Prosecutor General Dr Faiz Shah had last year made a disclosure about the three fleeing suspects by saying that “they were also killed in a shootout with law-enforcers”. 
Without elaborating further, Mr Shah had said that according to the IO of the case the absconding suspects had been killed in an encounter. 
Talking to Dawn, Dr Shah said that the “situation is the same” and the case was still dormant as there was no progress.
After the lapse of 13 years, Mr Shah’s claim gives the case yet another interesting twist as to whether the law-enforcers have failed to re-arrest the fleeing suspects or they have been killed in an encounter. 
In both conditions, the relatives of the victims as well as the survivors of the main Ashura attack still await justice. 
Back in his office, journalist Siddiqui is not only preparing himself for the coverage of this year’s Ashura procession, but also bracing himself to go through the same pain yet again.

2,Guard arrested for beating pregnant woman in Karachi's Jauhar area,"“Police have taken action on a viral video on social media wherein a guard is seen torturing a woman,” says East-SSP.","KARACHI: A private security guard was arrested on charges of beating a pregnant woman after CCTV footage of the incident went viral on social media, prompting Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to order his arrest. 
“Police have taken action on a viral video on social media wherein a guard is seen torturing a woman,” said East-SSP Syed Abdul Rahim Sherazi.
He said that the guard, identified as Daud, was arrested in Noman Grand City, an apartment complex in Gulistan-i-Jauhar.
An FIR (745/2002) was lodged against him under Sections 337 (Shajjah), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of victim Sana Akram, he added.
The complainant stated in the FIR that she worked as domestic help at a flat in the apartment complex. 
On the night of Aug 5, she said, her son, Sohail, had come at the reception of the complex to give her food but Abdul Nasir, Adil Khan, Mehmood Khalil and others of the flat union did not allow him to go to the flat. Upon which, she came downstairs and asked as to why they were not allowing her son. This enraged Adil, who started using swear words against her and then asked security guard Daud to beat her. The guard slapped her and then kicked her when she fell.
“I am five to six months pregnant...I felt pain and became unconscious,” she stated in the FIR.
The video of the incident went viral on social media and CM Shah took notice of it and directed the city police chief to arrest the person who dared attacking an innocent woman.

3,MQM-P asks PM to ensure fairness in delimitation,Wonders as to why and how PPP-led govt carried out delimitation when it is actually ECP's job.,"KARACHI: Expressing concern over the delimitation process carried out by the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan on Monday asked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to play his role for justified delimitation of constituencies in urban parts of Sindh.
It wondered as to why and how the PPP-led government carried out delimitation in Sindh when it was actually the job of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
These concerns were expressed by the coordination committee of the MQM-P, which met here at its temporary headquarters in Bahadurabad.
“It’s high time that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should play his role for the justified process mainly in urban Sindh and other parts of the province,” said an MQM-P statement. “On the directives of the Supreme Court, it’s the job of the ECP to carry out delimitation but it was the Sindh government of PPP which undertook this exercise.”
The meeting, it said, also expressed concern on the delay in implementation of the terms of the “Charter of Rights” signed between the MQM-P and PPP and MQM-P and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz in March 2022.

4,"Urban flooding alert issued for Karachi, other Sindh cities",Met office says heaviest rain spell expected on Thursday; fishermen advised to take extra care till Aug 13.,"KARACHI: The Met office released on Monday an urban flooding alert for Karachi and other cities as monsoon currents penetrating in Sindh are likely to become more intense from Tuesday (today) onwards.
Speaking to Dawn, chief meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz explained that the prevailing weather system was expected to turn intense gradually, first taking over southeast parts of Sindh on Tuesday afternoon or in the evening and then northeast areas including Karachi late at night with scattered heavy falls.
He said the heaviest spell is expected from Aug 11 onwards when the low pressure area building up in eastern India would enter Pakistan and gain strength from the conditions prevailing over the Arabian Sea.
“Then, it is likely to affect the whole of Sindh. But, before that, there would be scattered moderate to heavy falls on and off in several parts of the province,” he said, adding that the prevailing weather system had blocked sea breeze, causing warm, humid conditions in Karachi.

Met office says heaviest rain spell expected on Thursday; fishermen advised to take extra care till 13th

Sea conditions are likely to become rough/very rough during August 10-13 and fishermen are advised to take extra care, the Met department alert stated.

5,Study highlights severe inequities in water access in Karachi,94pc samples tested in city's Lyari area were found contaminated.,"KARACHI: Lyari’s water problem, and those of similar settlements across Karachi, cannot be resolved by only augmenting water supply as often stated in public discourse and water utility plans. Rather, institutional structures and policies are needed to ensure equitable access to existing water supply system, says a study recently published in an international journal.
It demonstrates how poor performance of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) has led to severe inequities in water access in Lyari, forcing the poorest to spend the most for the least volume of water and compromise on the quality of life in pursuit of water.
Titled Beyond water scarcity: Water (in) security and social justice in Karachi, the research is published in the Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies.  
It is authored by Dr Hassaan F. Khan, Assistant Professor of environmental sciences at Habib University (HU) and Director of the Karachi Water Project, and Syed Ali Arshad, a Habib alumnus, while the field work was done by university’s undergraduate researchers.

94pc samples tested in Lyari found contaminated

The study quantifies how limited access to the water network contributes to household water insecurity beyond just a “shortage” of water which tends to hijack almost all discourse on water in Karachi.
In the first phase, 465 household surveys across Lyari’s 11 union councils were conducted and analysed, followed by interviews and participant observations.
According to the study, only about 28 per cent of dwellings in Karachi (where nearly half the population lives in informal settlements) have reliable access to municipal piped water.
Public discourse, it says, understands Karachi’s burgeoning water crisis through reasons like dwindling reserves and a growing demand-supply. This dominant narrative of water scarcity has swayed attention away from how poorer populations have to involve in alliances/conflicts for access to water on a daily basis.
“Weak urban water governance in Lyari contributes in pushing vulnerable sections of the population further to the margins. The intermittent piped water supply in Lyari is inadequate, unsafe, unreliable and inconvenient,” it said, and added: “This forces many households to resort to additional costlier and inconvenient sources of water and leads to severe inequities in water access. Lower-income populations are especially affected and pay disproportionately higher amounts for a much lower water consumption.”
According to the study, Lyari with an approximate population of 660,000, grew as a largely informal settlement, which was regularised only after the 1970s, where the new government provided 90-year leases to households, and allowed Lyari to be considered in the city’s water infrastructure plans.
The water quality tests for bacterial contamination from 79 selected households in sample population reinforce these findings: an alarming 92.4pc of households’ drinking water tested positive for presence of Total Coliform; 77.2pc of these households drinking water samples showed presence of E-coli, which is a primary cause for several waterborne diseases.
Despite this, a sustained culture of lax governance by state institutions allowed the region to become a “gray zone of state power” categorised by rule of criminal syndicates, practices of political patronage, and a dramatic growth of illegal high-rise apartments. 
“Consequently, amenities like water supply were influenced by these actors and developments, causing marginalisation and displacement of certain communities: whilst the groups with better social/political capital were able to settle in areas with better water access, the poorest communities, such as the native Sindhi Mahigeer community and the rural-urban migrant Zikri community continued living in regions in the southwestern wing with poor access to piped water,” the study says.
For all surveyed households with piped water connection, the median for total water supply per week is only 3.5hours.
“Several hours spent daily in collection and transportation of limited quantities of water can cause bodily and emotional distress, especially among women compromise personal hygiene, and prevent pursuit of opportunities that can result in improved outcomes, such as economic activities and education,” the study says.
As many as 95pc of all the households that have to travel for water, complained about physical exhaustion caused by activities, including carrying large quantities of water in hand, on back or over their heads on a daily basis, as well as having to stand in lines, especially during scorching weathers during summer season. 
Finally, when residents are unable to access enough water through either piped supply or other free sources, they have to resort to using the readily available, albeit considerably more expensive sources like tanker service, Mushki, and other vendors.
For lower-income households, buying this water involves major cuts on other household expenses, especially during summer when prices increased significantly owing to increased consumption.
The study points out that KWSB is not able to generate sufficient revenue for any improved services. Survey results show that as many as 80pc of all households with pipeline connections, two-thirds of whom get regular supply of water, do not receive a water bill. 
In situations where households have maintained “illegal connections” or live in non-leased houses, officials claim that the KWSB is unable to send water bills.
However, even for households that do maintain a lease and have been provided authorised water pipeline connections, the majority continue to utilise water supply without receiving any bill. According to the water utility’s executive engineer for the region, such households have not “registered themselves with the service”. 
“In other words, in order to get billed, the onus is actually on the consumers themselves to visit KWSB’s revenue offices and document their connection to the system,” the study says.

6,The car workshop owner and Niaz-i-Husain at Lucky Star,"KARACHI: Every year as Muharram begins and Ashura approaches, the people of Karachi remember hundreds of the...","KARACHI: Every year as Muharram begins and Ashura approaches, the people of Karachi remember hundreds of the cauldrons of haleem that would be lined up for distribution of Niaz-i-Husain along Dr Daudpota Road, better known as the Lucky Star area. 
The haleem would be cooked and distributed for free among devotees and passers-by under the supervision of the owner of a vehicle’s axle and suspension repair workshop, Shah Jee Axle Walay. 
Several years have passed and you don’t see Shah Jee, a tall, well-built figure with a big bushy moustache and dark brown sunglasses, there anymore. Off and on there have been nostalgic mentions of the Ashura day dish on social media. There has been lots of speculation, too, about what happened to Shah Jee. 
Some say that he passed on while his sons took their shares in the business to go their separate ways. Some say that the business empire of Shah Jee is not what it used to be and thus he can no longer afford to organise the mass niaz. Still, no one really knows for sure what happened to Shah Jee. 
Dawn set out to get the real story. The place to begin our search was right there under our very noses where it all used to happen — Lucky Star.
At the biggest adjoining Shah Jee Axle Walay workshops in Saddar, we run into another tall gentleman with bushy moustache and shoulder-length hair supervising the work. He resembles the picture of Shah Jee on the shop’s banner. It turns out that he is Nazim Shah, his son. 
The first question we have for Nazim Shah is about Shah Jee’s whereabouts while bracing ourselves to be informed about the worst. But to our relief, we are informed that Shah Jee is still very much around though in Islamabad. “He had a paralysis attack some years ago which has left him not as active as he used to be,” the son informs. 
“My sister is married to the son of my uncle [Shah Jee’s elder brother]. They live in Islamabad. After my elder uncle’s passing, my sister and her husband were insisting that our father come to live with them because they were lonely. Then after he suffered a stroke, he also decided to move to Islamabad. In his eighties now, he is getting old also, and his health is not what it used to be anyway,” he says. 
Another partner in the vehicle repair workshop business, Riazuddin, recalls that the last big Muharram niaz organised by Shah Jee comprised 400 cauldrons of haleem for which they had sacrificed some 60 bulls and cows. 
“He wouldn’t even sit down for a breather,” he smiles. “Seeing his enthusiasm and goodwill, despite being Sunni, some cattle breeders sold their huge Australian cows worth Rs2,500,000 each to Shah Jee for Rs700,000 each. It was for a good cause.” 
The partner also explains that Shah Jee’s popularity and his famous workshop earned them plenty of enemies, too. “So many workshops sprang up all over the city claiming to be our branches. We had to go into litigation to shut them down. Now there are only three big genuine Shah Jee workshops — one here, one in Gulshan-i-Iqbal Block 7 near Disco Bakery and one at Safoora Chowrangi on University Road — run by his sons Nazim Shah, Azam Shah and Tahir Shah. The litigation process also moved away our attention from philanthropy,” he says. 
“Besides being a huge philanthropist and social worker, Shah Jee also had political leaning with the PML-N. In his prime, back in 1997, he had even brought a lion to this place. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, too, visited Lucky Star twice. Shah Jee also used to organise football matches, martial arts demonstrations, kick-boxing and bodybuilding competitions here. He had set up several sports clubs, too. Besides, he would organise a 14th-August rally that began from Lucky Star; he would set up relief camps during natural calamities and celebrate Eid Miladun Nabi in a big way here. But after his health started deteriorating some 20 years ago, things slowed down,” he shares. 
Shah Jee’s sons and business partners still do organise the famous Niaz-i-Husain at Lucky Star but, obviously, it is not done on as big a scale as their father used to do.

7,Appellants told to file rejoinder in plea against Karachi's Malir Expressway,The tribunal has adjourned the proceedings till Aug 17.,"KARACHI: The Sindh Environmental Tribunal has asked the counsel for the residents and environmentalists to make rebuttal to the reply filed by a private firm constructing the controversial Malir Expressway project.
The tribunal, headed by retired Justice Nisar Ahmed Shaikh, asked advocates Kazim Hussain Mahesar and Muhammad Imran Kalmati to file the rebuttal on the next date and adjourned the hearing on appeals challenging the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) approval of the project.
The tribunal has adjourned the proceedings till Aug 17.
The location of the project, as per the EIA approval, is starting from right before the Jam Sadiq bridge on Korangi Road and run along the right bank of the Malir river through the Korangi and Malir districts, terminating on M-9 near DHA City outside Karachi.
On a previous hearing, Advocate Ravi Pinjani, who represented M/s Malir Expressway Limited, had filed a copy of the ‘fresh’ EIA report dated June 10 and signed by Sepa director general Muhammad Naeem Mughal, removing the appellants’ objection that the earlier EIA report was signed by a deputy director who got no legal authority to issue such an approval under the law.
Regarding the merits of the appeals, the counsel had argued that the appellants never raised any environmental concerns with regard to the environment of the metropolis.
He had objected that since the tribunal’s domain was environmental concerns therefore the appeals should be dismissed for lacking merit since the appellants did not highlight any environmental adversity in the proposed project.
The lawyer also challenged the appellants` locus standi, arguing that they were not directly aggrieved by the proposed project, while they did not highlight any adversity by the proposed cutting of trees or air pollution, etc, in their appeals.
He maintained that with the construction of the Malir Expressway “we will have primary advantage that western portion of the metropolis is connected through bypasses, but there is no such bypasses connectivity in the eastern corridor. Therefore, this project will connect the city with far-flung parts, including Korangi Industrial Area, the Defence Housing Authority and other areas on the outskirts”.
Advocate Pinjani argued that at present the average daily commuting time in the eastern corridor was 90 minutes, adding that with the construction of Malir Expressway this commuting time would be reduced to 30 minutes on an average day. “The overall impact is positive for the metropolis, since this is not any commercial or residential project, but a highway,” he claimed.
The company’s lawyer had also maintained that around 1,800 trees coming in the way of the expressway were to be cut down, but Sepa had advised to grow 19,000 trees with three rows of trees cover on either side of the expressway to maintain environmental balance in the area.
Lastly, the counsel had submitted that the project currently costing Rs27 billion, out of which 72 per cent is publically funded since its a consortium of banks and the Sindh government.
Opposing the appellants’ requests for granting an interim stay order against any construction activity at the site, Advocate Pinjani had cautioned that if due to any technical reasons the project was stayed the costs would spiral up given the growing rate of inflation. 
He pleaded to dismiss the appeals for being devoid of merits.

They have kept the distinction intact for decades.
The community is concentrated in Hazara Colony in Hussainabad, which witnesses multiple activities during Muharram ranging from serving of ‘langar’ (free food) to staging of old mourning processions. 
Mallah and Solangi communities were the oldest ones living in the area followed by those whose elders migrated from India and Hazaras. Several houses of their community are located in Hazara Colony mainly close to the protective bund.
Hazaras, usually, pass a low profile life even though they are serving in government departments. However, when it comes to Ashura, the Hazara men including young and elderly lead the central Ashura’s procession on 10th of Muharram here. They would keep the tradition intact even tis day, they resolved.
Hazara Imambargah is located a few paces from the protective bund. Members of the community profess Asna Ashari sect among Fiqah-i-Jafria and have been living in the area for close to seven decades. Because of distinct facial features this ethnic community is easily distinguishable.
Ashura (today’s) central procession emanates from Qadamgah Maula Ali off Station Road. Hazaras’ dasta (circle) remains in the forefront of a procession staged under the aegis of Anjuman-i-Hyderi (AH), registered in 1948. 
“Our dasta is the first among all Anjumans without any fear while other Anjumans get their numbers after balloting,” says a bearded Hamid Hussain, administrator of Hussainabad’s Hazara Imambargah. 
“We never felt frightened or threatened even when Hazara community members were being massacred in various parts of the country, particularly in Balochistan. We had led Ashura’s procession even in those days without having any fear,” said a confident looking Hamid Hazara.
Hyder Ali, his young fellow who works in a private school, is incumbent general secretary of the community’s Anjuman after the death of his father. 
The 7th Muharram mehndi of Shahzada Qasim was one of the important events of the community in Hussainabad. It is held inside an Imambargah. “Like any other event of Shahzada Qasim’s mehndi, women from other ethnic backgrounds turn up in our Imambargah to have their ‘mannat’ for different reasons including social, domestic, personal and family oriented,” informs Hamid.
District police provide security to mourners who are part of central procession. Besides other mourners, Hazaras were taken to Qadamgah under security for leading the central mourning procession. They beat their chests and flagellate en route to Karbala Dadan Shah from where they were brought to their Imambargah under security.
“Many of our elders had settled here in Hyderabad and Nawabshah soon after partition. Gen Musa also owned land in Bulri Shah Karim, Tando Mohammad Khan district,” Hamid Hazara recalled. Some community fellows also live in Latifabad Unit-3 and in 60-Mile area in Shaheed Banazirabad district.
“Our members are associated with government jobs and also own shops in Qadamgah area and deal in used clothes business in loonda bazaar,” he says. They are active in different political parties, chiefly Pakistan Peoples Party. “Sindh Assembly member Jabbar Khan considers our colony as his strong vote bank,” Hamid says.
Their Muharram observance of rituals was largely confined to their locality and mainly at the Imambargah. Ritual of our 7th Muharram mehndi is also performed within the Imambargah,” interjects an elderly Nadir Ali Hazara in Persian while speaking to Hamid. 
He also agreed with Hamid that his community fellows here never scared away from terror incidents targeting their community members. Many including children had lost their lives in the terror waves of religious extremism, sweeping the country.
Hazara community stages Imam Hussain chehlum’s procession in Hussainabad instead of participating in the central procession of the city which was brought out by Anjuman-i-Imamia Sindh (AIS). After taking a round of the street the mourners again converge on the Imambargah, and Hamid explains why.
“Our community’s ‘dasta’ used to be at the forefront at number one in chehlum procession as well like Ashura’s. But then Anjuman-i-Imamia Sindh (AIS) changed our number to which our community members objected and parted company with them,” says Hamid. AIS stages chehlum’s or “Arba’een” central procession in the city. It emanates from Qadam Gah and culminates at Dadan Shah.
AH general secretary Syed Raza Rizvi points out that Hazaras participate as one community or tribe under the command of their elder. “We always want that procession is led by those who are organised more than anyone else. And that’s why we keep our own Anjuman at the tail of the procession to make sure that the procession reaches its destination on time,” he says.
Hazaras, he says, don’t participate in any balloting for getting number of ‘dasta’ as they are somewhat exempted from this process. But other Anjumans have to participate in the process. So, he says, that’s why Hazaras lead AH’s central procession every year.

The chief secretary Dr Sohail Ahmed Rajput took serious notice of the children’s deaths, which started coming out of the rain-hit areas from July 7 to date during and after heavy rains, and asked Dadu DHO Dr Ahmed Ali Samejo and Jamshoro DHO Dr Vinod Kumar to bring aid to the ailing children at their doorsteps.
He directed the health officers to diagnose real cause of the children’s deaths. He would not brook any negligence by health officials in this regard and take stern action against them if the camps were not set up immediately, he warned.
He said that directives had also been issued to secretary of health, DG health Sindh, Hyderabad commissioner and Dadu deputy commissioner to monitor the operation of the medical camps and government healthcare facilities in Kachho and Manchhar Lake areas.

DHOs asked to set up medical camps

Dadu DC Syed Murtaza Ali Shah said that he had written letters to DHO Dr Ahmed Ali Samejo on Aug 2 and 5 and asked him to organise the camps and report about deaths of children and others from gastroenteritis and other diseases.

14,Durrani distances himself from ethnic strife,SUKKUR: Sindh Assembly Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani has distanced himself from ongoing attempts to fan ethnic strife...,"SUKKUR: Sindh Assembly Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani has distanced himself from ongoing attempts to fan ethnic strife between Sindhis and Pathans and said that his ancestors had been living in Sindh for almost two centuries and they had now become completely Sindhis. 
They would always be in the forefront to spill their blood for Sindh if things ever came to such a pass, he said. 
It were the Afghan nationals who wreaked havoc on Sindh’s soil and Syed Jalal Shah, Dr Qadir Magsi, Ayaz Latif Palijo, Sanan Khan Qureshi, Riaz Ahmed Chandio and other leaders and old nationalist families fully appreciated this fact, they would never incite people to hatred for all Pathans in Sindh, remarked Durrani.
Talking to media persons after offering condolences to Amanullah Pathan over his mother’s death in Jacobabad, Durrani said that current monsoon rain had ruined standing crops and inundated cities and villages in Balochistan and Sindh.
He said in answer to a question on bills that it was Sindh government’s duty to enforce laws made by Sindh Assembly but implementation of federal government’s laws could be problematic in the province when the centre did not support or cooperate in their enforcement.
Commenting on foreign funding case against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, he said that it was an old case and the Election Commission of Pakistan should have impartially and thoroughly checked the evidence of the case.

15,More fire stations be established in Larkana: LCCI,LARKANA: The Larkana Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has expressed its concern over the local...,"LARKANA: The Larkana Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has expressed its concern over the local municipality’s ill-preparedness to cope with any major fire incident in the city, pointing out that it had only four fire engines and they all were in bad shape.  
With these few vehicles, the Larkana Municipal Corporation (LMC) could perform its duty of firefighting in an efficient manner, it said, pointing out that the city had expanded in all directions and its population had also increased to 800,000 souls. 
The LCCI has urged the authorities concerned to establish more fire stations at different locations.
LCCI president Bashir M. Paryal Shaikh has written a letter to the department concerned in this regard.
Speaking to Dawn on Monday, he said it looked unjustified that the city with a population of 800,000 people had only one fire station. He said that the station was located in the thickly populated area, Jiles Bazaar, which appeared to be hub of business and trade. Vehicular traffic in the area could hardly move in peak hours, often at a snail’s pace. In an emergency situation, the fire brigade vehicles struggle hard to move amid a mess of traffic. This causes delay in rushing to a place where fire has to be extinguished. Ultimately the fire inflicts more damage. He said the four firefighting vehicles available to the station were procured in 1990s and since then the LMC seemed to have paid no attention to their maintenance. 
The station was in a shabby condition and very recently the plaster of its ceiling had partially fallen down, he said, adding that the life its personnel were also at risk while sitting in the office and the parking area. 
“It is very sad to see that the district is left at the mercy of nature; an emergency can hit this city anytime and the fire brigade would not be able to cope up it, he apprehended. 
He suggested that at least four fire stations be established on the outskirts of the city and also new vehicles be made available to them to save people from suffering heavy losses in the event of emergencies.

16,Khuhro condemns social media campaign over chopper crash,‘Imran Khan cannot escape disqualification after ECP’s foreign funding case decision’,"LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Sindh president Senator Nisar Ahmed Khuhro on Monday visited Sujawal Tunio village near Bakrani town to offer his condolences to the family of Maj Saeed Ahmed Tunio, the pilot of the army helicopter that had crashed in Winder, Balochistan, on August 1. Six army officers had embraced martyrdom in the incident.  
Other PPP leaders including Abdul Fatah Bhutto, Shakeel Memon and Amin Shaikh were accompanying Mr Khuhro. 
Later, speaking to the media the Senator condemned the regretful campaign on social media in the wake of the chopper crash. He fully supported the calls for immediate legal action against all those involved in the propaganda against the state and its institutions. He regretted that the propaganda was resorted to while the entire nation was in deep distress over the tragedy. He acknowledged that the institution of army had always been on the forefront and played its due role in difficult times. 
Mr Khuhro also commented on former prime minister Imran Khan’s politics and criticised him for “instigating youth to adopt a wrong path”. This would give birth to disturbance, he apprehended, and advised Mr Khan to “stop poisoning youths’ minds and exploiting them for his personal gains”.  

‘Imran Khan cannot escape disqualification after ECP’s foreign funding case decision’

The PPP leader claimed that fissures had emerged within PTI over its leadership. “There are many candidates in PTI for the slot of prime minister and one of them is [former foreign minister] Shah Mehmood Qureshi,” he further claimed.  
A day earlier, the PPP leader held a press conference here to explain his party’s views with regard to the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision against PTI in foreign funding case. Mr Khuhro said Imran Khan was facing disqualification after the ECP decision and now seeking “NRO from political leadership of the ruling coalition [at the centre]. 
“Imran Khan is sending messages to the political leadership and seeking to spare himself from action,” alleged Mr Khuhro. 
“How could he be granted NRO now when foreign funding against him has been proved?” he argued, and expressed his confidence that Mr Khan would not escape disqualification. 
When leaders like Khwaja Nazimuddin, Ayoub Khuhro, Qazi Fazlullah, Pir Illahi Bakhsh, Hussain Shaheed Suharwardi and others could be disqualified than why not Imran Khan, he further argued. 
The PPP Senator noted that some PTI lawmakers were tendering their resignations while some others were sending their leave applications.  
Mr Khuhro alleged that millions of rupees had been deposited in the accounts of President Dr Arif Alvi, former Sindh governor Imran Ismail and other PTI leaders. President Alvi should step down and face the investigation, he said. 
He also pointed out that President Alvi and Imran Khan gave contradictory statements about alleged “directions” leading to the successful no-trust move against PTI government. “It proves that Mr Khan’s claim of US conspiracy was a lie,” he added.
