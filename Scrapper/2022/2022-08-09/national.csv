0,ANP wants report on 2016 Quetta tragedy implemented,A terrorist attack on a govt hospital in Quetta in 2016 claimed the lives of more than 60 lawyers.,"ISLAMABAD: Awami National Party (ANP) president Asfandyar Wali Khan on Monday called for implementing the recommendations mentioned in the report of the inquiry commission headed by Justice Qazi Faez Isa on the terrorist attack on a government hospital in Quetta in which more than 60 lawyers died.
In a statement issued by the party’s information secretary Zahid Khan on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the Quetta incident, the ANP chief also called for implementing the National Action Plan against terrorism which had been prepared by all political parties of the country with consensus after the terrorist attack on Army Public School in Peshawar.
Mr Khan was of the view that terrorism could be eradicated only through the implementation of the Qazi Faez Isa report in letter and spirit.
He lauded the lawyers’ community for their struggle for the cause of sanctity of the bar and the bench despite facing such tragedies. He said the sacrifices rendered by the lawyers’ community so far in the wake of terrorism in the country would not go in vain.
The ANP chief said the terrorists had eliminated a whole generation of the lawyers in the bloody attack. He said some “conspirators” were still active in the region to destroy peace. He termed the terrorist attack on the lawyers in Quetta one of the biggest tragedies suffered by the country.
On Aug 8, 2016, terrorists struck a government hospital in Quetta where a large number of lawyers had gathered after an attack on Bilal Anwar Kasi, the president of the Balochistan Bar Association at the time.
Taking a suo motu notice, the Supreme Court constituted an inquiry commission under Justice Qazi Faez Isa and the 110-page report of the commission containing some 18 recommendations was published in December 2016.
“The people of Pakistan have been subjected to sustained terrorist attacks, which continue unabated, and deserve answers. Those who have failed the people of Pakistan need to be held accountable. Things cannot go on as they have been. Without top-tier accountability, it is unlikely systemic change will be possible,” stated the report, urging the state to re-exert itself against those spreading hatred and murder.
It also urged the state to strictly abide by the laws, such as the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), the National Counter-Terrorism Authority Act, the Pakistan Penal Code, and, above all, the Constitution of Pakistan.
The report suggested that the ATA “needs to be enforced, and terrorists/terrorist organisations must be proscribed without delay. They must not be permitted to hold meetings. Those claiming to be members of proscribed organisations should be prosecuted in accordance with the ATA.”

According to data released by the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), over 19,000 tests were conducted while the national positivity rate stood at 3.32 per cent. As many as 163 patients were in critical care.
Although the city-wise data showed a double-digit positivity rates, low testing in some cities has significantly skewed the data.
The positivity rate in Nowshera was 33.33pc; however, only three tests were conducted, of which one was found positive. Swabi also showed a similar result, with 30pc positivity rate from a mere 10 tests.
Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi were the only cities in which over a thousand tests were conducted.
The most number of tests — 5,389 — were conducted in Karachi, where 80 people tested positive for the coronavirus, showing a positivity rate of 1.4pc.
Pakistan has reported over 620 cases every day for the past 10 days with the exception of Aug 3 when 392 cases were reported.

In a specific reference to public gatherings and processions being held in connection with Muharram, the authority asked people to strictly use face masks and sanitiser.
The use of masks and sanitiser has been made mandatory for the participants of majalis and processions, the NCOC added.
According to it, only vaccinated people would be allowed to attend majalis which would be held in open spaces with adequate ventilation arrangements.
Besides, social distancing must be maintained during congregations and processions, while old people and children should refrain from attending gathering with huge crowds.
Last month, Karachi saw an uptick in the number of cases amid Eidul Azha celebrations and relentless monsoon rains. On July 12, the positivity rate in the country’s financial capital, reached alarming levels to come in at 39.5pc.
The country feared a renewed wave of the virus in June when the number of cases began increasing. However, authorities have said that the situation was currently under control due to a robust vaccination drive all over the country.

Flood-affected people receive relief goods distributed by the district administration in a village near Chaman on Monday.—Dawn

 
ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of National Health Services has sent a team of 12 doctors of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) to Balochistan’s Lasbela district to provide medical treatment to flood victims.
Talking to Dawn, the ministry’s spokesperson Sajid Shah said that the team will hold free medical camps in Uthal’s District Headquarters Hospital and Lakhra’s Rural Health Center.
“There are general physicians, general surgeons, neurosurgeons, orthopaedic surgeons and other experts in the team,” he said, adding that free medicine would also be provided to the patients.
In a statement, federal Health Minister Abdul Qadir Patel said that another consignment of medicines would be sent to Balochistan after Ashura.
“We will continue the support for our brothers in Balochistan and use all possible resources to provide them with relief,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Red Crescent Society (PRCS), with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC), has expanded its rescue and relief operations in Balochistan and other parts of the country under the Disaster Response and Emergency Fund (DREF).
The PRCS is carrying out relief activities in flood-hit areas of Balochistan. In addition to cash assistance, clean drinking water and hygiene kits will be distributed among the flood victims.
A high-level meeting at the PRCS headquarters took several decisions for relief and rehabilitation in the flo­od-affected areas of Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
PRCS Chairman Abrarul Haq said the Society was devoted to help people who were affected by heavy rainfall and floods.
He added that PRCS had deployed mobile health teams with doctors, paramedics and free medicine in Tank, Jhal Magsi and Jafferabad districts to provide health services to flood-affected population.
Water treatment plants would be installed in Karak, Tank, Jhal Magsi and Jaffarabad in the coming days and each plant would have the capacity to generate 30,000 litres of clean and safe drinking water per day, said Mr Haq.

3,EU sees little cooperation between govt and parliament,Says security situation and access to justice are matters of concern; earmarks initial grant of 265m euros under MIP.,"ISLAMABAD: The European Union has observed that politics in Pakistan is highly partisan, with little cooperation and compromise solutions between the government and parliament despite three elections and two peaceful transitions between civilian governments since 2008.
The role of the military in politics and administration is seen as guarantee for stability, but also criticised for undermining civilian governance capacity, according to the ‘Multi-Annual Indicative Programme (MIP) for 2021-202, which was recently signed by Pakistan and the European Union.
The latest programming is guided by the country’s strategic development priorities and the overall geopolitical programme of the European Commission for promoting green and sustainable inclusive growth and jobs, advancing governance and human development, and fostering resilience, peace and security as well as digitalisation.
The duration of the new MIP is of seven years, for the period 2021 to 2027, and it will be implemented in two phases with a mid-term review of progress taking place in 2024. This review will provide an opportunity to possibly redefine and redirect EU priorities and actions in the light of evolving economic, social and political developments as well as lessons learnt.

Says security situation and access to justice are matters of concern

For this reason, EU has earmarked an initial grant of 265 million euros. The multi-annual indicative programme (MIP) and the ‘Vision 2025’ are expected to be revised, following the 2023 general elections. This will allow realigning the second half of the MIP with a new government strategy as it may emerge, EU document says.
The third elections since the end of the military regime in 2008 and, therefore, the second successive peaceful transfer of power between civilian governments took place in 2018 in relative calm. However, the security situation and access to justice in the country remains challenging.
The efficiency of law enforcement and judiciary institutions is impacted by outdated regulatory frameworks. There is thus the need for capacity strengthening, and for improved coordination and cooperation between the stakeholders. This situation affects both internal security and citizens’ trust in the institutions, as well as the investment climate.
A slow recovery from the Covid-19 crisis and its related socioeconomic impact could further delay needed economic and structural reforms. These will be mitigated through increased coordination and dialogue with other development partners, regular policy and political dialogue, provision of dedicated capacity building activities, including in the area of public financial management, mainly through technical assistance, and whenever possible exchange of expertise from EU member states.
The MIP will also aim at enhancing cooperation in the areas of the Strategic Engagement Plan such as economic, social, and environmental sustainability, energy, the rule of law, good governance and human rights. This MIP also fully takes into account the situation in Afghanistan further to the Taliban takeover, covering in a mainstreamed approach the refugees and their hosting communities, and complements the specific programmes financed at the regional level.
The MIP will address capacity issues and integrate disaster risk management in future programmes in order to increase resilience of economic activities, building upon actions supported by the EU’s humanitarian assistance.
While the MIP covers all the country, it is proposed to concentrate most of the support in the provinces and fragile territories adjacent to the western border with Afghanistan, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the territory of Gilgit-Baltistan. This support will be complemented by federal level interventions and whenever justified interventions in the other provinces and territories. The proposed geographical targeting should trigger increased focus and impact and a more transformational effect.
Agriculture is the main economic sector in Pakistan and water availability is under increasing stress. Skewed land distribution and precarious tenure rights impact negatively agricultural competitiveness and livelihood opportunities and keep small farmers and landless families trapped in poverty.
A critical factor to ensure that agriculture production can meet the growing food demand is access to energy.

4,ARY News ‘pulled off air’ in parts of country,"Transmission faced disruption in Islamabad, parts of Punjab and Sindh; channel blames Pemra.","ISLAMABAD: ARY News went off air on Monday evening in many parts of the country with the channel blaming the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) for the move.
However, Pemra didn’t give any reason for its action.
The channel’s transmission started to face disruptions at around 8pm in Islamabad, parts of Punjab and Sindh, though it was available in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
While local cable operators replaced the ARY News slot with other channels, the subscribers of Nayatel saw a static screen displaying the message: “The channel is currently unavailable. Sorry for the inconvenience.”
Some subscribers in Karachi received a message from their cable operators that the service had been suspended. The message read: “Valued customer, the transmission of ARY News is suspended on instructions of Pemra till further notice. Inconvenience is regretted.”
The channel said the “strategic media cell” of the ruling PML-N was spreading false information and fake news to create divisions between PTI chief Imran Khan and the armed forces.
It also said that several fake accounts were involved in defaming PTI by spreading fake news regarding the Lasbela helicopter crash, in which six army officers and soldiers were martyred.
Pemra officials could not be reached despite repeated attempts for comment, apparently due to restrictions on mobile phone services and slow internet on account of Ashura-related security measures.
ARY claimed that the channel was taken off air “after its June 27 report on the activation of the ruling PML-N’s strategic media cell proved to be true”.
But that could not be confirmed from official or other sources.
ARY News also went off air in May ahead of the PTI’s Azadi March.

6,Forensic audit finds irregularities in Establishment Division,"Report finds Rs48m spent on buying stationery and store items, weak internal, administrative controls, violation of policies.","ISLAMABAD: A forensic audit of the Establishment Division — the government’s human resources arm — has exposed poor administration, violation of its own policies and irregularities in financial matters.
The audit, ordered by former prime minister Imran Khan in March, was completed by the Auditor General for Pakistan, who recently submitted the report to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The audit points out that the national exchequer suffered a loss of Rs48 million as senior officials of the Establishment Division minted money through “fictitious purchase of stationery and other store items”.
The audit said the exercise violated the General Financial Rules, which state that the “purchase must be made in the most economical manner in accordance with the definite requirement of the public service”.

Report finds Rs48m spent on buying stationery and store items, weak internal, administrative controls, violation of policies, etc

The Establishment Division manages bureaucracy and, in turn, ensures the country’s affairs are run smoothly. It serves as the nerve centre of the bureaucracy and its officers act as management consultants for the federal government.
The audit report states that the division floated open tenders during 2016-17 and 2017-18 fiscal years to buy stationery and other store items and Rs48m was spent during the three fiscal years through 2018-19.
The procurement was made without approval from the purchase committee. An internal inquiry was conducted in the Establishment Division, but its findings were not shared with the audit team. The division spent Rs20.3m on stationery in 2017, Rs21.5m in 2018 and Rs6m in 2019.
A previous report had observed that “during the financial year 2018-19, there was a substantial decrease in expenditure on purchase of stationery”.
The audit held that this was a serious violation of General Financial Rules.
The audit objection was based on a complaint filed with the then establishment secretary Ejaz Munir. However, the Establishment Division’s section officer, who raised the issue, was posted out.
Chief Finance Officer Mohammad Afzal, who confirmed the financial irregularity and urged the establishment secretary to hold an inquiry, was also transferred from the division.
The inquiry into the matter has been pending since 2019, while the inquiry officer is proceeding abroad on a scholarship.
The latest forensic audit points out several reasons for this financial misappropriation, including “weak internal and administrative controls”, “partial implementation of E-Office applications”, “non-observance of rotation policy by the Establishment Division caused long-time stay of officers/officials in same posts”, “procurement of stationery, computer stationery and other store items on the basis of unrealistic demand” and “unauthorised purchase of stationery and other store items by a section officer”.
The audit recommends that the division must devise and implement a yearly procurement plan to end such financial irregularities in future.
It also suggests that the “rotation policy of staff and officers may be observed in true letter and spirit so that opportunities of misappropriation/fraud may be curtailed”.
A previous audit report pointed out that the Establishment Division itself has been violating the rules governing the transfer and posting of civil servants on deputation.
The auditors pointed out that several officers working at the division on deputation have overstayed their deputation period well over the extended five-year limit.
These officers include those from provincial education departments, ex-cadre and non-cadre officials and, in one instance, a veterinary doctor from Balochistan.
As per the Establishment Division’s own rules, “The normal period of deputation for all categories of government servants would be three years. This would be extendable by two years with the prior approval of the competent authority”.
After five years have elapsed, “both the borrowing and lending organisations must ensure the immediate repatriation of the deputationist”.
“If a person is on deputation to a government organisation and has completed the maximum tenure of five years, he must revert or be reverted by the borrowing office to his parent/lending organisation… otherwise, the audit offices concerned shall not make payment of salary and allowances to him beyond the date of expiry of five years,” according to the rules.
