The dollar was weaker as investors took profit on the strong gains notched up last week on speculation that the US Federal Reserve will ann­o­unce a third successive rate increase of 75 basis points in September.
“The macro calendar is quiet this week with US inflation data being the main highlight,” said Forex.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada.
“This will keep the dollar... in focus after a very strong US jobs report on Fri­day rekindled the possibility of a hat trick of 75-basis-point rate hikes in Sept­ember.” Data due Wed­nes­day are expe­cted to show inflation in the world’s biggest economy slowed slightly in July, but remained close to the four-decade highs seen recently. 
Oil prices gained, making good some of the losses from last week, when a rise in US crude stockpiles was partly responsible for a 10pc drop in prices.

1,Record 9m tonnes of rice production expected,"Expectations of high crop yield based on weather conditions, increase in acreage, better availability of farm inputs.","LAHORE: The country is expected to produce record-breaking over 9 million tonnes of rice against all odds in the current fiscal year against the 8.9m tonnes produced in 2021-22.
The US Foreign Agricultural Service GAIN report for July 2022 forecasts a lower production at 8.4m tonnes in Pakistan.
However, local rice sector experts expect that Pakistan will harvest more than 9m tonnes of paddy in the forthcoming season because of weather conditions, increase in acreage and better availability of farm inputs.
“Above normal rain in July and the first week of August, late sowing of paddy in cotton fields of Sindh and south Punjab which were damaged due to heavy rains, will push for a record rice production,” says Hamid Malik.
The country has a carryover stock of around 1m tonnes but higher consumption of corn for animal feed purposes will leave more exportable surplus during FY23.
“Pakistan has big chances of rice exports up to 5m tonnes during the FY23 because of lower paddy production of over 10m tonnes in India as the crop was hit by erratic rains of monsoon there, Chinese crop was affected by high temperature, and Vietnam suffered untimely rain at harvesting time,” he says.
Due to these factors, global rice production will come down to 515m tonnes this year as against 519m tonnes last year leaving a gap of 4-5 million tonnes on the supply side, he estimates, adding global average price is expected to be higher than that of the ongoing season.
About the Basmati growers, he says they may get a lesser price for their produce this year but with higher per acre yield and a cut in expenses for pumping out subsoil water due to rains and better availability of urea may give them consolation.
He predicts that prices of non-Basmati rice varieties in the local market will be higher this year.

2,Trade deficit with neighbours widens in FY22,Pakistan’s exports to nine regional countries rose 16.97pc while imports grew by nearly 28.84pc in FY22.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s exports to nine regional countries rose 16.97 per cent while imports grew by nearly 28.84pc in FY22 from a year ago, the latest data released by the State Bank of Pakistan showed.
The country’s exports to Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives account for a small amount of $4.590 billion — just 14.43pc of Pakistan’s total global exports of $31.79bn in FY22.
China tops the list of Pakistan’s regional exports leaving other populous countries India and Bangladesh behind. Islamabad carried out trade with its farther neighbours Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Bangladesh and the Maldives via sea only.
On the other hand, imports from these countries edged up to $17.814bn in FY22 against $13.826bn over the corresponding period last year, an increase of 28.84pc. 

Exports grew 17pc, but imports swelled close to $18 billion

As a result of huge imports, Pakistan’s trade deficit with the region expanded during the period under review.
Pakistan’s exports to China posted positive growth in 2021-22. The bulk of the regional exports share, which accounts for 60.58pc, is with China while the remaining is for eight countries. 
Pakistan’s exports to China posted growth of 36.12pc to $2.781bn in FY22 from $2.043bn in FY21. The increase in export proceeds was noted in the post-Covid period especially the exports of rice.
Contrary to this, imports from China grew 30.03pc to $17.296bn during the period under review against $13.301bn over the last year. The bulk of 97.09pc imports is coming from China alone while the remaining imports are from other eight countries.
Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan posted a negative growth of 43.8pc to $552.518m in FY22 from $983.314m in the same period in FY21. Till a few years ago, Afghanistan was the second major export destination for Pakistan after the United States. The export figures did not include proceeds that were materialised in the local currency.
Imports from Afghanistan posted a negative growth of 17.84pc to $147.249m against $179.223m over the last year mainly driven by higher arrivals of essential kitchen items including tomatoes, potatoes and onions as well as fresh and dried fruits. The government has allowed maximum imports from Afghanistan in the rupee on a land route in the post-Taliban regime period. The figures did not reflect those imports made in rupees.
The country’s exports to India plunged 44.47pc to $1.292m this year from $2.327m in FY21. The imports from India slightly increased 2.11pc to $187.663m against $183.785m over the last year. 
Pakistan’s exports to Iran on the official channel remained zero in FY22. Most of the trade with Tehran is carried out through informal channels in border areas of Balochistan. No imports were made from Tehran during the period under review.
Exports to Bangladesh increased 41.28pc to $870.604m in FY22 from $616.202m. Imports from Dhaka grew 28.06pc to $97.500m this year against $76.134m over the last year.
Similarly, exports to Sri Lanka increased by 38.72pc to $373.412m in FY22 from $269.168m in the previous year. The imports from Sri Lanka dipped 3.96pc to $81.728m from $85.102m over the previous year.
On the other hand, Pakistan’s exports to Nepal increased by 26.2pc to $5.775m in FY22 from $4.576m the previous year. However, imports rose by 12.62pc to $1.401m this year against $1.244m over the last year.
Exports to the Maldives increased by 14.29pc to $6.917m from $6.052m. Import jumped 1,314pc to $1.301m this year against $0.092m over the last year.
Export proceeds to Bhutan were recorded at $0.082m in FY22 against $0.159m over the last year, a decline of 48.42pc. The imports from Bhutan were noted at $2.499m in FY22 against $0.075m over the previous year, an increase of $2.424m or 3232pc.

3,"Govt asked to begin gas reforms, set up transmission firm","World Bank-backed plan envisages smaller gas firms instead of SNGPL, SSGCL.","ISLAMABAD: The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has asked the government to immediately create a National Gas Transmission Company (NGTC) classified as a “strategic asset” to begin with gas sector reforms and open up the gas market for competition and facilitate bridging a massive demand-supply gap currently facing the country.
According to Ogra estimates, Pakistan’s unrestricted gas demand is currently more than six billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), compared to 3bcfd of total supplies, including imported LNG, leaving a growing shortfall of more than 3bcfd.
In a presentation, Ogra’s member gas Muhammad Arif has pointed out a series of gas market challenges, including resistance from gas utilities to reforms for fear of losing market share; limited domestic gas reserves and production, no gas storage facilities; and limited LNG handling facilities both in terms of terminals and pipelines. Some other issues also included the country’s perceived investment risk, overall economic conditions, and zero private sector participation in midstream and downstream.
The Ogra member has highlighted that optimum capacity utilisation of infrastructure was an important element of gas sector reforms and a third party access (TPA) regime was already in place for the gas pipeline network, but “Sui companies’ fear of losing customers is a bottleneck.”

World Bank-backed plan envisages smaller gas firms instead of SNGPL, SSGCL

Given the limited availability of gas, the government has been advised to revisit gas supply priorities and formulate a policy for the allocation of gas upstream to create an enabling environment for multiple players.
On its part, the Ogra is in the process of finalising TPA for LNG terminal and storage facilities for which the government would have to introduce special fiscal incentives to red carpet fresh investment instead of creating barricades. According to the Ogra member, the exclusivity of two gas utilities in their franchised areas has ended, and “implementation has started to pay the way for private participation in transmission and distribution networks.”
The Ogra has also sought the federal government’s policy guidelines regarding the extension of transmission and distribution networks in new towns and villages despite fast-increasing gas shortfalls amid declining domestic gas production and unaffordable international prices.
Editorial: Gas sector reforms
The World Bank (WB) backed gas-sector reforms that envisage the dismantling of two gas utilities — Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Ltd (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) — into at least five public-sector companies, besides facilitating many other private operators and supplying domestic supplies to consumers within a gas-producing province, were taken in hand by the PML-N government but have been stalled since 2017 due to political reasons and lack of consultations with provinces.
The reforms sought to dismantle the SNGP and SSGCL in a manner that separated their transmission and distribution businesses. There would then be at least five fresh licences that include a transmission operator and four distribution companies, each having provincial boundaries as their sales areas to supply only domestic gas to residential consumers with the approval of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) after provinces reach consensus.
The transmission network will provide open access to distribution companies and any other private operators arising out of increasing LNG imports. There are already a couple of distribution licensees. The transmission company will not take title to gas. It will only transport gas and get paid for a transportation charge to be set by the regulator for transporting local gas to be sold by the provincial distribution companies and imported LNG by private operators to their dedicated consumers.
The gas companies would have a sort of postage stamp tariff, i.e., based on gas transported and revenue requirements. This will enable a buyer to enter into a contract with a supplier using the transmission system of NGTC for a wheeling charge. Larger consumers would be free to choose their preferred supplier, and the mechanism would foster competition and transparency in cost allocations among LNG importers.
The new model devised by consultants under the WB assistance suggests that customers anywhere on the network should get gas with the security of supply and improved viability and sustainability of the sector while remaining within the constitutional provisions concerning the supply of domestic gas resources.

4,Engro to start LNG marketing business,Engro Eximp FZE will lead the joint effort with New York Stock Exchange–listed Excelerate Energy.,"KARACHI: Engro Corporation is setting up a gas marketing business in Pakistan along with the New York Stock Exchange–listed Excelerate Energy, a company official told Dawn in a recent interview.
Engro Eximp FZE, which is a subsidiary of Engro Corporation and serves as the Dubai-based trading arm for the Pakistani conglomerate, will lead the joint effort to establish a re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) marketing business to open up new fuel supply avenues for private businesses, said company CEO Kaleem Asghar.
Pakistan’s domestic gas reserves have been in decline for many years. Natural gas production has also gone down at an annualised rate of 2.2 per cent for five years. The gas sector regulator believes the shortfall will soon be close to two billion cubic feet per day (bcfd). The average winter demand is 6.5-7bcfd.
“The government has already approved third-party access, which opens possibilities for making (existing) terminal capacity available through expansions by bringing bigger floating storage re-gasification units (FSRU) as well as the sale of booked but unused capacity,” said Mr Asghar.
Pakistan began importing RLNG in 2015 by installing two purpose-built terminals on Port Qasim. Pakistan State Oil Company Ltd uses Engro Elengy Terminal to import gas under long-term contracts while Pakistan LNG Ltd brings spot purchases through GasPort LNG Terminal.
“In the long run, when a new terminal — either FSRU or land-based — is developed, (it) will also make available capacities for utilisation by multiple private parties,” he added.
The upcoming LNG terminals — Qatar-backed Energas LNG and Mitsubishi-backed Tabeer LNG — will have capacities of 750-1,000mmcfd each. Given the capacities of already operational Engro Elengy (690mmcfd) and GasPort LNG (750mmcfd), the addition of the two “merchant” terminals will more than double the country’s re-gasification capacity.
But how will the new trading business get access to the pipeline capacity currently controlled by the Sui gas companies? According to Mr Asghar, the partners will “engage the Sui companies” to access pipeline capacity. “There’s also an option to further explore gas marketing through virtual pipelines to help develop a private gas market,” he said.
Virtual pipelines refer to the transportation of LNG from the port to industrial consumers or retail fuel stations through specialised trucks.
Contrary to the popular belief, Mr Asghar says, using virtual pipelines to transport gas isn’t prohibitively expensive. “It’s costly only if you bring LNG from other countries in small containers. But if you import the fuel in large volumes and distribute it onwards through trucks, pipeline tolling charges almost equal the freight cost,” he said, adding that countries like India, Turkey, and China are already using virtual pipelines.
New industrial units being set up in dedicated industrial parks are getting gas connections at RLNG rates. These industrial units along with CNG pumps will constitute a large part of the clientele for the new venture of Engro Corporation, Mr Asghar said.
“Private parties have been attempting to arrange RLNG for themselves. People from the industrial sector want to expand but can’t because of a lack of gas,” he said.

5,Food security information system in works,"Dashboard will have data on food price monitoring, stock releases.","ISLAMABAD: A ‘future-ready food security information system’ is being developed at the Ministry of National Food Security & Research (MNFSR) to monitor the supply, demand, and prices of essential agricultural food commodities and their seasonal availability for policy feedback and decision-making.
The ministry intends to integrate its proposed Pakistan Food Security Infor­mation System (PFSIS) with the UN FAO’s Food Security and Nutrition Infor­mation System (FSNIS), with the aim of establishing a single source of information which will be used by all internal and external stakeholders. This is to be achieved by designing an easy-to-use decision support system (DSS) with projection and forecasting models using both current and historical data.
The MNFSR has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to conduct a technical assessment of the possibility of integrating its food security portal with the FSNIS. The technical assessment will support the ministry in adopting the best way forward for integrating the two systems and provide direction for setting up the single-source data bank and DSS, linked with a web portal for monitoring, decision and policy making, and sharing of reliable information with its stakeholders and the general public.
Official sources told Dawn that ADB has agreed to provide technical assistance to the ministry since the business requirements of PFSIS are higher-level statements of the goals and objectives or needs of the enterprise for an intended system.

Dashboard will have data on food price monitoring, stock releases

The FSNIS, which is currently in the works, has historical data from 1947 to 2020 and current data on agriculture, food security, and nutrition in Pakistan. The FSNIS is currently focusing on providing information to the general public, whereas the PFSIS is currently geared only for policy and decision-makers.
The MNFSR’s food security dashboard will be linked with food price monitoring data and provide information about daily prices, stocks, stock releases, import and export dates, and changes in prices of 24 food commodities. The dashboard is a template and work on it is on hold, the ADB assessment report says.
The ADB’s knowledge and support for technical assistance Strengthening Food Security Post-Covid-19 and Loc­ust Attacks is an effort to strengthen Pakistan’s food security and resilience in agriculture.
The aim is to help sustain national food security by enhancing the agriculture sector’s resilience to natural disasters and the ability to achieve national targets for agricultural growth. The ministry’s institutional capacity will also be strengthened to manage a sustainable food security system.

6,US sanctions crypto ‘laundering’ service Tornado,"US officials describe the “crypto mixer” as a hub for laundering stolen funds, including by North Korean hackers.","WASHINGTON: The United States placed sanctions on Monday on Tornado Cash, a leading  “crypto mixer” for transactions in virtual currency that US officials describe as a hub for laundering stolen funds, including by North Korean hackers.
The Treasury said Tornado Cash had been used to transfer at least $96m of funds stolen in June from crypto exch­ange service Harmony Bridge, and another $7.8m of the nearly $200m in crypto currency hacked from Nomad, a similar service.
In addition, Tornado Cash was used to transfer and mask $455m of the more than $600m worth of ethereum, a leading virtual currency, stolen in April from the Axie Infinity game via the Ronin Network.
That theft, which the Treasury called the largest known crypto heist to date, was carried out by North Korean state-backed hacking units known as the Lazarus Group and APT38, according to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Tornado Cash is one of the leading mixers, also known as tumblers, which help people hide the movements of their crypto currencies like bitcoin and ethereum by blending them with the transfers by other users.
Tornado Cash  “has been used to launder more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019,” the Treasury said.

7,Stakeholders want say in trade pact with Turkiye,"Without deliberation from private sector, agreement bound to create uncertainty for industries and economic outlook, says EFP.","KARACHI: The Employers’ Federation of Pakistan (EFP) has asked the government to take private sector in confidence before signing a preferential trade agreement (PTA) with Turkiye.
“Without any deliberation from the private sector, the agreement is bound to create uncertainty for Pakistan’s industries and economic outlook. The country can no longer afford to have trade agreements that would prove unfavourable for local industries and result in a sharp rise in the country’s import bill,” the federation said in a statement on Monday.
Expressing concerns about Pakistan’s expected PTA to be signed with Turkiye on Aug 12, EFP Chairman Ismail Suttur said Islamabad has agreed to give duty exemptions to Ankara on almost 220 products, whereas around 120 Pakistani products will get duty waivers. The Ministry of Commerce has failed to reach out to the private sector for consultations on the PTA, he added.
“Without consultations with the private sector, the PTA could prove to be counter-productive for Pakistan’s economy.” The statement quoted Mr Suttur as saying, “Pakistan was never able to realise the true potential of the agreement, whereas China was able to export a considerably higher volume of products to Pakistan, thereby worsening the country’s balance of payments (BOP) position.”
He said the commerce ministry has not reached out to the private sector nor the apex bodies—EFP and FPCCI—representing the private sector in Pakistan. The EFP chief said that several Pakistan-based companies may be negatively affected as a result of this PTA as their products may become uncompetitive as compared to Turkish products that would enjoy duty exemptions.
