0,Australia smash India to win hockey gold on final day of Commonwealths,"Six-time defending champions show their opponents no mercy, beat them 7-0.","BIRMINGHAM: Australia dem­o­li­shed India 7-0 in the men’s hockey final on Monday to maintain their perfect record at the Commonwealth Games and end their gold medal hunt in style.
The six-time defending champions showed their opponents no mercy in sweltering conditions on the final day of sporting action in Birmingham.
Australia have won every gold medal in men’s hockey since the sport joined the Commonwealth Games programme in 1998.
The dominant Australians were 2-0 up after the first quarter and two goals from Jacob Anderson helped put them 5-0 up after 30 minutes.

Nathan Ephraums scored his second to make it 6-0 and Flynn Ogilvie completed the rout early in the final quarter.
Australia’s Blake Govers said the team had saved their best performance until last.
That’s what we pride ourselves on,” he said.“It’s awesome to do it without too much of a heart problem. We had to play with confidence and play forward and take the game on from the start, and that’s what we did. That’s the difference between the two games [final and semi-final against England].” Host nation England beat South Africa 6-3 to take bronze.

Australia have topped the medals table with 67 golds — 10 ahead of England. Canada are third with 26 golds and India have 22.
The closing ceremony takes place at Alexander Stadium later on Monday, bringing to an end 11 days of sporting action at the 22nd Commonwealth Games.
Elsewhere on Monday, Scot­land’s James Heatly and Grace Reid won the mixed synchronised 3m springboard final, with England pair Noah Williams and Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix taking gold in the 10m event.

India celebrated a golden double in badminton.
World number seven PV Sin­d­hu won the women’s singles, overcoming Canada’s Michelle Li while Lakshya Sen beat Malaysia’s Ng Tze Yong to win the men’s gold.
India’s Sharath Kamal Acha­nta beat England’s Liam Pitchford 4-1 in the men’s singles table tennis gold-medal match.
The best two weeks of my 40 years of life,” said the winner, who won three golds and a silver in Birmingham.“It can’t get better.”
Birmingham 2022 CEO Ian Reid said the Games had been a huge boost for the city and the surrounding area.
He said more than 1.5 million tickets had been sold, with most venues above 90 percent capacity.

One of the goals at the outset was to put the city on the world map and instil that huge pride across everyone that lives in the region and I think we’ve achieved that,” he told a briefing on Monday. I think that can lead to much bigger and greater things.”
On Sunday, Australia won the first women’s cricket gold medal in Commonwealth Games history as Scotland’s Laura Muir captured the 1500m title on the final night of athletics.
Elsewhere, England’s women won hockey gold and Australia beat Jamaica in the netball final.
Hot favourites Australia held their nerve to beat India by nine runs in a Twenty20 thriller in front of a big Edgbaston crowd and partied on the pitch as the lights went out around the stadium.
It’s absolutely huge,” said left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen. We are blessed enough to be part of some winning World Cup teams but to win the first gold medal for women’s cricket in the Common­wealth Games, you’re only ever going to do that once.”
Victory underlined the dominance of Australia’s women, who are also world champions in the 20-over and 50-over formats.
Muir ended her Common­wealth Games campaign with a flourish by winning gold in the 1500m at the Alexander Stadium.

The 29-year-old’s team-mate, 10,000m champion Eilish McColgan, just failed in her bid for memorable double, finishing second behind Kenya’s impressive world silver medallist Beatrice Chebet in the women’s 5,000m.
Muir, who won bronze in the 800m on Saturday, kicked for glory before the bell and ran a fairly moderate field — lacking two-time Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon — ragged, timing 4min 02.75sec.
Wyclife Kinyamal defended his men’s 800m crown in a time of 1:47.52. It was an impressive turnaround for the 25-year-old, who finished last in the final of the world championships in July.
New Zealand cyclist Aaron Gate won the men’s road race to collect his fourth gold medal of the Commonwealth Games. In the women’s race, Australia’s Georgia Baker won her third gold of the games.
England won hockey gold for the first time after holding off a fightback from Australia to win 2-1.
Second-quarter goals from Holly Hunt and Tess Howard ultimately provided decisive 24 hours after the men’s team had suffered semi-final despair at the hands of Australia.
There was more joy for Australia in the netball competition, with a 55-51 over Jamaica in the final.
Australia also shone at the Sandwell Aquatics Centre. Cassiel Rousseau took the men’s 10m platform title and Maddison Keeney won her second gold of the games in the women’s 3m springboard.
England’s Delicious Orie won super heavyweight gold on a busy night of boxing, beating India’s Sagar Ahlawat.
India won three other golds in boxing but Northern Ireland took five, including a special double for Aidan Walsh and his sister Michaela.

1,"Hours after reaching Konya, Shajar Abbas exits in 100m heat",Clocked 10.25 seconds against his previous best of 10.37 but remains fourth in Islamic Solidarity Games contest.,"LAHORE: Emerging Pakistan runner Shajar Abbas, despite earning his career-best timing, exited the 100-metre heat in the Islamic Solidarity Games, which started in Konya, Turkey on Monday.
According to the information received here from Konya, the 22-year-old Shajar clocked 10.25 seconds against his previous best of 10.37 in the heat and remained fourth, so exited from the further contest of 100m race.
It is learnt that Shajar reached Konya at 5:00am on Monday morning — just hours before he was scheduled to feature in the Islamic Solidarity Games — after competing in the Commonwealth Games where he demonstrated impressive performance by qualifying for the 200-metre final where he finished last.
Soon after his hotel check-in at Konya, the runner rushed to compete in the 100-metre race. Had Shajar whose participation in the Commonwealth Games ended on Saturday night, left for Turkey the same day, he could have been in a better shape to compete in Konya.
The opening ceremony of the Islamic Solidarity Games is scheduled for Tuesday.

2,"Kohli, Rahul in Asia Cup squad; Bumrah out injured",NEW DELHI: India batsmen Virat Kohli and KL Rahul have been recalled to the Twenty20 squad for the Asia Cup but...,"NEW DELHI: India batsmen Virat Kohli and KL Rahul have been recalled to the Twenty20 squad for the Asia Cup but seamer Jasprit Bumrah has been ruled out due to injury, the country’s cricket governing body BCCI said on Monday.
Former captain Kohli and Bumrah were left out of the T20 squad for the five-match series against West Indies, which India went on to win 4-1 on Sunday.
Kohli has endured a lean run of form across all formats and the 33-year-old is without a century in international cricket since November 2019.
Rahul returns to the squad after a lengthy period on the sidelines following a groin injury and Covid-19 diagnosis. He will be Rohit Sharma’s deputy.
Harshal Patel is also not available for selection due to injury, while Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel and Deepak Chahar have been named as standbys.
India are defending champions at the Asia Cup, which will be played from Aug 27-Sept 11 in the UAE. They will open their campaign against arch-rivals and neighbours Pakistan in a blockbuster Sunday clash.
The tournament, which serves as preparation for the Asian sides in the lead-up to the T20 World Cup later this year, was shifted to the UAE last month due to the political and economic crisis in Sri Lanka, who retain the hosts’ honour.
Squad: Rohit Sharma (captain), KL Rahul, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Deepak Hooda, Rishabh Pant, Dinesh Karthik, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin, Yuzvendra Chahal, Ravi Bishnoi, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Arshdeep Singh, Avesh Khan.

3,Canada’s Hamilton prepared to throw CWG 100th anniversary party,"BIRMINGHAM: The Commonwealth Games are ready to return in 2030 to Hamilton, the Canadian city that launched the...","BIRMINGHAM: The Commonwealth Games are ready to return in 2030 to Hamilton, the Canadian city that launched the multi-sport event 100 years ago, with Niagara Falls providing the backdrop for beach volleyball and a push to add men’s cricket to the programme.
With the federal and provincial governments expressing support and no other cities having formally thrown their hats in the ring, Hamilton bid leader Louis Frapporti told Reuters the ‘Steel City’ is the favourite when the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) makes a decision sometime next year.
“Without jinxing it we are clearly the punitive favourite if only because we have invested so much time and energy in actually creating a proposal,” said Frapporti.  “The only country we are hearing any rumblings about is New Zealand.
“What we understand is we are so far ahead of them in terms of preparation of a bid that they are more likely to be interested in 2034 than 2030.”
If chosen it would mark the fifth time Canada has hosted the quadrennial event but the first since 1994 when they were held in Victoria, British Colombia.
Hamilton staged the first competition in 1930 when it was known as the British Empire Games and had just six sports; athletics, boxing, lawn bowls, rowing, swimming, and wrestling.
Women competed only in aquatic events.
At the Birmingham Games, which came to close on Monday, nearly 5,000 athletes from 72 nations and territories competed in 19 sports.
For the first time at a major multi-sport event there were more medal events for women (136) than men (134) and a record eight integrated para-sports with podium finishes counting in the overall medal standings.
While the 100th anniversary provides an obvious hook on which to hang a pitch, the Hamilton100 Commonwealth Games Bid Corporation will not be playing the sentiment card but instead focus on the elements that made the Birmingham Games a success.
“We are very light on the centenary celebration elements,” said Frapporti.  “Some people, like our [Hamilton] mayor, are very keen on that but from the perspective of us who have actually crafted the proposal we see that as the least compelling part of this.
“We want to get away from the concept of the Games as an event in time.
“Rather we are looking to take the CGF’s value proposition which includes inclusivity, diversity, sustainability and make it about a movement.”
Diversity, inclusion and private funding are buzz words that perk up government ears, particularly when it comes to spending taxpayer money.
Originally the Hamilton100 bid proposed an operating budget of around $1.5 billion (CDN).
But that has been trimmed to around $1 billion, about the same cost of the Birmingham Games with, according to Frapporti, the private sector kicking in between $250 to $500 million.
“What differentiates the Games framework at this point is a very significant amount of private sector investment around the delivery of infrastructure assets,” said Frapporti.
The biggest infrastructure project in the Hamilton bid would be the construction of an athletes village, which under current plans would be privately delivered.
The private sector would also be responsible for renovating the FirstOntario Centre in downtown Hamilton and contribute to the building of a state-of-the-art cricket facility.
Otherwise, the bid leans heavily on existing facilities across what is known as the ‘Golden Horseshoe’ such as the velodrome in nearby Milton built for the 2015 Pan Am Games.
The bid will also make use of one of the world’s natural wonders with Niagara Falls providing the backdrop for beach volleyball.
“To the extent the Commonwealth Games aspires to be the ‘Olympics light’ there is no path to success doing that,” said Frapporti.  “What we sought to do is embrace those values and opportunities which actually truly differentiate the sport so very much around inclusivity.”

4,Kyrgios clinches first ATP title in three years,WASHINGTON: Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios won his seventh ATP title and first in three years by defeating...,"WASHINGTON: Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios won his seventh ATP title and first in three years by defeating Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka in Sunday’s men’s final at the ATP and WTA Washington Open.
The 27-year-old Australian downed 96th-ranked left-hander Nishioka 6-4, 6-3 for his first ATP title since capturing the 2019 Washington crown.
“It’s emotional for me to be back here again and claim another title,” Kyrgios said.
Kyrgios, who lost to Novak Djokovic last mon­th in his first Grand Slam final, made back-to-back tour-level finals for the first time in his career and didn’t allow a service break all week.
“It’s just very emotional for me to see where I was at last year to now. It’s just an incredible transformation,” Kyrgios said.  
World number 63 Ky­r­gios fired 12 aces and 32 winners against four double faults and 20 unforced errors while taking 22 of 25 first-serve points to defeat Nishioka in 81 minutes.
Kyrgios improved to 4-0 against Nishioka.
In the women’s final, Liudmila Samsonova won her second career WTA title by beating Estonia’s Kaia Kanepi 4-6, 6-3, 6-3. Her first title came at last year’s German Open on Berlin grass.
Kyrgios became the first man to sweep singles and doubles titles in the event’s 53-year history — a feat he called  “super special” — by joining American Jack Sock to beat Croatian Ivan Dodig and American Austin Krajicek 7-5, 6-4 in the final.
Nishioka netted a backhand to surrender a break in the opening game and Kyrgios denied the Asian southpaw’s lone break chance with a backhand winner in the sixth game, holding out to claim the first set with his seventh ace.
Kyrgios broke in the first game of the second set when Nishioka sent a forehand long and again in the final game when Nishioka netted a backhand on the Aussie’s third match point.

Talking to Dawn, Hamad said the PCB members were informed during their visit to the GIK Institute cricket ground that the venue was registered with the PCB and that the Institute wanted to further modernise it.
According to Hamad, deve­­lo­pment of women’s cricket also came under discussion.
“Promotion of women’s cricket and establishment of a biomechanics lab at the GIK Institute were also discussed [during the meeting],” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, Yasir proposed clay from Gujranwala be brought  for the ground and lauded the modern faci­lities provided to students at the GIK Institute.
Prof Khalid acknowledged Yasir’s continued efforts for promoting cricket in Swabi and his important role in helping Pakistan win international matches.

Lewandowski, who had failed to score in any of Barca’s friendlies on their US tour, opened the scoring in the third minute of the Joan Gamper Trophy match after he converted Pedri’s pass with a brilliant finish from a tight angle.
Barca’s new signing then returned the favour as he set up the 19-year-old midfielder to score two minutes later.
Lewandowski handed Pedri another assist for the Spain International to make it 4-0 in the 19th minute after forward Ousmane Dembele scored their third of the night.
Striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and midfielder Frenkie de Jong got on the scoresheet in the second half.
“I am happy to (have) played the first game at Camp Nou and ... to win the trophy,” Lewandowski said in a video on Barca’s social media account, holding his Man of the Match award.

After a troubled summer during which Jorge Sampaoli walked out over his unhappiness at the club’s transfer approach, it was a welcome win for Tudor following a turbulent pre-season.
“I’m clearly very happy, it’s a clear and deserved victory,” said Tudor.
The former Croatia Internati­onal was jeered by home fans ahead of kick-off, but an own goal by Wout Faes and debut goals for Nuno Tavares and Luis Suarez lifted spirits at the Velodrome.
Folarin Balogun, like Tavares an Arsenal loanee, replied late on for Reims before Suarez grabbed his second of the evening.
“The whistles towards me? I was inside, I didn’t hear them,” said Tudor.
“The supporters are always right. We play for them and they do what they want.
Football doesn’t exist without them.” Tudor dropped captain Dimitri Payet to the bench, handing debuts to five players including Tavares and Jonathan Clauss, who earned a France call-up with Lens last season.
Clauss was soon involved as Reims defender Faes turned the right-back’s cross into his own net under pressure from Arkadiusz Milik on 13 minutes.
Marseille were unlucky not to add to their lead with Cengiz Under and Valentin Rongier hitting the woodwork, but Tavares made it 2-0 with a fine low strike just before half-time.
Colombian forward Suarez, signed from Granada in July, needed just 13 minutes to open his Ligue 1 account, steering home after the ball bounced around the Reims penalty area.
England Under-21 International Balogun headed in to cut the deficit, but Suarez ensured it was Marseille’s night by tapping home Cedric Bakambu’s pass deep into stoppage time.
Aaron Ramsey scored a minute into his Nice debut after coming on as a second-half substitute to rescue a 1-1 draw away to promoted Toulouse.
The Wales International curled in an equaliser on 78 minutes to cancel out a first-half goal by new Toulouse signing Thijs Dallinga, the top scorer last season in the Dutch second division.Jonathan David scored twice as Portuguese coach Paulo Fonseca began his reign at Lille with a 4-1 home victory over Auxerre, who are back in the top flight for the first time in a decade.
Benjamin Andre put Lille ahead inside the opening minute before Canada star David doubled the lead with just three minutes played.
David added a third before half-time and Akim Zedadka made it 4-0 just past the hour. Gaetan Charbonnier grabbed a consolation for Auxerre.
Belgium defender Arthur The­ate had a debut to forget for Rennes, putting an own goal past fellow newcomer Steve Mandanda in a 1-0 home defeat by Lorient.
Theate, signed from Bologna in July, shanked a cross past Mand­anda, the 37-year-old World Cup winner who left Marseille last month after making a record 613 appearances for the club.
Wales centre-back Joe Rodon also made his Rennes debut alongside Theate after signing on a season-long loan from Totte­nham Hotspur. Florian Sotoca bagged a hat-trick despite missing a penalty to earn Lens a 3-2 win against Brest, while Montpellier beat Troyes by the same scoreline.
Last season’s French Cup winners Nantes, who were thrashed by Paris St-Germain in the Champions Trophy in Israel a week ago, drew 0-0 at Angers.

Despite 68 per cent possession and chalking up 27 shots to Stuttgart’s 11, Leipzig were unable to convert their dominance into an opening day win.
Leipzig got on the board in the eighth minute through Nkunku, who threaded a shot past the outstretched hands of Stuttgart keeper Florian Mueller and into the bottom left corner.
Fresh off being named Germany’s footballer of the year for his contributions in the 2021-22 season, Nkunku was dangerous throughout, often dropping back well into his own half to retrieve the ball and kickstart an attack.
Leipzig dominated the early stages, before the home side got a goal back against the run of play through former Juventus midfielder Naouirou Ahamada.
Ahamada curled the ball into the bottom corner of the net in the 31st minute, celebrating even before the ball went in.
Leipzig coach Domenico Tedesco made several attacking changes in the dying stages of the match as the visitors went in search of a winner, bringing on striker Alexander Soerloth and Emil Forsberg in the 85th minute.
After the match, Tedesco lauded the performance of opposing keeper Mueller.
“We didn’t score goals. That was somewhat down to us, but also to the opposing goalkeeper,” Tedesco told broadcaster DAZN.
“We have to live with it.” Stuttgart’s American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo said his side, who narrowly escaped relegation on the final matchday last season, had picked up a  “slightly lucky but not undeserved point”.
In Sunday’s late game, Cologne overcame the news that star striker Anthony Modeste had signed with Borussia Dortmund moments before kick-off to defeat 10-man Schalke 3-1 at home.
Schalke midfielder Dominick Drexler was red-carded in the 35th minute for sinking his studs into the calf of Cologne’s Jonas Hector.
The newly promoted Royal Blues managed to hold on until half-time, before conceding three times in the second half.
Borussia Dortmund junior Luca Kilian latched onto a Hector cross to score Cologne’s first in the 49th minute, before Florian Kainz took advantage of a fumble from Schalke goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow to score the home side’s second in the 62nd minute.
Schalke pulled one back when Marius Buelter superbly headed in a cross in the 76th minute, but Cologne extinguished the visitors’ hopes just four minutes later when Dejan Ljubicic headed in his side’s third.
Speaking after the match, Kilian said he felt  “pure pleasure” in scoring against Schalke, the bitter rivals of his former club Dortmund.
“To score against Schalke feels especially good, for someone who was born in Dortmund. Nothing has ever tasted so good.” Cologne reportedly pocketed a five million euro ($5.1 million) transfer fee for Modeste, who scored 20 goals last season to propel Cologne to seventh place and a maiden Europa Conference League appearance.

Haaland converted a penalty after 36 minutes and wrapped up the points with a composed finish in the second period to cap an impressive display, with his father and former City player Alfie celebrating in the stands.
“It’s nice that he saw both goals as it is a big moment for me as a debutant in this competition,” the 22-year-old Haaland said.  “Also now it is almost 30 minutes since I scored the last goal so I have to keep going.”  Haaland charged past the West Ham defence to latch onto a through ball and take it around Alphonse Areola before being fouled by the substitute goalkeeper, who had replaced the injured Lukasz Fabianski after 29 minutes.
West Ham were forced into the early change when Fabianski picked up a knock clearing a cross from Kevin De Bruyne as he clattered into team-mate Aaron Cresswell and Haaland.
The Norwegian striker stepped up to convert the resultant spot kick, his cool finish sending Areola the wrong way to give City a deserved lead after an utterly dominant first half in which West Ham were rarely able to venture from their own box.
City, who had a first-half goal disallowed after Ilkay Gundogan was offside in the build-up, made a slightly disjointed start to the match but gradually strengthened their grip on the contest and doubled their lead after the hour mark.
Midfielder Kevin De Bruyne had defended a series of crosses before slipping through a delightful pin-point pass to Haaland, who timed his run to perfection and slotted home with a fine left-foot finish in the 65th minute.
West Ham forward Michail Antonio had headed wide in the opening stages and De Bruyne easily cleared Jarrod Bowen’s free-kick just before halftime, but the hosts struggled to make their mark on the game in a largely toothless attacking display.
Manager David Moyes brought on Said Benrahma and new signing Gianluca Scamacca just before the hour mark in an attempt to change West Ham’s fortunes but Haaland doubled City’s lead minutes after and the visitors comfortably saw out the win.
City have a new look to them this season after the departure of four first team players but there has been no disruption to Guardiola’s passing machine, with the club aiming to win a third straight league title.
Guardiola’s side controlled 80 per cent of possession in the first half and 76 per cent overall but did not have to exert themselves against a passive West Ham side, who faded after a bright first few minutes.
City also scored with their only two shots on target in a clinical performance that presented an ominous prospect for their rivals, showing that they will once again be the team to beat in the title race.
They host Bournemouth next weekend while West Ham travel to Nottingham Forest.
