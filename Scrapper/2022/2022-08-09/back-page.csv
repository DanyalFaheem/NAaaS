KARACHI/LAHORE: Arshad Nadeem had an unwavering conviction coursing through his veins in Birmin­gham on Sunday evening that no matter what the other competitors did, no matter what the state of his injured elbow would be, he would be the one with the gold medal across his neck.
And since his record-breaking throw of 90.18 metres in the javelin final of the Commonwealth Games brought Pakistan’s first track and field medal at the quadrennial spectacle in 56 years, everything’s been a rush for him.
It’s understandable. Pakistan’s wait for an athletics gold has been even longer. Before Sunday, the last time the country’s flag was raised; the national anthem played at the track and field venue for the Commonwealth Games was 60 years ago.
Arshad, who improved on his personal best three times during the session, was in tears after his victory but had a wide grin as the rendition of the national anthem came to an end — the medal he’d so longed for, and promised he’d deliver, draped around his neck.
Longing for another gold
Once off the podium, it was time for his dope test. Once done with giving his sample, it was almost midnight.
Monday was time to pack all the stuff and catch a flight to Turkiye, where Arshad is looking forward to another gold at the Islamic Solidarity Games.
“Just another day in an athlete’s jet-set life,” Arshad told Dawn in an interview while rushing to the airport, already running late to his flight for Konya.
Arshad had arrived in England after competing at the World Athletics Championships in Oregon where he finished fifth. His first stop was the Cambridge University where Dr Ali Sher Bajwa checked his elbow injury. He wasn’t a part of the Pakistan contingent’s march at the opening ceremony and was flying out well before the start of Monday’s closing ceremony.
“I’ve got the gold and that’s what matters most to me,” said Arshad.
What’s more remarkable about Arshad’s victory in Birmingham is that he didn’t have his coach with him. Salman Butt was watching Arshad perform on television after he couldn’t get his accreditation made in time.
It wasn’t a surprise for Salman that Arshad became the first javelin thrower from South Asia to cross the 90-metre barrier.
“He can do even better,” Salman told Dawn on Monday. “I was convinced he could do it.”
Arshad too believed. “I wasn’t going to give up without a fight … I knew I would win.”
Arshad had led the contest for the longest time, but it seemed Grenadian world champion Anderson Peters had turned the contest on its head when he launched the javelin to 88.64 metres with his penultimate throw. But Arshad hit back immediately with a throw that set the Games record and sealed the gold medal.
Wild celebrations
That sparked wild celebrations across the country, but the loudest ones were in Arshad’s hometown of Mian Chunnu where family members had all gathered around a television set.
“It was a great moment for the family,” his brother Aleem Arshad told Dawn. “At the same time, we were concerned about how his heavily-strapped elbow was holding up.”

Arshad revealed that he was in a “lot of pain but the desire to win meant all the pain was forgotten.”
He, however, realises that he can’t carry on with his elbow pain for long if he’s to fulfil his lofty ambitions.
“Dr Bajwa has had a good look at my elbow but hasn’t exactly told me what we need to do,” he said. “Once we’re done with the Islamic Games, we’ll start with the treatment.
“We have some time till next year’s Asian Games in China and I’m hoping that I’m pain-free for that as well as the 2024 Paris Olympics.”
Dr Bajwa termed Arshad’s victory “a miracle”.
“We will soon sit down with his coach [Salman] and the Athletics Federation of Pakistan to finalise a roadmap for his early recovery,” he told Dawn on Monday. “There is also an old knee problem which we’re looking at.”
Salman believes that once the injuries are treated, Arshad can improve his best distance “by a further five metres”.
Arshad, who finished fifth at last year’s Olympics in Tokyo, had a two-month training camp in South Africa under coach Terseus Liebenberg before competing at the world championships.
During his time in South Africa, Arshad met javelin world record holder Jan Zelenzy of Czech Republic, who threw the spear to a distance of 98.26 metres in 1996.
“The aim is to set the world record,” Arshad said. “Zelenzy told me to keep training hard and it will happen. I know I have the capacity to do that.”
Pakistan-India rivalry
Arshad’s mark at the Games was 39 centimetres short of the Olympic record set by Norwegian Andreas Thorkildsen in 2008 but much better than Neeraj Chopra’s winning effort of 87.86 metres in Tokyo.
India’s Chopra was ruled out of the Commonwealth Games due to injury, but he was quick to congratulate Arshad on social media with the duo sharing a friendly rivalry.
They have been competing against each other since 2016 and while Neeraj seemed to be a rung above Arshad, the Pakistani beating him to the 90m mark has raised hopes of a South Asian battle for supremacy at javelin’s top table in the years to come.
“It has set things up very nicely,” Arshad’s coach Salman said. “It’s going to be an interesting battle between them in the forthcoming events.”

1,Biden slams attacks on Muslims,WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has denounced the recent killings of four Muslim men in New Mexico state that...,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has denounced the recent killings of four Muslim men in New Mexico state that police are treating as a hate crime against Muslims. 
“I am angered and saddened by the horrific killings of four Muslim men in Albuquerque,” President Biden said on Twitter on Sunday. “While we await a full investigation, my prayers are with the victims’ families, and my administration stands strongly with the Muslim community. These hateful attacks have no place in America.”
New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham called the killings “wholly intolerable” and said she was sending additional state police officers to Albuquerque to aid in the investigation. “We will continue to do everything we can to support the Muslim community of Albuquerque and greater New Mexico,” she said.
A Muslim community leader in the city of Albuquerque, where the killings happened, said the assurances were much needed.
“Incredibly terrified. Panicked. Some people want to move from the state until this thing is over. Some people have moved from the state,” Ahmad Assed, president of the Islamic Center of New Mexico (ICNM), told CNN. “Businesses are closing ... early. Students won’t leave their homes.”
ICN’s Director Public Affairs Tahir Gauba said the area’s Christian and Jewish groups are holding an interfaith meeting at the ICNM mosque on Tuesday, where they would pray with Muslims to underline their support for the community.
A Jewish community centre has offered to deliver halal food to the area’s Muslims “if they are afraid of going out to do grocery,” Gauba said.
Two of the victims — Mohammad Afzal Hussain and Naeem Hussein — were Pakistanis. Two others — Aftab Hussain and Mohammad Ahmadi — were Afghans, although they lived in Pakistan too as refugees before migrating to the United States.
Afzal Hussain, 27, was born in Hujra Shah Moqeem in 1994, was killed on Aug 1 near his home, while Naeem Hussain, 25, was killed on Friday. He was from the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas.
Aftab Hussain, 41, was killed on July 26 in the city’s international district. Mohammad Ahmadi, 62, the first victim of this senseless violence, was killed in November behind the halal market he and his brother owned.
Afzal’s brother Mohammad Imtiaz Hussain said the White House contacted the ICNM soon after the Aug 1 murder. “Even President Biden issued a statement.”

2,"Shell-shocked Gaza starts clearing rubble, burying dead as truce holds",Israel and Islamic Jihad warn each other of response if ceasefire violated,"

PALESTINIAN youths salvage belongings from the rubble of their house, which was destroyed during Israel’s air strikes in Rafah last week.—AFP

 
GAZA CITY: Shell-shocked Gazans on Monday sifted through the rubble of three days of deadly conflict between Israel and Islamic Jihad militants as a truce held and life slowly returned to normal.
An Egypt-brokered ceasefire reached late Sunday ended the intense fighting that killed 44 people, including 15 children, and wounded 360 in the enclave according to Gaza’s health ministry.
Israel had since Friday launched a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of Islamic Jihad positions in Gaza, leading the latter to fire over a thousand rockets in retaliation, according to the Israeli army.
As relative calm returned to Gaza on Monday, and electricity was restored, Palestinians tried to salvage their belongings from the rubble of shattered homes and to start clearing the debris.

Israel and Islamic Jihad warn each other of response if ceasefire violated

“We received the news of the ceasefire with joy and happiness and we went back to our work,” said Gaza shopkeeper Hazem Douima. “We did not want more bloodshed.”
Bereaved families buried their dead, including at one funeral joined by hundreds of mourners in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip where a family laid to rest four minors killed in the conflict.
“Gaza is tending to its wounds,” said one resident, Mohammed Alai.
Gaza’s sole power plant, after a two-day shutdown, “started working to generate electricity”, said spokesman Mohammed Thabet, hours after fuel trucks passed the reopened good border crossing.
The outage had sparked fears about the impact on hospitals overwhelmed with casualties amid Gaza’s worst fighting since an 11-day war with militant movement Hamas last year.
‘Right to respond’
The Israeli military said roads would gradually reopen in the border area where restrictions were imposed in the lead-up to the offensive, which Israel said was launched to stop looming attacks.
Three people in Israel were wounded by shrapnel and 31 lightly hurt while running for safety, emergency services said.
Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid’s office late Sunday agreed to the truce, but said that “if the ceasefire is violated”, Israel “maintains the right to respond strongly”.
Islamic Jihad also accepted the truce, but said it too “reserves the right to respond”. US President Joe Biden welcomed the truce and thanked Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for Cairo’s role in brokering it.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that it was “crucial to work to consolidate the ceasefire”.
Tehran said it will always “defend the active resistance”.
Islamic Jihad said 12 of its leaders and members had been killed. The groups Mohammad al-Hindi said the ceasefire deal “contains Egypt’s commitment to work towards the release of two prisoners”.
They were named as Bassem al-Saadi, a senior figure in the group’s political wing who was recently arrested in the occupied West Bank, and Khalil Awawdeh, a commander, also in Israeli detention. North of Gaza in the Israeli city of Asheklon where air raid silents had wailed and people fled to bunkers, beachgoers returned to the Mediterranean shore.
Sitting in a cafe, Eitan Casandini said locals were feeling “very good”. “After we destroy them we can sleep peacefully,” he said. “I don’t think (Islamic) Jihad will do anything again in the next three or four years.”
Islamic Jihad is aligned with Gaza’s rulers Hamas but often acts independently.
Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of the enclave in 2007, including the conflict in May last year.
Israel has said it was necessary to launch a “pre-emptive” operation against Islamic Jihad, while the diplomatic official said the group had been planning an attack by sniper fire or with anti-tank missiles.
The army killed senior leaders of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, including Taysir al-Jabari and Khaled Mansour. The senior Israeli diplomatic official said Islamic Jihad had been dealt “a very serious blow” which had “taken them back decades”.

3,UK govt under pressure to act over cost of living crisis,Bank of England warns long recession is on its way as energy prices surge to unprecedented levels.,"LONDON: The British government came under pressure on Monday to set out plans immediately to support families through a mounting cost of living crisis, with a leading business group and former prime minister saying a political vacuum cannot be allowed to last.
The Bank of England warned on Thursday a long recession was on its way as energy prices surge to unprecedented levels, pushing inflation to a 40-year high of 9.4 per cent in June and leaving many households on the brink of economic hardship.
But the political response has been stymied by the race to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister after he was forced to quit over a string of scandals. While he remains in office, he has recently been on holiday and his successor will not be announced until September 5.
Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the country could no longer afford to wait for a new leader, with action needed now before energy prices leap again by an expected 70pc in October.
Brown, the country’s finance minister for 10 years from 1997 and prime minister from 2007 to 2010 during the financial crash, said many households were facing an economic timebomb.
“Take action this week and deal with these multiple problems that amount to a national emergency,” he told LBC Radio. “You don’t wait till the crisis hits you in October and then say you’re surprised.”
The CBI agreed, urging the prime minister and finance minister to prevent a “summer of drift” by meeting the two candidates to replace Johnson — foreign minister Liz Truss and former finance minister Rishi Sunak — and agree a way forward.
Britain’s energy regulator Ofgem will publish its new domestic household price cap on August 26.
“We simply cannot afford a summer of government inactivity while the leadership contest plays out followed by a slow start from a new prime minister and cabinet,” Tony Danker, CBI Director-General, said in a statement.
Johnson’s spokesperson said it would be up to the next British leader to decide whether further support was needed, and that the government had already put in place a funding package to help people this winter.

4,"A year on, Afghans hide out fearing death by data","Taliban have access to payroll data, digital ID systems; donors, aid agencies fail to secure systems, activists say.","• Taliban have access to payroll data, digital ID systems
• Donors, aid agencies fail to secure systems, activists say
KABUL: Sadaf was at work last year at the attorney general’s office in suburban Kabul when her sister rang with news that the Taliban had entered the Afghan capital, and begged her to race home.
“Cover your face! And don’t tell anyone where you work,” her sister said, her voice shaking with fear.
Sadaf didn’t know it then but this was the start of exile within her own country, a life of lying low to avoid death by data. Like thousands of Afghans, she has spent the past year hiding out in a series of safe houses, hoping to evade her digital trail and prevent the Taliban tracking her family.
When her sister broke news of the takeover, Sadaf grabbed her bag and rushed from the office, pulling her headscarf low over her face and tucking her office ID into her shoe.
Outside was chaos. Streets were jammed with vehicles and people running in every direction, desperate to flee. After walking part way home, Sadaf hitched a ride and made it to her house two hours later.
She quickly hugged her three children, then shut herself in the bedroom, gathered all her identity papers and any documents related to work, and burnt the lot in the bathroom sink.
“I was very scared,” said Sadaf, who had worked at the government office for more than 25 years — over half her life. The 48-year-old, who asked that her last name not be used, knew only too well the danger she faced.
The Taliban had previously bombed their vehicles; Sadaf was injured in two of those attacks and had lost several colleagues.
“I didn’t want anything to fall into the hands of the Taliban,” she said by text message from an undisclosed location in Afghanistan.
A week after the Taliban took over, men knocked on Sadaf’s door and spent hours searching her home. They knew where she worked, and left with a warning that they were watching.
The next day, Sadaf packed her belongings and fled, along with her children and husband, a carpenter. They have been in hiding ever since, lodging with relatives and friends, and never staying anywhere for more than two weeks.
“I am in danger because of my job,” said Sadaf.
Sadaf is among the tens of thousands of Afghans — including former government officials, judges, police and human rights activists — who remain in hiding one year on, fearful of being tracked with digital ID and data systems that the militants gained with regime change.
In the past year, human rights groups and the United Nations have documented the killing or enforced disappearance of hundreds of former members of the security forces, as well as journalists, judges, activists and LGBT+ people.
A Taliban spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Like many poor nations, Afghanistan pushed to digitise its data in recent years with funding and expertise from the World Bank, United States, European Union, the United Nations’ refugee agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme and others. One such programme is the digital ID system known as e-Tazkira, which holds a wealth of personal and biometric data including a person’s name, ID number, place and date of birth, gender, marital status, religion, ethnicity, language, profession, iris scans, fingerprints, and a photograph.
The ID is needed to access services, jobs and to vote. But it also exposes vulnerable ethnic groups, and people who worked in government or with foreign agencies, rights groups say.
“Everyone is vulnerable,” said Aziz Rafiee, executive director of the non-profit Afghan Civil Society Forum, who gets hundreds of desperate messages every day from Afghans in hiding. The systems were “a big mistake right from the beginning”.
“In a country like Afghanistan, there is always the possibility that the information would end up in the hands of terrorists, and you could be killed,” said Rafiee, who did not apply for an e-Tazkira, fearing this very outcome.
Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch confirmed that the Taliban controlled payroll data of the government and the supreme court, and biometric systems of the police and army, and those who worked with foreign governments and aid agencies.
“For those in hiding, there is no way to avoid detection because the Taliban are carrying out identity checks — with photos, fingerprints, iris scans — at checkpoints,” said Belkis Willie, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.
“So people are not able to leave the houses they are hiding in. In addition, anyone who goes to the passport office to get their passports to try and leave the country — their identity would be very clear to anyone,” she said.
Life and death by data
Advocates for biometric registration say it enables more accurate counts and identification of people in need, ensures more efficient aid delivery, and helps prevent fraud. But critics say registers can be misused for profiling and surveillance, and many exclude the most vulnerable of people.
The events in Afghanistan have underscored the risks of ID systems that are built without considering the possible impact on human rights, and without safeguards to prevent abuse, said Raman Jit Singh Chima at Access Now, a digital rights group.
Over the past year, digital rights groups have called on aid agencies, foreign donors, and telecom and tech companies to rethink how they gather biometric data, and to secure their systems to prevent harm. But this has not happened, said Chima, a policy director.
“Digital ID programmes with grave implications for human rights are still being implemented, or encouraged, even in high risk or crisis hit environments,” he said.
And in Afghanistan, Sadaf is still in hiding. “Lack of employment and poverty on the one hand, and fear on the other hand, has made my life very difficult,” Sadaf said. “I wish this was a nightmare and that I could wake up.”
