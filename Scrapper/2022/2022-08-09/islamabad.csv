2,Eight members of HEC’s governing body retiring next month,"Govt to fill seats on time to ensure continuity of decision-making process, says official.","ISLAMABAD: Eight of the total 21 members of the Higher Education Commission (HEC)’s governing board are going to retire next month after completing their tenures.
The commission’s governing body takes policy decisions about the higher education sector of the country.
Officials of the HEC said for effective decision making, the process of appointing new members should be started earlier so that within a few days after the retirement of the eight members the commission could get their replacement.
According to rules, the commission members are appointed by the prime minister.

Govt to fill seats on time to ensure continuity of decision-making process, says official

Meanwhile, sources said in the upcoming meeting of the commission, which is tentatively planned for August 28, the commission will get updates on plagiarism, distance learning, undergraduate and PhD programme policies.
Talking about the plagiarism policy, the sources said that the existing policy had some loopholes and in the past, instead of improving creative writing, this policy was in many cases,used for victimisation.  
They said the HEC wanted to bring an improvement in the policy and the draft of the amended policy was also shared with the universities recently.
The sources said the HEC wanted to give more power to universities in dealing with plagiarism cases. 
The commission, after getting feedback from vice chancellors and the HEC, will make decisions on the undergraduate and PhD policies.
These two policies were introduced during the tenure of the previous HEC chairman Dr Tariq Banuri in December 2020 and January 2021. 
However, after receiving concerns from vice chancellors, the HEC deferred the implementation of both the policies until September this year.
Last year, during a VCs committee meeting held in Mureee, majority of the VCs had rejected these policies.  They were of the view that without getting any input from universities, the HEC had finalised the policies which were not feasible for implementation in the current forms.
When contacted, an officer of the ministry of education said that the ministry was cognizant of the retirement of some commission members next month, adding the government would fill the seats on time.
Meanwhile, when approached by Dawn, newly-appointed HEC Chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmed said he would take all stakeholders such as the VC on board before reviewing any policy.
Asked about the proposed changes to the plagiarism policy, he said: “Since I joined HEC some days ago so I am not updated about proposed changes on plagiarism policy, but let me make it clear, we will propose, review and finalise policies after getting input from all relevant stakeholders for effective implementations.”
The chairman said after deliberation and feedback from universities, the policies would be placed before the commission.
The commission has 21 members, including the chairman HEC, secretaries of the ministries of education, science and technology, higher education departments of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and members from public and private sectors. Other members include Prof Dr Attaur Rahman, Prof Dr Sarosh Hashmat Lodhi,  Shams Kassim Lakha, Asif Mumtaz Sukhera, Shahnaz Wazir Ali, Prof Bhawani Shankar Chowdhry, Dr Naveed A. Malik, Prof Dr Javed Iqbal, Engr Ahemd Farooq Bazai, Dr Faisal Bari,  Abdul Saboor Kakar, retired Lt Gen Mohammad Asghar, Dr Mohammad Akram Sheikh, Nadira Panjwani, Dr Arif Nazir and the HEC executive director Dr Shaista Sohail.

The lumpy skin disease had affected a large number of cattle in Hazro area as scores of livestock especially cow and buffalo suffered from the disease in different villages.
The locals of the area expressed their concern over foul smell emitting from scores of dead animals scattered over a large area near Islamabad-Peshawar motorway near Chach interchange and adjoining areas of tehsil Hazro.  They feared that it would spread different diseases in the area.
An official of Tehsil Municipal Administration (TMA) urged people to cooperate with the garbage disposal squad for proper disposal of dead animals.
He said that the cattle owners, breeders and farmers should inform sanitation department of the TMA who would properly dispose of dead animals without any charges as throwing the dead animals in the open would not only pollute environment but also attract a large number of birds which could prove fatal for the jet planes flying from nearby Kamra air base.

He said the owners of affected animals should register their complaints in the toll free number of the livestock department and teams would be sent to the area for vaccination accordingly.

Their unflinching faith in Almighty Allah, their exemplary devotion, dauntless courage and unfailing patience while fighting for the glory of Islam was a great lesson for us to follow, he said.
Mr Ashraf said it was our collective responsibility to stand firm in the face of tyrannical forces that were spreading chaos in the society to achieve their nefarious designs.

The procession witnessed strong criticism of Israeli policies, as many leaders of religio-political parties condemned the recent attack in Gaza that left innocent civilians dead.
Talking to journalists at the procession outside G-6 Imambargah, chief of Majlis Wahdat Muslimeen (MWM) Allama Nasir Abbas said sacrifices made by respected personalities in Karbala were not limited to that time only.
“This is a message of principle; Yazid is not an individual but represents a behaviour by rulers and those in authority. One of the followers of Yazidiat in current times is Israel, as it is their policy to kill innocent civilians including minors in Gaza and elsewhere,” he said.
Meanwhile, Shia Ulema Council Vice President Allama Arif Wahidi criticised Israeli action in Gaza and restrictions on Muharram processions in India-held Kashmir.
“The armed forces with the support of the whole nation have defeated terrorists and the fruits of peace and victory in the war against terror should be visible all over. We receive requests from our Sunni brethren about them wanting to participate in processions but the security system prevents them to move in freely,” Allama Wahidi said, calling on the authorities to allow women and children to stand on rooftops of their houses along the procession route.
While people were allowed to bring food for distribution as niaz, many locals lodged complaints with the deputy commissioner against blocking of streets in G-6-1/3.
“There has to be a mechanism. We also want to establish sabeels, but authorities do not allow us to come out and this is not fair,” said Kamran Abbasi, a local resident.
A large number of sabeels offering water and sherbet were established along the procession route by residents and by the managements of mosques belonging to the Barelvi school of thought in G-7 sector.
The procession commenced after noon prayers from Markazi Imambargah and after passing through its traditional route, culminated at the same imambarghah after 10pm. The number of participants seemed to be higher than before.
Security measures were managed by police, Rangers and Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel while the deputy commissioner was present in the procession.
Taxila

Sources in the ministry said during the last few years efforts were made to finalise a new policy but these could not bear fruits.
They said that there was a need to make changes to the existing policy to make it relevant and rationale.

Similarly, during PTI’s tenure, a proper policy was not finalised and only a national education policy framework was issued.
Officials of the education ministry, while referring to the draft policy, said in 2016 it was decided that nine more chapters would be added to the national policy and it would be made into a comprehensive national document.
The issue of new education policy was also highlighted a couple of months ago in National Assembly as well. 
In reply to a question, MNA Shahida Rehmani was informed by Minister of Education Rana Tanveer Hussain that the National Education Policy 2009 was still intact and work on development of a new policy had been initiated.

“In this regard, a National Education Policy Framework was also issued in 2018 where uniform education system was one of the priority areas,” the minister stated in his response.
