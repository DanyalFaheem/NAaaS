0,Former Tata chairman Cyrus Mistry dies in road accident,"The accident took place in Palghar, located about 100 kilometres north of Mumbai, on Sunday afternoon.","MUMBAI: Cyrus Mistry, the 54-year-old former chairman of Indian conglomerate Tata Sons, died in a road accident near financial capital Mumbai on Sunday, Indian police said.
Mistry was ousted as chairman of Tata Sons, the holding company of the $300-billion salt-to-software Tata conglomerate, in a boardroom coup in 2016, sparking a long-drawn-out legal tussle on which India’s top court eventually ruled in Tata Group’s favour.
The accident took place in Palghar, located about 100 kilometres north of Mumbai, on Sunday afternoon. Mistry was travelling to Mumbai from Gujarat with three others, B. Patil, the top police official in Palghar district, said.
A senior Mumbai police official said the car in which Mistry was travelling had rammed into a divider, and that he had died at the accident site.
Several prominent politicians and industrialists tweeted their condolences after news of Mistry’s passing was reported. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Mistry’s demise untimely and shocking.
“He was a promising business leader who believed in India’s economic prowess. His passing away is a big loss to the world of commerce and industry,” Modi tweeted.
Mistry’s family and Tata Sons did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.
Mistry was the sixth chairman of the Tata group, a conglomerate started over 150 years ago, and the second not named Tata. He was the brother-in-law of Noel Tata, half-brother of Mistry’s predecessor as chair Ratan Tata.
Mistry’s grandfather first bought shares in Tata Sons in the 1930s. The Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group, founded by Mistry’s father, currently holds a near 18pc stake, making it the largest single shareholder in a firm mostly controlled by trusts.
The decades-long relationship between SP Group, one of the country’s largest construction firms, and Tata Group was strained following his sacking, and SP Group has since been looking to  “separate its interests” from Tata Sons.

1,Ukraine’s PM seeks more weapons during Berlin visit,Shmygal is the first high-level Ukrainian official to visit Germany in months.,"BERLIN: Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmygal on Sunday voiced hopes that Germany would become a leading player helping Kyiv to build up its air defences, as he sought more heavy weapons for Kyiv from Berlin.
Shmygal is the first high-level Ukrainian official to visit Germany in months, in a sign of eased tensions between Kyiv and Berlin after a rocky patch. Germany’s initial stuttering response on providing military support to Kyiv following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had sparked consternation.
But Shmygal acknowledged during his visit that Germany has since significantly stepped up its military aid, with heavy armaments such as the tank howitzer 2000 or MARS rocket launchers all  “working well on the battle field”.
The air defence system Iris-T is expected to be delivered in the autumn, he said, adding that Ukraine  “hopes that Germany will become one of the leaders in the process of developing Ukrainian air defence”.
In a speech on his vision for Europe on Monday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz had said he saw Germany taking on  “special responsibility” to help Ukraine build up its artillery and air defence systems.
Defence ministers of Nato allies are expected to arrive in Germany on Thursday for a meeting led by the United States to coordinate military needs for Ukraine. Ahead of the talks, Scholz stressed Germany’s commitment to bolstering Ukraine, but added that it would be done in coordination with  “our friends and allies”.
The Ukrainian prime minister had made the first stop on his trip to Berlin a meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, where Shmygal said he  “discussed the military situation, strengthening sanctions and the need to provide weapons for Ukraine”.
Shmygal also thanked Germany  “for solidarity with Ukrainians and support”.
Germany will  “continue to stand reliably by Ukraine’s side,” Steinmeier reassured Shmygal, according to the German president’s spokeswoman.
The cordial read-outs of their talks marked a clear change in tone from previous months, when a row had erupted in April because Steinmeier’s offer to visit Ukraine was rebuffed.
Steinmeier, a former foreign minister from Scholz’s Social Democratic Party, had been shunned over his years-long detente policy towards Moscow — something which he has admitted was a mistake following the outbreak of war.
Germany’s SPD has historically championed close ties with Russia, born out of the  “Ostpolitik” policy of rapprochement and dialogue with the then Soviet Union, devised by former SPD chancellor Willy Brandt in the 1970s.
That tradition contributed to Germany initially refusing any weapons deliveries to Kyiv, with a previous decision to send only 5,000 helmets sparking anger and mockery. But Scholz’s coalition, which also includes the Greens and liberal FDP, has since made a sharp U-turn.
Howitzers, rocket launchers and anti-aircraft missiles are among the weapons that have arrived in Kyiv. Heavier weapons like the IRIS-T anti-aircraft systems, rocket launchers mounted on pick-ups and anti-drone equipment are due in a further military aid package worth over 500 million euros. Ukrainian soldiers are currently being trained in Germany to use the anti-aircraft Leopard tanks.
On Sunday, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev accused Germany of leading a  “hybrid war” against Russia, justifying a stop in gas deliveries via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Europe.
“Firstly, Germany is an unfriendly country. Secondly, it has imposed sanctions against all of the Russian economy... and it is delivering lethal arms to Ukraine,” Medvedev said in support of his statement in a message published on Telegram.

2,Inhaled Covid-19 vaccine gets approval in China,Cansino says it is uncertain when vaccine would be able to go to market as additional administrative approvals are needed.,"HONG KONG: China’s CanSino Biologics Inc said on Sunday that its recently developed Covid-19 vaccine has been approved by the country’s drug regulator for emergency use as a booster, potentially benefiting its business.
The inhaled version of Cansino’s adenovirus-vectored Covid-19 vaccine has obtained the green light from the National Medical Products Administration, the company said in a filing on Sunday.
“The approval will have a positive impact on the company’s performance if the vaccine is subsequently purchased and used by relevant government agencies,” CanSino said.
The company cautioned, however, that it will face fierce competition from other vaccines in China that have also obtained government approval or are in clinical trials.
China granted emergency use authorisation to Livzon Pharmaceutical Group Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine as a booster, Livzon said on Friday, one of just two new products against the disease the country had cleared in more than a year.
Cansino also said it was uncertain when its vaccine would be able to go to market, since additional administrative approvals are still needed, while sales would depend on the Covid-19 situation at home and abroad, as well as China’s vaccination rate.
China has seen a recent flare-up in Covid outbreaks. The southern tech hub of Shenzhen imposed a weekend lockdown in most parts of the city on Saturday, while the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu put its 21 million people under lockdown on Thursday.
Mainland China reported 1,848 new coronavirus cases for Sept 3, including both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, compared with 1,988 new cases a day earlier.

The former two-term US president had already won a pair of Grammy Awards — for audio versions of his memoirs  “The Audacity of Hope” and  “Dreams from My Father” — so he now only needs an Oscar and a Tony to complete the estimable EGOT.
According to an Entertainment Weekly tracker, only 17 people have achieved an EGOT, including Mel Brooks, Whoopie Goldberg, Audrey Hepburn and — most recently — Jennifer Hudson. One other president had already been awarded an Emmy — Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 — although his was an honorary award.
After leaving office in 2017, both Obama and his wife Michelle have each written best-selling memoirs, and in addition to their non-profit foundation, have established a production company which has inked a major deal with Netflix, reportedly worth tens of millions of dollars.

4,Six die in bid to climb Russian volcano,KAMCHATKA: Six people have died climbing the Klyuchevskaya Sopka volcano in Russia’s far east and six more are...,"KAMCHATKA: Six people have died climbing the Klyuchevskaya Sopka volcano in Russia’s far east and six more are believed to be stranded on Sunday after freezing winds halted a rescue attempt.
The party of twelve, which includes two guides, set off to climb the 4,754-metre (15,597 ft) volcano on Tuesday but ran into trouble on Saturday when some of the group fell to their death at almost 4,200 metres, authorities say. One person is thought to have a broken leg, authorities said.
Rescuers attempted to reach them on Sunday but had to turn back as severe winds prevented their helicopter from landing. “They were scheduled to land at an altitude of 3,300 metres, but due to gale force winds at 30 metres per second (67 miles per hour), they failed to do so, although two attempts were made a few hours apart,” rescuers said.
Temperatures on the mountain can reach as low as minus 14 degrees Celsius (7 Fahrenheit) overnight.
Tatyana Yukhmanova, a representative from the local civil defence authority, said that rescuers will try to reach the group again tomorrow if weather conditions allow.
Klyuchevskaya Sopka is the tallest of over 160 volcanoes whose snowy peaks tower over Russia’s Kamch­atka peninsula. It forms part of a Unesco World Heritage Site listed for its exceptional natural beauty.
Rescuers warn that the mountain, made up mounds of volcanic rocks mixed with snow and ice, is considered particularly hazardous to climbers due to its altitude and the risk of volcanic eruption.

5,War crimes trial in post-WWII Ukraine unveiled at Venice festival,VENICE: Watching the powerful historical testament to the horrors of war and the depths of human cruelty in  “The...,"VENICE: Watching the powerful historical testament to the horrors of war and the depths of human cruelty in  “The Kiev Trial” at the Venice Film Festival, it can seem that little has changed.
The out-of-competition documentary by Ukranian director Sergei Loznitsa uses archival footage of a now-forgotten war crimes trial of 15 Germans held in Kyiv in 1946.
But the atrocities that witnesses recount in the black-and-white film has echoes of war crimes that Ukraine accuses Russia of having committed on its soil in recent months.
The International Criminal Cou­rt is currently investigating war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Ukraine.
“History repeats itself when we do not learn from history. When we don’t study and don’t want to know,” warned Loznitsa, speaking to journalists on Sunday.
This year, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began in February,  “we all realised we were (back) 80 years ago,” he said.
“We just started to repeat the same things. And it means we did not learn after the war.” The trial was held in January 1946, just as the Allies’ groundbreaking Nuremberg Trials against Nazi war criminals were beginning Stalin sought to use the trials in Kyiv for his own propaganda purposes, Loznitsa said.
The Ukranian director relied on about three hours of footage shot by the Soviets to document the trial, including the arraignment, witness testimony, defence statements and verdict — and finally, the public hanging of the 15 defendants.
The atrocities occurred on different dates and in different places throughout Ukraine, including Babyn Yar, where nearly 34,000 Jews were shot to death in massive pits.
Babyn Yar was the subject of a documentary by Loznitsa last year that played at the Cannes Film Festival in May.
Buried alive
In  “The Kiev Trial,”, witnesses describe the countless horrors inflicted on the local population by the Germans — children shot in their mothers’ arms, the elderly ordered to lie down in pits and shot by drunken firing squads, old men set upon by dogs, people thrown down a mine shaft, patients in a psychiatric hospital shot, and more.
The prosecutor asks one defendant why he felt it necessary to shoot the children in a town that his troops were razing to the ground. “Because they were all running around the village,” he replies.
A woman testifies how she played dead after the mass shooting at Babyn Yar.

6,Pope Francis beatifies ‘Smiling’ John Paul I,VATICAN CITY: Thousands of people gathered in St Peter’s Square on Sunday as Pope Francis presided over the...,"VATICAN CITY: Thousands of people gathered in St Peter’s Square on Sunday as Pope Francis presided over the beatification of John Paul I, the so-called  “Smiling Pope” who led the Catholic Church for just 33 days before dying in contested circumstances.
John Paul I, the son of a bricklayer from the Dolomite mountains and a particularly warm and pastoral figure, was elected pope on Aug 26, 1978, at the age of 65.
He died just 33 days later, on Sept 28, 1978, of a heart attack, making him the shortest serving pontiff in modern church history.
A crowd of several thousand including Italian President Sergio Mattarella gathered under umbrellas through a thunderstorm to listen to the beatification mass — a step before canonization and becoming a  “saint”.“How beautiful is a Church with a happy, serene and smiling face, that never closes doors, never hardens hearts, never complains or harbours resentment, does not grow angry or impatient, does not look dour or suffer nostalgia for the past.”A wall hanging representing the late pope was hung on the front of St Peter’s basilica.
The death of John Paul I death sparked intense speculation as to the cause, from suicide — he seemed reluctant to take on the position of pope — to murder, allegedly by those who opposed his plans to reform the church, particularly the powerful Vatican bank.
Many have since discounted this and biographer Christophe Henning said the swirling rumours can be explained by the sudden nature of his death and the  “calamitous communication” by the Vatican at the time.

7,Floods claim 112 lives in Sudan,"Last month, the country declared a state of emergency due to floods in six states.","KHARTOUM: More than 100 people have been killed and tens of thousands of homes destroyed by flooding caused by torrential rain since Sudan’s wet season began in May, police said on Sunday.
Heavy rains usually fall in Sudan between May and October, and the country faces severe flooding every year, wrecking property, infrastructure and crops.
Last month, Sudan declared a state of emergency due to floods in six states.
“The number of people killed by floods and heavy rains has reached 112,” said Abdel Jalil Abdelreheem, spokesman for Sudan’s National Council for Civil Defence, a unit of the police.
The authorities had previously in late August given a figure of 79 dead from flooding so far this wet season.
“A total of 34,944 houses were completely destroyed while 49,060 were partially damaged,” Abdelreheem said, adding that around 115 people had been injured.
The crisis comes as Sudan reels from deepening political unrest and a spiralling economic crisis exacerbated by last year’s military coup led by army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.
The United Nations, citing government figures, said a week ago that the floods have so far affected 226,000 people across Sudan.
The eastern states of Gedaref and Kassala, North and South Kordofan state, River Nile state, and the Darfur region were among the most badly affected, according to the UN children’s agency, Unicef.
The UN also warned that flooding this year could affect up to 460,000 people — far higher than the average 388,600 people affected annually between 2017 and 2021.

8,Temperatures soar to new records in California,"The worst of the heat was concentrated in the Central Valley on Sunday, where temperatures climbed to 109 degrees Fahrenheit.","LOS ANGELES: Record high temperatures were recorded in California’s Central Valley from Sacramento to outside of Los Angeles on Sunday, with officials warning that the dangerous heat wave could afflict the state through the end of the week and test the limits of the electric grid.
State officials on Sunday urged residents to limit their power usage for the fifth day in a row as energy demand spiked and temperatures were still on the rise.
The worst of the heat was concentrated in the Central Valley on Sunday, where temperatures climbed to 109 degrees Fahrenheit. The thermometer could hit 115 degrees by midweek, the National Weather Service said, warning residents to stay indoors to avoid heat-related illness.
“The heat wave begins in earnest today with dangerous temperatures now forecast to extend through the end of the week,” National Weather Service Sacramento wrote on Twitter on Sunday.
The southern California city of San Diego, which set a record temperature on Saturday of 95 degrees, set another record on Sunday, National Weather Service forecaster Tony Fracasso said, although afternoon thunderstorms offered some relief.
The California Independent System Operator (ISO), which oversees the state’s electric grid, extended a  “flex alert” to a fifth day, asking state residents to set their thermostats to 78 degrees or higher, avoid using major appliances, and turn off lights in order to conserve energy.
“Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday in particular are shaping up to be the most difficult of this heat wave,” the agency said in a news release.
It added that the state’s ongoing wildfires and potential new blazes could further strain the power grid by crippling lines and generators. More than two decades of drought and rising temperatures, exacerbated by climate change, have made California more vulnerable than ever to wildfires.

9,Trump brands Biden ‘enemy of the state’ at Pennsylvania rally,Says the “egregious abuse of the law” was going to produce “a backlash the likes of which nobody has ever seen.”,"WILKES BARRE: Donald Trump branded Joe Biden an  “enemy of the state” on Saturday as he hit back at the US president’s assertion that the Republican and his supporters are undermining American democracy, and slammed last month’s FBI raid of his Florida home.
Making his first public appearance since the August 8 raid, Trump told a rally in Pennsylvania that the search was a  “travesty of justice” and warned it would produce  “a backlash the likes of which nobody has ever seen.”  “There can be no more vivid example of the very real threats from American freedom than just a few weeks ago, you saw, when we witnessed one of the most shocking abuses of power by any administration in American history,” Trump claimed, despite long-standing protocols by which the Justice Department and the FBI act independently of the White House.
Trump told cheering supporters at the “Save America” gathering in the city of Wilkes-Barre that the  “egregious abuse of the law” was going to produce  “a backlash the likes of which nobody has ever seen.” 
He also hit back at Biden’s speech this week in which the president said his predecessor and Republican supporters  “represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.” 
Speaking in Philadelphia, the cradle of US democracy, on Thursday, the president launched an extraordinary assault on those Republicans who embrace Trump’s  “Make America Great Again” ideology — and urged his own supporters to fight back in what he billed as a  “battle for the Soul of the Nation.” 
Trump slammed it as the  “most vicious, hateful and divisive speech ever delivered by an American president.”  “He’s an enemy of the state. You want to know the truth. The enemy of the state is him,” Trump said.
“Republicans in the MAGA movement are not the ones trying to undermine our democracy,” continued Trump, who has repeatedly claimed the 2020 presidential election, which he lost, was rigged; and whose party has made unfounded claims of voter fraud a central plank of their platform.
“We are the ones trying to save our democracy, very simple. The danger to democracy comes from the radical left, not from the right,” Trump added.
He was appearing at the rally ahead of November’s midterm elections, which could see Biden’s Democrats lose control of both houses of Congress.
‘Top secret’ files 
Even although Trump is not on the ballot, Biden, 79, is seeking to turn the vote into a referendum on his predecessor in a bid to hold on to the Senate and House of Representatives.
At the Wilkes-Barre rally — where Trump took to the stage to support his candidate in the Senate race, TV physician Mehmet Oz — Trump supporter Edward Young said he had been  “disgusted” by Biden’s speech. “He declared war on me. He declared war on half of America,” Young said.
The duelling visits by Biden and Trump to Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, come as the Republican is under increasing legal pressure over the documents found by the FBI at his Mar-a-Lago estate.
The Justice Department has said in court filings that highly classified government documents, including some marked  “Top Secret,” were discovered in Trump’s personal office during the raid.
A detailed list of what was seized also showed Trump held on to more than 11,000 unclassified government records that he claims are his to keep — but legally are owned by the National Archives.
Among the papers seized were 18 documents labelled  “top secret”, 53 labelled  “secret” and another 31 marked  “confidential.” Of those, seven top secret files, 17 secret files and three confidential files were retrieved from Trump’s private office.
Agents also found several dozen empty folders labelled  “classified” in the office, raising speculation that sensitive documents may have been lost, destroyed or moved.
Trump, who is keeping supporters and commentators guessing about whether he intends to run for president again 2024, has sued to have the documents turned over to a neutral  “special master,” a move that could slow the government’s probe.

10,"UK angry with France as 1,000 migrants cross Channel",The defence ministry said 960 migrants were detected making the dangerous crossing in 20 boats.,"LONDON: Nearly  1,000 migrants crossed the Channel in small boats on Saturday, the UK  government said on Sunday, as growing numbers of arrivals have exacerbated  tensions between Britain and France.
The defence ministry said 960 migrants were detected making the dangerous crossing in 20 boats.
This came after 1,295 migrants were spotted making the crossing on August 22, setting a new record for a single day.
The  issue has caused a major political headache for the UK government,  which promised tighter border controls after leaving the European Union.
Tensions have risen between London and Paris, with the UK government accusing France of not doing enough to stop the crossings.
So  far this year there have been more than 26,000 crossings, while now is  the peak time of year for those attempting to enter the UK this way. Over the whole of 2021 just over 28,500 migrants were detected in around 1,000 boats.
The  UK last month vowed to speed up removals of Albanians illegally  entering the country as official statistics showed they were now the  largest single group making small-boat crossings of the Channel.
In previous years, asylum seekers from war zones made up the vast bulk of small-boat arrivals.
Greece blocked over 150,000 migrants
Greece has blocked over 150,000 undocumented migrants on its land and maritime border so far this year, the migration minister said on Sunday.
“The entry of 154,102 irregular migrants was averted since the start of the year. Around 50,000 attempted to invade Greece in August alone,” Notis Mitarachi told Eleftheros Typos daily.
Border control is a top priority for the conservative Greek government that came to power in 2019, and will seek re-election next year.
Last month, the government announced plans to extend a 40-kilometre (25-mile) long wall along the Greek-Turkish border at Evros by another 80 kilometres as part of efforts to control the flow of migrants. It will also install thermal cameras and deploy an additional 250 border guards.
Greece is often the country of choice for people fleeing Africa and the Middle East to try to reach a better life in the European Union.
Thousands come via Turkey by crossing the Evros River, and over the narrow and perilous Aegean Sea crossing separating the traditional rivals.
Charity groups have accused Athens of illegally turning back migrants or forcing them over the border to Turkey — something Greece’s conservative government has repeatedly denied.
Mitarachi on Sunday denied Athens was involved in illegal pushbacks, and accused Turkey of engaging in  “violent push forwards”.
Athens last month accused Turkey of forcibly pushing a group of stranded migrants onto a small Greek islet on the river.
Rights groups at the time said a five-year-old child in the group had died after the Greek government for days denied that the migrants were on Greek territory.
Mitarachi has cast doubt on the incident. On Sunday he insisted that the family in question has declared having four children, and that they were all rescued by Greek police.
“To put it very simply, the family brought forward four children, and four we rescued,” he said.
“Many inconsistencies have been noted in what (the family) said at the beginning, what they said afterwards, and in what has been proven so far,” the minister said.

The Austrian-registered Cessna 551 aircraft was flying from Jerez in southern Spain, from where it took off at 1256 GMT without a set destination, according to FlightRadar24 website.
It turned twice, at Paris and Cologne, before heading straight out over the Baltic, passing near the Swedish island of Gotland. At 1737 GMT it was listed on the flight tracker as rapidly losing speed and altitude.
“We’ve learned that the plane has crashed (in the ocean) north-west of the town of Ventspils in Latvia,” a spokesperson for Sweden’s rescue service said.  “It has disappeared from the radar.” 
German and Danish war planes had earlier been sent to inspect the aircraft as it passed through those countries’ airspace, but were unable to make contact, Johan Wahlstrom of the Swedish Maritime Administration said. “They could not see anyone in the cockpit,” he said.
German newspaper Bild reported that a man, a woman and their two daughters were aboard, without sourcing the information.
A Lithuanian air force helicopter was dispatched to the crash site for search and rescue at neighbouring Lat­via’s request, a Lithuanian air force spokesperson said. Latvia said it had also sent ships to the scene.
“Our ships are on the way to the position where the plane crash happened”, Liva Veita, spokesperson of Latvian Navy, said.

12,"50 years to agree compensation for Olympic attack ‘shameful’, says German president",BERLIN: Germany’s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted on Sunday it was  “shameful” that it took five...,"BERLIN: Germany’s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted on Sunday it was  “shameful” that it took five decades for Berlin to agree compensation for the bereaved families of Israeli victims in the 1972 Munich Olympics attack.
“That it took 50 years to reach this agreement in the last days is indeed shameful,” said Steinmeier, standing next to his Israeli counterpart Isaac Herzog, with whom he will be attending a commemoration ceremony in Munich on Monday.
A row over the financial offer previously made by Berlin to victims’ relatives had threatened to sour the ceremony, with families initially planning a boycott.
But a deal was finally agreed on Wednesday offering 28 million euros ($28 million) in compensation. It also — for the first time — sees the German state acknowledging its  “responsibility” in failings that led to the carnage.
On Sept 5, 1972, eight men of the Palestinian group Black September stormed into the Israeli team’s flat at the Olympic village, shooting dead two and taking nine Israelis hostage.
West German police responded with a bungled rescue operation in which all nine hostages were killed, along with five of the eight hostage-takers and a police officer.
The Games were meant to showcase a new Germany 27 years after the Holocaust, but instead opened a deep rift with Israel.
In 2012, Israel released 45 official documents on the killings, including specially declassified material, which lambasted the performance of the German security services.
Included in the reports is an official account from the former Israeli intelligence head Zvi Zamir who said the German police  “didn’t make even a minimal effort to save human lives”.
Relatives of victims have over the years battled to obtain an official apology from Germany, access to official documents and appropriate compensation beyond an initial 4.5 million euros.
As recently as just two weeks ago, relatives of the victims said they were offered 10 million euros — including the 4.5 million euros already given.
“I came home with the coffins after the massacre,” Ankie Spitzer, whose husband Andre Spitzer was killed in the hostage-taking, said.
“You don’t know what we’ve gone through for the past 50 years.” Herzog underlined the pain faced by the bereaved relatives, saying they simply  “hit a wall” whenever they tried to raise the issue with Germany or even with the International Olympic Committee.

13,Nasa unsure about Moon rocket launch attempt this month,"Says next possible launch window is Sept 19 to Oct 4, and failing that, Oct 17 to 31.","KENNEDY CENTER: After scrapping a second attempt to get its new 30-story lunar rocket off the ground due to a fuel leak, Nasa officials said on Saturday it may not be possible to try again this month.
The current launch window for Nasa’s Artemis 1 mission to the Moon ends on Tuesday and is  “definitely off the table,” said Jim Free, associate administrator for Exploration Systems Develop­ment, at a press conference.
The next possible launch window is Sept 19 to Oct 4, and failing that, Oct 17 to 31, Nasa said.
The ability to take off during those windows  “will really depend on the options that the team comes back with likely on Monday or early Tuesday morning,” said Free.
Millions around the globe tuned in to live coverage and crowds gathered on beaches in Florida on Saturday hoping to witness the historic blastoff of the Space Launch System (SLS).
But a leak near the base of the rocket was found as ultra-cold liquid hydrogen was being pumped in, forcing a halt.
The Artemis 1 space mission hopes to test the SLS as well as the unmanned Orion capsule that sits atop, in preparation for future Moon-bound journeys with humans aboard.
The first launch attempt on Monday had also been halted after engineers detected a fuel leak and a sensor showed that one of the rocket’s four main engines was too hot.
“This is a whole new vehicle, a whole new technology, a whole new purpose of going back to the moon and preparation to go to Mars,” said Nasa administrator Bill Nelson.  “Yes, it’s hard.” Artemis mission manager Mike Sarafin described the hydrogen leak as  “large,” and said one of their  “leading suspects” was a seal on a fueling tube.
Engineering teams believe they will have to replace the seal, either directly on the launch pad or after taking the rocket back to its assembly building a few miles away.
It was  “too early” to entirely rule out a launch before the end of September, said Sarafin, who promised a status update next week.
Nasa has previously said that the early October period would be complicated to coordinate because a crew of astronauts will be using the Kennedy Space Center for a rocket launch to the International Space Station. In addition to the leak, another problem facing the SLS is its emergency self-destruct system.
Designed to explode in case the rocket deviates off course, the system will likely need to be reexamined before the next launch, which can only be done in the assembly building. Bringing the rocket in and out of the building will take  “several weeks,” Sarafin said.
Apollo’s twin sister 
Once launched by SLS, the Orion capsule will take several days to reach the Moon, flying around 60 miles (100 kilometres) at its closest approach.
The capsule will fire its engines to get to a distant retrograde orbit (DRO) of 40,000 miles beyond the Moon, a record for a spacecraft rated to carry humans.
Mannequins equipped with sensors are standing in for astronauts on the Artemis 1 mission and will record acceleration, vibration and radiation levels.
The trip is expected to last around six weeks and one of its main objectives is to test the capsule’s heat shield, which at 16 feet in diameter is the largest ever built.
On its return to Earth’s atmosphere, the heat shield will have to withstand speeds of 25,000 miles per hour and a temperature of 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius) — roughly half as hot as the Sun.
Artemis is named after the twin sister of the Greek god Apollo, after whom the first Moon missions were named.
Unlike the Apollo missions, which sent only white men to the Moon between 1969 and 1972, Artemis missions will see the first person of color and the first woman step foot on the lunar surface. A successful Artemis 1 mission would come as a huge relief to the US space agency, after years of delays and cost overruns.
The cost of the Artemis programme is estimated to reach $93 billion by 2025, with each of its first four missions clocking in at a whopping $4.1 billion per launch, according to a government audit.
The next mission, Artemis 2, will take astronauts to the Moon without landing on its surface.
The crew of Artemis 3 is to land on the Moon in 2025 at the earliest, with later missions envisaging a lunar space station and a sustainable presence on the lunar surface.
A crewed trip to the red planet aboard Orion, which would last several years, could be attempted by the end of the 2030s.
