Farah’s win, which a month ahead of the London Marathon proper, followed the four-time Olympic champion’s shock defeat by club runner Ellis Cross in a 10 kilometre race in London in May.
That reverse led to a fresh debate over whether the 39-year-old Farah, who won double Olympic gold (5,000m and 10,000m) at both the 2012 and 2016 Games, should retire from competitive racing.
But he was out on front in south London on Sunday, crossing the finish line in Greenwich in a time of 61 minutes and 49 seconds after surging clear of the field in the final three miles of a 13.1-mile course.
Jack Rowe was second and defending champion Jake Smith third.
“Today wasn’t easy but most important is the win and it is nice to be back,” Farah told BBC Sport.
Somalia-born Farah, who in July revealed he had been illegally trafficked into Britain as a child, added:  “The key thing for me today was to try and win, no matter what happened.
“It was to play around with things, pick up my drink and all practice ahead of the London Marathon.” Scotland’s Commonwealth Games gold medallist Eilish McColgan won the elite women’s race with a record time of 67.34 minutes but unlike Farah she will not be competing in the London Marathon.
McColgan suffered an adverse reaction while refuelling during long-distance races and has been diagnosed with rebound hypoglycemia — a condition affecting endurance athletes that leads to reduced blood sugar levels and means there is not enough glucose in the blood to meet the body’s demands.
But McColgan stuck to water on Sunday as she bettered Charlotte Purdue’s time of 69.51 minutes last year.
“To run a two-minute course record, I can’t ask any more,” she said.

1,Freiburg go top as Union hold Bayern,"BERLIN: A goal from Joshua Kimmich was too little for Bayern Munich on Saturday, as the German champions were held ...","BERLIN: A goal from Joshua Kimmich was too little for Bayern Munich on Saturday, as the German champions were held to a draw for the second week in a row at Union Berlin and knocked off top spot in the Bundesliga.
Union battled to a well-earned point at home to Bayern, allowing fellow high-fliers Freiburg to leapfrog their way into first after they beat Bayer Leverkusen in a five-goal thriller.
After their impressive start to the season, Union had begun the day hot on Bayern’s heels with only goal difference separating the two teams.
They showed why early in the first half, taking the lead through Sheraldo Becker with a brilliantly worked free-kick to stun the champions and send the home crowd into ecstasy.
Their celebrations were cut short a few minutes later as Bayern immediately turned the screws and Kimmich levelled the scores with a fizzing, first-time finish from the edge of the area.
Bayern were repeatedly thwarted by Danish goalkeeper Frederik Ronnow as both sides had chances to win the game in a thrilling battle after the break.
Their second slip in as many weeks mean the champions are now in third, behind Borussia Dortmund and surprise leaders Freiburg, who beat Leverkusen 3-2.
Leverkusen took the lead on 16 minutes, Kerem Demirbay prodding the ball in after some penalty-box pinball.
Yet Freiburg hit back with two quick goals after half time, Matthias Ginter heading in the equaliser from a corner early before Michael Gregoritsch capitalised on a defensive error to turn the game on its head.
Chelsea loanee Callum Hudson-Odoi then set up Patrick Schick with a fine cross just minutes after coming off the bench for his debut, but Ritsu Doan restored Freiburg’s lead just a few minutes later.
Elsewhere, former Bayern coach Niko Kovac’s difficult start to life at Wolfsburg continued with a 4-2 defeat to Cologne.
Wolfsburg took the lead through Lukas Nmecha after just two minutes, but they were booed into the tunnel at half time after Cologne stormed from behind to take control of the game.
Dejan Ljubicic levelled the scores with a cool finish at the end of a delightful passing move, before a Paulo Otavio own goal and a Florian Kainz penalty gave the visitors a deserved 3-1 lead at the break.
Nmecha gave the hosts late hope with a goal in the second half, before Sargis Adamyan restored Cologne’s two-goal lead.
Two Niclas Fullkrug goals fired Werder Bremen to a 2-0 victory over bottom side Bochum, while Schalke are still looking for their first win of the season after a 1-1 draw at Stuttgart.
Chris Fuehrich gave Stuttgart the lead, but Simon Terodde salvaged a point for Schalke with his first goal of the season.

2,"Lewandowski on target again, Real stay perfect",MADRID: Robert Lewan­dowski sco­red his fifth goal in four La Liga games for Barcelona and helped his team breeze...,"MADRID: Robert Lewan­dowski sco­red his fifth goal in four La Liga games for Barcelona and helped his team breeze past Sevilla with a 3-0 win on Satu­rday, while Real Madrid made it four wins from four with victory over Real Betis. 
The win lifts Barcelona to second place in the table on 10 points, two behind leaders Real Madrid.
For Julen Lopetegui’s team, however, it was their third defeat in four games, leaving them with only one point in 17th place.
Roared on by their fans at a sold-out Sanchez Pizjuan stadium, Sevilla enjo­yed an impressive start, pressing Barce­lona high and cornering their rivals.
But the visitors silenced the crowd in a lightning counter attack in the 21st minute, ending with Raphinha heading in a rebound from a Lewandowski chipped shot that a defender cleared off the line.
Fifteen minutes later, Jules Kounde sent a perfect cross into the box that Lewandowski caught on his chest before striking his volley into the bottom left corner.
Ten minutes into the second half, Kounde provided another assist, heading a corner at the right post on to Eric Garcia, who thumped home from close range to wrap up the three points.
Lewandowski kept trying to lob the goalkeeper and delivered another attempted chip in a counter-attack in the 73rd minute only to be denied by a defe­nder on the goal again, with Frenkie de Jong almost scoring from the rebound.
The Dutch midfielder shot just wide of the post again five minutes later.Vinicius Junior struck for the third game running as Real took an  early lead at the Santiago Bernabeu, but Sergio Canales soon equalised  with a goal against his former club. 
Rodrygo secured a 2-1 win for Carlo Ancelotti’s side just past the  hour with his first goal of the campaign, ending Betis’ perfect start. 
Playing at home for  the first time this season as renovation work continues on their iconic  ground, Real had a lucky early escape when Nabil Fekir appeared to be  fouled in the area. 
The incident went unpunished and was not reviewed, but Fekir injured his hamstring and had to be replaced. 
Real promptly inflicted a sucker punch as Vinicius raced onto  David Alaba’s ball over the top, lobbing Betis goalkeeper Rui Silva for  the opening goal. 
Betis, who began the season with wins over Elche, Mallorca and  Osasuna, hit back when Borja Iglesias laid off a throw-in for Canales to  drive through the legs of Thibaut Courtois. 
Vinicius should have immediately restored Real’s lead, blazing  over a cross from Rodrygo. Silva then made a miraculous stop to claw out  Aurelien Tchouameni’s header. 
The Betis keeper again got his fingers to a powerful effort from  Luka Modric, but Rodrygo had the final say when he slid home Fede  Valverde’s pass on 65 minutes. 
Atletico Madrid drew 1-1 at Real Sociedad as Nigeria striker Umar Sadiq scored on his debut for the hosts. 
Alvaro Morata swept in at a corner in the fifth minute, but Sadiq  headed home a second-half equaliser following his arrival from Almeria. 
Mallorca and Girona drew 1-1 in the early game.

5,Antony scores on debut as United end Arsenal’s perfect start,Brazilian’s clinical strike and Marcus Rashford’s double inspire 3-1 win for Manchester United.,"LONDON: Antony scored on his dream debut for Manchester United as the Brazilian’s clinical strike and Marcus Rashford’s double inspired a 3-1 win that ended Arsenal’s perfect start to the Premier League season on Sunday.
Antony was making his first appearance after signing from United manager Erik ten Hag’s former club Ajax in an 82 million ($94 million) deal on Thursday.
Full of flicks, tricks and purposeful movement, the 22-year-old forward took just 35 minutes to get on the scoresheet in a dazzling introduction to his new fans at Old Trafford.
Arsenal hit back to equalise through Bukayo Saka, but Rashford blew the leaders away with two goals in the space of nine second-half minutes after Antony was replaced by Cristiano Ronaldo.
Thanks to Antony and Rash­ford, United were able to celebrate a fourth successive victory that lifted them to fifth place.
Opening his reign with consecutive losses against Brighton and Brentford was a humbling experience for Ten Hag.
But since then, the Dutch coach has started to put his imprint on a United side that look far more organised than the shambolic unit that finished sixth in the Premier League last season.
Arsenal’s first defeat this term after five successive wins was cruel on Mikel Arteta’s men, who contributed plenty to an engrossing encounter but paid the price for some naive defending.
Arsenal thought they had snatched the lead in the 12th minute as Gabriel Martinelli raced away from Diogo Dalot to clip a fine finish over David de Gea.
But VAR intervened to ask Paul Tierney to check for a foul in the build-up and the referee ruled Martin Odegaard pushed Christian Eriksen to steal possession.
Antony put United ahead in the 35th minute when Rashford’s deft pass reached the forward, who took advantage of Arsenal’s sloppy marking to sweep a composed finish into the far corner from eight yards.
Antony kissed his badge and posed for the television cameras in a flamboyant celebration that sent Old Trafford into raptures, earning a ticking off from Tierney for sticking the ball up his shirt in front of the Arsenal fans.
Confidence clearly was not a problem for Antony and he even tried an audacious lob that kept Arsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale on his toes.
Antony departed to a standing ovation after 58 minutes to be replaced by Ronaldo.
Saka silenced Old Trafford two minutes later as Arsenal grabbed a deserved equaliser.
Odegaard’s pass unhinged the United defence and when Dalot’s tackle on Gabriel Jesus diverted the ball to Saka, the England winger slotted home with ease.
But United caught Arsenal with a brilliant counter in the 66th minute.
Playing through the Arsenal press, Eriksen found Bruno Fernandes and his superb pass sent Rashford galloping clear to fire past Ramsdale.
United wrapped up the points with a replica of their second goal as Arsenal once again left themselves open at the back and this time Eriksen fed Rashford to slot home.
In Sunday’s early game, Brighton extended their superb start to the season with a 5-2 victory that left bottom of the table Leicester in turmoil.
Graham Potter’s fourth-placed side made it four wins from their first six games thanks to a second-half surge at the Amex Stadium.
Kelechi Iheanacho put Leicester ahead in the first minute, but a Luke Thomas own goal and Moises Caicedo’s strike gave Brighton the advantage.
Patson Daka equalised for Leicester, but the struggling visitors collapsed after half-time as Leandro Trossard put Brighton in front before Alexis Mac Allister’s double sealed the rout.
Leicester have taken just one point from their first six games, losing five in a row to leave boss Brendan Rodgers under severe pressure.
CITY HELD BY GERRARD’S VILLA
Champions Manchester City were held to a 1-1 draw at Aston Villa in  the Premier League on Saturday after Erling Haaland grabbed his 10th  goal in six games.
Jamaican Leon Bailey fired in a fine equaliser  for Villa in the 74th minute after excellent work from Jacob Ramsey who  provided a crisp, low cross which the winger curled into the top corner  with a first-time left-foot finish.
Haaland had put Pep  Guardiola’s side in front, five minutes into the second half, after  connecting with an excellent deep cross from the right flank by Kevin De  Bruyne.
The Norwegian, who had struck hat-tricks in the last two  games, pulled away behind the back post and leapt to steer the ball home  with a precise volley.
De Bruyne then hit the bar with a dipping free kick but Villa defended well against a wave of City attacks before Bailey struck.
Gerrard,  who has admitted to feeling under pressure due to Villa’s poor start to  the season, threw on Philippe Coutinho and the Brazilian had the ball  in the net only to see the flag raised for offside.
No VAR review  was possible for that effort, but replays suggested Coutinho may have  been in an onside position and Gerrard said it had been a  “legitimate  goal”.
The result leaves City in second place on 14 points, one  behind leaders Arsenal who face Manchester United at Old Trafford on  Sunday.

MISANO: Francesco Bag­naia insisted he was not thinking about winning the MotoGP championship des­pite triumphing at Misano Adriatico on Sunday to claim his fourth straight win and close in on leader Fabio Quartararo.
Ducati rider Bagnaia pipped Enea Bastianini by just 0.034 seconds in a thrilling San Marino Grand Prix victory which moved him above Aleix Espargaro into second and within 30 points of reigning world champion Quartararo, who finished fifth.
But the 25-year-old Italian said after claiming the honours he would only start thinking about snatching the crown from Yamaha’s Quartararo  French­man Quartararo is looking over his shoulder and despite believing he did a  “really great job” cut a disconsolate figure after finishing over five seconds behind Bagnaia.
Bagnaia’s victory was all the more impressive for him being forced to start from fifth after a three-place grid penalty imposed during practice on Friday.After taking the lead on lap three Bagnaia held off first Maverick Vinales and then Bastianini to claim his sixth win from the 14 GPs completed in the 20-race season.
Bastianini will be Bagnaia’s team-mate on the factory Ducati bike next season and he showed why he is moving up from the satellite Gresini team.
The 24-year-old, who had started second on the grid, pushed past Vinales and behind Bagnaia on lap 20 and then piled the pressure on his compatriot.
The pair were practically wheel-to-wheel for the final few laps and after trying to overtake with only a few turns remaining crossed the line almost alongside Bagnaia.Bagnaia’s team-mate Jack Miller had started on pole for the second time in his MotoGP career but was one of five riders to crash in a chaotic opening to the race.
Johann Zarco, Michele Pirro and Pol Espargaro all crashed out on the very first corner, while Miller and Marco Bezzechi went down a lap later.
Alonso Lopez became the first non-Kalex rider to win a Moto2 race since 2019 with his first ever GP triumph.
The Boscoscuro rider, who started the day 12th in the championship, finished ahead of Spaniards Aron Canet and Augusto Fernandez who snatched the overall lead from Japan’s Ai Ogura by four points.
In Moto3 Dennis Foggia made it three Misano wins in a row when he pipped Jaume Masia to close the gap between him and new championship leader Izan Guevara to 35 points.
Foggia is the first rider to complete the Moto3 hat-trick at the track and is 24 points behind Gue­vara’s fellow Aspar rider Sergio Garcia, who dropped down to second in the standings after being disqualified from the race for irresponsible riding.

“Today, I am announcing my retirement from T20 internationals,” Mushfiqur, 35, said in statement on social media. 
“I will proudly continue to represent Bangladesh in Test and ODI formats. I am hopeful that I can bring success for our nation in these two formats,” he added.
Mushfiqur added that he would continue to take part in the Bangladesh Premier League and other Twenty20 franchise tournaments.
Mushfiqur’s announcement came after Bangladesh lost their Group ‘B’ matches in the Asia Cup against Afghanistan and Sri Lanka in United Arab Emirates, in which he contributed only five runs.
It was his comeback tournament having missed the previous two series against the West Indies and Zimbabwe.
He played in 102 Twenty20 matches for Bangladesh and scored 1,500 runs at 19.48. He captained for 23 of those matches, leading Bangladesh to eight wins.
Mushfiqur is the second senior Bangladeshi cricketer to retire from Twenty20s in recent months after Tamim Iqbal.
Bangladesh have won just two of 12 matches in the shortest format since T20 World Cup last year.

8,"Perfect Nadal, battling Swiatek make US Open fourth round","Nadal takes his record over Gasquet to perfect 18-0 with 6-0, 6-1, 7-5 victory to stay on course for 23rd Grand Slam title.","NEW YORK: Rafael Nadal defeated close friend Richard Gasquet for the 18th time to reach the US Open fourth round on Saturday as world number one Iga Swiatek made the last 16 for a second successive year.
Four-time champion Nadal took his record over Gasquet to a perfect 18-0 with a 6-0, 6-1, 7-5 victory to stay on course for a 23rd Grand Slam title.
Nadal has now won 34 straight sets against Frenchman Gasquet who he first played as a junior.
On Saturday, he was barely troubled, winning the first nine games of the contest before Gasquet got on the board.
Next up for the Australian and French Open champion is 22nd seed Frances Tiafoe for a place in the quarter-finals.
“He’s a great player, very charismatic, very fast,” said Nadal of the American.
Tiafoe made the last 16 for a third successive year by seeing off Argentina’s Diego Schwartzman 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, 6-4.
The 36-year-old Nadal showed no ill effects of the bloodied nose he suffered when he accidentally bounced his racquet into his face in the second round.
“It’s a little bit bigger than usual but it’s okay,” he joked.
Carlos Alcaraz, widely-regarded as Nadal’s Grand Slam heir apparent, claimed a season-leading 47th win despite breaking one of his shoes.
The 19-year-old third seed defeated Jenson Brooksby of the United States 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 on the back of 46 winners.
Alcaraz, a quarter-finalist in 2021, managed to break one of his tennis shoes as he slid to reach a ball mid-match.
“It’s the third time that I have done this. As you can see, I do a lot of sliding,” he said.
Alcaraz next faces 2014 champion Marin Cilic who fired 26 aces and 74 winners in total past Britain’s Dan Evans in a 7-6 (13-11), 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, 7-5 win.
British seventh seed Cameron Norrie made the fourth round for the first time with a comfortable 7-5, 6-4, 6-1 win over Danish teenager Holger Rune.
He next faces Russian ninth seed Andrey Rublev who needed five match points to see off Canada’s Denis Shapo­valov 6-4, 2-6, 6-7 (3/7), 6-4, 7-6 (10-7).
World number one Swiatek downed unseeded Lauren Davis 6-3, 6-4.
Swiatek came back from 1-4 down in the second set to reel off five successive games against the American who called a medical time out in the first set to have her blood pressure taken.
The 21-year-old Pole will face Wimbledon quarter-finalist Jule Niemeier of Germany for a place in the last eight.
Swiatek has now won three matches in a row for the first time since capturing her second French Open in June.
“It’s not like I lost confidence or something. I still know anything can happen on these tournaments,” she said.
Petra Kvitova defeated ninth-seeded Garbine Muguruza after saving two match points.
Kvitova came through 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (12/10) and will take on Jessica Pegula of the United States for a quarter-final place.
Two-time Wimbledon champion Kvitova said she had drawn inspiration from Serena Williams when the American legend saved five match points before eventually being eliminated on Friday.
“I watched Serena and it was amazing how she was saving match points, so I tried to do the same today,” said two-time US Open quarter-finalist Kvitova who next faces three-time runner-up Victoria Azarenka.
Muguruza’s defeat, her sixth in seven meetings against the Czech, left only four of the top 10 women’s seeds in the tournament.
Sixth seed Aryna Sabalenka, who made the semi-finals in 2021, brushed aside French qualifier Clara Burel, 6-0, 6-2 in just 68 minutes.
Pegula, the eighth seed, ended the run of Chinese qualifier Yuan Yue, 6-2, 6-7 (6-8), 6-0.
Azarenka eased past Petra Martic 6-3, 6-0 to set up a last-16 clash with 2016 finalist Karolina Pliskova who downed Olympic champion Belinda Bencic 5-7, 6-4, 6-3.

9,Verstappen continues winning streak in home Dutch Grand Prix,Stretches his Formula One lead to a massive 109 points.,"ZANDVOORT: Red Bull’s Max Verstappen won his home Dutch Grand Prix from pole position for the second year in a row on Sunday and stretched his Formula One lead to a massive 109 points.
George Russell finished second for Mercedes with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc completing the podium at Zandvoort and Verstappen also taking a bonus point for fastest lap.
Leclerc and Verstappen’s Mexican team-mate Sergio Perez are tied on points but the Ferrari driver is ahead on wins with seven rounds remaining — and Verstappen more than four race victories clear.
In the constructors’ standings, Red Bull have 511 points to Ferrari’s 376.
“They threw everything at us but we made the right calls,” said Verstappen over the team radio as he took his fourth win in a row, and 10th of the season.
“Its always special to win your home grand prix, this year I had to work for it even more,” he added as the packed grandstands full of orange-shirted fans went into party overdrive.
Mercedes’ seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was fourth, the Briton fuming at his team after leading a race he might have won but for the timing of safety cars and a tyre stra­tegy that left him on slower tyres than rivals.
“I can’t believe you guys,” he said over the radio, with expletives filling the airwaves.
Hamilton had already complained that his hopes of winning had been  “stuffed” by a virtual safety car period triggered by AlphaTauri’s Yuki Tsunoda which allowed Verstappen to pit with less time lost.
The Japanese had initially stopped by the side of the track on the 44th of 72 laps, complaining his tyres had not been fitted properly.
Told they were OK, he returned to the pits for a tyre change and seatbelt check and was sent back out before stopping again and parking up.
The full safety car was deployed on lap 55 when Alfa Romeo’s Valtteri Bottas stopped just before the last corner, with Verstappen and Russell pitting for soft tyres but Hamilton staying out on the mediums.
Verstappen seized the lead back at the re-start and did not look back.
“We timed it really well out of that last corner into the banking. You could see the draft was quite strong and we got ahead. Its incredible to win again,” said the Dutch driver.
Perez finished fifth with Fern­ando Alonso sixth for Alpine and Lando Norris seventh for McLaren.
Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz ended up eighth after finishing fifth on the road but relegated due to a five-second penalty for an unsafe release in the pitlane. Alpine’s Esteban Ocon was ninth and Lance Stroll took the final point for Aston Martin.

ISLAMABAD: Ali Imran’s half-century guided Northern to a three-run victory over Central Punjab while Adil Amin’s quick unbeaten 40 helped Khyber Pakhtunkhwa overcome Sindh by six wickets in their respective National T20 Cup matches here at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Sunday.
In the first match, opener Tayyab Tahir’s third half-century of the tournament went in vain as Central Punjab lost to Northern.
Tayyab scored 53 off 39 (six fours and a six) and stitched a crucial 82-run second wicket partnership with Abdullah Shafiq (33 off 23, five fours) in a contest curtailed to 16 overs because of rain.
Northern’s Ali Imran, later named player of the match, smashed 56 at a strike rate of over 164 after Central Punjab captain Qasim Akram elected to bowl. 
Ali struck three sixes and as many fours in his 34-ball knock before he was dismissed by Mohammad Ali who returned figures of 3-33 in the penultimate over.
He added 39 runs with opener Hasan Nawaz (24 off 23) and 47 with Mubasir Khan (18 off 17) in what was an extraordinary rearguard after Northern were reduced to 10-2 in nine balls.
Sohail Tanvir made his experience count down the order smashing 20 runs off eight deliveries (two fours and a six).
In the second match of the day, Adil’s knock boosted Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to a 152-run target with eight balls spare.
Adil smashed three four and two sixes as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa crossed the line with six wickets in hand.
The batter was provided a solid platform for the run chase by openers Sahibzada Farhan (45 off 34) and Mohammad Haris (37 off 29) as they added 82 for the first wicket. 
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had a scare in the 11th over when both were dismissed by leg-spinner Zahid Mehmood.
Sindh’s Saad Khan top-scored with 40 off 36 and wicket-keeper Sarfaraz Ahmed made 27 not out off 24 after captain Saud Shakeel elected to bat.
Scores in brief: 
NORTHERN 146-7 in 16 overs (Ali Imran 56, Hasan Nawaz 24; Mohammad Ali 3-33, Ali Asfand 2-24); CENTRAL PUNJAB 143-5 in 16 overs (Tayyab Tahir 53, Abdullah Shafique 33; Salman Irshad 2-27).
SINDH 151-4 in 20 overs (Saad Khan 40, Sarfaraz Ahmed 27 not out; Mohammad Imran 2-30); KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA 154-4 in 18.4 overs (Sahibzada Farhan 45, Adil Amin 40 not out; Zahid Mehmood 2-32).

PARIS: Kylian Mbappe scored twice as Paris St Germain geared up for their Champions League opener with a routine 3-0 win at 10-man Nantes to stay top of the Ligue 1 standings on Saturday.
France forward Mbappe found the back of the net either side of the interval to take his season’s tally to seven before being replaced by Neymar as coach Chris­tophe Galtier looked to spare the duo before PSG host Juventus on Tuesday.
PSG now turn their attentions to the Champions League and their opening group game at home to Juventus on Tuesday, when the in-form Neymar is sure to return to the starting line-up. 
“There is always the risk that you can break a player’s dynamic if  they are in good form but don’t accept being left out of the team,”  admitted PSG coach Christophe Galtier of his decision to bench the  Brazilian. 
“But I had a long discussion with him yesterday. I made my decision  and he accepted it.” Galtier, who said Vitinha had taken a heavy knock  to his kneecap, insisted his team would still have to raise their game  in the Champions League. 
PSG have 16 points from six games and lead second-placed Olympique de Marseille, who beat AJ Auxerre 2-0 away, on goal difference.
Olympique Lyonnais, who have a game in hand, climbed up to third on 13 points after Karl Toko Ekambi’s double and a goal by Alexandre Lacazette gave them a resounding 5-0 victory against Angers.
RC Lens are fourth, also on 13 points, and travel to Stade de Reims on Sunday.
PSG opened the scoring when Mbappe beat Nantes keeper Alban Lafont from inside the box after being set up by Lionel Messi in the 18th minute.
The hosts were reduced to 10 men six minutes later when Fabio Da Silva was shown a straight red card for a dangerous tackle on Vitinha.
Mbappe doubled the lead nine minutes into the second half at the end of a quick counter attack. The 23-year-old found Messi in the box and the Argentine slid the ball towards Mbappe who tapped in at the near post.
Nuno Mendes then made it 3-0 in the 68th minute, firing home after Neymar’s strike had bounced off the post for PSG’s 24th goal in Ligue 1 this season.
Earlier, Marseille continued their near-perfect start with a solid victory at promoted Auxerre with Alexis San­chez showing his worth with his third goal since joining from Inter Milan as a free agent during the close season.
Igor Tudor’s side prevailed through an early Gerson goal and substitute Sanchez’s late strike while Cengiz Under caught the eye with a sterling display in the first half, four days before their Champions League trip to Tottenham Hotspur in London.
Marseille went ahead when Under’s angled shot onto the post bounced into the path of Gerson, who fired home from close range in the eighth minute.
The hosts moved up a gear after the break with Gauthier Hein and Paul Joly going close, but Marseille were more clinical and wrapped it up through Sanchez when they were under pressure. The Chile striker netted with a low shot on the turn from Matteo Guendouzi with seven minutes left.

Portugal winger Leao struck twice in each half in a pulsating clash at the San Siro, the first since Milan’s takeover by US investment fund RedBird was completed in the week, which put the champions a point ahead of Atalanta and Roma at the summit.
Fans bounced in the stands after a thrilling match full of goalmouth incident which was decided by Leao and Olivier Giroud, who after Marcel Brozovic’s 21st minute opener for Inter put Milan two goals to the good on the hour mark.However they also had the magnificent Mike Maignan to thank for the three points after the France goalkeeper pulled off four superb stops from Lautaro Martinez, Edin Dzeko — also a scorer — and Hakan Calhanoglu.
Leao’s second came after a mesmerising piece of dribbling and close control, and with the transfer window now shut and Chelsea rumours died down he will be key to Milan’s Champions League campaign which begins at Salzburg on Tuesday.
A second defeat in five matches leaves an Inter team without the injured Romelu Lukaku sixth and with Bayern Munich coming to town on Wednesday night.
Napoli lead Milan on goal difference after new boy Khvicha Kvaratskhelia continued his sensational start to life in Italy with the winner at Lazio, seventh after their first defeat of the campaign.
The 21-year-old, who also struck the post and missed another great chance before scoring, has captured fans’ imaginations with a series of decisive displays.
Luciano Spalletti’s side are unbeaten on 11 points thanks to a hard-fought win in Rome in which they fought back from going behind after just three minutes following Mattia Zaccagni’s drilled opener for the hosts.
The away side drew level seven minutes before the break through Kim Min-Jae, whose thumping header from Piotr Zielinski’s corner just crossed the line despite the best efforts of Lazio stopper Ivan Provedel.
Georgia International Kvaratskhelia netted dominant Napoli’s winner and his fourth of the season in the 61st minute when he met Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa’s low pull back with a thumping effort against which Provedel could do nothing.
JUVE DISAPPOINT IN FLORENCE
Juventus are level on nine points with Inter after a disappointing 1-1 draw at Fiorentina.
They could count themselves fortunate to have left Florence with a draw as after Arkadiusz Milik gave the away side a ninth-minute lead, Christian Kouame levelled midway through the first half and Mattia Perin pushed Luka Jovic’s penalty onto the post just before the break.
Juve had new signing Leandro Paredes — who gave away the missed penalty — made his first start while Angel Di Maria returned after recovering from a thigh injury, but they lacked spark in their third draw from five league fixtures.
A poor performance in which Milik’s goal was their only shot on target is not a good omen for Juve heading into Tuesday’s Champions League Group H opener at Paris St-Germain.
