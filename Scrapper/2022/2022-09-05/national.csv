Scholars and literary organisations in India, former USSR and some other countries, were planning to pay tribute to Ghalib on his 100th death anniversary. But in Pakistan, there was a lukewarm response to the idea. Faiz Ahmed Faiz (1911-1984) was anxious to commemorate Ghalib’s centennial. One of the great admirers of Ghalib was Mirza Zafar-ul-Hasan (1916-1984). A friend of Faiz, broadcaster, connoisseur of fine literary and art works and a writer in his own right, Zafar-ul-Hasan agreed to organise Ghalib’s death centenary in a befitting manner. But Zafar-ul-Hasan had other great ideas, too, rather than arranging for just a gathering or two to celebrate Ghalib and his poetry, for instance, researching Ghalib’s life, his works ; helping researchers and critics working on Ghalib; publishing a magazine on Ghalib; reprinting Ghalib’s Urdu and Persian works; translating Ghalib’s works in other languages and ... and what not!
Realising that what they were dreaming of was not an easy task and it needed help from intellectuals, Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Zafar-ul-Hasan chalked out a plan to establish an organisation named after Ghalib and invited writers, poets, journalists and intellectuals to lend a helping hand. The response was overwhelming and almost every corner of Pakistan echoed with ‘ayes’. It was the year 1968, so they had almost a year to prepare to hold a centennial in impressive and elaborate manner. An organisation named Idara-i-Yadgar-i-Ghalib (IYG) was established in 1968. Many well-known writers joined hands and they included, among many others, Peer Hussamuddin Rashdi, Sibte Hasan, Prof Karrar Hussain, Shanul Haq Haqqee, Farman Fatehpuri, Mumtaz Hasan, Muslim Ziai, Amna Majeed Malik, Mukhtar Zaman and Sahar Ansari. Faiz was made president and Zafar-ul-Hasan Secretary.
In January 1969, country’s political turmoil was on its peak. So it was decided to begin the centennial programmes from May 9, 1969. Literary giants like Ghulam Rasool Mahar, Punjab University’s vice chancellor Hameed Ahmed Khan and Pashto Academy’s Maulana Abdul Qadir were among the many celebrities that adorned the opening ceremony, the mushaira and exhibition of Sadequain’s paintings. To raise funds, Ghalib Pencil was launched and many bought it for hundreds of rupees a piece.
It was decided to establish the Ghalib Library where the head office of IYG was to be housed. The Karachi Municipal Corporation gave a piece of land in Nazimabad and Habib Bank funded the entire construction. On Dec 8, 1969, the foundation stone was laid and the library was formally inaugurated in September 1972, though it had been working since 1971. It was a ground plus one storey building. A magazine Ghalib was launched in 1975. About 100 books have been published so far by IYG. So IYG and Ghalib Library have completed 50 years of serving literature. On the ground floor a bank branch worked till 2005 and the then mayor of Karachi Naimatullah Khan asked the KMC to get the entire building renovated. It was handed over to IYG as a library, working on the first floor, was full to the brim and finally got the space to arrange the books properly.
Mirza Sahib built the library from scratch, going from door to door to collect the books donated. Today, Ghalib Library has some 40,000 periodicals and almost as many books, some of them very rare. The collection is a treasure for anyone carrying out research on Ghalib and/or Urdu literature.
Later on, many intellectuals helped run the organisation and only a few of them can be named here, for instance, Mushfiq Khwaja, Moinuddin Aqeel, Fatima Surayya Bajia and Ra’na Farooqi. Now Sabeeh Rahmani is the president and Dr Tanzeem-ul-Firdous is secretary. From day one, all the office-bearers worked on an honorary basis and the library staff is paid a token amount barely sufficient for transportation.
One of the prominent features of Ghalib Library is its literary and cultural gatherings. Though the frequency of these gatherings dwindled considerably after Mirza Sahib’s death, Library still holds mushairas and symposia from time to time. One of the biggest hurdles is lack of funds. Mirza Zafar-ul-Hasan used to comment on its financial issues in a lighter vein and he would quip “Ghalib Library’s financial condition is similar to that of the personality to whom it is dedicated”, as Ghalib’s financial woes are well-known. A meagre grant from the federal government is received every year but it is just not enough to run the affairs. Some members and donors contribute from time to time to keep it afloat.
It was Infaaq Foundation that came to rescue in 2005. One hopes the citizens of Karachi would come forward to save this half-century old cultural institution.

They gathered near Uch Sharif and chanted slogans, alleging that so far none of the government officials had approached them for help, nor they were given any food  or medicines. They said their children were falling sick because of different diseases and most of their cattle had been swept away by the flood.
A large number of people from rural areas, including Rasoolpur, Bakhtiari, Tahirwali and other union councils of Uch Sharif, a sub-tehsil of Ahmedpur East tehsil, had been affected by the increasing flow of floodwater in the river Chenab during the last month.  
Many of them had been illegally occupying the pond area around Panjnad Headworks, from where they were moved to safer places, along with their livestock to avoid losses before the flooding in the river Chenab.
Now, with the floodwater receding from the affected areas, most of them returned to their homes, which were badly damaged, while their crops had also been destroyed.  
MURDER: A youth allegedly killed his father at Chah Amirwala village in the limits of Lodhran police station on Sunday.
According to police sources, Karim Bakhsh had distributed his landed among his two sons -- Sohail and Tufail. 
They said the elder son, Sohail, sold his land share, squandered the amount and demanded his father and younger brother to sell their share too and give him more money. However, Karim Bakhsh and Tufail refused to do so. 
The police sources say that on Sunday, Sohail attacked his father with a club when he was in his house, and fled away leaving him dead on the spot.  
The police registered a murder case against the suspect and shifted the body to the Lodhran District Headquarters Hospital for the postmortem examination.
The police suspected that Sohail might also have killed his mother, who had died about a month ago under mysterious circumstances and started investigating the matter.  
REGULARISED: Punjab government has regularised the service of 238 work-charge employees of the building department.
According to Chau­dhury Afzal Mehmood, zonal secretary of All Pakistan PWD Workers Union, the temporary employees had been demanding regularisation for their service for the last one year. These employees were handed over their appointment letters at a function here on Sunday.

2,"Pakistan must learn to live within its means, says Miftah",Hopes for economic growth of more than 3.5 per cent.,"KARACHI: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail has said the government wants to break a boom-and-bust cycle that’s played out for decades, and help the country to finally learn to live within its means.
Talking to Bloomberg News, he said import payments should equal dollar inflows, which means curbs on luxury items may remain in place for longer than currently anticipated.
“I want to see a Pakistan that lives within its means. That’s it,” he said. “Nothing can happen in one year, but we can start.” 
The outlook has been further complicated in the aftermath of historic floods, which could have an economic impact of at least $10 billion, adding to a list of problems for the minister that includes political turmoil and raging inflation. 
Less than a week ago the International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave Pakistan a $1.16 billion lifeline to avoid imminent default. The country also secured pledges for a total of $9bn in investments and loans from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Mr Ismail said he expects a $1bn investment in listed state-owned companies to materialise in about a month.  

Hopes for economic growth of more than 3.5 per cent

On Aug 29, Pakistan secured a bailout from the IMF to avert an imminent default as the country deals with political turmoil and deadly flooding. 
The finance minister expects economic growth of more than 3.5 per cent for the fiscal year that started in July, down from an initial target of 5pc. He predicts that inflation, running at the highest in 47 years and the second highest in Asia, is close to its peak and will average 15pc for the year. 
Vegetable prices, a key component, have already started to come down after shooting higher following the floods, he claimed. 
The minister aims to spur Pakistan’s growth by avoiding unchecked imports of everything from home appliances to cosmetics and the resultant chronic shortage of dollars. The revival of the IMF bailout was the 13th for the country since the late 1980s. 
Pakistan’s imports need to be equal to the dollar inflow from exports and from remittances provided by citizens living abroad, according to Mr Ismail. The State Bank figures show remittances in the second quarter running at record levels. 
For now, Pakistan has restricted certain imports, including those for automobiles and automotive parts that’s seen Toyota Motor Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp’s local units temporarily halt  production. Mr Ismail planned the measures to last for an initial three months but the impact of the floods may see them extended. 
Pakistan’s export revenue is dominated by textiles, and much of its cotton crop was washed away. The government will allow the textile industry to import as much cotton as it needs to keep the looms running. Islamabad is now also importing tomatoes and onions from Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey after shortages shot prices higher. 
“If I have limited dollars, I will absolutely make sure that I use them to buy wheat, I use them to buy edible things for our people,” said Mr Ismail. “Maybe we can delay buying Audis and Mercedes.”

3,IMF sees policy reversals behind rising debt,Fund's report says debt sustainability expected to improve with steadfast implementation of tight policy matrix.,"ISLAMABAD: The country’s public debt sustainability has deteriorated because of policy reversals by the PTI government in the second half of the previous fiscal year ending June, but it is expected to improve going forward with steadfast implementation of a tight policy matrix.
“The debt-to-GDP ratio is now projected to rise from 77.9 per cent at end-FY21 to 78.9pc at end-FY22 before falling to around 60pc by end-FY27, assuming the adjustment efforts in the context of the EFF [extended fund facility] programme are fully carried out,” the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in its latest report on Pakistan.
It said that while gross financing needs (GFN) remain elevated over the near term amid sizeable fiscal deficits and limited progress in lengthening maturities, GFNs are projected to decline over the medium term — reflecting programmed fiscal consolidation and efforts to enhance cash and debt management — reaching 17.2pc of GDP by FY27.
It, however, warned that higher interest rates, a larger-than-expected growth slowdown due to policy tightening, pressures on the exchange rate, renewed policy reversals, slower medium-term growth, and contingent liabilities related to state-owned entities pose significant risks to debt sustainability.
In a detailed report on ‘Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis’, the IMF noted that sustained fiscal adjustment in line with the EFF programme commitment and a favourable interest rate-growth differential are projected to put debt ratios back on a clear downward path. The rebasing of GDP last year to 2015-16, which raised nominal GDP by 16pc, would itself lower the end-FY21 debt-to-GDP ratio to 75.8pc (from 88.6pc at the time of the sixth review).
The Fund said the combined effect of the GDP rebasing, the broader debt perimeter and revisions to the macro projections lead public debt to decline to 62.4pc of GDP by end-FY26 (from 70.4pc at the time of the sixth review) and around 60pc by end-FY27.
In this context, the IMF said the near-term financing needs remain elevated amid headwinds to the authorities’ debt management strategy. Although the authorities met all indicative targets on long-term issuance by wide margins, efforts to reduce the stock of outstanding treasury bills (T-Bills), supported by the on-lending of special drawing rights (SDR) allocation in the local currency, which provided a reprieve to the reliance on short-term instruments, were undone as the fiscal deterioration in January-June generated enormous borrowing demands.
As a result, GFNs are projected to have risen to 23.5pc of GDP in FY22 (from 19.8pc in FY21). In addition, domestic bond issuance during FY22 was skewed towards two- and three-year instruments such that medium-term refinancing needs will remain high, currently projected to decline towards 17.2pc in FY27.
In addition, two-thirds of long-term issuance during FY22 has been at floating rates tied to the T-Bill rate, implying that the government bears much of the interest rate risk. That said, the resumption of domestic sukuk issuance and the inverted yield curve are providing potential scope for the lengthening of maturities, albeit at the cost of locking in higher rates for longer.
External financing needs rose in FY22, reflecting the large current account deficit and remain elevated over the medium term, largely reflecting rollover of the increased stock of short-term borrowing.
The IMF advised the authorities for sustained efforts to lower GFNs, particularly as they navigate the current challenging environment. The authorities’ plans to raise financing periodically in international markets have been impeded by the spike in sovereign spreads following geopolitical and domestic political volatility as well as the rising global interest rates.

4,Gas supply to Quetta restored after 11 days,Supply was suspended after raging floodwater swept away 12-inch gas pipeline near Bibi Nani area of Bolan district.,"QUETTA: Gas supply to the provincial capital was restored on Sunday after 11 days of suspension, triggered by raging floodwater that burst the banks of Bolan River due to incessant rains and swept away the 12-inch gas pipeline near Bibi Nani area of the Bolan district of Balochistan. 
The destruction of the pipeline also cut off gas supply to other areas including Pishin, Ziarat, Mastung, Kalat, Khuzdar and Mach.
Floodwater earlier on Aug 19 swept away another gas pipeline of 24-inch diameter in the same area, but the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) continued supply to Quetta through a narrower 12-inch pipeline until Aug 25 when it also was swept away.
SSGC officials could not start repair work on both pipelines in the flooded areas for more than a week.
When the floodwater receded last week, they started the repair work. Finally, after completion of work, the gas supply to the provincial capital was restored on Sunday. 
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had earlier directed the authorities to expedite work and restore gas supply to Quetta and other areas of Balochistan without delay.

5,"Cattle skin disease, floods ravage meat market","At 5pc, KP has the highest percentage of lumpy skin disease-related animal deaths.","KARACHI: Outbreaks of lumpy skin disease (LSD) — caused by a debilitating virus in cattle — have increased meat prices across the country, though traders also point out other factors, such as a devastating monsoon and higher fuel prices.
The disease has affected sales and production in all provinces, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa being the hardest hit in terms of death percentage in animals.
The LSD does not affect people and is thought to be spread by flies or mosquitoes, causing nodules to form on the skin, with accompanying symptoms such as much lower milk production. It can sometimes be fatal.

At 5pc, KP has the highest percentage of LSD-related animal deaths

Sindh
In Karachi, beef currently sells for Rs700 to Rs900 per kilogram while mutton prices range from Rs1,600 to Rs2,200.
“There has been no change in meat prices in the last three months. However, animals are in short supply as persistent heavy downpours in the interior parts of Sindh have restricted movement and many farmers have lost their animals,” said Abdul Latif Qureshi of the Livestock Traders Welfare Association.
He said the disease didn’t play a major role in higher meat prices, which had mainly been driven by an overall impact of high inflation.



 
Dr Nazeer Hussain Kalhoro, the director general of Sindh’s livestock department and head of the provincial task force on LSD, blamed little investment in the sector for high meat prices.
“I believe LSD’s role was 20 per cent in meat prices. The situation has more to do with little public and private sector investment. We continue to rely on traditional farming in the face of high meat consumption,” he said.
He said the LSD situation was under control in Sindh, except Tharparkar and desert areas of Umerkot, where five to 10 cases were being reported daily.
“This region sees major (uncontrolled) animal movement following monsoon as the whole area has turned green (after heavy rains) and farmers across Sindh as well as from Punjab bring their cattle for free land and fodder,” he said, suggesting some unvaccinated herds might have been the source of disease spread.
Besides, the refusal on the part of farmers to get their animals vaccinated also played a major role in the spread. “This region was almost LSD-free from January to June, which made farmers complacent,” he said.
An LSD outbreak was reported in the first week of March in Sindh, affecting several cattle farms in the province, including Karachi.
According to the provincial task force, 53,668 LSD cases have been reported since March in Sindh, killing 571 animals (around 1pc of the total cases) while 53,072 have recovered.
“These cases are only reported in cows. No buffalo or any other animal or human has been affected so far. Consumption of milk and meat is safe these days for human health,” it says.
Experts agree that the shortage of animals would become severe in the coming months due to huge livestock losses in floods, causing a subsequent increase in its prices. Animal mortality, according to the livestock department data, currently stands at 70,000.
Punjab
The LSD entered Punjab from Sindh and initially hit southern parts, but it has now travelled up to the central part of the province, according to farmers and officials of the provincial livestock department.
“Though the disease affects cattle, even calves are losing their monetary value because of fear,” says Abad Khan, a livestock farmer from central Punjab.
Livestock officials, however, believe the numbers are now stabilising as the province has so far vaccinated 15pc of the cattle population. A high-ranking official of the livestock department said the province was planning a one-time import of six million doses to cover the entire animal population.
Of the 14.6m cattle population, 29,620 cases have been reported so far, leading to 765 deaths (2.6pc of the total cases) while recoveries stand at 21,720, he said.
“It is because Punjab is vaccinating at a much faster pace than the spread. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the mortality rate has so far gone beyond 4pc. Punjab has two consolation points: the actual rate of spread is slow and the LSD does not jump to humans. The beef and milk of infected cattle do not infect humans,” he said.
Farmers, however, think that their cost is increasing even if statistics are lower.
Balochistan
Balochistan has not been spared either. Abdul Samad, president of a provincial beef sellers’ association, said his sales plummeted more than 40pc after the LSD spread in Sindh and some parts of Balochistan as the disease has scared consumers away.
“Everyone who enters the shop first asks about the lumpy skin disease and doesn’t proceed to order until satisfied,” said Mr Samad, who has been running his beef shop for 30 years at Kasi Road, the main meat, mutton and vegetable market in Quetta.
Most shopkeepers struggle to sell even one animal throughout the day, which stands in stark contrast to the past when selling two to three big size animals was normal.
Livestock department officials also confirmed a decline in cattle sales in the wake of LSD. Dr Kamran, director general of Balochistan’s livestock department, told Dawn LSD cases were reported in Zhob, Duki and Lasbela districts in February.
Mostly cows and bulls got infected from this disease, he said, adding that “we immediately started vaccinating animals in affected areas soon after cases started to emerge”.
“We have so far vaccinated around 20,000 animals, not only in those areas where cases were reported but also in other areas of the province,” he said. Animal husbandry doctors have been deputed to check animals coming from Punjab, Sindh and other areas.
Abdul Samad said cow and bull imports dropped due to lumpy skin disease, increasing the price of beef in Quetta and other areas. “Beef is now selling for Rs800 per kg compared to Rs600 to Rs650 sometime back,” he said.
Tameezuddin, who exports beef to Gulf states, lamented a decline in sales, saying importers were not placing orders from Dubai and other countries. “Our exports have dropped by up to 40pc to 50pc,” he said.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
The province has reported 46,343 LSD cases, leading to 2,366 deaths — a whopping 5pc of the total infections.
Districts that took the brunt included Kurram, Lakki Marwat, Kohat, Karak Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Haripur, Mansehra and Swabi.
Read: Bracing for a second wave of the lumpy skin disease
Current financial losses from the disease have been estimated at Rs2 billion. Official data shows that of the total population of 8.84m cattle and morbidity and motility ratio of 15pc and 2.5pc, respectively, annual dairy losses would come to about 337m litres and beef losses to 17.2m kilograms.
“It’s a huge challenge,” Dr Alamzeb, director general of the KP livestock department, told Dawn. “We estimate annual losses at Rs50bn if the situation is not properly handled.”
He said his department required Rs5bn to treat sick animals and vaccinate the ones at risk to overcome this highly contagious disease.
AJK
In Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), the first LSD case was reported in the first week of June, prompting the region’s animal husbandry department to deploy inspection teams at all entry points to prevent the entrance of affected animals from Punjab and KP provinces, the territory’s chief vet said.
Dr Ijaz Khan, the department’s director general, told Dawn a Lahore-based company that was the only local vaccine manufacturer had pledged to sell 120,000 doses to the department.
“We have so far received 80,000 doses from them, all of which were administered during a door-to-door vaccination drive across the state at a cost of Rs10 per dose,” he said, adding that his team had administered another 22,302 doses, purchased by livestock owners on their own.
Mr Khan said AJK had a cattle population of 545,239 and as of Aug 30, as many as 7,803 cases of affected animals had been reported from different areas, mostly from the southern Mirpur and Bhimber districts. Of those, 637 cattle had died while 6,246 had recovered, he added.
He said AJK Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas had sanctioned Rs150m to import vaccines on an urgent basis so that all cattle in the region could be vaccinated over the next three months.
Traders say panic has also aggravated the situation, as the people have stopped buying even mutton. “Our business has been ruined under the influence of a negative campaign on social media,” Syed Yasir Shah, general secretary of Muzaffarabad’s Anjuman-i-Qasaban (butchers’ association), lamented.
Flood-related animal deaths 
Besides LSD, devastating floods have also claimed hundreds and thousands of animals.
Balochistan lost some 700,000 animals, including heads of cattle and sheep, to the five strong monsoon spells and resultant flash floods.
Mir Ziaullah Langove, the provincial home minister, told Dawn Balochistan might face livestock shortage in the coming days, which would ultimately affect meat supply and lead to higher prices.
Livestock deaths in Punjab stood at 205,104 as of Aug 31, official data shows, including 200,667 in Rajanpur alone, where floods rendered a large number of people poor, dead or homeless.
In Sindh, flood-related livestock casualties have been recorded at over 18,000.
In KP, more than 9,000 cattle heads perished in the floods, according to official figures. Total agricultural and livestock losses in the province have been estimated at Rs1.89bn.

6,Relief goods for survivors arrive amid appeal for assistance,First Unicef humanitarian flight with relief goods landed at Karachi’s airport in early hours of Sunday.,"ISLAMABAD: While the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has called for an urgent international humanitarian emergency response following the massive devastation caused by unprecedented floods in one-third area of Pakistan, consignments of relief goods from Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Unicef and Qatar arrived and handed over to the federal and provincial authorities.
The first Unicef humanitarian flight with relief goods for the flood affected people landed at Karachi’s airport in the early hours of Sunday morning, while another aircraft carrying relief goods from Abu Dhabi landed at Lahore’s airport in the afternoon. The consignments were han­ded over to the provincial mini­sters and National Disaster Management Authority representatives.
IOM Deputy Director-General for Operations Ugochi Daniels said the foremost need for millions of affected people was shelter.
“The government has responded quickly but the scale of this emergency is massive, and the country needs support. We stand strong in solidarity with the people of Pakistan, especially those in Sindh and Balochistan provinces, the most affected by these floods,” she said after visiting Pakistan. 

IOM calls for urgent world response to flood emergency

Ms Daniels said the sheer scale of the disaster required a massive response. She said with the collapse of agricultural economy, there is going to be a need for significant investment.
Aga Khan pledges $10m for flood-hit people Prince Rahim Aga Khan, the son of Aga Khan, expressed sorrow over the loss of lives and material in the devastating floods in Pakistan and pledged to donate $10 million to help flood-hit people of Pakistan. 
The son of Aga Khan made the pledge in conversation with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, according to PM Office. 
Prince Rahim was quoted as directing all organisations of the Aga Khan Development Network to take part in the flood relief and rehabilitation process.
Also, relief goods including tents and plastic sheets, donated by the Japanese government, reached Karachi and were handed over to National Disaster Man­agement Authority (NDMA) by Chief Representative of Japan Inter­national Cooperation Age­ncy (Jica) Kinoshita Yasumitsu, in the presence of Japanese Consul-General in Karachi, Odagiri Toshio.
Japan Consul-General Odagiri said his government would continue to work closely with the Pakistani government, and the embassy of Japan, the Consulate-General of Japan, and Jica would cooperate with each other to respond to the situation. 
Jica Chief Representative Kinoshita said that with the partnership of Jica, the Pakistan government had prepared its first disaster management plan in year 2012, which currently was in the process of revision for the next 10 years. He said Jica was committed to supporting relief, recovery, and rehabilitation efforts of the government of Pakistan with the motto of ‘Build Back Better’.
Meanwhile, Qatar Fund for Development has distributed food packages among 7,000 people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
The aid was delivered to 3,500 beneficiaries in Charsadda and Nowshera, while another 3500 beneficiaries were provided assistance in Loralai district of Balochistan. The dry food packages contained flour, vegetable oil, dates, rice, sugar, tea, salt, and other necessary food items.
In the medical field, Doctors Worldwide, a UK-based NGO, has been working and coordinating with its partners in Pakistan for the past two weeks for targeted and needs-based response for flood-hit people. 
In order to ensure that aid reaches everyone and not only those visible ‘on the roadside’, a widespread coordinated approach has been adopted by local NGOs along with the army, UN and other organisations.
The organisation said it had been supporting 80 field medical camps across 10 districts to provide urgent healthcare needs with a focus on specialist medical camps and temporary clinics for mothers, babies and children.

He said former premier Khan had a very clear point of view about politics and no group had the right to decide about the future of the country, saying that only the people of Pakistan could take that decision. He said the PTI chairman had already made it clear that he would not talk or negotiate with anyone unless the date of general elections would be announced.

They have claimed that the bank has not increased the pensions for the past six years.
Qazi Muhammad Younas and Perven Mali, the spokespersons for ZTBL pensioners who hail from Balochistan, on Sunday said the federal government has been increasing the pension and all other departments were paying them to their retired employees.
However, they claimed that the president and board of directors of ZTBL have been reluctant to increase the pensions. 
“All pensioners have been drawing the same amount without an increase of a single penny since 2016,” Mr Younas told Dawn.
He said when the budget for 2022-23 was being tabled in the National Assembly, hundreds of retired ZTBL employees had reached Islamabad, threatening that they will go on a hunger strike unto death in front of the bank’s head office.
Upon their protests, the bank’s president had met the representatives of the pensioners and formed a committee to look into the matter, assuring that it will be resolved within three months.
He said that around 10 pensioners had filed a petition in the Sindh High Court, which ordered a 10 percent increase in the pension for the petitioners, but ignored around 3000 other pensioners.
