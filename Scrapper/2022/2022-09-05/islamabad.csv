0,Twin cities face dengue threat,Pindi reports 39 more cases; Islamabad health officer warns of spike in cases due to unprecedented rainfall.,"ISLAMABAD/RAWALPINDI: The district health officer of Islamabad warned of a rise in dengue cases in the light of excessive rainfall during the current monsoon, as Rawalpindi continued to report dozens of dengue patients with 39 more patients admitted to three government hospitals on Sunday.
Referring to stagnant water accumulated in ponds and low-lying areas after the rainfall, Islamabad District Health Officer Dr Zaeem Zia said the stagnant rainwater was an ideal breeding ground for the growth of the dengue larvae and urged timely measures to contain the threat.
Though Islamabad reported only one case in the past 24 hours from its urban areas and a total of 124 infections during this year, Dr Zaeem Zia warned that the number of dengue cases could rise in the capital if adequate measures were further delayed.

Pindi reports 39 more cases; Islamabad health officer warns of spike in cases due to unprecedented rainfall

“Almost all parts of the country have faced floods and more than usual rains…the accumulated rainwater in ponds and low-lying areas will become a breeding ground for mosquitoes,” he cautioned.
He said the Islamabad administration had adopted a proactive approach and teams were being sent to different areas of the capital to drain out the stagnant water and raise awareness among the public against the viral disease.
39 more patients in Pindi
Another 39 patients arrived at hospitals in Rawalpindi, taking the total tally of patients to 567 during the current season.
Out of 110 patients who were admitted to three government-run hospitals during the past 24 hours, 34 patients were being treated at Holy Family Hospital (HFH), 33 patients in Benazir Bhutto Hospital and 43 patients were admitted to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Raja Bazaar. Out of the total number, 19 patients arrived from Islamabad, 88 from Rawalpindi while one patient each came from Attock, Haripur and Jhelum.
“More than 100 suspected patients have been admitted to the hospital’s dengue ward,” District Health Authority Chief Executive Officer Dr Anser Ishaq told Dawn.
He said the dengue serology report of the suspected patients would be received on Monday which would confirm if the said patients were infected with dengue.
“The number of patients increased with each passing day. We are adopting precautionary measures to avoid further spread of the virus in other parts of the garrison city,” he said, adding that due to an increase in the number of patients, there was a need to speed up the anti-dengue drive to avert a 2019-like situation when more than 4,200 dengue patients were reported.

1,Benazir Bhutto Hospital doctors want security after scuffle with attendants,Attendants accused of attacking doctors following death of kidney disease patient; FIR registered.,"RAWALPINDI: Scuffle between doctors and patients’ attendants in the emergency department of Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH) on Sunday forced doctors to stage a strike.
The services in the emergency department resumed after registration of a first information report (FIR) against the patient’s attendants in the local police station. However, Young Doctors Association (YDA) demanded improvement of security of doctors.
According to details, a patient suffering from kidney disease died on Sunday and attendants held doctors responsible for the death and attacked them. Upon this, the doctors lodged an FIR against the mob with Waris Khan police station and after its registration, they ended their token strike.
YDA BBH President Dr Humayun Warraich told Dawn:“The mob brutally hit male and female doctors, threatened and tried to murder a female doctor, broke medical equipment and doors. One doctor is severely injured. Culprits left the emergency in the presence of police.”
He said in response to the recent incident, the YDA showed utmost resistance and resilience despite being pressurised by the administration. “Both at the district and hospital level, emergency services were withdrawn for the whole night. An FIR, according to our demands including sections 506 and 427 has been lodged against the culprits,” he said.
After this, the association’s BBH chapter has asked for more security outside the emergency department besides declaring that a one patient - one attendant policy will be observed from now on.
The tender of the current “incompetent security company” deployed at BBH should be cancelled.
Dr Warraich said if our demands were not met, “we will consider complete withdrawal of Outdoor Patient Department and Emergency department services as it is not possible for doctors to work under these hostile conditions”.

4,"After repeated setbacks, CDA plans to move garbage disposal site to Chakbeli",Recent IHC order states waste must not be dumped in residential areas.,"ISLAMABAD: It seems that the civic agency is regretting its previous decision of not constructing a landfill site in Kuri as Islamabad High Court (IHC) in a recent order directed it to ensure that “no waste is dumped in temporary sites in residential areas in Islamabad with effect from 04-10-2022.” Hence now, the authority is planning on moving the dumping site to Chakbeli in Rawalpindi.
The Capital Development Authority (CDA), which was setup in 1960, has so far failed to establish a scientific landfill site, and currently it has been dumping garbage and trash of the city in the under-construction residential sector I-12.
While, as per the IHC order of Justice Babar Sattar passed last month, CDA cannot dump waste in temporary sites in residential areas, meaning the civic agency will have to develop a proper landfill site outside residential areas.
The IHC justice, in his landmark judgment had also directed the federal government to ensure that all the relevant bodies are issued directions to put together a waste disposal scheme for Islamabad and ensure that CDA submits a plan for the perusal of this court within a period of three months.

Recent IHC order states waste must not be dumped in residential areas

Following the IHC orders, the CDA’s planning wing and sanitation directorates have been holding a series of meeting, but so far, there is no serious output. “We have been discussing various options we have no other options but to setup a landfill site at an appropriate place,” said an officer of the planning wing.
He said that the issue is that Islamabad has five zones and except zone III, all four zones are residential while zone three is situated in elevation (along the Margallas) and this is not ideal for landfill site.
However, Director General Civic Management Shahjahan Khan told Dawn that CDA is in talks with Rawalpindi’s administration for properly disposing garbage in Chakbeli area.
“Hopefully, we will start properly disposing off trash in Chakbeli area, as our talk with Pindi administration is almost in its final round,” he said and added that two transfer stations will also be setup in Islamabad – one in Sewage Treatment Plant in sector I-9 and one near old airport area.
On the other hand, the CDA has continuously been receiving criticism from residents for questionably reversing its decision in 2011 of setting up a permanent landfill in Kuri – a site which was finalised by an international consultant and a portion of the road was also constructed by CDA for it. However, through a dubious decision, the CDA and environment body in 2011, decided not to setup the landfill site in Kuri area.
Some officials had alleged that CDA changed the said decision at the behest of some housing societies. Since then, CDA has been making makeshift arrangements for dumping over 600 tonnes of waste at temporary locations. The civic agency, for years, has been dumping waste in the under-developed residential sector of I-12.
Earlier, some years ago, the CDA had proposed a site in Sangjani in deep ditches created by stone crushers but the environment body after receiving public complaints rejected the site. 
Later, the CDA proposed a site in institutional sector of H-16, but it has to drop this idea because of a court case, whereas last year, the civic agency discussed setting up a landfill site along Park Road in the premises of nursery site only to drop this idea too, as the area falls in the middle of the city and CDA’s own three residential schemes - Park Enclave, Rawal Town and Shahzad Town - are also located in the area.
Another officer said that the civic agency will have to setup a scientific landfill site by all means. “In other countries, the landfill sites are not only used for trashing garbage, but electricity is also made from garbage and here, the 62-year old CDA still failed to earmark site for a proper landfill site,” he said. 
It is relevant to note here that as a long term solution, the CDA is also working with Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) for setting up a joint site in the jurisdiction of Punjab near Mandara. Both agencies held meetings in this regard, but still there is no serious outcome. The DG civic management said that Mandra will be a permanent solution, adding that a consultant has already been hired, who is also exploring some potential sites.

Carrying placards and banners inscribed with different slogans, the shopkeepers staged a sit-in on Museum Road near the office of vice president of the cantonment board.
Protesters were of the view that there are around 32 cantonment boards across the country and investors get properties especially shops on 99 years lease from these boards and almost all have sublet these shops. However, nowhere else were any shops sealed, the shopkeepers said, adding that by utilising colonial powers inherited from British policymakers, officials are depriving bread and butter from 66 families and leading them to starvation.
Retired Col Kazim Raza, while expressing solidarity with the aggrieved shopkeepers, termed the act of the cantonment board “discriminatory”.
He appealed to the authorities concerned that keeping in view the high inflation and poor economic condition of the working class, the shopkeepers would be allowed to run their businesses on humanitarian grounds. Commenting on the issue, a spokesman for the cantonment board said 164 shops located in the garrison city were owned by the cantonment board. These shop owners sublet the premises in violation of section 5 of the agreement which states “not to assign, sublet, transfer or part with the possession of the said building or any part thereof, or any of right or interest therein under any circumstances without written sanction of the executive officer Taxila”.
The spokesman further added that 66 shopkeepers were issued notices over violation of this section for subletting their shops in December 2021 and July 20022 and subsequently the shops were sealed.
The spokesman said that the case was presented before and ordered regularisation of their agreement with imposition of fine amounting to Rs10,000 however, out of 66 shopkeepers, 28 refused to regularise the contract.

9,Azad Kashmir PM to hold ‘power show’ in Bagh today,MUZAFFARABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas will address a big public meeting at...,"


 
MUZAFFARABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas will address a big public meeting at the district headquarters of Bagh on Monday (today) in what the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) claimed will be its grand power show in the area.
It would be Mr Ilyas’ first formal public appearance in Bagh district after assuming the office of prime minister some four-and-a-half months ago.
Mr Ilyas originally hails from Bangoin village of Poonch district which falls in LA-22, from where his paternal uncle Sardar Saghir Chughtai had returned in 2016 polls on the ticket of Muslim Conference. Shortly before the 2021 polls, Mr Chughtai had joined PTI at the hands of his nephew to be its nominee from the same constituency. However, due to his sudden death the PTI ticket was awarded to his widow Shahida Saghir who clinched a smooth victory in elections.
As the native constituency was already being represented by a family member, Mr Ilyas decided to enter the fray from LA-15 in the neighbouring Bagh district from where he defeated his close rivals from the PPP and PML-N by more than 5,000 and 8,500 votes, respectively.
Mr Ilyas, who became the prime minister on April 18 this year following a dramatic turn of events, had been unable to visit his constituency ever since, “due to his pressing engagements in Muzaffarabad and Islamabad,” his media team said.
“Actually, the visit to his constituency got delayed for different unavoidable reasons. In the meantime, the prime minister wanted to take some solid steps for the betterment of the state and its people before formally addressing to and interacting with his electorate,” said Yasir Arif, a key member of PM Ilyas’ media team.
Reports from Bagh said the entire town and the main artery leading to it from Kohala had been decorated with PTI flags and welcome banners and billboards, carrying portraits of PTI chief Imran Khan, PM Ilyas and other public office holders belonging to the ruling party.
Mr Arif said the public meeting would be held in Sardar Mohammad Hussain Stadium towards the eastern side of Bagh city.
“The prime minister is most likely to make some big announcements for the development of the area including establishment of some new institutions as a potential game changer to revitalise the territory’s economy,” he said.
On Tuesday, PM Ilyas would attend a prayer ceremony at the grave of his uncle Chughtai in Bangoin village, Mr Arif said, adding that the premier had personally invited leaders of almost all political and religious parties to attend the event in keeping with their friendly ties with the late lawmaker.

10,Islamabad’s ties with Kabul face new challenges after Taliban takeover: experts,Say Pakistan should treat neighbouring country as a sovereign state...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan have been facing new challenges over the last one year since Taliban took over Kabul and Islamabad needs to adopt a regional approach while framing any policy towards the landlocked country.
This was the view of experts at a consultation on ‘Afghan peace and reconciliation: Pakistan’s interests and policy options’ organised by Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS).
The experts stressed that Pakistan should revisit its policy towards Afghanistan and treat the country as a sovereign state.
Lawmakers, academicians, former diplomats, retired army officers, journalists and experts on security and Afghan affairs participated in the discussion. The main themes of the consultation, which was fifth in a series of discussions organised by PIPS on Afghan peace process, include ‘One year of Taliban rule: Emerging Afghan situation and its interface with the countries near and beyond’ and ‘A review of emerging Pak-Afghan relations’.

Say Pakistan should treat neighbouring country as a sovereign state

Seasoned politician and Chairman Senate Standing Committee on Defence Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed in his keynote address said Pakistan needed to adopt a regional approach to frame any policy towards Afghanistan and treat the neighbouring country as a sovereign state.
“Our biggest fallacy on Afghan policy is that we have been playing favorites,” he said.
Senator Sayed deplored that even after over 40 years, the Afghan story was not over and there were new challenges. In the context of Pakistan, he said the focus should be “who makes the policy and what policy should be made.” He supported the suggestion that a working group should be formed on the Afghan issue.
Former national security adviser retired Lt Gen Nasser Khan Janjua endorsed the view of other experts that policy review was required for Afghanistan. He stressed that the Afghan issue was still unsettled in the larger context and Pakistan should treat the Afghan people with honour and respect.
He said they should keep in mind that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was a defeated phenomenon. “We want closure of war,” he said, adding Pakistan should see Afghanistan in the larger context that both have a common future.
Political analyst and expert on Afghan affairs former senator Afrasiab Khattak said Pakistan needed to revisit and rectify its policy towards Afghanistan.
“Afghanistan is facing the threat of disintegration and Pakistan will have to face the consequences of this worst-case scenario,” he said and added that “we should see our Afghan policy critically.”
Senator Anwaarul Haq Kakar shed light on the issue of Afghan refugees living in Pakistan for decades and said there was a need to rationalise this matter. He proposed that they should be given permanent resident cards of Pakistan to connect them with the formal economy and tax net.
Defence and strategic affairs analyst retired Maj Gen Inamul Haque disagreed with another participant that there was strong anti-Pakistan sentiment among Taliban ranks and added that such a sentiment was only limited to few people.
He said Pakistan enjoyed respect among the rank and file of Taliban and common citizens of the neighbouring country. He also rejected the notion that Pakistan’s policy for Afghanistan was flawed and added that there was a problem in its implementation.
Former senator Farhatullah Babar said the interim government of Taliban was reluctant to take action against the banned TTP.
“This is the reality of the last one year that Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan has become a supporter of TTP,” he said, adding that the recent killing of Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in a drone strike in Afghanistan showed that militant groups were still growing there.
Former ambassador Mohammad Ayaz Wazir also endorsed the view that Pakistan should revisit its policy towards Afghanistan and address reservations of the Afghan people. He said that Pakistan should avoid interfering into the internal affairs of Afghanistan.
Jamaat-i-Islami Balochistan chief Maulana Abdul Haq Hashmi said it was unfortunate that there was no discussion in Pakistan at the academic and political level on the ideology of Taliban, which was contrary to what they had accepted during negotiations with the US.
Professor Dr Zafar Nawaz Jaspal of the Quaid-i-Azam University talked about Pakistan’s border issues with Afghanistan and proposed that they should get rid of the illegal border economy to bring stability on the borders.
PIPS Director Mohammad Amir Rana in his introductory remarks said the primary purpose of the consultation was to take a review of the Afghan situation after one year rule of Taliban, and of the emerging Pak-Afghan relations.

14,Media asked to play role in countering tobacco campaigns,"Health expert says no federal, provincial legislation regarding new tobacco products...","ISLAMABAD: Health activists on Sunday said media could play a vital role to counter the deceptive campaigns of the tobacco industry to promote harmful emerging tobacco products among Pakistani youth.
They were expressing their views during a consultation organised by the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (Sparc). Experts and senior journalists explored the need to ban emerging products such as nicotine pouches, e-cigarettes and heated tobacco devices, as they were becoming increasingly popular among Pakistani youth due to elaborate advertisements and promotional campaigns.
Country Lead Vital Strategies and former technical head/director, Tobacco Control Cell, National Heath Services ministry Dr Ziauddin Islam said the number of smokers in Pakistan had reached up to 29 million.
“Tobacco consumption is causing serious health implications on Pakistanis and yearly 170,000 people die as a result. Pakistan became a party to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) on Feb 27, 2005. Our country was already struggling to counter threats posted by cigarettes but now the tobacco industry has launched these emerging products to gain more profit at the expense of public health,” he said.

Health expert says no federal, provincial legislation regarding new tobacco products

Dr Zia said in Pakistan there was no federal or provincial legislation regarding emerging products.
“Prohibition of Smoking and Protection of Non-Smokers Ordinance 2002 provides key guidelines regarding advertisement, promotion and sale of tobacco products to children. Such measures are required for emerging products as well to take them out of reach of children and youth,” he said.
Malik Imran Ahmed, country head Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, said utilising the gap in policy-making, the tobacco industry had launched deceptive campaigns and profited from them.
“Emerging products have been directly targeted at youth using icons such as famous musicians, actors and models for paid social media content. The industry has even launched a music show. Furthermore, despite the claims, emerging products are being sold near educational institutions, playgrounds and restaurants to attract young customers,” he said.
Mr Ahmed said media’s extensive and unbiased coverage was the reason for increase in prices of cigarettes after three years.
“Media needs to play its role in exposing tobacco industry’s tactics regarding emerging products as well,” he said.
Sparc Programme Manager Khalil Ahmed Dogar said: “Pakistan is lucky that majority of its population is the youth; 61 million of youngsters are an asset for our country. Nicotine addiction serves as a gateway to many other forms of substance abuse and may cause serious health and mental health issues among youth. Such dangerous products should have no room in a country like Pakistan.”
He said due to cheap and easy affordability nearly 1,200 children begin smoking every day in Pakistan.
“I request the media to take this issue as a child rights issue,” he said.
Chief executive officer of Chromatic Trust Shariq Mahmood Khan said tobacco companies were investing money in online campaigns on almost all social media platforms.
“The algorithms of advertisements are designed in such a deceptive manner that the ads appear even on articles that are written to discourage people from using tobacco,” he said.
Mr Mahmood urged website owners to take down these advertisements and raise awareness on harms of nicotine, second hand smoking, and adverse impacts of tobacco products on public economy and environment.
