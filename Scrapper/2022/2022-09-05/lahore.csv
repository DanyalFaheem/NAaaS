0,Hotel mafia in DG Khan involved in causing landslides on Dera-Quetta Road,CS launches inquiry into activity aimed at selling eatables.,"DERA GHAZI KHAN: Deputy Commissioner and Border Military Police (BMP) Senior Commandant Anwar Baryar has ordered an investigation into the incidents of human-induced landslides in Fort Munro on the inter-provincial Dera-Quetta road for selling edibles and other goods at exorbitant rates to the travelers stuck in the traffic jam on the blocked road.  
The political assistant of Koh Sulaiman tehsil, Muhammad Ikram Malik, has been directed to take strict action against the hotel mafia involved in the causing landslides.  
In a letter to Mr Malik, Mr Baryar said the transport owners had alleged that the hotel mafia on the Fort Munro Road was behind the continuous landslide on the National Highway after the rains.  
“The road often remains blocked. Human-made landslides are caused by dropping stones from the mountains. When the traffic gets jammed, expensive items are sold by the hotel mafia,” Hidataytullah, a truck driver, said. He complained that fruits and vegetables get rotten due to the traffic issue.  

CS launches inquiry into activity aimed at selling eatables

The closure of Dera-Quetta road caused shortage of vegetables and fruits and price hike in south Punjab.  
CHIEF SECRETARY: Chief Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal reviewed the arrangements in the flood relief camps in Rojhan and Rajanpur. 
Accompanied by Additional Chief Secretary Shahryar Sultan, the chief secretary met the flood victims. 
He directed the Rescue 1122 to improve the response in the inaccessible areas. He said availability of medicines must be ensured for the people in the flood relief camps along with vaccination and fodder for the cattle.  
Mr Afzal said the administration should provide support and guidance to the welfare institutions and philanthropists for transparent distribution of relief goods.  
He issued instructions for speeding up relief operation by helicopter in the affected areas of the Koh-i-Sulaiman.

1,IGP in predicament over ‘frequent reshuffles’,"Federal, provincial govts allegedly issuing conflicting orders...","LAHORE: Punjab IGP Faisal Shahkar is facing a tough time as the federal government is demanding that he adopt a ‘go-slow policy’ whereas Parvez Elahi’s government is allegedly exerting pressure on him to have more ‘handpicked’ officers appointed as regional and district police officers.  
The federal government has conveyed to the IGP its reservations over recent ‘political appointments’ in the province and ‘uncalled for action’ against many police officers. The authorities suggested him to exercise the legal and administrative powers vested in him in the transfers and postings instead of “toeing the line of the Punjab chief minister.”  
On the other hand, the Punjab government had recently sent a list of the police officers to the IGP office for their appointment. It had also pointed out the ‘places of postings’ against the names of the police officers in the list.  
Sources said the IGP declined to acquiesce in to the provincial government’s demand, saying frequent political appointments had already weakened his ‘command’ on the Punjab police force.  

Federal, provincial govts allegedly issuing conflicting orders

Earlier, the IGP had reshuffled many senior officers on the desire and recommendation of the chief minister. Most appointments or removals were made in accordance with the ‘list’ provided by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) to the Punjab government in the wake of May 25 ‘Azadi March’. The PTI had demanded removal of the then IGP, Rao Sardar Ali Khan, the then additional IGP Special Branch Punjab, the Lahore police chief, the DIG operations and some other officers, claiming that they were directly involved in lodging cases against PTI workers to stop them from participating in the march. 
At that time, Rao Sardar was transferred and posted as IG Railways police when he refused to further serve as the provincial police chief. Other police officers were either surrendered to Islamabad or removed from the posts shortly after Parvez Elahi formed the government in Punjab.  
A source said differences between the IGP and the chief minister had widened after the latter asked him for the appointment of some police officers as DPOs of Okara, Layyah, Sialkot, Rahim Yar Khan and Narowal. The IGP, the source said, had refused to make postings of the police officers as recommended by the government.  
Mr Shahkar conveyed to the government that his department had already shortlisted some officers against the posts while considering their capacity to serve and his reaction had irked the chief minister, said the source. 
Similarly, the source said, the IGP was under pressure for the replacement of three RPOs -- DG Khan, Bahawalpur and Sahiwal.  
Mr Shahkar had earlier removed Sheikhupura SP investigation Nasir Bajwa from his post when the PTI raised the issue with the provincial government that the officer was involved in action against party’s leader Hammaz Azhar. Similarly, the IGP also recently transferred Sargodha SP investigation Akhlaqullah Tarar and made him an OSD. The officer prior to that was transferred from Lahore where he was serving as SP city division, on the same grounds.  
Another BS-18 police officer, Safdar Raza Kazmi, who was serving as Civil Lines SP operations, had been removed and made an OSD when the PTI asked the provincial government to take action against him for misbehaving with an influential lawyer.

3,Punjab notes: Cash is what they immediately need,"When we look at the images of relentless monsoon fury, we see among other things dead bodies, battered families,...","When we look at the images of relentless monsoon fury, we see among other things dead bodies, battered families, destroyed houses, inundated croplands, and washed away crops and dead animals in the water.  
What touches us most is the spectacle of the families that have vulnerable children and women without shelter having nowhere to go. What it evokes in us is pain, compassion and empathy, even pity. Consequently we feel compelled to do something that would alleviate their sufferings. The first response is driven by what may be called species instinct; how to save our species from death or extinction. Such an impulse or instinctive drive we share with all other living creatures. In the absence of such a thing no species can ensure its survival.  
German poet Brecht expresses it in a poetic way: “When a child is about to be run down by a car one pulls it on the pavement/Not the kindly man does that, to whom they put up monuments/Anyone pulls the child away from the car.”  
Likewise we want to pull the people away from the piles of rubble they have been trapped in. But how to do it? What comes immediately to mind is what is needed for physical survival; food, water, bedding, tents and medicines. Rescue operations are on. Rehabilitation phase is still not in sight as the floodwater hasn’t fully receded yet. All the concerned government and non-government organisations seem to have geared up. They are scrambling to collect what is obviously needed by the flood victims. Focus is on the provision of goods and services which is of course what the marooned people cry for at the moment. But such is the scale of calamity that even dedicated men and women engaged in humanitarian endeavour know that even their best efforts can’t enable them to be equal to the task. 
Sadly what worries one at the moment is that there seems to be no clarity on the priorities. Short-term measures are fine but long-term ones are a must if we want to see our people having semblance of normal life after the traumatic experience of Biblical proportions. In order to set priorities right one needs to have a holistic picture of the disastrous situation.  
In simple words fact must be taken into account of what the affected people have been deprived of. In the countryside their houses have been destroyed, crops have been washed away and gushing floodwater has killed their livestock. All these things have been the mainstay of their economic and social existence. A destroyed house means no shelter and a working person without shelter would be at the mercy of nature and severely handicapped in his/her activities. The worst hit would be children and women who help in raising crops and rearing and looking after livestock. A shelterless farmer means among other things a lowered of level of productivity.  
Farmers, the bulk of workers in our agrarian economy, are always cash strapped. They are forced to rely on loans as they have to buy seeds, pesticides, sprays on deferred payment. Deferred payment means either selling one’s crop cheaply to the lenders or paying interest which can be exorbitant. How they are going to pay their debts and eke out a living with their crops washed away and livestock gone? Livestock in the countryside is a valuable and yet affordable source of nutrition that keeps the family physically sustainable. Besides, selling of extra milk of buffalos and cows provides the peasant household with a bit of cash for day today needs. What it all boils down to is money; people need cash to rebuild their lives and they will do it bit by bit as they are hard-working lot. They are used to earn their living hard way as they are not given to comforts like our urban folks. Secondly, they are the least demanding. They can live with bare minimum provided they are provided with bare minimum in a situation where they are left with nothing. They are, to borrow a military phrase, battle-hardened. They can live without bottled water and soft bedding. They have high level of immunity because of the tough life they lead. They can sleep at night without mosquito nets and desert coolers. But surely they can’t live without roof over their heads, buffalo/cow and fields. In other words what they desperately need is cash, hard cash as they need it to build a modest house, buy a milch animal and get seeds and other inputs for the next crop.  
Similarly the people affected in towns whose houses and small businesses have been eliminated cannot put their life back on track without cash. It’s not that they don’t need anything else. They do but without cash at the initial stage of rehabilitation even most enterprising among them would find it extremely difficult if not impossible to pick pieces and make a fresh start. There is a real fear of their being stuck in the jaws of loan sharks which will further debilitate our weak economy reeling from a crushing loss in agriculture sector. But unfortunately there is a serious problem; our people, international donors and aid agencies find no transparent mechanism of cash collection and distribution in place. The past corrupt practices of concerned government departments and some NGOs have made the entire process suspect.  
Corruption and favouritism have created a huge trust deficit. What is immediately needed is a serious effort to establish an effective cash collection and distribution mechanism that is not only transparent but also looks so to the extent that it could be trusted with donors’ money. Remember if our farmers are allowed to go under the rest of the country shall starve on the surface. “After us the deluge” if we fail to act. And it would be more devastating for our future. — soofi01@hotmail.com

4,CM raps PDM for ‘ignoring the flood-hit for politics’,LAHORE: Chief Minister Parvez Elahi has denounced the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) component parties for...,"LAHORE: Chief Minister Parvez Elahi has denounced the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) component parties for “doing politics” even when humanity is grief-stricken (because of the floods) and needed everyone’s help beyond political leanings.
Mr Elahi was speaking to senior politician Nazir Ahmad Jutt at the chief minister’s office on Sunday.
A day earlier, Mr Elahi was criticised by some sections of the media and some PDM parties for participating in the PTI public meeting in his home town of Gujrat, when hundred of thousands of people were suffering because of the calamitous flood in the southern parts of the province he was ruling.   
The chief minster said the apathetic attitude of his political opponents indicated that they did not value difficulties and calamities being faced by their brothers and sisters.  
Referring to the PDM parties, he said these people always displayed “irresponsible behaviour” in every crisis, including the recent floods, adding that their politics was not based on any principle or an ideology. He said helping the flood-affected people was not less than worship.
He said the Punjab government had increased the number of special medical camps in the flood-affected areas to prevent spread of infectious diseases. He said necessary medical facilities and preventive medicines were available in surplus quantity in the flood-stricken areas.
Mr Elahi said the Punjab government was providing all available resources to help the people hit by the floods.

Keeping this tradition alive, Azad Theatre, one of the leading parallel theatre groups of Lahore, is gearing up for staging a play based on the classic Pakistani movie Kartar Singh. 
“Through theater, we want to highlight classic Pakistani movies, reviving them in the memories of the people. That’s why we are producing a play on Kartar Singh, which is also related to the independence. We are celebrating 75th Independence Day,” Azad Theatre Executive Director Malik Aslam told Dawn.  
He said the play, titled Kartar Singh, is the outcome of a month-long workshop, which Azad Theatre held from Aug 3 to Sep 3. About 20 young actors, girls and boys, participated in the workshop. On the completion of the workshop, this group of new actors, along with senior actors of Azad Theatre, is rehearsing for the play. 
Mr Aslam said the schedule for the play would be available in October and this grand production would be staged at the Alhamra Art Centre, The Mall.  
The play, he added, had been adapted by Nadeem Abbas, one of the senior members of Azad Theatre. The music pieces would be original and they would be played by a live orchestra.  
“We shall also incorporate poetry of Ustad Daman and Heer Waris Shah in the play according to the situation.”  
Aslam said although Azad Theatre was established as an organisation as recently as 2011, it consisted of a very experienced and dynamic team with over 22 years of experience. The team members had been performing in the mainstream for the past 20 years and had got an insight into folk and modern theatre techniques, he added. 
The team is amongst the best-trained theatre teams in the country, since all its members have attended a number of national and international workshops over the years and have been trained in international as well as local theatre techniques.

8,Sikhs extend help in relief work in flood-hit areas,"LAHORE: As the relief work is still going on in the flood-hit areas of Punjab, Punjabi Sikhs from the UK have also...","LAHORE: As the relief work is still going on in the flood-hit areas of Punjab, Punjabi Sikhs from the UK have also responded to the call for help of the unprecedented floods that hit the length and breadth of Pakistan. 
It’s the fourth day (Sunday) for Nasir Dhillon of Punjabi Lehar in south Punjab. He is currently doing relief work in the Rojhan area of Rajanpur district after spending some days in the Vehova town of Taunsa Sharif in district Dera Ghazi Khan. 
“Most relief workers and organisations go to cities or towns and they don’t go to the rural and katcha areas where there is still floodwater standing and people are stranded. We select such areas and go there.” Dhillon says that they hire boats or motorcycles to reach out to such people and deliver them the items of the need. 
“We cook food at langar for around 1,500 people daily and set up medical camps. There are 25 to 30 volunteers here with me. Only kitchen workers are paid, the rest are volunteers.”  
Nasir says they are also doing the survey along with the relief work as people are desperate here and right information is needed to see who deserves the help most. 
His team includes doctors from Faisalabad, Lahore and Chiniot. Their initial plan is to remain in the area for two weeks and the Khalsa Aid wants to continue it for months.  
They are being helped by Khalsa Aid, a UK-based humanitarian relief charity founded by Ravi (Ravinder) Singh.
“Khalsa Aid has bigger plans for rehabilitation, including construction of homes and it is raising funds in the western countries. 
“In this time of trouble, there is a chance of promotion of love between communities as well as India and Pakistan. They are working here today and tomorrow if there is some natural calamity, the Pakistanis should work there also,” he suggests. 
There is a rehabilitation phase as people who survived the flood have got their homes destroyed, Nasir says and adds that the people don’t have any food or anything of use left with them. 
Gurpreet Singh, the operations manager of Khalsa Aid, says after the flood devastations in Pakistan, they thought of engaging in flood relief activities and there were requests from the social media users too for help. The operations of the Khalsa Aid are not restricted to Punjab only.  
“First of all, we engaged Nasir Dhillon to work with us in south Punjab.Now three teams are working not only in Punjab but also in Swat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sukkur in Sindh,” says Singh while talking to Dawn by phone from the UK. 
The team of the Khalsa Aid which is engaged in Sukkur started working from the Gurdwara Beri Sahib in Sialkot and it is preparing food and other items of need and sending them to Sukkur in Sindh province. 
“Our Sukkur team provided tents to at least 250 families today (Sunday) and arranged langar for them two or three times a day. The team will expand the work further on Monday.” The Swat team in KP is working in the area of Bahrain near Swat.  
Mr Singh says that the organisation has made an appeal in the UK for provision of tents as they are immediately needed for shelter and these tents would be sent to Pakistan with the cooperation of the British Airways within a week.  
Talking about the long-term rehabilitation of the flood affectees, Gurpreet Singh says that Khalsa Aid is still working in the East Punjab where the flood caused devastation in 2019 while the organisation was still engaged there in rehabilitation despite the passage of three years. 
“Similarly, we have a long-term rehabilitation plan. However, we would assess it first and target the gaps left by the government and other organisations.” 
He says we would see what we can do for reconstruction, employment or livestock in the affected areas.

They gathered near Uch Sharif and chanted slogans, alleging that so far none of the government officials had approached them for help, nor they were given any food  or medicines. They said their children were falling sick because of different diseases and most of their cattle had been swept away by the flood.
A large number of people from rural areas, including Rasoolpur, Bakhtiari, Tahirwali and other union councils of Uch Sharif, a sub-tehsil of Ahmedpur East tehsil, had been affected by the increasing flow of floodwater in the river Chenab during the last month.  
Many of them had been illegally occupying the pond area around Panjnad Headworks, from where they were moved to safer places, along with their livestock to avoid losses before the flooding in the river Chenab.
Now, with the floodwater receding from the affected areas, most of them returned to their homes, which were badly damaged, while their crops had also been destroyed.  
They demanded the government to conduct a survey to assess their losses and recommend their cases for compensation.
MURDER: A youth allegedly killed his father at Chah Amirwala village in the limits of Lodhran police station on Sunday.
According to police sources, Karim Bakhsh had distributed his landed among his two sons -- Sohail and Tufail. 
They said the elder son, Sohail, sold his land share, squandered the amount and demanded his father and younger brother to sell their share too and give him more money. However, Karim Bakhsh and Tufail refused to do so. 
The police sources say that on Sunday, Sohail attacked his father with a club when he was in his house, and fled away leaving him dead on the spot.  
The police registered a murder case against the suspect and shifted the body to the Lodhran District Headquarters Hospital for the postmortem examination.

According to an initial report of the district Rajanpur, a copy available with Dawn, 12 people lost their lives while 3,192 people were injured during the flood while 425 schools, 16 hospitals, one college, 318,423 acre crops and 28,646 houses were damaged. 
The government established 27 relief camps, 48 medical and 55 veterinary camps while 564 health teams were also formed to provide health facilities to the people. The district administration distributed 16,685 tents, 48,122 ration bags, 1,430 mats, 6,866 bottles of drinking water, 2,000 mosquito nets and 5,583 cauldrons among the flood affectees.  
In the Dera Ghazi Khan district, especially in its Taunsa tehsil, 252 roads, 354,000 acre land, 200,000 acre crops, 350 villages and 33 school buildings were damaged.

The residents of Mangrotha in the tehsil Taunsa blocked the Indus Highway in protest against unavailability of ration on Saturday evening. The protesters stopped trucks carrying food items to distribute in the Sokar area by parking tractor-trolleys on the Indus Highway. They complained that the government and NGOs were not visiting their camps and areas to provide them with any food while ration was being distributed among the favourites. The road was blocked for four to five hours. 
Fazal Lund from Shadan Lund told Dawn that the flood was caused by poor redesigning of the drains, including Kora, Vehowa, Mithawan, Kahwan, Sanghar, Soori Lund, Matti Mahoi and Rekani. He said the bad planning had caused floods from Vehowa to Shah Saddar Deen and buried hundreds of houses and also resulted in damaging the land.  
Fazal demanded the government stop taking water bills, agriculture loans and electricity bills of tube wells from the flood-hit farmers and give them subsidized fertilisers, seed and diesel. He suggested to the government to conduct a survey and provide monetary help to the people to build their houses on their own.

16,Turkish aid for the flood-hit: Pakistan Railway to receive goods in Zahedan,The train carrying relief goods in 24 wagons was dispatched by the Turkish government on Aug 30.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Railways (PR) will receive relief goods-laden Turkish train in Iran’s Zahedan city by the end of this week as necessary arrangements have been made.  
After transshipment at Zahedan, the train would bring the goods to Taftan likely on Sept 12, Dawn has learnt. The train carrying relief goods in 24 wagons was dispatched by the Turkish government on Aug 30 to the Pakistan government to help the flood-hit.  
The train moved from Turkey’s capital Ankara and entered the territory of Iran on Sunday and is likely to reach Zahedan on Sept 9. According to senior officials, the transshipment of the goods (unloading of the Turkish train and loading / shifting the goods to Pakistani wagons) would be done at Iran’s Zahedan station, about 100kms away from Taftan -- the country’s last station bordering Iran.  
“According to my information, the train entered Iran’s territory on Sunday and now it is on way to Zahedan where it is likely to reach on Sept 9. Before it reaches Zahedan, we will dispatch our wagons for transshipment of the goods and bringing them first to Taftan and then Dalbandin station -- around 300kms away from Taftan,” Nisar Akhan, PR’s Quetta Division’s chief (Divisional Superintendent), told Dawn on Sunday.  
He said Pakistan’s broad gauge railway line exists till Zahedan (Iran) and after that the standard gauge rail begins that is commonly used for rail transportation in Iran, Turkey and parts of Europe. That is why the transshipment of the goods dispatched from Pakistan or Iran or Turkey is always at Zahedan.  
He said since the transshipment process may take a couple of days, the Pakistani train carrying these goods after being unloaded from Turkish train would probably reach Taftan on Sept 12. He said the PR teams had already restored the rail traffic between Dalbandin and Taftan after repairing the track damaged by floods.  
“Fortunately some of our goods trains and wagons are already available at Dalbandin. And we can use them for transshipment purposes,” he added.  
He said from Dalbandin, these goods would be transported to the flood-affected areas by trucks as the rail track between Dalbandin and Quetta had been damaged by floods.  
PR CEO Farrukh Taimur said the relief goods could not be transported through rail network as the track at various places had been washed away by floods. “I am currently on a tour to inspect the under-water railway tracks in Balochistan and Sindh. The relief goods from Dalbandin to Quetta cannot be transported by train. 
Moreover, it also cannot be transported from Quetta to other parts of the country by train due to washing away of railway bridge No 221 near Hirok station on Quetta-Sibbi section of main line-3,” he explained. “Therefore, we will transport goods by road,” he added.  
The PR has already informed the public that the resumption of the train operations may take a few days subject to receding of water on and along the rail tracks. At present, the Rohri-Tando Adam section, Paddidan-Bhiria, Daur-Bandhi and Bocheri-Nawabshah sections are inundated. The Nawabshah yard is also under water whereas the signalling system at railway yards is also dysfunctional due to inundation and power outages.  
The PR on Aug 21 had suspended its train operations at various sections after the flash floods washed away the tracks.

17,"Tomato, onion prices: Tax-free imports from Iran, Afghanistan futile exercise",LAHORE: The policy of allowing tax-free import of vegetables from neighbouring Afghanistan and Iran could not...,"LAHORE: The policy of allowing tax-free import of vegetables from neighbouring Afghanistan and Iran could not stabilise their prices, particularly onions and tomatoes, as profiteers are taking advantage of the situation and are overcharging the consumers. 
The local crops of vegetables have been damaged by the devastating floods in Sindh and Balochistan provinces while the surviving crops could not reach the markets because of damaged road and railway networks. This situation resulted in a hike of onion price from Rs50 per kg to over Rs300 and tomato price from Rs90 per kg to Rs400.  
Last week, the government decided to go for duty-free import of vegetables from Iran and Afghanistan to rein in the prices. The announcement forced the profiteers to bring their hoarded stocks into the market and thus prices of the two commodities came down for a couple of days. 
The prices resurged as the imports failed to meet the local requirements. A local arhti (broker) says Lahore requires at least 100 truckloads of onions but it is receiving only 40 trucks. Likewise, against the daily consumption of 70 truckloads of tomatoes, only 30 trucks bring the commodity wholesale markets of the provincial capital. This difference in supply and demand is causing the price of onions to increase to Rs250 per kg and of tomatoes to Rs300 per kg. 
Likewise, rates of other vegetables are also on the rise to the disadvantage of the consumers as the authorities are unable to control hoarding. 
Meanwhile, the Punjab government has formed a committee to take a decision on increasing the minimum support price of the all-important wheat crop. It includes ministers for finance, parliamentary affairs, food, agriculture and housing as well as secretaries of finance, food and law departments.  
The committee is likely to recommend Rs300 per 40kg increase in the minimum support price, which is presently Rs2,200 per 40kg. The country is already facing a shortage of grain and is importing at least 3.0 million tonnes of it for the ongoing crop year. Sowing of wheat will start in the month of November and it will be harvested in April-May.
