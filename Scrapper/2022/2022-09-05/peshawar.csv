3,Peshawar remains centre of different infectious diseases,Provincial capital records highest number of Covid and dengue cases.,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar, the most populous district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, continues to remain the epicentre of epidemics because it serves as transition point for the travellers from the whole province and has more hospitals and laboratories, according to officials.
The provincial capital has been recording the highest number of Covid-19 cases since the onset of the infectious disease in the province as well dengue haemorrhagic fever in addition to being on the top of the list regarding refusals against polio drops.
Officials at the health department say that Peshawar is being visited by people from other parts of the province in connection with their businesses, official work and treatment at the hospitals due to which it records the highest number of infections.
“Most of the laboratories are located in the city, which conduct tests of people from the whole province and the positive ones are listed in Peshawar,” they told this scribe.

Provincial capital serves as transition point for travellers from entire province

So far, a total of 6,354 persons have passed away due to coronavirus including 3,140 in Peshawar, which has also reported 84,569 Covid-19 cases of the province-wide 223,630 infections.
They said that most of the mortalities occurred in Peshawar because it had more hospitals that admitted more patients and those dying were bracketed as residents of the provincial capital, which was not correct. “More patients are referred to Peshawar from the district headquarters hospitals when they become serious and they die ultimately here,” said the officials.
Presently, Peshawar is home to 309 active coronavirus cases of the total 689 positive patients. Similarly, the provincial capital has more Covid-19 laboratories, which conduct bulk of the tests of the samples from the entire province as result it is believed that Peshawar has more infections.
Only the public health reference laboratory at Khyber Medical University conducted 90 per cent of the total 5,035,049 tests in the province.
Poliomyelitis is another public health issue, which has been haunting the children for the past more than two decades with Peshawar having the highest number of unvaccinated children recorded after every campaign.
According to a report regarding the recently-concluded polio campaign, Peshawar accounted for 20,274 missed children and 7,204 refusal cases while 13,070 children remained unvaccinated as they were not available in their homes when health team visited them to immunise them.
Peshawar has been reporting the highest number of unvaccinated children in the shape of non-availability, missed and refusal as compared to any other district in the province. These issues prevail in other districts too but Peshawar is the provincial capital where all technical and administrative people are based with more resources at their disposal.
“Dengue fever is another epidemic occurring in the province now and then with Peshawar being the worst-affected district,” said officials.
In 2017, more than 20,000 persons tested positive for dengue in Peshawar and about 70 of them died. This year, no death has been recorded due to the mosquito-borne ailment in the province but of the total 1,972 cases, Peshawar’s share is 111 and it is ranked fifth after Mardan with 783 cases, Khyber with 420, Nowshera with 193 and Haripur with182 cases.

The warned was made by the office-bearers of Hattar Industrialists Association while addressing a news conference here the other day. 
On the occasion, the association’s general secretary Attaur Rehman said over 480 units in the estate had been providing source of living to 60,000 workers, directly and indirectly, besides contributing billions of rupees in revenue to the national exchequer.
He said the industrialists were unable to pay the electricity bills of August.
He said off-peak rate per unit was Rs17.11, while peak-hour rate was Rs22.91 per unit, which was beside the Fuel Price Adjustment of Rs9.897 per unit and quarterly tariff adjustment of over Rs5 per unit.
Mr Rehman said such heavy taxation and high rates of electricity had forced the industrialists to revisit their plan of continuing production. He said before June 2022, there was a simple formula for consumers having MDI (maximum demand indicator) meters as they were sent bills only for the units consumed, but from June onward, the National Electric Regulatory Authority had changed the policy and started sending bills with 50 per cent of the sanctioned load of even a closed industrial unit.
He also demanded establishment of a sub-office of Pesco in the estate and reviving the policy of bills payment on 28 or 29 of each month.

The returning people were provided food, blankets, medicines and other necessary items at the camps set up in different localities of the cantonment.

12,PHC sets aside conviction of man in minor girl assault case,Remands case to child protection court for retrial...,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has set aside on technical grounds conviction of a person charged with sexually assaulting a minor girl and remanded the case back to a child protection court for retrial.
A single-member bench consisting of Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan allowed an appeal filed by the convict, Fazal Wahid, observing that he was indicted for committing offence of rape under section 376 of Pakistan Penal Code, whereas the allegations levelled against him in the FIR were that of sexual abuse falling under section 377-B of PPC.
While remanding back the case to the child protection court (CPC), Swat, the bench directed that the trial court should frame an amended charge as per allegations made in the FIR.
The bench also ordered releasing the appellant on bail on condition of furnishing two sureties of Rs500,000 each.

Remands case to child protection court for retrial

The appellant was convicted by CPC on April 13, 2022, under section 376 and 511 of PPC. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment with fine of Rs50,000.
The trial court had also ordered that since the child victim suffered mental and physical anguish, the compensatory fine of Rs100,000 was awarded to the victim to be payable in the form of saving certificates to her.
The appellant was also charged under section 52 (sexual abuse) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010, but in its judgment, the trial court had dropped that section observing that the provision was dropped so as to avoid double jeopardy.
The FIR of the occurrence was registered on August 28, 2021, at a police station in Swat under section 376 and 511 of PPC and section 53 of KP Child Protection and Welfare Act.
The victim, a child of around seven, had visited police station along with her father and reported the matter to the local police.
She had stated that she was sent by her mother to a nearby shop in order to bring pulses and as soon as she reached there, the shopkeeper (accused) caught hold of her and tried to rape her. However, she stated that her younger sister, who was searching for her, reached there and she was allowed by the accused to go.
The accused had denied the charges and claimed mala fide on part of the complainant’s family. He claimed that the complainant’s family had been purchasing grocery items from his shop on loan and when he demanded money, he was implicated in a false case.
The trial court had not accepted his plea and also referred to different articles of the UN Convention on the Rights of Child while convicting him.
The appellant’s counsel contended before the high court bench that in view of the nature of the allegations levelled in the FIR and the evidence produced by the prosecution during trial, the same could not constitute an offence of rape punishable under section 376 PPC as there was no allegation of rape in the FIR.
He contended that the allegations levelled in the FIR would squarely attract the provision of section 377-B PPC.
He stated that lacuna in the framing of charge could have been ignored, had the trial court not dropped the charge under section 53 of KP Child Protection and Welfare Act in its judgment. He said that it was a fit case for remanding back to the trial court for framing of an amended charge and thereafter to conduct a fresh trial.

14,Media asked to play role in countering tobacco campaigns,"Health expert says no federal, provincial legislation regarding new tobacco products...","ISLAMABAD: Health activists on Sunday said media could play a vital role to counter the deceptive campaigns of the tobacco industry to promote harmful emerging tobacco products among Pakistani youth.
They were expressing their views during a consultation organised by the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (Sparc). Experts and senior journalists explored the need to ban emerging products such as nicotine pouches, e-cigarettes and heated tobacco devices, as they were becoming increasingly popular among Pakistani youth due to elaborate advertisements and promotional campaigns.
Country Lead Vital Strategies and former technical head/director, Tobacco Control Cell, National Heath Services ministry Dr Ziauddin Islam said the number of smokers in Pakistan had reached up to 29 million.
“Tobacco consumption is causing serious health implications on Pakistanis and yearly 170,000 people die as a result. Pakistan became a party to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) on Feb 27, 2005. Our country was already struggling to counter threats posted by cigarettes but now the tobacco industry has launched these emerging products to gain more profit at the expense of public health,” he said.

Health expert says no federal, provincial legislation regarding new tobacco products

Dr Zia said in Pakistan there was no federal or provincial legislation regarding emerging products.
“Prohibition of Smoking and Protection of Non-Smokers Ordinance 2002 provides key guidelines regarding advertisement, promotion and sale of tobacco products to children. Such measures are required for emerging products as well to take them out of reach of children and youth,” he said.
Malik Imran Ahmed, country head Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, said utilising the gap in policy-making, the tobacco industry had launched deceptive campaigns and profited from them.
“Emerging products have been directly targeted at youth using icons such as famous musicians, actors and models for paid social media content. The industry has even launched a music show. Furthermore, despite the claims, emerging products are being sold near educational institutions, playgrounds and restaurants to attract young customers,” he said.
Mr Ahmed said media’s extensive and unbiased coverage was the reason for increase in prices of cigarettes after three years.
“Media needs to play its role in exposing tobacco industry’s tactics regarding emerging products as well,” he said.
Sparc Programme Manager Khalil Ahmed Dogar said: “Pakistan is lucky that majority of its population is the youth; 61 million of youngsters are an asset for our country. Nicotine addiction serves as a gateway to many other forms of substance abuse and may cause serious health and mental health issues among youth. Such dangerous products should have no room in a country like Pakistan.”
He said due to cheap and easy affordability nearly 1,200 children begin smoking every day in Pakistan.
“I request the media to take this issue as a child rights issue,” he said.
Chief executive officer of Chromatic Trust Shariq Mahmood Khan said tobacco companies were investing money in online campaigns on almost all social media platforms.
“The algorithms of advertisements are designed in such a deceptive manner that the ads appear even on articles that are written to discourage people from using tobacco,” he said.
Mr Mahmood urged website owners to take down these advertisements and raise awareness on harms of nicotine, second hand smoking, and adverse impacts of tobacco products on public economy and environment.

Carrying placards and banners inscribed with different slogans, the shopkeepers staged a sit-in on Museum Road near the office of vice president of the cantonment board.
Protesters were of the view that there are around 32 cantonment boards across the country and investors get properties especially shops on 99 years lease from these boards and almost all have sublet these shops. However, nowhere else were any shops sealed, the shopkeepers said, adding that by utilising colonial powers inherited from British policymakers, officials are depriving bread and butter from 66 families and leading them to starvation.
Retired Col Kazim Raza, while expressing solidarity with the aggrieved shopkeepers, termed the act of the cantonment board “discriminatory”.
He appealed to the authorities concerned that keeping in view the high inflation and poor economic condition of the working class, the shopkeepers would be allowed to run their businesses on humanitarian grounds. Commenting on the issue, a spokesman for the cantonment board said 164 shops located in the garrison city were owned by the cantonment board. These shop owners sublet the premises in violation of section 5 of the agreement which states “not to assign, sublet, transfer or part with the possession of the said building or any part thereof, or any of right or interest therein under any circumstances without written sanction of the executive officer Taxila”.
The spokesman further added that 66 shopkeepers were issued notices over violation of this section for subletting their shops in December 2021 and July 20022 and subsequently the shops were sealed.
