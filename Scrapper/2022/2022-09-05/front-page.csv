0,Water from cut made in Manchhar dyke floods five towns,"Breach to allow water flow into Indus; over 672,000 move to camps; minister says ‘controlled cut’ aimed at saving Sehwan, Bh...","HYDERABAD: Amid threats that rising level in Manchhar Lake would flood densely populated Sehwan and Bhan Saeedabad areas, authorities on Sunday made a “relief cut” in the dyke to allay the pressure that had been building since Saturday.
Meanwhile, ‘citizen committees have been formed at taluka levels to oversee relief efforts as over 672,000 people have been moved to camps all over the Sindh province.
The cut, made at RD-14 Yusuf Bagh location, will inundate the uni­on councils of Jaffarabad, Cha­nna, Arazi, Bubak and Wahur, which is also the constituency of Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and his village is also located there.
The decision to give the cut was made as the increasing water level had already imperilled the dykes since Saturday evening due to strong wind.

Breach to allow water flow into Indus; over 672,000 move to camps; minister says ‘controlled cut’ aimed at saving Sehwan, Bhan Saeedabad

On Sunday morning, Sindh Special Secretary Irrigation Jamal Mangan confirmed the development to Dawn over the phone. However, he didn’t give any detail about the size of the cut, saying he has not visited the site.
According to officials, the cut made between RD-14 and RD-15 will allow water to eventually reach Indus River — something not happening for the past two days as the river was flowing in ‘high flood’ between Sukkur and Kotri barrages.
As the lake received water from Main Nara Valley Drain — also called Right Bank Outfall Drain-I — on Saturday, the water level rose to 123.2RL, making the dykes vulnerable to breaches.
Earlier, irrigation officials had said that 25,000 to 30,000 cusecs water was easily flowing from the lake into the river when it had not attained high flood levels. But later, the flows dropped to 15,000 and then further to 10,000 cusecs.
An official said that small cuts are a standard practice to allay pressures as water flow gradually erodes the sand and widens it.
Ghulam Hyder, a fisherman, told Dawn that the cut was given near Arazi Goth near Sehwan and the water will enter the river once it starts receding.
Talking to reporters in Sehwan, CM Shah said the “controlled cut” in the lake would save the city which was under threat.
“Even my house in Bajara has been inundated after water entered the village where my father was born,” said Mr Shah, adding that now his second village will also be inundated due to the cut.
Reuters reported that the cut will save densely populated areas and will displace up to 100,000 people in the five union councils.
The decision to make the cut had to be taken to save Sehwan and Bhan Saeedabad cities where a population of 300,000 lives, Sindh Minister for Information, Transport and Mass Transit, Sharjeel Inam Memon said.
Addressing a press briefing at his residence on Sunday, Mr Memon, who is also the focal person for rain emergency in Hyderabad, said that decisions to make cuts were being made after taking all stakeholders into confidence While briefing on relief efforts, the minister added that more than 672,000 people are staying in relief camps all over the province.
He said dispensaries were being established in relief camps, while pregnant women were being moved to hospitals.
The government has decided to place orders for ration bags with private vendors as the Utility Stores Corporation was being slow, having procured only 8,000 bags against the target of 115,000, he added.
Mr Memon said once the water receded the process of dewatering would be initiated.
Short-term and long-term policies were being made for the rehabilitation of affected people, he said, adding that infrastructure would be restored in the first phase and in the second phase, assistance will be provided to help people rebuild their houses.
Citizen committees 
Meanwhile, to streamline relief efforts, citizens’ committees with civil judges as their heads have been formed at the taluka levels in some districts to set up tent cities and monitor the relief efforts.
The committees will oversee arrangements like provision of relief goods, food, and other necessary items. They are mandated to take strict actions against those pilfering or selling relief items.
The committees will also visit breached dykes and ensure dewatering of inundated areas.

1,"PML-N, PPP want favourite COAS to escape graft cases: Imran","""They are afraid that if a strong and patriotic army chief is appointed then he would ask them about the looted wealth,"" he says.","LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Sunday lashed out at the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) — major coalition partners in the incumbent government — saying both parties were opposing snap elections, because they wanted to “appoint an army chief of their choice” in November to save their skin in corruption cases. 
Addressing a rally in Fais­alabad, the former prime minister said PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif were making all-out efforts to bring their “favourite” army chief after the retirement of the incumbent chief in November this year. The new army chief should be chosen on merit, he said, adding Mr Zardari and Mr Sharif were “traitors” and should not be trusted with the fate of the country. 
“They want to bring their own army chief…they are afraid that if a strong and patriotic army chief is appointed then he would ask them about the looted wealth,” Mr Khan said, adding that the PPP and PML-N chiefs were sticking to the power because of the fear of accountability. 
Read: Who will be the next army chief?
“They are sitting [in the government] because they want to bring in an army chief of their choice through joint efforts,” he added. Imran Khan said the army chief should be “appointed on merit…whoever is on the top of the merit list should be appointed” to head the institution. 
Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, who was appointed in 2016, is set to retire in the last week of November. The army chief’s appointment is meant to be for three years, but Gen Bajwa was given an additional three-year term in 2019 after a bit of political drama.  
Imran Khan further said the opposition leaders were afraid of holding snap elections because they know they will be wiped out from political arena when elections are held in the country. 
He also bashed the coalition government over the state of the economy and quoted a report by the International Monetary Fund which, according to Mr Khan, had warned of unrest in Pakistan due to precarious economic situation. He added that early general elections were the only option to bring political and economic stability in the country.

2,Ceasefire ‘holding’ amid evolving TTP threat,"“There has been no movement. Everything is on hold,” says an official.","PESHAWAR: The ceasefire between the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and law enforcement agencies is holding, despite sporadic attacks, officials say.
Negotiations to sue for peace with the TTP to end nearly two decades of conflict in the tribal districts bordering Afghanistan have been on hold since the last delegation, comprising largely of tribal notables, held a round of talks towards the end of July, officials familiar with the process say.
“There has been no movement. Everything is on hold,” says an official.
Recently, questions were raised over the fate of peace talks after reports that armed militants had returned to Swat, Dir and parts of the tribal districts.
While there was no public comment from the government, returning militants claimed they had done so following an agreement. But sources familiar with the talks in Kabul said no such agreement had taken place.
“The only ‘agreement’ was about an indefinite ceasefire and continuation of negotiations to settle complex issues, including the return of the militants and their reintegration in society.
“The demand from our side was that the TTP was to be disbanded and they would return unarmed. Of course they didn’t agree, much like we didn’t agree to some of their demands”, the source explained.
The TTP continues to insist ever since the May ceasefire agreement that it had acted in self-defence whenever and wherever it was attacked, resulting in the death of policemen in Dera Ismail Khan and Peshawar.
The ceasefire agreement, they say, stipulates that both sides including the law enforcement agencies are free to act in self-defence, although in a recent post the militant group accused “the other side’ of violating the terms.
There is little clarity on who is carrying out which attacks and which group is behind the increasing number of extortion calls. The TTP denies its involvement and has asked victims to report such incidents but analysts say that public anxiety and concerns will only grow in the absence of clarity and transparency involving the peace talks and the understanding reached.
Little is known as to what was said or agreed upon between the TTP leadership and senior Pakistani interlocutors during the talks brokered by and held under the direct supervision of the acting Afghan Taliban Interior Minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani.
A team of religious scholars led by Mufti Taqi Usmani – someone who is revered and respected both within the ranks and file of the Afghan Taliban and the TTP, was sent to assure the militant leadership that there was nothing ‘un-Islamic’ about the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
There were some indications that considerable headway had been made leading to optimism amongst some circles that an agreement was round the corner.
But then reports of the presence of armed militants in the tourist hotspot of Swat emerged, sparking fears of renewed phase of violence after more than a decade of peace and normalcy in the region.
The attack on a PTI MPA from Dir in early August was the first such indication. The attack left the lawmaker seriously wounded and four others dead, but TTP denied it was behind the violence.
However, police and security officials strongly believed TTP militants on their way from Afghanistan to Swat via Dir carried out the ambush to punish the MPA for heading the Village Defense Committee in his native district, that had overseen the surrender of some militants to the state.
This was followed shortly by an incident that sent shockwaves across the region and led to public anger and protest demonstrations, when a group of armed militants held a deputy superintendent of police hostage along with three others in the mountainous Peochar area of Matta sub-district.
A jirga was pressed into action, which secured the release of the hostage men. The TTP claimed their men had acted in self-defense.
The government quietly moved forces to chase out the militants, but there were reports that the armed men had already abandoned their positions and returned to Afghanistan. There was, however, no independent corroboration.

The prime minister arrived in Quetta on a day-long visit and later took an aerial view of flood-hit areas in Balochistan and Punjab.
Accompanied by National Highway Authority (NHA) Chairman Khurram Agha, Mr Sharif said the work on a number of highways and roads has been completed, while efforts are under way to restore traffic on the remaining ones on an emergency basis.
The prime minister had already stressed that rehabilitation of the communication infrastructure was the top priority.

Shehbaz visits Bolan Pass to review restoration of highway

Mr Sharif was told that during the last two weeks, damaged roads in all the four provinces and Gilgit- Baltistan have been restored.
The Mansehra-Naran-Chilas N-15 National Highway has been restored, while Karachi-Chaman N-25 highway, where a section from Hub to Khuzdar, was washed away has also been restored for traffic, the prime minister was briefed.

He visited the Bolan Pass to review restoration work on N-65 highway, which has been cut off for over a month, where he was briefed by the NHA chairman and other officials about efforts to restore roads, railways and bridges in the area.
The prime minister appreciated the district administration, federal authorities and other institutions “for their commitment and devotion” which he said was a “source of inspiration for the people.”
“I salute all those who have been involved in relief and rehabilitation efforts,” Mr Sharif said, adding that damages to Bibi Nani and Pinjra bridges disrupted traffic from Quetta to Sukkur, leaving about 6000 people stranded on both ends.
The premier appreciated the NHA, law enforcement agencies, Pakistan Army and other authorities who restored the damaged Bibi Nani bridge within eight hours, adding that “they did a great national service”.
The primer also announced a relief grant of Rs5 million relief for the labourers working to restore the highway and another Rs1m grant for those working on the restoration of a major pipeline supplying gas to Quetta and other areas. 
He also announced Rs3m for labourers who have restored the Bibi Nani bridge.
A committee would be set up to dispense the amount on merit, he announced.
He said Balochistan chief minister and chief secretary have been coordinating with the relevant authorities to speed up the rehabilitation work.
While referring to the damages caused by floods, he added that the catastrophe has affected all provinces with over 1300 deaths, while economic and infrastructure damages are also enormous.
During the briefing, the NHA chairman said the authority will hire foreign consultants for reconstruction of Pinjra Bridge and the highway.

4,Rizwan stars as Pakistan edge India in thriller,DUBAI: Mohammad Rizwan hit an attacking 71 as Pakistan beat India by five wickets in a last-over Super Four thriller...,"DUBAI: Mohammad Rizwan hit an attacking 71 as Pakistan beat India by five wickets in a last-over Super Four thriller at the Asia Cup in Dubai on Sunday.
Chasing 182 for victory, Pakistan achieved their target with one ball to spare thanks to an inspirational 73-run stand between Rizwan and Mohammad Nawaz (42).
Rizwan was out in the 17th over after his second successive half-century in the tournament, but Khushdil Shah, with his unbeaten 14, and Asif Ali, who made 16 off eight balls, made sure Pakistan got over the line against Arshdeep Singh.
Reprieved after Arshdeep dro­p­ped an easy catch at short third man, Asif hit a six and two fours before falling with two balls left, leaving Iftikhar Ahmed to knock off the remaining two runs.
Earlier, Virat Kohli’s 60 guided India to 181-7 after being put in to bat.
Pakistan started their chase cautiously and lost skipper Babar Azam for 14 as leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi lured the batsman into a chip straight to mid-wicket.
The in-form Rizwan, who made 43 and 78 in the previous two matches, hit back with three boundaries off pace bowler Hardik Pandya and a six in the next over.
He put on 41 runs with Fakhar Zaman, who played a scratchy knock of 13 before falling to Yuzvendra Chahal’s leg spin.
Pakistan promoted the left-handed Nawaz, primarily a spinner, in the batting order to push the scoring and he delivered by promptly hitting a four and a six.
Rizwan, who hurt himself keeping wickets after landing awkwardly on his right leg but was able to continue, anchored the innings and reached fifty in 37 balls.
Nawaz smashed five fours and two sixes in his 20-ball blitz and stood firm with Rizwan before getting out to Bhuvneshwar Kumar.
Pandya removed Rizwan as India sensed a turnaround, but the left-handed Khushdil and Asif pulled off the chase as Pakistan avenged their loss to India in the group stage.
Middle-order stutter
Star batsman Kohli, who hit 60 off 44 balls before being run out in the final over, helped India survive a middle-order stutter to post a competitive total.
He reached his 32nd half-century in 36 balls with a six off pace bowler Mohammad Hasnain amid chants of “Kohli, Kohli” at a packed stadium.
Indian skipper Rohit Sharma came out all guns blazing to smash pace bowler Naseem Shah for a six and four in the opening over of the match.
Opening partner K.L. Rahul soon took the cue to whack Naseem for two cracking blows over the fence.
The openers put on 54 runs briskly and attempted to make full use of the power play, when only two fielders are allowed outside the inner circle, by hitting lofted shots. But Rohit fell when he mistimed Haris Rauf.
Khushdil Shah clung on to a sky-high catch as Rohit went back after scoring 28 off 16 balls in the sixth over.
Shadab struck in the next over to cut short Rahul’s stay on 28 and then left-arm orthodox spinner Mohammad Nawaz removed the dangerous Suryakumar Yadav for 13.
Kohli, who has slowly come out of his lean patch with scores of 35 and 59 in the previous two matches, kept the score ticking and got the occasional boundary.
But Pakistan kept chipping away with wickets, including the left-handed Rishabh Pant for 14 and Hardik Pandya for a second-ball duck off Hasnain.
Ravi Bishnoi finished off the innings with two boundaries as Fakhar Zaman faltered twice in the deep, including dropping a catch that reached the ropes.
Leg-spinner Shadab Khan stood out with figures of 2-31 from his four overs.
