MPA Jam Awais along with his servants/guards — Haider Ali, Meer Ali, Muhammad Mairaj, Mohammad Saleem Salar, Mohammad Doda Khan, Ahmed Khan Shoro and Mohammad Soomar — have been booked and detained for murdering 26-year-old Nazim Jokhio at the MPA’s farmhouse in Malir.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (Malir) Faraz Ahmed Chandio pronounced his order on an application filed by Advocate Mazhar Ali Junejo.
In the application, Mr Junejo submitted that he was a friend of slain Jokhio, who had sent him a voice message on WhatsApp telling that he had been taken away from his house and kept at Jam House by MPA Jam Awais and being coerced to tender an apology to the politician’s foreign guests for quarrelling with them over the issue of hunting houbara bustard.
He submitted that he might be allowed to join the trial proceedings as an important ‘witness’ of the prosecution against the influential politician.
However, the state prosecutor as well as counsel for the suspects and the complainant opposed the plea. 
The widow’s counsel pleaded the court not to allow the applicant to be treated as a witness in the case saying she had already reached an out-of-court settlement with the MPA and others, and did not have objection if they were acquitted and released in the case.

3,This week 50 years ago: NAP council and teachers’ protest,THE language issue in the province had not just affected the life of the average person but contrasting views with a...,"THE language issue in the province had not just affected the life of the average person but contrasting views with a divisive impact had also emerged within the ranks of political groups. For example, on Sept 5, 1972 it was revealed that the differences in the Sindh National Awami Party (NAP) on the language question came to a head when its newly elected council led by its President Azizullah Shaikh ‘quietly elbowed out’ the Pakistan NAP Secretary General Mahmudul Haq Usmani and his colleagues from the 80-strong contingent of councillors . It was believed to be a foregone conclusion judging by the action earlier taken by the Karachi NAP Committee when five local dissidents — Abdul Waheed Siddiqui, Alauddin Ahmed Abbasi, Kavish Rizvi, Altaf Asad and Mohammad Ahmad Siddiqui — were suspended. The show-cause notice served on them had charged them with violating the party’s constitution by propagating the concept of five nationalities, while the constitution recognised only four nationalities in the country. Such a notice was also now to be served to Mr Usmani. 
Staying on the subject of language strife, on Sept 8, an opposition member of parliament in the Sindh Assembly and a former commissioner of the city, G A Madani at a press conference challenged on the floor of the house the reported statement of the Central Home Minister, Abdul Qayyum Khan, that the percentage of Urdu speaking population in Sindh was 20.47. Giving statistics on the basis of the previous census, he claimed that the ratio of the Sindhi and Urdu-speaking populations in the province was around 50:50 percent. 
The other issue that made the headlines in those days was the nationalisation of educational institutions. On Sept 6, this newspaper ran a story according to which a stormy session of the teachers of local colleges held at Sir Syed Girls College decided to boycott all examination work including assessment of scripts from Sept 7 as a protest against the government’s amendment to martial law regulation (MLR) 118 seeking to remove clauses of vital interest to them. 
The meeting was called by the Teachers Joint Action Committee (TJAC) presided over by Rashid Patel, chairman of the committee. They expressed alarm at the manner in which the government had removed the protective cover granted under MLR-118 to the teachers of nationalised institutions. The committee warned the provincial administration of serious consequences if it continued to take provocative measures against the teachers who were determined to fight for the rights and befits promised to them earlier by the central government. 
In response, Education Minister Dur Mohammad Usto assured the teaching community that his government was sympathetically considering their case with a view to accommodating their demands. But on Sept 10, the talks between the government and the teachers’ representatives held on the Sindh Assembly premises, which lasted for five hours, remained inconclusive. 
The same day, on Sept 10, it was announced that a number of privately managed and community secondary schools, lower secondary and primary schools in the Karachi region were to be exempted from nationalisation scheduled to take place from Oct 1.

8,Starving flood victims face infectious diseases under open sky in Sindh,"Govt data says over 600,000 people have reported with various illnesses at medical camps since July.","KARACHI: An alarming situation currently prevails in the flood-affected areas where hundreds and thousands of flood-affected people, often forced to live under the open sky, are grappling with hunger and disease, it emerged on Sunday.
According to the latest July-Sept health department data, 660,120 have reported various illnesses at government-run medical camps in flood-affected areas since July.
The stats show that skin ailments and diarrhoeal diseases are rampant in flood-affected areas — a total of 149,551 reported with diarrheal diseases while 142,739 people reported with skin infections.
The officials recorded 132,485 cases of acute respiratory disease, 49,420 cases of suspected malaria, 101 cases of snake-bite and 550 cases of dog-bite.

Govt data says over 600,000 people report with various illnesses at medical camps

There were 185,274 cases of other illnesses.
In an interview on Sunday, Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho stated that over 47,000 pregnant women were in shelter camps in the province.
Read: Healthcare during floods
Hundreds and thousands of people had contracted various diseases after the floods, she added.



 
According to officials, over 15,000 cases of skin infection cases, around 14,000 cases of diarrhoeal diseases and more than 13,000 cases of acute respiratory illnesses are being reported daily at government-run medical camps.
Numbers much higher
Workers engaged in relief efforts in the flood-hit districts, however, believed that the actual number of cases was much higher as there were still several places in the province where the government was yet to reach and start relief operations.
“One of the major challenges currently being faced in the disaster areas is lack of shelter. Today, we have visited Mirpurkhan, Tando Muhammad Khan and Tando Adam but couldn’t see a single government-run relief camp and people were forced to live under the sky,” Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, secretary general of Pakistan Medical Association-Karachi said.
One relief camp the team came across was being managed by the People’s Primary Health Care Initiative on the Khipro road, he added.
“Skin infections are common as the vast majority of people had remained exposed to water for 10 to 15 days. The flooded areas are now breeding grounds for mosquitos but the people neither have shelter nor mosquito nets.”
The situation, Dr Shoro feared, would aggravate in the coming days and there was an immediate need for urgent action.
“People living under the open sky are forced to drink contaminated water. They are getting little bit of food either from non-profit organisations or some kind-hearted landlords.”



 
According to health department officials, around 5m people have been displaced in the devastating floods, which damaged over 1,000 health facilities in Sindh.
Of them, 966 were partially damaged whereas 126 were completely destroyed.
Editorial: Health catastrophe
The highest number of partially damaged facilities were located in Sukkur (230) followed by Larkana (199), Hyderabad (183), Mirpurkhas (171), Shaheed Benazirabad (156) and Karachi (27).
Mirpurkhas lost 65 health facilities followed by Hyderabad 22, Sukkur 17, Larkana 13, Shaheed Benazirabad 7 and Karachi 1.
The government data shows that while the cases of cholera were on the decline, cases of diarrhea and dysentery are increasing in Sindh.
“There are 293 mobile camps and 157 fixed camps where 496 doctors and 1138 paramedics have been assigned duties,” the data says.

11,Bentley found in Karachi's DHA was imported by Bulgarian envoy,"Customs previously tried to impound vehicle in 2019, stood down after embassy claimed ownership.","

The Bentley confiscated by customs.

 
KARACHI: The Bentley Mulsanne, said to be stolen from the UK and recovered during a raid by customs officials in Defence Housing Authority (DHA), was imported by a European diplomat stationed in Islamabad in 2019 and registered with the Sindh excise and taxation department in his name, documents seen by Dawn reveal.
Customs officials had recovered the vehicle on information “provided by a friendly country’s agency” that traced the Bentley’s location in a residence in DHA.
Two persons — Jameel Shafi and broker Naveed Bilwani — were arrested and booked in an FIR, in which one Navaid Yamin and unknown ‘facilitator’ of the Sindh excise and taxation department were also nominated.
The vehicle carried the number plate BRS-279 and a quick search of the registration number on the Sindh excise department’s online vehicle verification portal reveals that the ‘2014 model Bentley’ was registered on May 21, 2020 in the name of “H. E. Aleksandar Borisov Parashkevov”.

Customs previously tried to impound vehicle in 2019, stood down after embassy claimed ownership

Official documents reviewed by Dawn suggested that customs authorities had, in the past, also attempted to seize the high-end vehicle in Karachi.
However, documents reveal that the Bulgarian embassy intervened and communicated to the foreign ministry that the vehicle was being used by a ‘service staff’ of the foreign mission and had not been sold to anyone, so the “customs department had no jurisdiction to at all seize, confiscate, or impound the vehicle.
Interestingly, the member of ‘service staff’ was Navaid Yamin, one of the suspects nominated in the FIR lodged by customs authorities following the recovery of the luxury vehicle.
The story supposedly began in 2019 with the import of the vehicle by the ambassador of Bulgaria in Pakistan.
On Nov 2019, the government of Pakistan issued an exemption certificate in favour of Mr Parashkevov of the Embassy of Bulgaria for importing dutiable goods from abroad by diplomatic officers and missions for their personal use. The total value of the consignment was shown as $36,950 and Karachi was the port of discharge.
An official letter written by the Embassy of Bulgaria to the Sindh excise and taxation department on Dec 26, 2019 stated that the consignment (Bentley Mulsanne) was the property of then-ambassador Aleksandar Borisov Parashkevov. The embassy asked the Sindh government to “issue cover registration number plate of the vehicle due to security reasons”.
On Jan 8, 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued a “non-transferable” registration certificate for diplomatic vehicle in the name of Ambassador Parashkevov with registration number CD-09-13.
However, customs authorities learnt that the car was sold to a local in Karachi and they tried to seize it on account of non-payment of customs duty. But Navaid Yamin (the man named in Friday’s FIR) filed a suit against custom’s directorate of intelligence and investigation.
On March 11, 2020 the Bulgarian embassy sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that Navaid Yamin was the “service staff of the mission since 2019 in terms of Act IX of 1972 Diplomatic and Consular Privileges Act, 1972. He [Yamin] is providing all kind of services to our mission at Islamabad including but not limited to importation of Diplomatic Goods from abroad and is rendering such services at our mission”.
“Being service staff we have allowed him to use our vehicle i.e. Mulsanne V8,” the letter said, adding that the embassy imported the vehicle for “personal use” and “hurdles and objections created by customs authorities for attempting to impound our vehicle, which is at the moment in possession of plaintiff [Yamin], is totally uncalled for. It is once again clarified that we have not sold the vehicle; the customs department has no jurisdiction to at all seize, confiscate or impound the vehicle”.
It appears that following this correspondence, customs authorities abandoned their efforts to seize the vehicle until they received a letter from what is being described as “a friendly country’s agency” informing them that the Bentley was stolen.
A customs source said that they had no mechanism to ascertain whether a car brought at the Karachi port legally by an importer was stolen or not.

12,The graffiti artist with his vision for Karachi,The artist says art can be used to depict a country’s culture or for spreading awareness...,"KARACHI: Perhaps you didn’t notice the young man feverishly at work with his paint cans on the wall behind a heap of rubbish near a tall apartment building but you won’t be able to ignore his creation after he is done. It might very well be that the images he makes on the wall will take your mind off that heap of trash.
Young Syed Shees Uddin, who’s only 22 years old, wears many hats. He is a digital artist and a graphic designer by profession besides also being a student of Bachelors. That’s also why he only has the weekends, Saturday and Sunday, for graffiti.
This weekend, he is working on an image signifying the Defence of Pakistan Day. Right next to the wall he is working on is another wall covered in yellow paint with a name and phone number of some quack in bold black. The graffiti artist plans to do something about that, too, if he is left with some extra paint after finishing with his own painting.
His own work has a big ‘September 6’ written in Urdu with a Pakistan Air Force fighter jet on one side. He has also creatively used the same number ‘6’ with September for ‘6’ in ‘1965’ also.

The artist says art can be used to depict a country’s culture or for spreading awareness

“You see ugly wall chalking all over the city with all kinds of advertisements. No one takes permission from anyone to dirty the walls with such chalking but I make it a point to get permission from the area police station before going about my work,” Shees tells Dawn.
Starting since he was just a teenager, he has been making graffiti for eight years now. 
“I have always been good at drawing and I got to know about graffiti art through the internet. Such street art is a big thing in the suburbs of New York or many German cities. It can be used to depict a country’s culture or for spreading awareness. Either way it beautifies your city,” he says, adding that he has so far done graffiti on some 50 walls, which includes the walls of the National Stadium bridge, Karachi University and other places in Nazimabad, Gulberg, Dastagir, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, etc.
“Sometimes I am also called in do it as a part of a commercial project so the little bit of money that I make from there I use for my own beautification projects such as this Defence Day project that I am doing right now,” he says.
Shees is very quick. “Well, graffiti art is done with spray paints and spray paints help finish work fast. But I also make a rough sketch on paper first to compose my idea and to decide what colours I want to use,” he says.
“There are not many graffiti artists in the country although one may find many walls here covered with truck art in Karachi, which is also very popular and pretty to look at. But graffiti art and truck art are two separate things,” he points out.
“I recently met with City Administrator Murtaza Wahab sahib, who appreciated my work,” he beams.
“I can do so much more with the support of the government. I want to make all walls colourful and beautiful, call it my way of giving back to my city. There are government buildings, parks, consulate walls, etc., just calling out to me,” he concludes with a smile.

13,"Over 40,000 move out of Qambar-Shahdadkot's Warah to escape floodwater ravages",Several other towns and hundreds of villages in Qambar-Shahdadkot district vulnerable.,"LARKANA: Over 50,000 marooned souls had to start leaving Warah town of Qambar-Shahdadkot district moments after the deputy com­missioner on Saturday evening warned the entire population of an imminent threat of heaviest flooding ever to hit their already inundated houses and other structures, besides farmlands, any time.
The district, like other parts of Sindh, had witnessed unprecedented rains and flooding last month that had caused widespread destruction. The situation had constantly been turning grave with each passing day over the last couple of weeks. 
However, breaches in the dykes of FP Bund and Ghar Drain aggravated flooding as deluges brought all kinds of structures under several-feet-high water in the localities lying in depression. The rainwater has surrounded the entire town.
An education officer hailing from the town told Dawn that roughly over 90pc population had moved out of the town but those staying on had their lanes on highlands. 

Several other towns and hundreds of villages in Qambar-Shahdadkot district vulnerable

The fear-stricken people were finding it difficult to choose a safe route after leaving the town but most of its link roads have either been battered or they are flooded.
Gaji Khuhawar town
Gaji Khuhawar, a main town of the district with the population of about 10,000, was submerged when deluges gushing from breached Suprio Bund and Naseer Shakh (irrigation channel) in its western side hit it. The town’s roads leading to Warah and Mehar were flooded leaving only one route, Nasirabad road, for them open to move to some safe place, sources said. 
Transport operators were charging exorbitantly high fares from people in distress. 
Many panicked migrant families were using boats to get out of their flooded localities leaving all their belongings behind, the sources added. 
The rescue and relief operation by the army was under way and ration was being distributed among the displaced families daily. 
Shahdadkot 
Flood water coming from Garhi Khairo posed a threat to Sahdadkot. In order to save it, three cuts were given to the dykes of Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) to allow flows in the drain. 
Water flows towards ‘zero point’ of FP Bund and then towards Hamal Lake before travelling to the west to enter Manchar Lake through the Main Nara Valley (MNV) Drain. 
The floodwater has already encircled Qubo Saeed Khan town after entering into basic health unit, police station and certain localities in the depression. Cuts given a couple of days back to Qambar-Shahdadkot road near Selra had become inevitable after deluges coming from Balochistan and breaches in seem nullahs (saline drains) posed a threat to certain other areas of the town.
On Sunday, an 80-foot-wide breach had occurred in the Shahdadkot drain near village Gaman Faqeer Khoso. There were reports that Karam Ali Gopang village was submerged and gushing water was posing a threat to Mirokhan town. Local people were making efforts on their own to plug the breach but the irrigation staff concerned could not turn up to join them.

NAUKOT: For the last eight days, workers were engaged in a tricky rather laborious job to put sandbags and erect a fence that holds on sacks for plugging breaches in a waterway, called Puran Dhoro in Badin district of lower Sindh region — battered by monsoon rains.
The divers were creating a fence-like structure made of bamboos in a wet bed of the drain where breach had occurred. This is tied with rope tightly and sacks then placed gradually underwater to build an artificial bund to stop water.
Bamboo woods of varying sizes is obtained from eucalyptus trees. Each length of wood is sharpened at one end before being used. Sanghar is home of these divers who mostly plug breaches because of their specialisation.
“Divers had erected bamboo one by one inside the bed by diving into water at the breach point. This is the most difficult part of the whole exercise when they start to create a fence in a curvy manner. A straight fence doesn’t bear pressure of water in case of any breach,” said an irrigation officer Shoaib Sughrio explaining dynamics of exercise at site of Puran Dhoro. Plugging work in two breaches at the Puran was under way near Badin district since last Saturday.
“achay, achay [c’mon, c’mon],” yelled the charged workers while putting a huge size bamboo at one of two breaches to be fully plugged. Sacks eventually attain height between two ends of the breach’s point.
Bags were filled with soil from nearby dry land and carried on boats from a point Puran Dhoro and spinal drain of LBOD (Left Bank Outfall Drain) merge at RD-297 that also marks zero point of Puran, an old natural waterway.
Both breaches in Puran were big in size, one at RD-8 and other at RD-7. Breach at RD-8 had been plugged, while that of RD-7 was 80 per cent closed. “It is 40pc closed from each side. The central path is a bit difficult and consuming time,” said one official at site.
Divers were endeavouring to finish work. “In fact, depth of water at RD-7 [breach site] was huge and bamboos of that size were arranged after great difficulty. Rest of work will be finished now as soon as possible,” said another officer.
Puran Dhoro was part of larger LBOD system that takes saline water to sea in coastal Badin district. Puran Dhoro outfalls in LBOD’s spinal drain at RD-297. The drain’s nomenclature is equated with spinal cord in human’s body given the burden of the entire quantum of drainage it carries right up to sea. Spinal drain cumulatively has 818 RDs (reduced distance).
Having designed discharge capacity of 4,600 cusecs, LBOD system receives flows from Benazirabad, Sanghar, Mirpurkhas, Badin and some portion of Naushahro Feroze during rains.
“LBOD is having a flow of 12,000 cusecs,” CM Sindh Murad Shah said at a press briefing lately.
Aug 27 evening witnessed two breaches in Puran. According to Dr Fehmida Mirza, breaches led to inundation of villages’ lands in her lower house constituency in Badin. She has been questioning LBOD’s functioning from day one due to its design. 
“It has always spelt disaster for people of my district, be it cyclone or heavy rains. “I raised the matter [re-designing of LBOD] in the national assembly,” she said.
She refused to believe Aug 27 breaches were natural. “Both were cuts,” she insisted. “The cuts were given to provide relief to constituency of Mir Munawar Talpur, MNA and brother-in-law of PPP co-chairman [Asif Ali Zardari], in Mirpurkhas,” she said. She added her son and the Sindh Assembly member from the same area, Hasnain Mirza, was there with villagers for strengthening Puran’s bund. “Later, some people cut in drain’s bank”, she alleged.
Ever since heavy rains in August, Jhuddo-Naukot bridge remained closed for traffic. Water flows had been overtopping the said bridge which crosses over RD-305 of spinal drain. Drainage officials note gauges of LBOD system to measure rising level/declining trend of water at multiple points, RD-728, RD-468, RD-305, RD-295 and RD-245.
According to Irrigation Development Region-II Chief Engineer Zarif Khero, RD-728 reflects levels of flows entering the drain in Nawabshah and part of Naushahro Feroze. “This gauge, on Thursday, reflects 0.7ft drop in pre and post-breach levels,” he said. Other gauges like RD-245, RD-295 and RD-305 of spinal drain have shown marked decline in flows. Pre-breach gauge at RD-305 Roshanabad (Naukot-Jhuddo bridge) was 18.65ft which dropped to 16.35ft, Zarif said. 
“RD-295 with pre breach level of 20.10ft plummeted to 17.55ft which means a substantial drop of 2.3ft in level there,” he added.
But, Zarif explained, 2.3ft reduction also includes 0.7ft reduction in LBOD components of Nawabshah and Sanghar. It means reduction in spinal drain is 1.6ft which is attributable to flows in two breaches. 
“Once breaches are plugged, a rise of 1ft to 1.5ft is likely, but within tested gauges,” he said. 
He said the irrigation department provided machinery and other breach plugging material for protection of infrastructure which is likely to be it by water from breaches.
Similarly, a 1.85ft drop was recorded at RD-245 when compared with pre and post breach levels of 18.55ft and 16.7ft respectively. “Breach at RD-8 was not smaller. It was also big, but smaller than RD-7, which is closed. The breach at RD-7 has been plugged by 50pc,” claimed Zarif Khero.
Growers in Badin like Ramzan Kaloi and Pir Bux Hashmani, concurred with Dr Mirza. “Cuts were given in Puran’s bund to offload spinal drain whose flows had been building pressure in Jhuddo, Tando Jan Mohammad and other areas,” they said. 
Kaloi said he even got hold of man who gave this cut while villagers were strengthening vulnerable points of Puran. 
“Our crops lost and areas inundated,” he said.
CE Zarif had sent a letter to commissioners of three divisions besides PDMA (Provincial Disaster Management Authority) Sindh on Aug 24, asserting that people living within or along the banks of historic waterways shall be instructed to leave as an appropriate location of incised channels of Dhoro Pura was being considered for intentional relief cut for discharging excess floodwaters into Indus delta creeks.
His communication argued that area with sparse population would be considered on priority. 
“Owing to continuous rise of gauges, the banks of 132 miles spinal drain have become vulnerable and system has become susceptible to breach at any stage, God forbid!,” letter read.
Ever since it was built by Wapda in 90s, LBOD has been spelling disaster in its catchment, especially Badin. It was handed over to Sindh government in 2002. During 2011, late monsoon rains in Sept caused breaches, apparently due to deferred maintenance in the drain which had ravaged villages and standing crops in fields.
Now, multi-billion-rupee works were to be executed to address all design related defects in LBOD system, including construction of underpasses at four locations RD-275, RD-251, RD-239 and RD210+800. An amount of over Rs8bn were to be spent on these works by irrigation department, according to Khero.
