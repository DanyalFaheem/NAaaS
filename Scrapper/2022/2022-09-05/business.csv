0,Tough times ahead,"During the 2010 floods, immediate foreign aid and grants did not even cover 10-15pc of the estimated economic loss of $9.7bn so it","While it is too early to estimate the post-flood job losses, Pakistan’s GDP growth this year may fall to just 2 per cent against the initial target of 5pc, according to the Ministry of Finance. As a rule of thumb 1 percentage point loss in GDP growth in Pakistan results in one million job losses.
This means that during the current fiscal year ending in June 2023, the number of jobless people in Pakistan will rise by an additional 3m. All owing to the deluge 2022 that has killed around 1,200 people and has affected more people and farmlands than the 2010 super floods.
Inflation in August has already hit a 49-year high primarily due to the higher cost of fuel and electricity. It may rise even higher as the country begins to fix flood-related losses to the economy. Tough times ahead!
According to initial estimates by the government, the 2022 monsoon floods have caused at least $11 billion in losses to the economy. This is why the government is considering requesting the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to offer a free-of-conditions loan facility just like the one it had offered in 2020 to mitigate the economic fallout of Covid-19.

During the 2010 floods, immediate foreign aid and grants did not even cover 10-15pc of the estimated economic loss of $9.7bn so it is unlikely that Pakistan will have the required $11bn flowing in any time soon

In the best case, the government will get one or two billion dollars from the IMF as flood-relief financing in addition to the ongoing Extended Fund Facility of which $3bn more are scheduled to come. And, it will also get some funding from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other International Financial Institutions (IFIs).
Will the total amount thus arranged within this fiscal year equal $11bn? Seems too difficult. Will the flood-related foreign aid and grants be sizable enough that when it is combined with the post-flood borrowings from IFIs we get a total of $11bn? This, too, seems too difficult based on the experience of the 2010 super floods. During the 2010 floods, immediate foreign aid and grants had not even covered 10-15pc of the estimated economic loss of $9.7bn.
So far, the United Nations has flashed an appeal for $160m in emergency funding and the World Bank is working with the federal government to arrange $300m immediately.
This means that the external sector would remain under pressure during this fiscal year and the current account deficit at the end of the year would be much larger than the pre-flood estimate.
A larger than anticipated current account deficit will, in turn, keep the rupee under pressure bringing in imported inflation and causing consumer inflation to spike amidst a slowing down economy. It is not too difficult to imagine how it will erode the real income of ordinary Pakistanis and what would happen to the people who are already out of jobs or would shortly lose jobs as the floods start taking their toll on the economy.
The government estimates show that the floods would slow down the growth of the agriculture sector to just 1.8pc against the pre-flood estimate of 3.9pc. Post-flood estimate of growth in the livestock sector is just 2pc against the pre-flood estimate of 3.7pc. This will not only necessitate more food imports thus adding pressure on the exchange rate and imported inflation but will also cause higher food inflation due to reduced supplies of domestic food items.

The number of jobless people in Pakistan may rise by an additional 3 million by June 2023 because of the floods

Post-flood disruptions in food supply chains will aggravate shortages of cereals, meat and milk due to damaged crops and lost livestock, keeping food inflation high. The government’s post-flood estimates show that overall inflation may remain as high as 26pc during this fiscal year against the State Bank of Pakistan’s initial estimate of 18pc-20pc. It can be safely assumed that food inflation would remain even higher— somewhere around 30pc if not throughout this fiscal year at least during the next few months.
Already, in August this year annualised consumer inflation shot up to 27.3pc against 8.4pc in August last year. Food inflation readings for August 2022 were more disturbing — 28.8pc in urban areas and 30.2pc in rural areas. In August 2021 annualised food inflation stood at 10.2pc in urban areas and 9.1pc in rural areas.
At a time of such high food inflation rates, the government needs to focus specifically on the agriculture and livestock sector. The earlier the losses of agricultural and livestock sectors are compensated, and the people associated with them provided financial support, the better it would be for containing food inflation and minimising rural job losses.
The central bank has assigned a target of Rs1.8 trillion to banks for agricultural lending against the last year’s actual lending of Rs1.419tr. But setting a higher lending target is not enough.
The government and the SBP need to ensure that the farmlands damaged by the floods are reclaimed, farmers start recultivating major and minor crops as soon as possible — and livestock owners find enough resources and expertise to accelerate the breeding of cattle heads. Whereas the floods have damaged/affected major food crops like rice, sugarcane and maize and wheat, they have washed away minor crops like onion and tomatoes besides killing an estimated 800,000 cattle heads.
The government and the State Bank are working jointly on a few schemes for the rehabilitation of agriculture and livestock that are expected to be announced shortly. But the government has little fiscal room available for cost-sharing in concessional finance schemes. It is time for banks to perform their national duty and participate in those schemes wholeheartedly even at the cost of foregoing part of their normal profits.

1,Fearing for the Rabi season,"With seeds swept away and agricultural machinery submerged or lost in water, next season’s sowing is a daunting task","

With a maddening monsoon producing torrential rains and triggering floods across the country, sweeping away hundreds of thousands of acres of standing Kharif crops and raising fears about the possibility of the Rabi season, farmers and food security planners are a worrying lot.
The metrological pundits have calculated the disaster that fell from the sky and claim that it rained 287 per cent more than what is considered to be normal: 375 millimetres against the last 30-year average of 130 millimetres. It caused massive flash floods, running down from hills and sweeping everything away on their way to water streams.
After wreaking disaster on their route, these torrents hit main streams, added to their fury and broke their banks before joining rivers. The rivers, brimming to the brinks already, could not take this extra pressure and spread water to thousands of acres along their banks, and beyond. In the end, it turned out to be a national catastrophe, which lacked parallel in the recent history of the country.
The National Disaster Management Authority, along with its provincial arms, is counting the loss. So far, the death toll has climbed to 1,200 and is still counting. Over 33 million people are displaced, and half of them are children.

With seeds swept away and agricultural machinery submerged or lost in water, next season’s sowing is a daunting task

Around one million livestock has been swept away. All crops including cotton, sugarcane, fodder and vegetables have suffered varying losses. In Punjab alone, where only six districts came under pressure, 1.31m acres have been hit. Out of them, 744,998 acres had all kinds of standing crops. Two districts (DG Khan and Rajanpur)that fall on the foothills of Kohe (mountain) Suleman have experienced destruction, sharing 70pc of crop and agriculture losses done to the province.
However, beyond these damages already done, the experts now fear more during the next phase of this trail of destruction. Iqrar A Khan, the vice-chancellor of Agriculture University (Faisalabad), thinks that floods have also taken away seeds. “I am really worried about the next Rabi season. How would farmers sow wheat 10 weeks down the line?
“Can they afford to buy Rs6,000 per maund certified seed from the market, even when, and if, available in the required quantity to meet national demand? We can, and are, counting the damages, but we also need to plan for next season. After wheat, vegetable seeds have also been lost, making the next sowing impossible.
“These vegetables have already seen their prices multiplying and creating chaos in the market. Can we live another six months or so with the high vegetable price? If not, we need a plan right now,” Dr Iqrar demands.
A visit to these areas reveals the multiplication and extent of damages. “It may take a month or more to clear water in Punjab. In Sindh, it would take much longer because of topography. Floods always bring heavy deposits of silt with them. This year, it was heavier because of the water velocity with which it hit plains. It has flattened everything. No one now knows where his field exactly starts and ends.
“Soon we may see revenue officials summoned even for basic demarcation of acres. This is the kind of confusion that floods have left behind,” says Muhammad Abid, who works for a non-governmental organisation involved in the rehabilitation effort.
That is what we are seeing where water has just started receding. Let us see what emerges from under the water once it completely drains out. But my fears are much stronger for Sindh where, due to the absence of a drainage system, evaporation and seepage are the only options, he says.

Last year, Pakistan’s cotton imports went up by 32pc, costing the country over a billion dollars — it may be much higher this year as the cost of flood rolls out

“Wheat fears are for the future but cotton damages are already done. In Punjab, cotton has suffered more than any other crop,” explains Irshad Rao from Rajanpur areas, one of the worst hit districts in Punjab. As per some provincial estimates, the crop may suffer up to 20pc losses. In Sindh, the figure is 30-40pc.
Pakistan had fixed a target of 1.1m bales. Take 30-40pc off and it may come down to about 7.5m bales. In Punjab, officials think that floods may cost 500,000 to 600,000 bales but the farmers’ calculations are much higher.
“Last year, Pakistan’s cotton imports went up by 32pc, costing the country over a billion dollars. It may be much higher this year as the cost of flood rolls out,” he feared.
Beyond the standing crops, the implementation loss, which no one has calculated so far, would be equally damaging in near future, says Muhammad Naeem, a farmer from DG Khan. From tractors to harvesters, everything has remained in the water for weeks, if not swept away. All these machine implements now need a major overhaul if they are not to be completely lost. Most of the hand implements (shovels, spades, hoes and trowels) have been lost to water.
Now imagine the land preparation process that farmers would be carrying out a few weeks down the line being done without the basic tool. Where would the money come from for repair and purchase when standing crops have been destroyed and the farmers are denuded, both financially and of implements? This is the rural reality left behind by the floods, he explains and laments.
One loss, which farmers think may be much higher, but underreported by the disaster management organisations, is livestock. “National statistics claim that human population is 220m and animal population is 180m. Logic does not accept that if 33m humans were impacted, only 750,000 animals were affected. It does not square up,” insists Zubair Leghari, a livestock farmer from DG Khan.
“The bordering area between Balochistan and Punjab has very little agriculture with the main source of income being livestock,” he explains. “Did humans shift animals to safer places but themselves stayed along the waterways?
I don’t have counter statistics, but something certainly seems to be wrong.”
Summing up the scenario, Dr Iqrar paints the picture for the coming Rabi season: “Farmers are struggling without money, without implements, without seeds, without fertiliser and a land filled with silt to sow even basic crops like wheat. This is what the coming Rabi season looks like. The challenge is thus not only putting agriculture back on its feet but leading the revival efforts with financial and implement muscle, coffers full of inputs and farmers helped psychologically for rehabilitation. It needs an elaborate plan, prepared immediately and ready for implementation within next weeks.”

4,The sinking of the ship,The fast-paced surge in inflation and acute demand destruction show how the economic landscape will shape in upcoming months.,"Pakistan is literally and figuratively under deep water. The early estimates by the government put the direct losses to the economy from the deadly floods in the shape of the washed-away roads, bridges, rail tracks, homes, livestock, crops and so on in excess of $11 billion or close to about three per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
The exact estimates from floods that have affected at least one of every seven Pakistanis will not be available for several weeks, or it may take a few months before the damage can be assessed.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said that the recent floods caused more significant damage than the 2010 calamity. Due to the 2010 super floods, the economic growth rate had slowed by 2pc, and the financial losses were estimated at $9.7bn.
The unprecedented rains and floods, which have been ravaging most parts of the country since mid-June, have already killed more than 1,200 people, perished nearly 750,000 livestock, swept away major crops on swathes of farmlands, damaged over 6,000 kilometres of roads, razed over 1.2 million homes, and destroyed 243 bridges connecting different areas and regions of the country.

The fast-paced surge in inflation and acute demand destruction shows how the country’s economic landscape will shape over the next several months

Most deaths, as well as infrastructural and crop losses, are reported from Sindh, the worst affected province during the 2010 floods, followed by Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and south Punjab. Overall, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) situation report for September 2, at least 33m people have been affected by the floods, 14.5m in Sindh and 9.2m in Balochistan, with nearly 472,000 put up in relief camps set up by the military as well as relief agencies.
With the rain-induced calamity still moving from one place to another, its negative impacts are already starting to show up on the economy. The immediate effect of the floods can be seen in the rapid increase in the headline inflation in August when the consumer price index (CPI) spiked to the 47-year high of 27.3pc, the third fastest increase in the prices of consumer goods and services since April 1975, and the fifth fastest since October 1973.
The August prices don’t even capture fully the impact on food or non-food inflation resulting from the recent floods. No wonder analysts are projecting a sharper rise in food inflation going forward because of the destruction of food crops, especially tomatoes in Sindh and onions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and disruptions in the supply chain due to flooded or damaged roads.
The historical inflation data confirms that the CPI index has increased by more than 13pc in the last three months as energy subsidies are revoked and taxes and levies imposed on fuels.
A brokerage firm recently said in a note that an increase of this scale in the inflation index is usually seen in a period spanning over 12 to 18 months. No wonder analysts are of the opinion that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) will have to revise their earlier average annual pre-flood inflation projections for the current fiscal year from 19.9pc and 18-20pc to, maybe, 22-24pc once the actual economic impact of the devastation is fully factored into their fresh assessments. The Ministry of Finance has estimated that the inflation rate may soar to 26pc compared to the budget target of 11.5pc.
While the immediate victims of the devastation induced by weeks of flooding are poorer, rural populations, the massive destruction of industrial and food crops and livelihoods of millions of people are causing massive demand destruction across the country, including the parts that remain unaffected by the flood waters.
Consequently, we see carmakers, tractor manufacturers and steel producers cut down their production temporarily amid a fast build-up of inventories and a sharp reduction in demand. The fast-paced surge in inflation and acute demand destruction shows how the country’s economic landscape will shape over the next several months.
The impact of the floods will not remain confined to agriculture, large-scale industry and inflation. It will soon spread to the other segments of the economy, including textile and rice exports. The construction industry has also slowed down due to the dip in demand due to torrential rains and floods.
Most analysts agree that the crop losses and the impact of the food-related demand destruction on the large-scale industry will further slow down the economy, scaling down the budgeted GDP target of 5pc and the IMF projection of 3.5 per cent for the current year to just around 2pc. The SBP, in its last monetary policy statement, flagged heavy rainfall as a threat to the economy, given its impact on the agriculture sector.
The government ministers say it might take five years to rebuild the damaged infrastructure and rehabilitate the affected populations, with acute food shortages to remain its primary concern in the near term.
Analysts argue that funding and reconstruction will be a challenge for the cash-strapped government, which is forced to cut its spending under its loan deal with the IMF, which has just released $1.17bn in assistance to shore up the central bank’s liquid foreign currency reserves.
“The timing of the floods could not have been worse as Pakistan has already been facing a challenging time, trying to avoid a default and manage soaring inflation,” analysts at a brokerage firm write in their flash note on floods.

5,The rise of Sukuk,"The Sharia-complaint instrument is an effective tool for financing sovereign needs 
cost effectively.","

—RA

 
According to the Fitch Rating Dubai data, the global Sukuk issuances surged by 36.1 per cent in 2021 to $252.3 billion from $ 174.64bn in 2020. The growth momentum has continued despite Covid-19 and economic challenges.
The main players in the Sukuk market are central banks, governments and multilateral institutions. It is interesting to note that Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey and Pakistan accounted for $230.2bn (91pc) of total Sukuk deals and have emerged as leading players in developing Islamic capital market instruments.
According to the data reported by the International Islamic Financial Market Sukuk report 2021, over 11,000 Sukuk have been issued globally, amounting to $1.42 trillion by 36 countries. The Sukuk issuance from Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia lead in the Muslim world, while western players like the USA, UK, Japan, Germany, Singapore and France have occasionally entered the market to tap sharia-based investors.
Sukuk are normally defined as certificates of ownership (or shares) of a business, real asset or service that confines to Islamic commercial law and are a convenient sharia-compliant way for generating liquidity for entities, project financing and government funding needs. Sukuk are highly suited for and widely used by governments to generate local and international funding under a sharia-compliant mechanism while avoiding interest. Sukuk are redeemable at maturity; however, they can be traded in the secondary market in the case of tradeable Sukuk.

The Sharia-complaint instrument is an effective tool for financing sovereign needs cost effectively

The government of Pakistan first entered the global Sukuk market in 2005 with the issuance of $600 million Sukuk, while the domestic Sukuk programme was launched in 2008. According to the State Bank of Pakistan data, till June 2022, the government has successfully issued Ijarah Sukuk amounting to Rs3.25tr in the domestic market.
In 2020, the Ministry of Finance aggressively revived the Sukuk programme after almost three years. As a result, from April 2020 to June 2022, the government issued Ijarah Sukuk of more than Rs2.315tr (approximately $13bn) in the domestic market. These issuances not only helped the government reduce its borrowing cost compared to conventional instruments but also helped develop Sharia-compliant avenues for the government in the domestic Islamic capital market.
In January 2022, the government of Pakistan again entered the international market with the issuance of $1bn Pakistan International Sukuk, the purpose of which is to generate dollar funding from international avenues. With this issuance, the total global Sukuk issuance from Pakistan reached $4.6bn to date. This also shows the potential of Sukuk for raising dollars to meet the sovereign funding needs on Sharia-compliant principles.
The outlook for the domestic Sukuk market is very positive. The government is looking to increase the share of Sukuk in the market under the existing Ijarah Sukuk programme of around Rs1.5tr in the medium term. It is also exploring new concepts like asset-light structure, green Sukuk and sustainable Sukuk to increase the share of Sharia-compliant instruments in government securities by the end of 2022-23.
The successful issuance of Pakistan Energy Sukuk-II of Rs200bn has been the largest Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) security that was issued via book-building. Currently, Rs470bn worth of Sukuk (government and non-government) are listed on PSX.
In addition to institutional investors, the general public, pension funds and corporates can also invest in Sukuk with the help of the Investors’ Portfolio Securities Account managed by scheduled banks/dealers or the Central Depository Company on behalf of their customers.
The benefits of Sukuk are immense, both for the issuer and the investor. They provide a convenient source of large amounts of financing, generating much-needed liquidity for institutions, especially governments, that hold large amounts of illiquid assets.
Another benefit is their Sharia-compliant nature which provides an attractive avenue for investments by Sharia-compliant institutions and taps investors with Islamic preferences for investing since riba avoidance is often a major concern of many investors in Pakistan.
Sukuk can tap a broader market than conventional bonds, as it also includes investors with a Sharia compliance mandate, resulting in heavily over-subscribed government Sukuk issues in Pakistan. Also, being backed by assets and providing a fixed income stream, they are a less risky investment avenue than the equity market.
Due to the high demand for Sukuk owing to excess liquidity with Islamic financial institutions, they are more cost-effective for the government as compared to conventional t-bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds. Moreover, government Sukuk are a better investment avenue for Islamic finance institutions, which have been facing a shortage of high-quality investment avenues.
Sukuk, being asset-backed, can contribute directly towards the generation and growth of real economic activity if they are issued for developing new infrastructure projects like dams, solar parks, green energy initiatives, hospitals, motorways etc. They are also more secure as compared to conventional bonds. Moreover, the sale of assets can meet investor cashflows, which reduces default risk.
Fresh Sukuk issuances can contribute to the documentation of the economy as more investors are attracted to its Sharia-compliant nature. Therefore, a larger portion of government financing needs must be met with the regular issuance of Sukuk.
Sukuk can also attract financing for infrastructure development projects and can be targeted toward the retail segment to develop Islamic capital markets and contribute to financial inclusion. In addition, green Sukuk and Sustainable Development Goals-linked Sukuk need to be explored, which will help to promote sustainable economic growth.

6,Prioritise small dams,"Mini dams conserve rainwater, reduce poverty and are affordable compared to mega projects","The current climate-induced devastating torrential monsoon rains and floods have taken a heavy toll on human lives, destroyed property, roads, bridges, schools, health units and submerged farmland and villages under water resulting in huge crops and livestock losses.
With farm-to-market roads and highways damaged and the transport system disrupted, and millions of farmers in extreme distress, the calamity has further fueled inflation and enhanced food insecurity.
Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif said on August 30 that torrential rains and floods have submerged one-third of Pakistan and 33 million people have been affected.
The loss of farm output and livestock may lead to lower exports, higher imports, widening current account deficit and slower economic growth. The rural areas provide a big market for industrial goods while agriculture provides raw materials for the export-oriented manufacturing sector.

Mini dams conserve rainwater, reduce poverty and are affordable compared to mega projects

First of all, the situation demands that both the federal and provincial governments should rescue affected people, provide relief and rehabilitate flood victims. This has to be followed up by repairs to the damaged infrastructure.
While making an appeal to the international community for donations, Prime Minister Sharif said it would cost at least $10 billion to repair damaged infrastructure and provide aid to those affected by rains and floods. Referring to global climate changes, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Pakistan Julian Harneis reminded donors that the devastation is ‘internationally-driven.’
Taking a medium- and long-term view, there are many preventive measures to avoid the impact of floods such as the use of early preventive warning devices, restoring rivers, cleaning drainage, erecting flood barriers etc. But no less importance should be accorded to the construction of a network of small, mini dams in the country’s rain-fed areas.
There is a lot of official focus on building mega-dams without any meaningful progress because of multiple problems including financing. Of course, the need for large dams for sustainable agriculture cannot be denied.
On the other hand, small dams could be erected with domestic resources and local talents and skills at a fractional cost of large ones and at a faster pace to conserve rain and flood waters for irrigation, electricity generation and supply of drinking water.
The construction of small dams has never been a priority of successive governments though the country has the required expertise in building dams.
Small storage dams can play a key role in promoting agriculture, placing the maximum area under cultivation, and bringing in a ‘green revolution’ within a short span of time, said a study carried out a decade and a half ago. Small dams also have a positive impact on groundwater development.
In fact, small dams are considered more suitable for Pakistan by experts as they are stated to have proven an effective tool for poverty alleviation. They bring immediate economic prosperity at a local level.
Way back in May 2008, a National Engineering Services Pakistan expert quoted a credible study which had then estimated that Pakistan had the potential to build some 750 small dams to meet the water requirements of the growing local and regional population. At that time the country reportedly had merely 56 dams, against 12,000 in Sri Lanka, more than 2,000 in Nepal and 19,134 in India.
Various studies conducted in 2019 in the Pothwar Plateau, Punjab, established that around 11,000m cubic of water is lost annually due to surface run-off in rain-fed areas. If 50 per cent of this run-off is conserved in small or mini-dams, then half the water-storage capacity of Tarbela Dam (the largest one in Pakistan) could be retained. By 2017, 50 small dams had been built and another eight were under construction in the region.
Unfortunately, issues are allowed to linger on to become big problems, finally turning into serious crises. And most of the time the governments are trapped in firefighting and have little time and resources to spare for long-term solutions. This is what is happening now in the aftermath of climate change. that includes the floods of 2010.
Although no creditable figure for the total number of small dams is immediately available, one can see the pace of progress in this sector through recent official announcements and media reports.
Provincial Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Soro informed the Sindh Assembly on August 3 that 116 small dams have been constructed in the province and work is going on another 64 small dams, which are due to be completed by next year.
On February 6, Punjab Small Dams Organisation approved the construction of nine new dams in the Rawalpindi Division and Islamabad. A sum of Rs24.87m was allocated for topographic surveys for these dams.
PTI Chairman Imran Khan announced on August 26 that 10 more dams would be built in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to avoid recurring devastations such as caused by the ongoing super deluge in the province.
Earlier KP Minister for Irrigation Arshad Ayub Khan had said construction work had been initiated on seven small irrigation dams and water reservoirs in the newly merged districts in the province. These dams, estimated to cost Rs9bn, would irrigate 14,135 acres of barren land.
Some 25 small dams were stated to have been completed in different areas in KP to store flood and rainwater during monsoon for irrigation and drinking purposes by July 2019, nine of them from 2002 to 2019.
Baluchistan had built 64 small dams in rain-fed areas by March 31 under a phased federal programme of 100 small dams that are expected to be completed by 2026, according to provincial authorities. The 64 dams irrigate 25,850 acres of land.
Given the current state of governance and service delivery, both the federal and provincial governments need to ensure that small dams are constructed as scheduled without delays. And planning should also be initiated to realise the country’s full potential for the construction of mini and small dams on a priority basis to store rainwater, improve people’s livelihoods and avoid a catastrophe on a scale being witnessed now.

Real GDP growth | Source: IMF

 
Since 1959, Pakistan has approached the IMF 22 times, according to data from the Fund’s website. There are few years in Pakistan’s history during which it was not under the IMF’s scrutiny. In most years, there is a jump in GDP growth rate soon after it has graduated from the Fund’s programme as the government is free from the strings and shackles to pump money into the economy. Money that it does not have and thus necessitate a bailout as the boom and bust cycles continue, sharper and steeper each time.
As Pakistan confronts its worst ever climatic disaster amidst the dizzy political circus while the world faces the fallout of the most significant war since 1945, the roller coaster ride will be steeper downhill without any expectations of a positive upswing. While Miftah Ismail predicts an early end of his tenure, the government promises the sun, moon and stars to generate revenue and plug losses in the hopes of the Fund’s largess. Politically expensive promises that it will renege on at the first opportunity to jump back on the GDP roller coaster.

8,Ad-hoc efforts across the board,Higher-ups in the government seem too absorbed in damage control to gather stakeholders for evolving a viable strategy owned by,"


 
There might not be a clearly spelt-out strategy to deal with the floods-induced challenges in Pakistan beyond donation appeals to finance the rescue and relief efforts for the marooned millions. The government is said to be actively pondering many proposals to mitigate risks and emerge stronger from the current crisis.
To ensure food security, the government has decided to build up wheat reserves by ordering additional imports, removing duty on certain edibles and floating the idea of vegetable imports from India. However, the idea of reopening the trade with India conflicted with the current foreign policy stance towards the eastern neighbour. “The idea was shot down before it grew wings”, a proponent of the proposal, unhappy with the politicisation of the issue, shared privately.
The government wished to ensure the early repair and rehabilitation of power and the internet infrastructure across the country to limit interruptions in electricity and communication networks. Power minister Khurram Dastgir Khan when quizzed on the policy to deal with the current disaster said, “I have been away from the capital ensuring electricity-infrastructure rehabilitation in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, so not yet briefed on the broader strategy.
“The government has successfully rehabilitated electricity infrastructure across the country, except for some districts in Balochistan where flash floods have toppled transmission poles and pylons. We expect to restore them in the coming week,” he wrote back, responding to a set of queries.

Higher-ups in the government seem too absorbed in damage control to gather stakeholders for evolving a viable strategy owned by all segments

The possibility of engaging the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to soften conditions has also been weighed at the highest level. Finance Minister Miftah Ismail, in his talk at the Institute of Business Administration last week, hinted at clinching a softer deal with the IMF as he said donors well understand the growing post-flood situation and the distress it caused for the masses.
Taking cue from global climate change activists, the government is developing a case to demand Western nations with a deeper carbon footprint to share the cost of the fallout of climate change in Pakistan.
Planning Minister Ehsan Iqbal hammered the point when he reportedly said in a press conference: “Our carbon footprint is the lowest in the world, but Pakistan is among the ten most vulnerable nations. The international community has a responsibility to help us upgrade our infrastructure and make it more climate resilient so that we don’t repeatedly endure the current magnitude of loss.”
Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif is said to be cognizant of the fact that the situation can turn uglier any day. He wanted to take all stakeholders across the political divide, civil society representatives, corporate sector leaders and social activists on board to pool the best talent and maximum resources for dealing with the massive crisis. However, an insider in Islamabad told this scribe that the hostile stance of the opposition parties, particularly the PTI, made it hard for the prime minister to sell the idea to coalition partners and members of his team.
Some members of the kitchen cabinet thought all efforts should be directed towards relief. “It’s not worth investing time and energy in forcing everyone to sit around a table when no one expects much from the exercise. The idea has not been dismissed but deferred for the time being,” a senior leader of the ruling coalition said.
The response was weak on the question of why the National Disaster Management Agency is in the background when it is vested with the mandate to spearhead relief operations in emergencies. The agency’s hierarchy was approached, but they did not get back till the filing of the report. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sharif has announced plans to create a National Flood Response and Coordination centre for bringing together all line ministries and sub-national tiers of the government for what he terms ‘a more comprehensive response’.
Pakistan is still calculating the scale of damages during the worst ever flash floods that submerged three fourth of the country and unleashed an unprecedented humanitarian crisis at a time when the country is already struggling economically and the political situation is anything but stable.
Besides the loss of precious lives, the early estimates put the devastation cost, including infrastructure, housing, and agriculture, in the vicinity of $11 billion or Rs2.4 trillion (calculated at the exchange rate f Rs220). “Families ravaged by the catastrophe need immediate relief for survival and sustainability. This is our first and foremost priority at the moment,” said a leader of the ruling coalition.
“The government has diverted development funds for flood relief. Philanthropic outfits are active in certain pockets, donations are pouring in, but the challenge, everyone agrees, is too humungous and needs a well-crafted scientific strategy to cut losses and rehabilitate people and infrastructure,” he added.
A business leader said the government had not approached them to discuss the revival strategy. “Like other concerned citizens, business community members are doing all within their means to help those in need directly or through outfits they trust. Unfortunately, higher-ups in the government seem too absorbed in damage control to gather stakeholders for brainstorming and evolving a viable strategy owned up by all segments.”

9,A hefty injustice,Pakistan may receive aid but it will not receive compensation from those most responsible for climate change,"While the large-scale devastating floods in Pakistan have questioned the country’s ability to deal with natural disasters, the authorities cite climate change as the worst-case scenario. While Pakistan’s role in increasing the global temperature is minimal, countries like Pakistan are paying the price for the environmental pollution created by the big countries.
To what extent is the government’s statement about the impact of climate change on the severity of floods true? And to what extent does a lack of planning contribute to flood prevention and the enormous devastation that ensued? Again, experts have different opinions about this.
According to some experts, three factors indicate the intervention of climate change or global temperature in the current situation of Pakistan. These include the increase in extreme heat in the country, melting of glaciers, and manifold increase in rainfall. Experts have reported that the average rainfall has increased by 400 per cent in areas like Baluchistan and Sindh, causing severe flooding and at least 20 dams breaking due to the rapid flow of water.
An increase in the heat intensity was also observed along with rain. According to the Meteorological Department, the continuous temperature in Pakistan remained above 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit). Scorching temperatures of over 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit) were recorded in Jacobabad and Dadu.

Pakistan may receive aid but it will not receive compensation from those most responsible for climate change

Over three million people have been affected by rising river levels in Pakistan over the last three months of rains, over a thousand people, including 300 children, have died, and millions have been displaced. Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal has said that damages amount to $10 billion according to preliminary estimates. Surveys have been started in areas where water has passed, while many regions remain flooded.
According to some experts, owing to the melting of glaciers due to extreme heat and the speed of water flowing from the Himalayan mountains, Pakistan may also be at risk of a dangerous glacial leakage burst flood.
According to a report by the AFP news agency, Pakistan’s share in the emission of toxic gases globally is less than 1pc. Still, on the Global Climate Risk Index of the German Watch, Pakistan is continuously included in the ten countries affected by climate change and considered highly insecure.
In 2007, during an invited lecture, “Climate Change and Economic Development,” organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), John Gowdy, Professor of Economics and Professor of Science and Technology, said that climate change adaptation will depend critically on cooperation among countries, regions and individuals.
The effects of climate change will be felt first and foremost at the household level. In Pakistan, meeting this challenge will require various policy approaches, including technological innovation, empowering local communities with the tools and information they need to adapt, and setting up a mechanism to relieve the effects of climate change.
The UN Secretary-General António Guterres made a video appeal for aid to Pakistan, saying: “Let’s stop sleepwalking towards the destruction of our planet by climate change.”
“The Pakistani people are facing a monsoon on steroids — the relentless impact of epochal levels of rain and flooding,” said Mr Guterres. “As we continue to see more and more extreme weather events around the world, it is outrageous that climate action is being put on the back burner as global emissions of greenhouse gases are still rising, putting all of us — everywhere — in growing danger.”
But even as Pakistan turns to donors around the world asking for aid, there is one thing that the country will almost certainly not receive: compensation from the countries — including the United States — that are most responsible for planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
Furthermore, the monsoon season has existed in South Asia since ancient times, and it is incorrect to blame nature alone for the floods. In this regard, according to a report, “Road Awakening,” compiled by the Lahore High Court after the floods in 2010, the damage caused by floods can be reduced by building dams at various places and planting forests around rivers.
In the conversation on the Twitter space in the United States, Pakistani and Indian participants, while talking about development and environmental pollution, also propose that the developing South countries of the world, ie, the Global South, should unite and reduce their ecological pollution from the Global North, ie, the developed countries.
Some experts say the climate change narrative should focus on water rather than carbon emissions because it can exacerbate floodwater problems from rising sea levels, intensifying rainfall, and melting glaciers.
According to The Washington Post, the issue has become a flash point in global climate negotiations. In the landmark 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, countries agreed to recognise and “address” the loss and damage caused by dangerous climate impacts. Last year, at the major UN climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, representatives from developing countries hoped that negotiators would finally create a formal institution to funnel cash to the countries most affected by climate disasters.
However, despite being the largest historical emitter of carbon dioxide, the United States has blocked such efforts at every turn. For example, in Glasgow, the Biden administration joined a group of countries in resisting efforts to establish payments to developing countries that have been hit hard by climate change.

15,The VC parallels for China and Pakistan,"Paypal founder Peter Thiel, the latest high-profile addition to investors, says there is hope for Pakistan.","For all the doom and gloom being spelt out regarding the future of venture capital, especially with regards to its suitability for Pakistan, the country has shown a fair bit of resilience amid a global downturn. New (and old) investors continue to back Pakistani entrepreneurs, with Peter Thiel — the founder of PayPal and Palantir Technologies — becoming the latest high-profile addition.
Overall investments into the startup ecosystem of $325 million year-to-date are still on track to at least match the 2021 total of $366m, according to Data Darbar, even if that’s on the back of deals closed earlier. Sure, the rounds might further slow down as many foreign investors reassess their allocation to both the venture capital (VC) asset class and Pakistan. But that’s not the case with William Bao Bean, the General Partner of SOSV, the fourth most active VC firm globally in Q2 as per Pitchbook, with assets under management of $1.2 billion.
In a little over two years, the fund has invested in 16 Pakistani companies. Unlike many international investors who entered the local market out of fear of missing out in 2021, Mr Bean and his fund seem to have the country as part of the broader strategy.
“We are doing Pakistan for Pakistan,” says Mr Bean in answer to whether the shaky macro risks have changed how he views the market. As someone who covered the Chinese telecom, media and technology sectors for Deutsche Bank in the 2000s, he sees many parallels between China then and Pakistan today. “When I started covering China internet in 2003, the total valuations of all the startups was $3bn. My goal was to help Jack Ma explain Alibaba, the business-to-business (B2B) marketplace, to global investors for its initial public offering. Since then, the sector’s market cap has risen to $2.5 trillion. Pakistan today is $3bn, so I am hoping for something similar,” he adds.

In 2003, the total valuation of all the startups in China was $3bn, but since then, the sector’s market cap has risen to $2.5tr — Pakistan today is at $3bn, so there is hope for a similar path

“I want to do the same thing here as I did in China: explain, to my best, the local market to people from around the world. My biggest goal here is not just to help startups get off the ground and grow but also to make sure that the global investors can understand and be comfortable writing cheques here,” Mr Bean explains.
For now, the fund is primarily looking at early-stage startups trying to solve the ‘big problems’, which essentially share one characteristic: those solving the ‘big problems’ like digitising kiryana, logistics, and insurance, among others.
Initially, the terms of the deal are pretty standard: take 5-7 per cent of common equity and invest $150,000 though the valuation can differ. Of that, $45,000 is the programme cost that the portfolio companies undergo — in the case of Pakistan, the erstwhile MOX and Chinaccelerator were recently merged into one and rebranded as Orbit Startups.
Mr Bean feels beyond the money invested, these programmes are what set SOSV apart. “Our value addition is enterprise sales and customer acquisition, and all the startups get free advertising along with a strong corporate network,” he says. The fund makes follow-on investments, though its pockets are a little tight there. “We have a follow-on fund for $20m+ Series B and onwards, which doesn’t conflict with the core fund [$277m]. We try and maintain as close to our pro rata as possible, but last year, our companies in Orbit closed $286m in follow-on funding. Meanwhile, our whole budget for follow-on in a year is $3.5m, and the pro rata on that is $15m,” says the investor.
The 16-company portfolio of Orbit in Pakistan has cumulatively raised more than $53m since the commencement of their operations, of which the five that have gone for subsequent rounds did receive follow-on funding from SOSV. Of course, the numbers are skewed by Dastgyr’s $37m — the only startup in the portfolio to have raised Series A investment while the remaining fifteen are still pre-seed or seed.
The fund has already been exposed to logistics and e-commerce (B2B kiryana and direct-to-consumer brands like HighStreet and PriceOye) and is now looking at missing sectors. “We are looking at agri, health, edtech — any company that has a high customer acquisition problem but the business makes money and can benefit from our free advertising and distribution,” says Mr Bean.

16,Exploiter or facilitator?,Arthi charge four to fi­ve times the rate of interest than formal institutions but they also provide credit on flexible terms that,"The agriculture sector contributes 19.2 per cent to GDP and provides the raw material for textile and other agro-based industries. The textile industry accounts for 60pc of the country’s export. Agriculture employed roughly 38.5pc of the workforce in 2020-21, while more than 65-70pc of people relied on it for a living.
The target amount of formal credit was ­fixed at Rs1.5 trillion for 2020-21, but only 63.6pc was disbursed during the ­fiscal year. In Pakistan, the informal credit market is strong enough to cater to small farmers’ demand through a network of fi­nanciers known as “arthis”.
To better understand the role of the arthi in the agricultural supply chain, this article attempts to examine the arthi system by mapping the network and linkages, understanding its operations and fi­nancing mechanisms such as interest rates, costs, and risk management techniques. This will help to understand why formal institutions have failed to replace the role of arthi in the agricultural supply chain. It may also help fi­nancial institutions to improve their economic model to minimise credit risk so that they can penetrate the farming credit market more efficiently to capture a significant share.
Arthi is a commission agent who facilitates buying or selling agricultural produce, including livestock, collects payments if required, and pays it to the seller. Arthi also receives a commission or a fi­xed percentage of the transaction value by way of remuneration. Usually, arthi operate in grains, fruits and vegetable markets where different players in the supply chain of each food commodity interact.

Arthi charge four to fi­ve times the rate of interest than formal institutions but they also provide credit on flexible terms that the formal sector does not

There are two primary sources of agricultural credit: informal and formal. Informal sources usually include commission agents (also called arthi), input suppliers, village shopkeepers, friends and relatives. Among these, arthi play the most dominant role and have a significant share in informal credit disbursement.
Our survey reveals that registered arthi have long-term relationships with many farmers. Many admitted that their relationship with farmers had entered the second generation. In some cases, both arthi and farmers invite each other into family gatherings and marriages, indicating that the relationship extends beyond professional to personal lives.
Our discussions with farmers and arthi lead us to conclude that services offered by arthi are not uniform but depend on the type of market, its structure, and farmer’s demand. Our investigation of food supply chains reveals that arthi provides two significant services to the farmer.
First, he gives cash/inputs on credit at the time of sowing and second, he acts as the agent of sale for the farmer to dispose of his produce. The poor ­financial situation of the farmer, long distances from organised markets and lack of understanding of post-harvest crop management practices are among the many factors that play a vital role in farmers’ decision-making process whether to sell the produce at the farm gate or bring it to the mandi to sell it through the arthi.
Selling at the farm gate is preferred by many farmers due to the shortage of labour, high cost of transportation and high commission expenses. All products that enter the mandi are immediately auctioned to avoid the risk of price fluctuation and payments are made the same day to the farmer.
Arthi provides credit or inputs to meet the liquidity gap that farmers face. Agricultural credit is considered one of the strategic resources of crops and plays a vital role in improving agricultural productivity. This implies that arthi indirectly contributes to improving farm productivity. Higher productivity raises the standard of living among rural communities. Hence, arthi plays a significant role in the process of rural development.
But the interest rates charged by the arthi show that he makes money by lending to small and medium farmers. The literature reveals that operational cost is less than 2.5pc of the total lending volume and interest rates range between 62-80pc. This implies a signifi­cant pro­fit margin exists for the arthi, 5-7pc higher than the formal lending sources.
In addition to earning from lending operations, arthi makes a 2-4pc commission depending on crop type and terms and conditions with the client.
But despite the high interest charged by the arthi, it is essential to investigate the reasons that force farmers to secure credit from non-formal over formal resources.
The availability of informal credit on flexible terms without stringent conditions or collateral requirements is no less than a blessing for poor farmers. No financial institution from the formal sector offers unsecured credit to farmers in Pakistan.
This is one of the reasons why farmers prefer to avail credit facilities from informal sources even if they must pay a high-interest rate in terms of commission on their products or in some other form.
The general perception and literature depict arthi as an exploiter in the food supply chain who abuses his power for personal gain at all costs. However, the reality is not so bad. Without any doubt, arthi charges four to fi­ve times the rate of interest than the formal institutions, but he also provides a service that the formal credit sector does not.
Moreover, perceptions about arthi among farmers are mixed. Some farmers claim that arthi are helping hands in difficult times. Still, others demonstrate that they charge a very high-interest rate while acknowledging the ­financial support extended during the crisis.

17,We agree we need more women in the workplace — now what?,"To change societal biases, women with privilege need to participate in creating law, influence organisational decision-making.","We have reached the point where most organisations agree that diversity matters, and we need a better gender balance in the workplace. This, in itself, is an achievement.
However, if we are honest, it feels a bit superficial. In Pakistan, on average, the number of female employees in an organisation is approximately 21 per cent. Out of this 21pc, the largest chunk is at entry level, with far less presence in senior management. They often earn less than their male counterparts but are still shouldering a greater part of the domestic responsibilities. Of course, there are exceptions, but these unsaid rules hold not just in Pakistan but beyond.
So what’s holding us back, and what do we do next? There is no simple or short answer, and the responsibility lies with multiple parties: organisations, women themselves and society at large.
Ambition and self-belief
It’s our right to expect organisations, the law and society to change their behaviour and biases towards us. However, we cannot expect this to alter until we make our presence felt, till we show up and participate in these organisations, in creating law, in influencing decision-making, and in pushing for change outside our homes.

To change societal biases, women with privilege need to participate in creating law, influence organisational decision-making, and push for change outside the home

The first step to ambition is the simple desire to step out. Although motherhood and homemaking are essential, they are more challenging than most jobs with fewer financial rewards. In a system where this work still falls largely upon women, it is understandable why many opt out of careers to manage this side of life.
However, if you are reading this, you are educated and have access to information — you are immensely privileged, and that privilege comes with responsibility. Unfortunately, many women in Pakistan neither have the tools nor the option to work. If these are choices available to you, then I sincerely hope you will avail these opportunities.
The most common complaint from hiring managers is that few women are applying. If we do not claim our space, it will not be given to us. If you have the option, step out, in whatever capacity you wish to but take a more active part in the functioning of this world. The world will benefit, and studies show that so will your children.
Once we make it to the workplace, we see intelligent, hardworking, creative and collaborative women, but there is an absence of thirst: the hustle you see more often in men for growth and power.
Research and data show that women are less likely to try for a promotion or apply for a job unless they think they meet 100pc of the requirements. Imposter syndrome is real, the idea that we are here by mistake, that what we have achieved is a fluke, and that we don’t deserve the recognition we are receiving.
For many of us, myself included, self-belief has been a journey, but I recall my male counterparts when I first started working who believed that they deserved to be at the top from day one. They came with that ambition, and they went with that belief in themselves.
It isn’t enough that we are in the workplace; we must also aspire to lead, be at the top, and be in a decision-making capacity because that’s where we can make a real impact. Act and confidence will follow even if the belief is not there yet. Seeing you in a position of power will inspire other women and ease their path.
Financial independence
One of the great benefits of earning is that its changes the power dynamics. Unfortunately, power is often linked to financial control. The idea isn’t that we disrespect or abandon our relationships because we have financial independence, but that decision-making should be more democratic.
When I started working, one of the arguments against women’s careers was that ‘women don’t need to work’. ‘Men support families, women work for fun’. Whereas this statement is an unfair and incorrect assumption, I do see women treating their earnings light-heartedly.
Sometimes it’s excessive generosity, selflessly supporting entire families, contributing towards family assets (without expecting a fair share of ownership) and allowing others to control their income rather than claiming a right over it.
In other instances where there is any excess income, it is spent on luxuries, be it personal or for others, but what it isn’t going towards is saving or investment.
In both scenarios, the issue is a lack of long-term thinking, a tendency to ignore the harsher realities of life, and the assumption that there are safety nets. Globally women’s ownership of property and assets is significantly lower than men’s. In Pakistan, their legal share from their husband or parents is far smaller than their male counterparts (often, this too is challenged by male heirs).
Men begin saving and investing far earlier than women. Upon or post-retirement, a man’s net worth is likely higher than his female counterpart, who may have had a similar career trajectory. If the benefit of working is financial independence, this must translate into long-term independence. If we want to see a fundamental shift in the balance of power between men and women, a change in the balance of wealth is required.
For this, we need women to make money, grow it through investments, and have greater control over production. It starts with something small like knowing that asking for a fair share or co-ownership in family assets is not petty; it is your right. If you’re stronger at the end of the day, you can be a strength to others.
Importance of support
There is considerable debate among women around affirmative action: quotas and preferences for female candidates. While some may feel that these undermine well-earned positions, it is said by those who have already established careers.
I support quotas and believe they balance historical wrongs, and the many obstacles faced getting here. Men are geared, prepared and supported on all sides for their careers. Far greater resources are dedicated to boys than to girls.
Indra Nooyi famously shared that when she told her mother she had been made CEO of Pepsi Global, her mother said she was first a mother and a wife at home.
Not many men carry the full burden of multiple roles like women, so let’s cut ourselves a little slack. If we can assist in undoing some of the institutional bias’s against us, accept it, you may not need it individually, but others might.
