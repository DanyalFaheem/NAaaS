0,"Sewage must not be discharged into DHA, CBC stormwater drains, NED report filed in SHC recommends",KARACHI: The NED University of Engineering and Technology has submitted a report in the Sindh High Court about...,"KARACHI: The NED University of Engineering and Technology has submitted a report in the Sindh High Court about evaluation of drainage infrastructure in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) stating that existing design may be inadequate if stormwater drainage system is also used for sewerage flows.
The report suggested that sewerage must be drained out separately to get maximum benefit from the existing and proposed drainage system in future.
It further said that sewer water and deposition of solid waste had reduced the capacity of stormwater drains, and warned that more inundation was possible at hotspots and overall in the areas of DHA and Cantonment Board Clifton.
When a two-judge bench headed by Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi on Thursday took up two petitions, filed about the sewerage infrastructure that caused flooding during the torrential rains in DHA and CBC in 2020, the NED University filed its report in the light of the SHC orders.
It is further recommended in the report that the major drains were clogged, due to sewage flow and solid waste, required regular cleaning and maintenance to ensure drainage of stormwater in future.
“It is also important to mention that the simulations made in this vetting study and in the design report, the amount of inundation is still underestimated because model has the assumption that drains are empty at the start of rainfall; therefore, the amount of drained water from the area could be a lot less than shown as discharge. Consequently, more inundation is possible at the hotspots and overall in the area,” it added.
The report further said that even at a 10-year return period, with no sewage flow in the existing drainage system, a total of 15 manholes were found inundated for more than one hour with the spread of water at pavement greater than standard six feet and depth at curb exceeding six inches.
The current rainfall warrants the use of a return period larger than 10-year as Karachi is witnessing a recurrence of rainfall events like 2020 and 2022, it added, and suggested to use at least a 50-year return period rainfall intensity for redesigning of the stormwater drainage system which is also supported by international design criteria and guidelines.
“Part 4 of SWD Plan 2007, which was the Sewerage Master Plan for DHA, must be implemented by authorities to ensure no [flow of] sewage into the existing drainage system (SWD Plan 2007),” the report further recommended.
It said that the extreme flooding conditions in 2020 and 2022 in Karachi in general and DHA in particular were the recent examples of flooding due to lack of planning and maintenance of stormwater drainage system of a cosmopolitan city.
The NED varsity in its report said that floodwater accumulation was also related to solid waste management and it had tendency to clog the drainage system if not removed accordingly while another possible problem was that Karachi was using same infrastructure for both sewerage and stormwater drainage.
It stated that the main objective of this study was to vet the “Construction of leftover stormwater drainage network in Phase-I to VIII, DHA Karachi design validation” for improvement of existing/suggested drainage system.
The bench adjourned the hearing till Sept 14 as both sides sought time to examine the report. 
It may be recalled that in September last year, the SHC had directed the NED University to conduct the evaluation of the drainage infrastructure within the jurisdictions CBC and DHA and also asked the two institutions and the petitioners to provide requisite information and documents to the vice chancellor of the university.

1,Opposition parties hold PPP govt responsible for ‘disaster’ in interior of Sindh,MQM-P also deplores ‘bad governance’...,"KARACHI: Expressing their concern over the devastation unleashed by downpours and flooding in the rural areas of Sindh, opposition political parties have questioned performance of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government and deplored its incompetence and bad governance which, they said, turned the situation more disastrous.
They demanded a transparent and effective system to be put in place to monitor performance of the district administrations across the province and feared that absence of a proper mechanism to check flood relief activities would lead to corruption and misappropriation of funds, which were expected to flow in in response to countrywide appeal for assistance.
“There’s no doubt that this year has witnessed extremely high count of rain in Sindh and Balochistan,” said former federal minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Sindh chapter president Ali Zaidi. 
“But has the current situation in Sindh developed overnight? Has the Met office not warned of above average rains? This situation has been turned into disaster due to incompetence of the Sindh government. We fear that it’s not over yet. The Sindh government and its never-ending greed would now deprive people of their due assistance.”

MQM-P also deplores ‘bad governance’

He was confident that the recent political trend and its incompetence to meet the challenges would lead to an end of PPP’s rule over Sindh. This situation, he said, would further expose the PPP and its governance as the “feudal mindset” would never change and learn from past mistakes.
“The dark night is about to end and Sindh is at the verge of getting rid from Zardari mafia, and in general elections 2023, PTI will return victorious and form government in the province,” he said. 
“The people of Sindh have drowned along with their cattle and PPP ministers are busy holding photo sessions. Our workers across the province are busy helping the affectees. The PTI will bring an end to tyrannies of Zardari mafia and it will make them answerable within and outside the Sindh Assembly.”
Jamaat-i-Islami chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman wondered that why the government facilities across the province were not opened to the people who lost their houses and other properties to the flooding. He said the PPP made every effort to make flood in the province as an excuse to postpone scheduled elections, but on ground it had not made a single concrete move to help out the affectees.
“Our party’s welfare wing Al-Khidmat already has hundreds of volunteers in both Sindh and Balochistan who are coordinating with local administration and all other organisations for effective relief operation,” he said, adding: “But it’s so unfortunate that the provincial government of the PPP which enjoys mandate from these affected areas and powers for the last 14 years has failed to meet the challenge while every resource is missing from the scene. Their incompetence has made this situation more disastrous.”
He said that in many affected Sindh districts the local administration was exploiting the situation and people were able to get some relief only by using their “connections” or political influence. Similarly, he said, there were a number of reports that the floodwater was deliberately diverted to settled localities only save the agricultural lands of the landlords, feudal lords and political leaders, who were associated with the ruling party.
In a statement, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) expressed its serious concern over the recent flood situation in rural Sindh and criticised the PPP government for its “failure” in managing the disaster.
“The recent rains in different parts of Sindh have caused flooding in different parts of the country,” said the statement issued by MQM-P’s coordination committee. 
“But the situation in Sindh is more critical due to bad governance of the PPP. The civil administration in Sindh has badly failed and the people have been left at the mercy of donor organisations and charities. The situation calls for greater effort with sincerity and honesty.”
Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) -- an umbrella organisation of five political parties – accused the Sindh government of getting away from the challenge. It alleged that the ruling party would only become active when the international donor agencies started showing interest that would open new avenues of corruption and misappropriation.
“The GDA workers and volunteers would not abandon people of Sindh in this critical hour. Our workers have set up emergency centres in all affected Sindh districts and coordinating with all relief organisations,” said Sardar Abdul Raheem of the GDA.

2,PTI files petition against LG poll delay,KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf on Thursday filed a petition in Sindh High Court against the Election...,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf on Thursday filed a petition in Sindh High Court against the Election Commission of Pakistan and provincial authorities for again postponing the second phase of local government elections in Sindh.  
The PTI sought directive for ECP to either hold LG polls on Aug 28 or announce a fresh schedule and pleaded to set aside the postponement decision of ECP.
The PTI through its MPAs Khurram Sher Zaman, Raja Azhar Khan and Jamal Siddiqui approached the SHC and submitted that on Aug 24, the ECP had again postponed the LG elections scheduled to be held in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions on Aug 28 and did not announce any new date.
The petitioners contended that after the victory of PTI in the by-election of NA-245, the Sindh government has intentionally and deliberately filed application with ECP for postponement of LG polls in order to escape from election.
They further submitted that the ECP was bound to hold elections within 120 days, while the four-year tenure of last local governments in Sindh had expired on Aug 30, 2020, and it has failed to hold the same and violated the mandatory provisions of law.
The petitioners argued that provincial government was malafidely delaying the elections without any justification and deliberately not transferring the power to the representative of local governments as provided under Article 140-A of the Constitution and also appointed blue-eyed administrators and officers in Karachi, Hyderabad and others cities instead of neutral administration/administrators.

3,"Haleem Adil Sheikh not freed as custody required in another case, court informed",The FIR alleges PTI leader of transferring land from one deh to the other in connivance with revenue officials.,"KARACHI: Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh was not released even after obtaining bail in a land-grab because he is booked in another case registered against him in Hyderabad.
This was submitted by Central Prison Karachi Superintendent Hassan Sehto in a report filed before District and Sessions Judge (East) Naeem Memon, who is seized with a petition against continued detention of Mr Sheikh in the prison despite having obtained bail in a land-grab case registered in Karachi.
The prison chief also submitted a copy of the FIR lodged against Mr Sheikh, a leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), and others related to illegal transfer of land from one deh to the other in alleged connivance with revenue officials.
He submitted that the case was under trial before the anti-corruption court in Hyderabad, thus Mr Sheikh could not be set free.
The judge took the prison chief’s report on record and adjourned the hearing.
Naeem Adil Sheikh had moved the court against the prison superintendent, accusing him of not releasing his brother, Haleem Adil Sheikh, despite the fact that the Special Court Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) had granted a bail to his brother on Aug 22.
The Anti-Encroachment Force (AEF) had arrested Mr Sheikh after the judge had revoked his interim pre-arrest bail for ‘failing’ to appear before the court on Aug 17. Subsequently, he was remanded in judicial custody.
Later, the special court’s judge granted him a bail subject to furnishing of a Rs100,000 personal bond. However, defence counsel Zahoor Mahsud alleged that the prison authorities had refused to release the interned opposition leader on the pretext that his custody was required in some other case.
In Karachi, Mr Sheikh is facing a trial in a case registered against him and others under sections 8(i) of the Special Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act, 2010 at the Anti-Encroachment Force Zone-I, Karachi, on behalf of the state.
Case property seized from convicted IS man was lost to fire, IO tells court
An antiterrorism court was informed that a weapon used in the murder case registered against the Islamic State-inspired convict Saad Aziz and others had been lost in a fire in the Malkhana (judicial ware store) in April 2018.  
A business graduate from a prestigious Karachi institution, Saad Aziz, who along with his accomplices was sentenced to death by a military court for killing 43 members of the Ismaili community in 2015 bombing in Safoora Goth, had been charged with murder, attempted murder, possessing illicit weapon and causing terrorism.  
When the matter recently came up before the ATC-VII judge, who is conducting the trial in the judicial complex inside the central prison, the investigating officer was set to produce case property against the accused persons.  
The investigating officer disclosed before the court that an unlicensed weapon recovered from the accused persons in another case, had been burnt in the incident of the fire that had hit the City Courts’ Malkhana in April 2018.  
Without passing any order against the officials in charge of the judicial ware store over the purported loss of the case property, the judge had adjourned the matter on Aug 22.  
A case under Section 23(i)-A of the Sindh Arms Act, 2013 was registered against Saad Aziz, alias Tin Tin, and Asad-ur-Rehman, alias Malik, at the Counter-Terrorism Department police station in 2015.  
In the meanwhile, the judge directed the investigating officer of another case pertaining to murder, encounter and terrorism to produce the case property against both the accused on the next date.  
The judge also issued non-bailable warrants for the arrest of the witnesses of the prosecution for failing to turn up before the court to record their testimonies against the accused persons.  
The judge told the SSP concerned to ensure arrest of the witnesses and their production before the court.

Water in the lake has also started developing pressure along its embankments.
Irrigation Engineer Sehwan Mahesh Kumar said that due to continuous rainfall at Kirthar Mountains and Kachho belt, the level of water in the lake had risen. Water level was recorded at 120-foot RL, he added. 
He said the embankments of the lake had been raised till 128-foot RL. When the water level would reach at 124 feet, it would be a dangerous position, he said, adding that stones and flood-fighting material was being dumped at the weak positions of embankments.
The private secretary to Sindh chief minister, Saleem Bajari, also reached Manchhar Lake and supervised the work there. Speaking with reporters, Mr Bajari said the embankments of Manchhar Lake were strong still, adding that its strict monitoring had been started.
People got in a panic and started to migrate to other areas fearing occurrence of breaches when some people hoisted a red flag at Band Manchhar when the level of water reached 120-foot RL. But the local irrigation authority declared that the embankments were safe.

They said that minorities in Pakistan were being protected well by state institutions, and added that Indian government would be better off if protection to religious minorities there was ensured and justice was provided to the heirs of 12 Bheel community fellows who had travelled to India from Sindh and were murdered by zealots. 
Speaking at a joint news conference at the local press club, Advocate G.M. Parkash, a member of the National Lobbying Delegation for Minorities, Bishop Samson from the Catholic Diocese Sindh, M. Parkash Singh, a member of the Pakistan Hindu Council, Ghazi Salahuddin, chairman of the Hyderabad Cantonment peace committee and Fr. Dr Daniel Fiaz from the Church of Pakistan roundly condemned the Aug 21 incident. 
“We are here to say that we stand for peace for all and we will foil conspiracies of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh [of India],” said Advocate M. Parkash. He said the incident was simply condemnable and such incidents must stop. Anyone involved in it must face the music. “I must say religious places of minorities here are safe and Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and Christians were names of Pakistani power,” he said. 
Referring to the Sunday disturbances in the city, he said the Indian media was trying to use the Aug 21 incident for unleashing a propaganda against Pakistan. Religious minorities, including scheduled caste (Dalits), Muslims and Christians were not safe in India, he added. 
He said that 12 Bheel community fellows had travelled to India, where RSS zealots had poisoned them to death. He said no inquiry had so far been held by Indian government. “It is all a conspiracy of RSS,” he said, adding: “Modi government’s conspiracy will fail”. 
He urged United Nations to take notice of Indian agents’ activities in Pakistan. He pointed out that by holding a ‘Namoos-i-Risalat’ rally in Hyderabad, religious minorities had proved that Hindus respected all religions. “Hindus here get more security from law enforcers than our Muslim brothers,” he said.  
Bishop Samson appreciated the response given by security agencies following the desecration incident and ensuing disturbances in Hyderabad. He said those involved in it must be brought to justice. The cleric lambasted those elements which were trying to capitalise on this incident. “No person from any religious minority here can even think of committing blasphemy,” he remarked, and said this was all aimed at causing provocation. 
Fr. Dr Daniel Fiaz said believers of all faiths were respectable and they coexisted in harmony. “We all respect everyone’s faith because all faiths preach peace and harmony,” he said, adding that no religious minority fellow had temerity to commit such offence. He, however, called for severe punishment to anyone found involved in the incident. 
Sikh community leader M. Parkash Singh said Indian government was hell bent to propagate against Pakistan at international level through its media. He observed that the Indian media would resort to such tactics but always looked the other way when it came to atrocities against Sikhs, Muslims and Kashmiris by Indian forces. 
He also called for an inquiry into the murder of 12 Bheel community members by the RSS.

10,"Committees formed in every district for relief, rehabilitation of rain-hit populace","Army to join operation, UN official pledges assistance at the earliest...","KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, presiding over a rain emergency and relief meeting here on Thursday, decided to constitute district-level committees comprising the deputy commissioners concerned, representatives from Corps-V and engineering corps, local government, PDMA, and local representatives to start relief, rescue and survey, and damage assessment right from deh level so that proper relief could be provided to the rain-affected people. 
“The purpose is to reach the affected families and support them in a transparent, proper and decent way,” the CM said, and added that the committees being formed at the district level would not only work for relief, rescue, survey, early rehabilitation and damage assessment, but would also procure all the required material and goods, right from tents, mosquito nets, food items, medicines, machinery and other such things. 
It was pointed out that the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) had distributed 80,000 tents and placed an order for another 180,000 tents but a requirement of one million tents was generated by district administrations. 
The chief minister said that River Indus was in high flood, Guddu Barrage had 517,392 cusecs upstream and downstream flows, Sukkur Barrage 597,753 and Kotri 297,178 cusecs flows. “Comparatively embankments of our rivers are in better position than the flood situation of 2010 and 2011 but even then, various vulnerable points are under pressure,” he said.

Army to join operation, UN official pledges assistance at the earliest

If the mountain range of Punjab received more rain, the flows in the river would increase thereby exerting more pressure on the bunds, he said. 
Mr Shah said that the people living in the riverine belts had vacated their houses and started lining the embankment of the river but when the bunds come under more pressure, they migrated further to the main roads. 
Tent cities
He added that he had travelled across the province and found that thousands of people had set up makeshift cottages and tents along the main roads. 
It was decided that tent cities be set up at the union council level so that people could be shifted to one place which would be easier for the administration to provide them with all necessary facilities. It was also decided that tents be given to people separately. 
The chief minister said that the Crops-V would also help the district administration in the distribution of ration bags and other materials. 
Standing rainwater
The issue of disposal of rainwater from roads and streets in cities and towns also came under discussion at the meeting. 
It was informed that since the nearby canals/branches were flowing at their maximum capacity, they could not carry/accept more rainwater in natural gravity. 
The meeting decided that the district administration would use diesel engines and electricity to pump out rainwater for which necessary machinery would be provided to them on an emergency basis. 
PDMA officials told the meeting that they had already provided dewatering machines, pumping machines and generators to the officials concerned. 
The chief minister concluding the meeting said that the survey of the collapsed houses, washed away crops and perished cattle heads would help the government prepare a plan to rehabilitate the affected people. 
CM, UN official discuss calamity
Meanwhile, the chief minister and the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Pakistan Julien Harneis at a meeting in the CM House discussed the overall devastation by downpour and the requirement of humanitarian aid in the affected areas. 
The meeting was attended by Chief Secretary Sohail Rajput, chairman of P&D Hassan Naqvi, CM’s principal secretary Fayaz Jatoi, local government secretary Najam Shah and rehabilitation secretary Asif Memon while the UN official was assisted by Imran Leghari. 
The chief minister told the visiting UN coordinator that heavy rains had rendered a great portion of Sindh’s population displaced. 
“Those who have lost their houses need tents to live in but the tents were not available in the market,” he said, and added that he had requested consuls general of Iran and other countries to help procure tents. 
The UN official said that he was going to visit some affected districts of the province to assess the losses and damage caused to the people and their needs. He said his agency would help out the affected people. 
The chief minister said that his government had mobilised all the resources to rescue people in the first phase. 
“We have set up relief camps where we are providing them food and set up free medical camps for the affected people,” he said, adding that the people, particularly women and children, living in camps needed nutritional supplements, water purification tablets and water filtration pumps. 
The UN official said that they would assess the situation speedily and convey the people’s requirements to the agency to ensure provision of assistance at the earliest. 
The CM thanked him for his support and response.

11,Bank manager shot dead in Karachi’s North Nazimabad area ‘over old enmity’,West-zone DIG Nasir Aftab says that the victim was employed at the branch of Faisal Bank.,"KARACHI: Manager of a private bank branch was shot dead by unknown assailants when he came out of his office in North Nazimabad’s Block I on Thursday afternoon, according to police and rescue services.
They said that the manager, Maqbali Khan, was gunned down at Khadija Market.
West-zone DIG Nasir Aftab said that the victim was manager of the branch of Faisal Bank. 
Another officer, Central SSP Maroof Usman said that the victim was apparently getting cigarette or smoking at the gate of the branch while an armed security guard of the branch was also standing nearby. The assailant first “terrified” the guard by pointing a pistol at him. The guard rushed into the branch to save himself after which the assailant turned to Muqbali Khan, who also tried to ran to safety. However, the assailant fired several shots on the victim from behind. 
Khan suffered four bullet wounds and was transported to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead.
SSP Usman said the lone suspect was carrying a pistol in a shopping bag when he came close to the branch. He fled the spot after committing the crime, the police officer added.
“The murder appears to be the outcome of some personal enmity,” the SSP said.
DIG Aftab ruled out possibility of intended robbery as the suspect’s motive.
He said the victim originally hailed from Mohmand Agency; his son visited the hospital after the incident. The police investigators had obtained the CCTV footage of the episode from the crime scene which was shown to him. “The victim’s son recognised the assailant and informed the police that his family had some old enmity with the attacker and his associates at their native place.
Further investigation was under way, the police said.

Protesters ransack KE office in Korangi
Enraged over prolonged power outages and inflated bills, residents of Korangi on Thursday stormed a local office of the power utility and ransacked it before arrival of law enforcers, who managed to prevent the situation from deteriorating, according to witnesses and officials.
A large number of protesters, including women and children, held a noisy demonstration outside the KE office near Darul Uloom, blocked the main Korangi Industrial Area road and chanted slogans against it. They set old tyres on fire causing suspension of vehicular traffic flow on both track near Singer Chowrangi. Several hundred vehicles were stuck up in the snarl-up. A large group of protesters also overpowered private guards of the power utility, broke into the office and ransacked fixtures and furniture. Contingents of the police and Rangers rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control by persuading the protesters to leave the office.
Meanwhile, a Korangi police spokesperson in a statement said that the people protested at KE’s Korangi Darul Uloom office over increase in their bills and ransacked the power utility office.
Landhi DSP and Awami Colony SHO, along with police contingents, controlled the situation and got the road reopened to traffic, added the spokesperson.
Separately, residents of Shah Latif Town also blocked National Highway near Jogi Mor against “overbilling”.
Malir SSP Irfan Bahadur said they were asking as to why the utility had included fuel adjustment charges in their bills, which ultimately increased manifold. They submitted a memorandum with power utility officials and dispersed peacefully, added the senior police officer. The traffic remained suspended on the highway for some time, he said.
The KE spokesperson said: “On Thursday, severe damage was caused to our customer-facing offices, and our staff members were tortured. As many as five FIRs have been lodged by KE and CCTV footages have been shared with the law enforcement authorities for identification of the lawbreakers.”
He said due to severe damage caused to the Landhi and Korangi centres, both would remain temporarily closed.
Similarly, the residents also held protest outside KE office in Nazimabad over the same issue.

They told reporters that they had been living on main roads in the aftermath of heavy rains which had destroyed their houses, but not a single item in the name of relief good was provided to them yet by the district administration. Some people were providing them only food on their own, they said.  
The protesters said they were compelled to live in make shift huts due to inundation of their villages under flood water.
