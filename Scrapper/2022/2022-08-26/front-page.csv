• 23 Sindh districts declared ‘calamity-hit’ as floods ‘submerge southern Pakistan’
• Govt requires over Rs72 billion for relief efforts; calls upon donors, nation to contribute
ISLAMABAD: Calling the incessant monsoon rains a “climate-inducted humanitarian crisis of epic proportions”, the Pakistan government on Thursday officially declared a ‘national emergency’ in light of the rain-induced floods which have so far killed 937 people, including 343 children, and left at least 30 million without shelter.
As per the latest data compiled by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Sindh reported the highest number of deaths as 306 people lost their lives due to floods and rain-related incidents from June 14 to date.
Balochistan reported 234 deaths whereas Khyber Pakh­tun­khwa and Punjab recorded 185 and 165 deaths, respectively. In Azad Jammu and Kash­mir, 37 people were killed while nine deaths were repor­ted in the Gilgit-Baltistan reg­ion during the current monsoon rains. In the same period Islamabad reported one death.

According to the NDMA, Pakistan received 166.8mm of rain in August, as opposed to the average of 48mm — an increase of 241 per cent. Sindh and Balochistan — the worst-hit regions — witnessed a 784pc and 496pc increase in the monsoon deluge, respectively, it added.
Consequently, the abnormal increase in rainfall generated flash floods across the country, particularly in the southern part of Pakistan, which rem­ains inundated at the moment with 23 districts of Sindh being declared “calamity-hit”.
Monstrous monsoon
Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman said a “war room” has been established by the prime minister at NDMA, which would spearhead relief operations across the country. She admitted that the incessant “monstrous” rainfall had “made it hard to carry out relief operations, especially helicopter sorties”.
“Pakistan is going through its 8th cycle of monsoon; normally the country has only three to four cycles of [monsoon] rain,” the minister said during a press conference in Islamabad.
“Pakistan is under an unprecedented monsoon spell and data suggests the possibility of re-emergence of another cycle in September.”
Senator Rehman, who compared the current situation with the devastating 2010 floods earlier this week, said the current situation was worse than that. “The water is not only flowing from the north as in 2010, but it is equally or more devastating in its sweep and destructive power,” she added.



 
According to the senator, flash floods caused by heavy rains had swept away bridges and communication infrastructure in various areas of the country. “Almost 30 million people are without shelter, thousands of them displaced and have no food,” she told reporters.

Stressing the need for relief from international donors, the minister said that the need for shelter and relief was dire as per what the provinces had conveyed. “It is still an evolving situation and every day the needs assessments were changing as the rains did not stop and the water kept coming,” she said, adding that the number of homeless was growing.
Sindh has asked for one million tents and Balochistan has demanded 100,000 tents, she said, adding that all tent manufacturers had been mobilised and external donors were also approached for tents.
Initial needs assessment report
As per the government’s preliminary rapid needs assessment report, at least Rs72.36 billion is required to provide immediate relief to the flood-hit people. In terms of food and instant cash relief, the government requires Rs7.33 billion, for non-food items (NFIs) it needs Rs8.713bn, whereas Rs1.627bn are required for health-related expenses.
The government also requires Rs9.024bn to compensate the loss of cattle as a result of rain-induced floods while the machinery and related equipment required for the relief efforts would cost Rs4.646bn, as per the initial assessment. Meanwhile, in order to rebuild at least 82,000 houses damaged in the deluge would cost Rs41 billion i.e. Rs50,000 per house.
‘Appeal to Pakistanis’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb evoked the “national spirit” and urged the nation, including overseas Pakistan, to come forward and help their compatriots at this critical juncture.

“The entire nation, especially the overseas Pakistanis, should donate generously to help the flood victims as a huge amount of money would be required for their rehabilitation in the wake of large-scale disaster, she said in a statement.
Ms Aurangzeb added that the federal government, along with the provinces, was making tireless efforts and all the resources were being mobilised. The minister said that owing to heavy rains and severe flooding, there were difficulties in relief operations and that public contributions were needed to ramp up rescue efforts.
She added that the details and process for depositing donations in the Prime Minister Flood Relief Account 2022 had already been made public.

KARACHI: In what appeared to be among the most disastrous monsoon spells in six decades, Sindh and Balochistan are witnessing the heaviest rainfall since 1961, as the two provinces recorded 522 and 469 per cent, more than the normal downpour this year, respectively.
The fresh numbers came from the Met Office, which surprised officials and attracted warnings from environmentalists, who called it the beginning of fresh challenges for the authorities as the much-hyped climate change had finally come knocking.
“Sindh has received 680.5 millimetres of rain since July when the monsoon season actually began,” said a Met official.
“As per calculated and defined standards, Sindh normally gets 109.5mm rains in the monsoon season. So it’s 522pc higher than normal. Similarly, Balochistan receives 50mm rain on an average every monsoon, but it has so far recorded 284mm — 469pc higher. The country has overall witnessed 207 times higher rainfall so far this monsoon and the season is going to last till September-end.”
Padidan, a town in Naushero Feroze district, has so far received 1,722mm rain since July, the official said, stressing that figure was never recorded in any Sindh town, ever. He then referred to data that suggested Sindh and Balochistan had last witnessed such torrential rains in 1994, which was recorded as the heaviest since 1961.
“In 1994, Sindh had received 502.6mm rain, which was 276pc higher than the normal count as per calculations in those times based on environmental and climate modules. The same year, Balochistan had received 175mm rain, which was 52pc higher than its normal count,” he explained.
In other parts of the country also, the situation didn’t look so different this year. Gilgit-Baltistan, according to the Met Office data, has so far received 50.3mm rain in two months, which is 99pc above normal and Punjab 349mm, exactly 90pc higher than its normal downpour in monsoon. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa witnessed 31pc above normal rain this monsoon, where so far 257.4mm rains have been recorded.

Azad Jammu and Kashmir is the only region in the country that has witnessed below average downpour this monsoon. The valley has recorded 279.6mm rain, which is minus 7pclesser than its normal monsoon downpour. The situation has set alarm bells ringing, as the authorities and experts are convinced that climate change is no longer an approaching challenge, but “is happening right now”.
“The impacts of climate change have started emerging,” said Dr Ghulam Rasul, former director general of the Pakistan Meteorological Department. “What we are seeing now is actually part of those series of events that had started emerging for quite some time. For instance, spring in Pakistan is almost eliminated. We didn’t see spring this year. After a very harsh winter, we jumped into a very severe summer with one after another heatwave even in rural areas.”
He called the massive and “disastrous rains” as the reasons behind the flooding in Sindh and Balochistan and not the infrastructure soil condition. In Balochistan, he said, the hilly soil could have been one of the reasons that aggravated the flood situation as the water could not be absorbed by such a surface. But that couldn’t be called a reason in any part of Sindh, he added.
“Another challenge which makes this climate issue more challenging is the growing population and the fast shrinking space for a better and environment-friendly ecosystem,” said Mr Rasul.
“The population is growing so fast that our agricultural land is being used for urban settlement and construction. You can gauge the severity of the issue with simple data that in 1951, 5,500 cubic metres water was available in Pakistan for one person. The number has now shrunk to 850 cubic metres.”

2,SC upholds LHC decision against sale of evacuee land,Says federal minister does not enjoy any authority to approve sale of evacuee land.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that a federal minister did not enjoy any authority under the laws governing the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) to approve the sale of evacuee land either in his discretion, or in relaxation of any provision of the law.
“And if the actions of the concerned federal minister were bereft of executive nature, then as a natural corollary, they cannot be construed as being authorised by the President of Pakistan in terms of Article 99 of the Constitu­tion,” said a 19-page judgement authored by Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan.
On Aug 4, a two-judge Supreme Court bench had rejected a plea challenging a Jan 18 order of the Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi bench that declared illegal the sale of commercial property, belonging to the ETPB in Raja Bazaar and worth billions of rupees, to a real estate investor.
The bench, consisting of Justice Ahsan and Justice Yahya Afridi, relea­sed a detailed judgement on Thursday.
The case concerns the sale of a Rawalpindi property in 1992, approval of which was given by the federal minister for social welfare way back in 1977.
The commercial property was under the ETPB’s control and initially rented out to Raja Ali Zaman (deceased) and Raja Muhammad Banaras (both of them vendees) by the authority concerned on behalf of ETPB. During the tenure of their tenancy, the vendees approached the then federal minister for Social Welfare and Rural Develop­ment for outright sale of the property.
Through a memorandum issued on March 22, 1977, the request was granted and on June 6, 1992, a deputy administrator of ETPB executed the sale deed in favour of the vendees.
Munir Paracha had represented the appellants while Hafiz Ahsan Khokhar appeared on behalf of the ETPB.
The detailed judgement explained that all land or properties managed and supervised by the bureau belong to the federal government and it was only after seeking permission from the latter that the ETPB can be permitted to sell or dispose of land under its supervision.
Therefore, the judgement said, it is incumbent upon the ETPB to seek permission from the federal government for disposing of any land under its management or supervision.
If the ETPB’s board did not move a resolution recommending sale, or sou­ght permission to sell a private property, it will be deemed that the federal government’s permission was never sought for the sale of the property in question.
But if it was the federal government that wished to sell any land under ETPB management, the process for doing so would be to refer the matter to the bureau’s board. The board would give its recommendations to the federal government before any sale was carried out, the judgment said.
After the federal government has accorded its approval, the ETPB chairman would then exercise authority under Section 12 of the ETPB Act by designating an officer to carry out the sale of the land or property, the judgement explained.
In essence, to sell or dispose of land managed by the ETPB, a resolution has to be passed by its board. The resolution has then to be approved by the federal government, according to the verdict.
But it regretted that the present government had nothing on record to suggest that the appellant applied to the ETPB or approached the federal minister concerned, unlike the bureau, who through March 22, 1977 memorandum, accorded approval for the sale.
If an application was filed by the appellants with ETPB, the court observed, the matter would have been taken up by its board, but the suit property could only have been sold subject to a resolution and approval by the federal government.
Minister’s powers
The March 22, 1977, memorandum also showed, the judgment said, the price of land was determined by a federal minister, but he was not the competent person to do so.
In the absence of an “appropriate application” and without it being processed in the departmental hierarchy, the entire superstructure of the transaction, which ended with the sale deed, was based on an unlawful exercise and, therefore, any action taken on the basis of the memorandum was unlawful and inconsequential vis-à-vis the ETPB and the federal government’s rights.
The judgement explained that Article 173 of the Constitution deals with the power of the federation as well as the provinces to acquire property and to make contracts.
There is a presumption that the legislature intends to legislate on matters in harmony with the Constitution and that the courts will give effect to the will of the legislature manifesting itself through the laws passed by the legislature.
When the federal minister concerned accorded approval for sale of the suit property even though he was not authorised to do so, his action cannot be considered as an executive action, the apex court ruled.
The Lahore High Court rightly concluded that being bereft of its executive nature, the sale deed had been obtained without the federal government’s approval and was therefore illegal, the Supreme Court said and dismissed the appeal.

3,Army top brass hints at tougher approach against TTP,Emphasises continuat­ion of counter-terrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.,"ISLAMABAD: The army top brass on Thursday hinted at a tougher app­roach against the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakis­tan (TTP) as it emphasised continuat­ion of counter-terrorism operations in Khyber-Pakhtunkhawa and Balochistan.
Speaking at the 250th Corps Comm­anders’ Conference, a monthly feature at General Headquarters, Army Chief Gen Qamar Bajwa, according to ISPR, “directed formations to maintain operational readiness and efforts to counter terrorism particularly in KP & Balochistan must continue (sic)”.
A review of the security situation and flood relief operations being undertaken by the army topped the agenda of the meeting.
The ISPR press release on the conference did not give any details about the emphasis on counter-terrorism operations.

All general officers of Pakistan Army to donate one-month pay for flood relief operations

Operations against Baloch insurgents (in Balochistan), Gul Bahadur group (in KP) and some of other militant outfits have been continuing.
However, there has been a cessation of hostilities between security forces and TTP since Eidul Fitr – at least an unannounced one as far as Pakistani security forces are concerned.
At present, the two sides are observing a three-month ceasefire as their representatives hold peace talks.
Gen Bajwa’s assertion about the continuation of the kinetic operations in KP and Balochistan provinces comes in the backdrop of growing public resentment about the return of TTP fighters.
Many suspect that the TTP fighters were returning as part of the ongoing peace talks.
Editorial: Militancy redux
Earlier this month, the TTP militants were seen in Swat’s Matta area and at least one incident of their clash with law-enforcement agencies was reported.
Similarly, their presence has been noted in North and South Waziristan where an uptick in target killings and kidnappings has been witnessed.
This has led to anti-TTP protests in Swat and North Waziristan.
The timing of Gen Bajwa’s statement also coincides with stress in peace talks that have been taking place in Afghanistan. There is a growing trust deficit between the two sides, though neither wants to walk out of the talks.
It is widely suspected that the TTP has begun extending active support to Gul Bahadur group in its attacks on security forces. The group, however, does not formally acknowledge its role in these attacks.
The TTP has, meanwhile, blamed security forces for the killing of two of its militants in North Waziristan.
In a statement released earlier this week, the terrorist group had warned that its patience was running thin.
Disquiet among TTP ranks is also visible over the death of the group’s spokesman and senior commander Omar Khalid Khorasani in Afghanistan in a bomb blast.
At the same time, Taliban Interior Minister Sirajudddin Haqqani, who had been mediating TTP–Pakistan talks, is under tremendous pressure after the killing of Al Qaeda chief in a US drone attack in Kabul at the end of last month.
The COAS statement was, therefore, seen by security analysts as an attempt to correct perceptions among the people worried at home about the TTP comeback, while at the same time conveying a tough message to the terrorist group.
Flood relief efforts
Gen Bajwa praised the army’s flood relief efforts and “directed Army Formations to render all possible support to the flood affectees”, the ISPR said, adding that the participants discussed the flood situation and ongoing relief and rescue operations.
“Expressing deep sorrow over loss of precious lives and extensive damage to infrastructure due to unprecedented rains/ floods, forum resolved to spare no efforts for mitigating the sufferings of flood affectees,” the ISPR further said.
In a separate statement, the ISPR said: “All General Officers of Pakistan Army have donated one month pay for flood relief operations.”
Meanwhile, Twitterati noted the absence of Bahawalpur Corps Commander Gen Faiz Hamid from the meeting. He was not seen in the video clip of the meeting that was publicly shared by the ISPR.
Gen Hamid had recently been transferred from Peshawar to the Bhawalpur corps. As the commander in Peshawar, he was the lead negotiator in talks with the TTP.

4,"Imran gets bail in terrorism, Section 144 cases",Says Pakistan has become global ‘laughing stock’ after reports of cases against him received extensive coverage in world media,"

ISLAMABAD: Imran Khan makes his way through the crowd upon his arrival at an anti-terrorism court on Thursday.—Tanveer Shahzad

 
ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan was on Thursday granted pre-arrest interim bail in the terrorism and violation of Section 144 cases registered against him.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief was booked in a terrorism case for his controversial remarks about a female judge at a party rally in the capital on Aug 20, while a separate first information report (FIR) was registered against him on charges of violating Section 144 (ban on public gatherings exceeding four persons) by holding the large rally.
The Islamabad Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) granted pre-arrest interim bail to Mr Khan till Sept 1 in the case of intimidating a woman additional district and sessions judge (AD&SJ) and senior police authorities.
ATC Judge Raja Jawad Abbas Hassan took up the petition seeking pre-arrest bail for Mr Khan.

Says Pakistan has become global ‘laughing stock’ after reports of cases against him received extensive coverage in world media

Earlier this week, Islamabad High Court’s Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani had granted him three-day protective bail, which expired on Thursday.
Mr Khan appeared in the ATC along with his legal team and former ministers Pervaiz Khattak, Asad Umar, local leaders Ali Nawaz Awan, Amir Kayani, Raja Khurram Nawaz and Senator Faisal Javed.
Besides, PTI activists were also present in and outside the Federal Judicial Complex that housed the ATC. Some of them tried to enter the courtroom, however, police stopped them and locked the doors.
During the hearing, Mr Khan rose to his seat to mark his attendance. His counsel Babar Awan argued that the complainant in this case was a magistrate, Ali Javed, while the aggrieved AD&SJ, the Islamabad inspector general of police (IGP) and deputy inspector general (DIG) did not lodge the FIR.
He presented a watered-down version of the otherwise ‘threatening’ speech of Mr Khan and said the former premier had warned the judge of legal action, adding he reprimanded the IGP and DIG for being a part of the government and responsible for the well-being of an under-custody suspect.
The judge, after initial hearings, granted interim bail to Mr Khan against a surety bond of Rs100,000 till Sept 1.
Advocate Awan requested the court to extend the interim bail for a longer period since Mr Khan was contesting by-elections on nine seats. The judge however declined the request and issued a notice to the police, and adjourned further hearing till the said date.
Moreover, AD&SJ Tahir Abbas Sipra granted an interim bail to Mr Khan in another case registered against him for taking out a rally in violation of Section 144 of the CrPC on Aug 20.
His counsel argued that the FIR contained bailable sections of the PPC and requested the court to accept the petition.
The judge granted interim bail to Mr Khan till Sept 7, and summoned the police with the relevant recordand adjourned further hearing till then.
‘Laughing stock’
After attending the proceedings at the Federal Judicial Complex, Imran Khan came down hard on the government for lodging a terrorism case against him, and said Pakistan had become a “laughing stock” in the world because news reports of the cases against him had received extensive coverage in the international media.
He alleged that his chief of staff, Shahbaz Gill, had been tortured and sexually abused, and “when I said I will take legal action against the police officials involved as well as the magistrate who sent Gill into police custody despite torture being proven in court, I was booked in a terror case”.
When this news spread across the globe, it gave an impression of Pakistan being a “banana republic”.
“Whoever is making these decisions or whatever decisions they are taking, they should think of the country first,” Mr Khan maintained.
The PTI chief went on to say that the government was trying to arrest the leader of the “biggest party” in these cases. “They are afraid of the power of the PTI. There have not been such huge rallies in the history of Pakistan,” he claimed.
He further said the coalition government was trying to knock him out on technical grounds due to the fear of the PTI’s popularity, which was winning by-elections across the country. The country was being mocked just because some people want to protect their skins, he remarked.

5,Punjab police register terror case against Rana Sana,Move being seen as tit-for-tat for case filed against PTI chief in Islamabad,"LAHORE: Punjab police on Thursday lodged a case against Minister for Interior and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Rana Sanaullah under Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).
The Industrial Estate police station of Gujrat [the hometown of Chief Minister Parvez Elahi] registered a first information report (FIA) against Rana Sanaullah on the complaint of a citizen, Shakaz Aslam.
Political circles declared it a tit-for-tat move, saying the FIR was registered in Punjab against the interior minister a few days after Islamabad police lodged a case against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman and former premier Imran Khan on the same [anti-terrorism] charges.
In the case registered against Imran Khan, the complainant was a judicial officer, while in Punjab the FIR was lodged against Rana Sanaullah by a commoner.

Move being seen as tit-for-tat for case filed against PTI chief in Islamabad

An official said the decision to lodge the case against Mr Sanaullah was taken at the level of the Punjab government. He said it had been conveyed to the IG Punjab ‘just for his information’ when the matter of registration of the case was discussed at the level of Gujrat DPO and government.
The DPO was recently posted on the recommendations of the Punjab government, the official said.
Punjab Home Minister retired Col Hashim Dogar confirmed in his latest tweet on Thursday that a case had been registered against Rana Sanaullah. He said the FIR was lodged against the federal minister for [allegedly] threatening the judiciary and government officials, including the then chief secretary of Punjab.
The minister further said the charges framed in the FIR were ‘serious’ and action would be taken in accordance with the law.
Reacting to the move, former federal minister and PML-Q leader Moonis Elahi said he (Rana Sanaullah) would be arrested soon in the anti-terrorism case. “As the federal government is instituting false cases against PTI chairman Imran Khan, the masses have filed a true case against Rana Sana,” he added.
In the FIR, the complainant alleged that Rana Sanaullah appeared in a Geo TV programme on Aug 21. He said the anchor ran some old clips and statements of Mr Sanaullah which were aired on April 16, 2021, and Jan 29, 2022, on some TV channels.
In the clips, he said, Mr Sanaullah had threatened the judiciary, the Punjab chief secretary, the commissioner, other government officials and their children with dire consequences.
An official source told Dawn that the complainant was wanted to the Islamabad Police in some cases lodged with Kohsar and Aabpara police stations.
The ICT police had already issued him call up notices. According to the sources, the ICT police have initiated the process to declare him a proclaimed offender.

6,Riyadh confirms $1bn investment in Pakistan,• Bilawal conveyed commitment in call with Saudi counterpart • Kingdom informed about damages caused by unprecedented floods,"• Bilawal conveyed commitment in call with Saudi counterpart
• Kingdom informed about damages caused by unprecedented floods
• Miftah says external financing needs for current fiscal year now complete
• Finance ministry official says too early to clarify nature of investment
ISLAMABAD: The Saudi king has directed his government to invest $1 billion in Pakistan “in confirmation of the kingdom’s support of the Pakistani economy” and its people, a report from the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said on Thursday.
The investment commitment was conveyed to Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari during a phone call with his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan.
The directive from King Salman bin Abdulaziz came a day after the Qatari government said it would invest $3bn in Pakistan.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari tweeted earlier on Thursday about the interaction with Prince Farhan and welcomed the investment commitment. He also said he had briefed his Saudi counterpart on the flood situation in Pakistan.
The SPA report said the two leaders also discussed “strong Saudi-Pakistani relations and ways to boost them, as well as the regional and international issues of common interest”.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have earlier indicated to provide $1bn each in oil purchase financing.
However, it is not clear whether the Saudi announcement of $1bn is an investment or the deferred oil facility for Pakistan. “It is too early to clarify the nature of the investment,” a finance ministry official said.
The announcement from the UAE to invest $1bn in Pakistan came on Aug 5, followed by Qatar’s intention declared on Wednesday to invest $3bn.
A major IMF condition for Pakistan was to secure $4bn financing commitment from friendly countries.
Finance Minister Miftah Ismail told Dawn he had also received the confirmation of the investment from Saudi Arabia. “We welcome the Saudi Arabia investment in Pakistan,” he said.
With the kingdom’s investment ann­o­u­ncement, all prior IMF conditions had now been met, he said: “We have managed our external financing requirements now. Our external needs are now complete for the fiscal year 2023.”
The move follows the completion of the $4 billion in bilateral financing from four friendly nations and would pave the way for immediate disbursement, expe­c­ted to be in Pakistan’s account before the end of working hours on Aug 31.
The Fund’s executive board would meet on Aug 29 to take up Pakistan’s case for approval of the completion of the seventh and eighth reviews of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), besides a $1bn increase in the size of the programme to $7bn and extend the bailout programme to August next year.
The IMF board’s clearance was expe­c­ted to reverse Pakistan’s continuously depleting foreign exchange reserves, strengthen the rupee and support the balance of payments.
With an increase in the petroleum development levy on oil products on July 31, the IMF publicly confirmed that Pakistan had completed all prior actions to revive the loan programme, but the Fund linked its board’s approval of a $1.18bn instalment to the confirmation of $4bn additional inflows from the four friendly countries.
The rupee quickly recovered against the dollar after that, rising from about Rs240 to around Rs214 in the interbank market. However, the trend has now reversed and the rupee once again seems to be under pressure. It closed at 219.41 to the dollar on Thursday, according to the central bank.
On July 13, the IMF announced its much-awaited staff-level agreement with Pakistan, a nine-month extension in the loan programme and a $1bn increase in the size of the bailout package to $7bn, including an upfront disbursement of about $1.18bn.
However, it linked its board approval to a series of prior actions, which the Pak­istani government has fulfilled since then.
