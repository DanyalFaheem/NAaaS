Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced on Thursday that he was reversing the decision of the previous government to stop public departments, corporations and autonomous bodies from funding sports teams.
That move by Imran Khan’s government to put an end to the departmental structure and transition towards a regional system had rendered many sportsmen jobless but was never fully implemented.
PM Shehbaz announced his decision at a ceremony in the honour of Pakistan’s medal winners at the recent Commo­nwealth Games in England and the Islamic Solidarity Games in Turkey at the Prime Minister Office.
“I’m lifting the ban so that competitions can be revived between departments,” Mr Sharif said at the ceremony. “It will be a healthy move that will help our youngsters to excel in the field of sports.”
The decision was welcomed by a loud applause by the athletes present at the ceremony, including Arshad Nadeem, who won gold medals in the javelin at both the events, and Commonwealth Games weightlifting gold medallist Nooh Dastagir Butt.
After taking over as the country’s prime minister, Shehbaz had pledged that he would restore the departmental sports structure.
Athletes in Pakistan have for long relied on departmental jobs to take care of their financial matters in order to concentrate on sports but in September last year, the previous government had announced that it was discontinuing funding to departmental sports teams of various government agencies and corporations and would instead utilise that funding for promotion of regional sports teams.
It had set a final date of April 6 this year for ending the departmental sports structure as well as introducing a new sports policy, only for the government to be toppled after No-Confidence vote in the very same month.
That change had already taken place in cricket in 2019 when departmental cricket had been abolished to make way for six regional teams in the domestic circuit which included two teams from Punjab, one from Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Federal Areas.
The move had discouraged several departments from investing in sports teams with several of them also discontinuing other teams apart from cricket as well.
Pakistan’s athletes who won medals at the Commonwealths in Birmingham and the Islamic Games in Konya had already appealed for the revival of the departmental structure.
“Our medal winners have made the country proud and are an inspiration for our youth,” PM Shehbaz said during the ceremony where he also distributed cash prizes.
The premier also promised that steps would be taken to hold sporting events at college and university levels to provide maximum channels to youth to excel in sports.
ROAD TO REVERSAL
The decision to restore the departmental sports structure was widely hailed but hockey great Manzoor-ul-Hasan Senior urged the government to do that in letter and spirit by “binding all the government departments, private banks and others, who have shut down their departments in the past to resume working forthwith”.
“Many banks, after being privatised had closed their sports departments despite making millions in profit,” the former Olympian told Dawn. “Moreover, there is a dire need to improve the sports infrastructure.”
Several sports federations in the country also welcomed the government’s decision but it was immediately unclear if the Pakistan Cricket Board would bring back the departmental teams into its fold.
Since the PCB shifted to a regional system, the Movement for Restoration of Departmental Cricket has been protesting the decision in vain.
Former members of the PCB Board of Governors Nauman Butt and Shakil Sheikh had been leading the MRDC and the latter said on Thursday that for the PCB constitution would have to be amended to enforce the government’s decision.
“The government would have to take necessary steps by making changes in the PCBs constitution,” he told Dawn.
Nauman, meanwhile, said that the decision of the previous government had “served nothing” but added that the damage caused to the players would now be undone.

1,Serena to face Kovinic in US Open start as retirement looms,The 40-year-old American superstar will meet Kontaveit in the second round if both win their opening matches.,"NEW YORK: Serena Williams will face Danka Kovinic of Montenegro in her first round match at the US Open following the draw for the tournament made on Thursday.
Serena, the 23-time Grand Slam title winner who has hinted she will make the event her farewell tournament, is in the same quarter of the draw as second seed Anett Kontaveit of Estonia.
The 40-year-old American superstar, whose first Grand Slam title came at the 1999 US Open, would meet Kontaveit in the second round if both win their opening matches at the year’s final Grand Slam event, which begins on Monday.
Serena, who is one title shy of the all-time record 24 Slam crowns won by Margaret Court, could have quite a path to the final were she to make a shock run on the Flushing Meadows hardcourts.
She could face Canada’s 14th-seeded Leylah Fernandez, a 19-year-old who was last year’s US Open runner-up, in the fourth round and Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur, this year’s Wimbledon runner-up, in the quarter-finals.
The winner from Kontaveit’s quarter of the draw could meet Greek third seed Maria Sakkari or Romania’s seventh-seeded Simona Halep in the semi-finals.
The other half of the bracket features top seed Iga Swiatek of Poland, this year’s French Open champion, and Spanish fourth seed Paula Badosa.
Swiatek could meet US eighth seed Jessica Pegula in a quarter-final while Badosa could face sixth seed Aryna Sabalenka.
Japan’s Naomi Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion, is also in Badosa’s quarter of the draw.
She would meet defending champion Emma Raducanu, the 11th seed from Britain, in a third-round showdown and Sabalenka in the round of 16.
The men’s draw opened slightly with Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic, a 21-time Slam singles winner, pulling out just before the draw because he cannot enter the United States while unvaccinated for Covid-19.
Top-ranked defending champion Daniil Medvedev will face American Stefan Kozlov in his first match next week while second seed Rafael Nadal starts against Australian Rinky Hijikata.
Nadal, a men’s record 22-time Grand Slam champion seeking his fifth US Open title, could face Britain’s Cameron Norrie in the quarter-finals and countryman Carlos Alcaraz, the third seed, in the semi-finals.
Defending champion Medvedev could meet Greek fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the semi-finals and Canadian sixth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the quarter-finals.
Alcaraz has Polish eighth seed Hubert Hurkacz in his quarter of the draw while Norway’s fifth-seeded Casper Ruud is in Tsitsipas’s quarter.

2,"Bayern to play Barca in CL group stage, City meet Dortmund","Bayern and Barcelona will also come up against Inter Milan in Group ‘C’, which is completed by the Czech champions Viktoria Plzen.","ISTANBUL: Bayern Munich were placed in the same section as Robert Lewandowski’s Barcelona in Thursday’s draw for the UEFA Champions League group stage in Istanbul, while Erling Haaland will face his former club as Manchester City were paired with Borussia Dortmund.
Bayern and Barcelona will also come up against Inter Milan in Group ‘C’, which is completed by the Czech champions Viktoria Plzen.
Bayern beat Barcelona 8-2 in a one-off quarter-final in Lisbon in 2020, while the Catalans also lost 3-0 twice to the Germans last season as they were eliminated in the group stage.
Lewandowski, 34, signed for Barcelona during the close season for a fee that could reach 50 million euros ($49.9m) after scoring 344 goals in eight years at Bayern.
Haaland left Dortmund for Premier League champions City in the close season. Those sides will also face Sevilla and Danish champions FC Copenhagen in Group ‘G’.
Last season’s beaten finalists Liverpool will play Ajax, Napoli and Rangers in Group ‘A’, while reigning champions Real Madrid will face Celtic as well as RB Leipzig and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group ‘F’.
Meanwhile, Paris St Germain — who again start among the favourites to win a trophy that has continued to escape them since the Qatari takeover of more than a decade ago — will meet Juventus as well as Benfica and Israeli champions Maccabi Haifa in Group ‘H’.
Chelsea, winners in 2021, will take on Serie A champions AC Milan as well as Red Bull Salzburg and Dinamo Zagreb in Group ‘E’, while Tottenham Hotspur will face last season’s Europa League winners Eintracht Frankfurt along with Sporting Lisbon and Marseille in Group ‘D’.
Porto and Atletico Madrid meet for the second season running in Group ‘B’, which also featured Bayer Leverkusen and Belgian champions Club Brugge.
This season’s group stage will begin with the first round of games on September 6 and 7.
All six matchdays will be played in the space of nine weeks, finishing on Nov­ember 1 and 2, with UEFA needing to complete the group stage before the World Cup begins on November 20.

Benzema was in red-hot form, scoring 15 times in the competition and lifting the trophy for a fifth time in his career after the Spanish side beat Liverpool in the final.
Ancelotti became the first coach to win Europe’s most prestigious club trophy four times. He first won the title with AC Milan in 2003 and 2007 before claiming it with Real in 2014.
When asked how he had become the most successful coach in the competition, Ancelotti said:  “The passion I have for the sport and the quality of the players.
“Last season there was a fantastic connection between the veterans and young ones, there was fantastic chemistry with the supporters that helped us reach an unbelievable achievement.”  On Benzema, Ancelotti said:  “Karim is not just a fantastic striker and top scorer, he’s a fantastic footballer, supported by great attitude day by day.
“Compared to last year, this year he improved his knowledge, he knows the game really well, how to manage the game and he’s a strong leader in the dressing room and a good friend of mine. We are lucky to have Karim.”  
Barcelona women’s Alexia Putellas won the women’s player of the year, beating England’s Beth Mead and Germany’s Lena Oberdorf to the top prize. Putellas, who won award last year along with the Ballon d’Or, netted 34 goals for Barcelona last season as the club won all the domestic trophies and reached the Cham­pions League final.

4,Anderson strikes before Rabada takes South Africa to 151 all out,MANCHESTER: James Anderson led a fine display by England’s quicks before South Africa tailender Kagiso Rabada took...,"MANCHESTER: James Anderson led a fine display by England’s quicks before South Africa tailender Kagiso Rabada took the Proteas to a total of 151 on Thursday’s first day of the second Test at Old Trafford.
Anderson, bowling from the end named after him on his Lancashire home ground, made the initial breakthrough by removing South Africa captain Dean Elgar during a morning session where South Africa slumped to 77-5 at lunch.
The 40-year-old England great then struck twice in two balls to reduce South Africa to 92-7 before tea on his way to figures of 3-32 in 15 overs But Rabada, with an innings top score of 36, and fellow fast bowler Anrich Nortje (10) checked England’s progress with a ninth-wicket partnership of 35.
That stand ended with the very first ball after tea when recalled seamer Ollie Robinson had Nortje lbw before Rabada was last man out after edging a drive off left-arm spinner Jack Leach to Joe Root at slip.
The true worth of South Africa’s total, however, will only become apparent when England bat.
Elgar, with World Test Championship leaders South Africa 1-0 up in a three-match series despite a fallible top order, took a calculated risk in deciding to bat first upon winning Thursday’s toss in overcast conditions that favoured fast bowlers.
His thinking was influenced by the recall of off-spinner Simon Harmer in place of left-arm quick Marco Jansen in the only change to the team that overwhelmed England by an innings and 12 runs in the first Test at Lord’s last week.
The pitch is expected to offer more turn later in the game.
Dropping the towering Jansen looked harsh particularly as he had both bowled well and made a valuable 48 during a low-scoring match where England, having won all four of their previous Tests, suffered their first defeat under the leadership duo of captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum.
None of the top order got near Jansen’s score on Thursday, with Keegan Petersen’s 21 the highest contribution by a specialist batsman, albeit one equalled by wicket-keeper Kyle Verreynne.
Anderson struck in just the fifth over when he had Sarel Erwee, fresh from a fine 73 at Lord’s, well caught by diving wicketkeeper Ben Foakes off an inside edge.
Elgar, Erwee’s opening partner, had a couple of reprieves before he fell for 12, with Robinson, in for Matthew Potts in the only change to England’s side at Lord’s, denied his wicket by a marginal no-ball.
Stuart Broad, coming on as first change, twice beat Elgar before he dismissed him, Jonny Bairstow holding a good low catch at third slip and he then removed Petersen with another catch in the cordon in a return of 3-37 in 11 overs.
Stokes (2-17) then got in on the act with just his third ball when Aiden Markram (14) top-edged a pull to Foakes. The all-rounder struck again when Rassie van der Dussen was lbw for 16, a tight decision upheld on review.
Anderson has done many things during a career that has seen him become the most successful fast bowler in Test history, but a hat-trick has eluded him.
He came close Thursday when he had Harmer and Keshav Maharaj plumb lbw with successive balls only to spear the hat-trick delivery, to Rabada, well down the legside.
The sun came out to make batting easier, but the change in conditions could not fully explain England’s curious decision to set increasingly defensive fields to Rabada, yet to score a first-class fifty.
Last man Lungi Ngidi played one of the shots of the innings when he drove Robinson down the ground for four, his lone scoring stroke before Rabada was dismissed.

5,Boult retains Test hopes after declining NZ contract,MELBOURNE: Trent Boult has not given up hope of playing Test cricket again despite declining a central contract with...,"MELBOURNE: Trent Boult has not given up hope of playing Test cricket again despite declining a central contract with New Zealand Cricket (NZC), the left-arm seamer said on Thursday.
Boult has negotiated a “significantly reduced role” with the Black Caps citing the need to spend time with his family though he remains open to stints in Twenty20 leagues.
Aware that not having a central contract would affect his chances of national selection, Boult hoped the Leeds Test against England in July would not prove his last. 
“I hope not,” said the seamer, who was picked for the three-match Chappell-Hadlee One-day Interna­tional series in Australia beginning on Sunday. 
“I’m fully aware that with the decision I made to give that contract back, it’s going to affect that selection. I’m taking it almost week by week really.   
“I know the next series is in Pakistan and then at my home ground against England in the new year, but it’s too far away to tell. 
“I’m going to leave that with New Zealand Cricket and respect their decision.”  
The paceman, who was part of the New Zealand squads that finished runners-up in the last two editions of the 50-overs World Cup, wanted to have another shot at winning one-day cricket’s biggest title in India next year. 
“It’s only a few months around the corner and there’s a lot of hunger to try to have another crack at that trophy.”  
Boult reiterated he gave up his central contract primarily to be able to spend more time with family. 
“I’ve got three young boys that only see dad for eight weeks a year at the current moment. 
“If I don’t play any international cricket — obviously I still want to — then that might be a couple of leagues a year and 10 months at home rather than the other way around.”

Number five seed Lee was one of the main contenders for the title this week in Tokyo but he fell into an early hole that he could not dig himself out of, going down 21-19, 11-21, 21-19.
Three of the top five men’s seeds in Tokyo have now crashed out before the quarter-finals as Lee joined number two seed Kento Momota and number three Anders Antonsen in making an early exit.
Danish number one seed Viktor Axelsen made it through to the quarter-finals with a 21-19, 21-16 win over Thailand’s Sitthikom Thammasin, but India’s Lakshya Sen and China’s Shi Yuqi both fell by the wayside.
Rising star Sen came into the tournament fresh from winning gold at the Commonwealth Games but he could not find a way past Indian compatriot HS Prannoy in a 17-21, 21-16, 21-17 loss.
Prannoy, who stunned Momota in the second round, now faces the world number 23 Zhao in the quarter-finals.
Shi was returning from a 10-month ban from the Chinese Badminton Association for making  “inappropriate comments” following a 2021 match where he withdrew on match point.
Indonesian Anthony Sinisuka Ginting nipped his comeback in the bud with a 21-11, 13-21, 21-18 win and the number six seed’s reward was a quarter-final match-up against Axelsen.
Defending champion Loh Kean Yew also reached the quarter-finals after opponent Angus Ng of Hong Kong withdrew during the second game.
On the women’s side, defending champion and number one seed Akane Yamaguchi made short work of Japanese compatriot Sayaka Takahashi in a 21-18, 21-7 win.
Yamaguchi will next face former world number one Carolina Marin after the Spaniard fended off four match points to beat China’s He Bingjiao 16-21, 21-15, 22-20.

Antonio Colak tapped in the winner for the Glasgow side on the hour after Milik Tillam robbed PSV defender Andre Ramalho and slipped the ball across the box to the Croatian forward who made no mistake.
Rangers reached the Europa League final last season, losing to Eintracht Frankfurt, and their return to the group stage of the Champions League completes an impressive turn-around for the Scottish club.
Twelve months ago, Colak was public enemy number one for Ibrox fans when  he scored twice for Malmo to give the Swedish club victory over Rangers  in the third qualifying round.
“It’s difficult to describe in words, it was a great team performance. It’s an amazing journey we’ll have this year and I’m so proud of all of these guys,” said Colak.
“I was in tears on the pitch, it was just a moment of joy. As a kid I always wanted to compete at this level and to be here is amazing,” he added.
With Celtic also in the group stage, Scotland will have both their giants in the elite competition for the first time since 2007/08.
Dinamo Zagreb needed extra time to get past Norway’s Bodo/Glimt 4-1, securing a 4-2 aggregate win, after letting their early advantage slip.
Mislav Orsic fired Dinamo ahead from a tight angle in the fourth minute and then a brilliant bicycle kick from Bruno Petkovic extended the lead, making it 2-1 on aggregate.
But the Norwegian champions fought their way back into the game with Albert Gronbaek levelling the tie on aggregate in the 70th minute with a shot which Dinamo keeper Dominik Livakovic should have kept out.
But early in the second period of extra time Dinamo restored their advantage with a composed finish from the edge of the box by Josip Drmic and then made sure of victory with a goal on the break from Petar Bockaj.
Australian international goalkeeper Mathew Ryan pulled off a string of  impressive saves as Copenhagen resisted a Trabzonspor side looking to  overturn a 2-1 first leg deficit. The second leg ended 0-0.

Big-hitting Lynn, the highest run-scorer in the BBL but dropped by the Brisbane Heat after the last edition, was announced as one of the marquee players in the International League T20 (ILT20) earlier this month.
Cricket Australia, which owns the BBL, could have denied Lynn the “no objection certificate” he needs to play in the ILT20 but have taken a pragmatic approach in an increasingly competitive player market.
The 32-year-old top order batter will be available for only 11 of the Strikers’ 14 regular season games before heading off to the UAE in mid January to play in the ILT20 with CA’s blessing. 
“Cricket Australia welcomes the Adelaide Strikers’ signing of Chris Lynn for 11 out of 14 games in the upcoming season,” a CA spokesperson said. 
“Lynn does not hold a CA or state contract and has not done so since his last Queensland Cricket contract expired in June 2019. Each matter regarding release for overseas competitions is subject to the individual’s circumstances. 
“Our guiding principle remains the prioritisation and protection of Australia’s domestic summer of cricket and the interests of the game overall.” 
Australia opener David Warner will play in the BBL for the first time in 10 seasons after signing a lucrative deal with the Sydney Thunder.

Ballance, who played 23 tests for England and had previously apologised to Rafiq in November, added in a statement published in The Cricketer that he had used  “unacceptable — at times, racist — language” in his presence.
“If I had realised how much this hurt Azeem, I would have stopped immediately,” Ballance said.  “That’s why I wanted to meet him this week and be clear in person that I intended no malice.
“That’s not an excuse, I realise the language I used was wrong. I have accepted, from the outset, the words I used were wrong and I hope this statement brings Azeem some comfort.
“There is no place in our sport for this behaviour and I am determined to play my part in ridding the game from racism and make it more inclusive. To do this we all need to be honest and learn from our past mistakes.”  
Rafiq, a former England Under-19s captain of Pakistani descent, told a British parliamentary committee last year of  “inhuman” treatment at Yorkshire and described the sport in England as riddled with racism.
On Thursday, he welcomed the apology from Ballance.
“He has done cricket and the fight against racism a great service with these words,” Rafiq said.  “I would also like to thank those who have been in contact with me privately to apologise for what they witnessed.”  Rafiq added:  “Gary has been brave to admit the truth and I understand why the mental strain has made it difficult for him to make this apology any sooner.
“Gary must be applauded for his honesty and unreserved apology and must now be allowed to get on with his life.”

15,"Indo-Pak matches help ‘spread love and kindness’, says coach Saqlain",Images of Babar Azam and Virat Kohli shaking hands with broad smiles have won hearts.,"DUBAI: Matches between India and Pakistan tend to be high-voltage contests, where emotions come out in their purest form, but for Pakistan head coach Saqlain Mushtaq games between the arch-rivals are about spreading the message of love and kindness.
The images that came out of the ICC Academy in Dubai on Wednesday — one of which showed Pakistan skipper Babar Azam and Indian batting superstar Virat Kohli shake hands with broad smiles on their faces — heartened Saqlain.
The two teams, who don’t play bilateral cricket against each other because of tense diplomatic relations between the neighbouring countries, meet for the first time in more than ten months on Sunday for their Asia Cup opener.
Indian and Pakistani players meeting each other reminded Saqlain of his experience during the Cricket All-Stars event in the United States seven years ago where fans stitched the countries’ flags together.
“Few years ago I went to play the Cricket All-Stars and world cricket’s 25 big names were present there,” Saqlain said during a media talk on Thursday.
“However, only Pakistani and Indian fans were there [to watch the matches]. The fans had stitched both [the countries’] flags. It showed that cricket is not just sports or entertainment; it is something that unites the humanity.”
The former Pakistan skipper said it was natural to be emotional while playing India, but it was also an opportunity to send out a bigger message.
“We do have emotions for our country when we play a match but the pictures that came out yesterday portrayed a positive image,” said Saqlain. “We try our best to give the message of kindness and love and that is why our players go to meet the Indian players and its vice-versa.”
Pakistan will be missing pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi after the left-armer was ruled out due to a knee injury he picked up during the national side’s recent Test tour to Sri Lanka.
Fast bowlers Haris Rauf and Naseem Shah — who is yet to make his Twenty20 International debut — will be Pakistan’s next best options. Pacer Mohammad Hasnain is also available for selection as he returns after fixing his bowling action which was declared illegal earlier this year.
Saqlain shrugged off chances of any doubts emerging due to Shaheen’s absence and said the other members of the Pakistan pace attack were experienced enough to handle responsibility.
“All three [Shaheen, Haris and Naseem] have executed Pakistan’s requirements and plans very well since a long time,” he said.
“The captain, myself as the head coach, and the support staff have full confidence in them. I think we shouldn’t have doubts in this situation.
“Shaheen, obviously, lead [the bowling] and isn’t available unfortunately. But all the three bowlers are such that in any given situation of the day, they can change the game,” added the head coach hours before fast bowling all-rounder Mohammad Wasim was taken to the hospital for an MRI scan after complaining of back pain.
The scorching heat in Dubai and how the six sides participating in the main round of the Asia Cup has also come into focus with temperatures soaring past 40 degrees Celsius. Saqlain believed much importance shouldn’t be attached to the conditions at play.
“I think these are the requirements of professionalism and you can’t think too much about these things,” said the 45-year-old.
“[The players] need to adapt, cope and adjust according to the plans and execute them.
“We are not soft and the players are expected to be tough. Also, I don’t think the weather is too bad.”
ROHIT PLAYS DOWN HYPE
India will be looking to avenge their defeat to Pakistan in last year’s T20 World Cup and go all the way in the continental tournament and their cap­t­a­in Rohit Sharma has also downplayed the hype surrounding Sunday’s game.
“Everyone watches the game and it’s a high-pressure game without a doubt, but within the group we want to create a normal atmosphere,” he told Star Sports.
“We don’t want to hype this game too much. It’s important to tell the players who haven’t played against Pakistan or played them just one or two times that it’s just another opposition.”
Sharma was the captain of the Indian team when they last won the Asia Cup in 2018. Kohli, who was the full-time captain back then, had given the tournament a miss but he is available this time around.
India, however, are without marquee pacers like Jasprit Bumrah and Harshal Patel in the tournament.
