During the scuffle, the glass of the entrance gate of the centre was damaged. Speaking to Dawn, CDA Member Engineering Syed Munawar Shah said that CDA has directed the person who got the centre booked for elections to make repairs immediately.
“Those who damaged the glass will fix it otherwise we have to other options – one we can forfeit their security amount and secondly we can get a first information report (FIR) registered against those involved in breaking the glass,” the member said.
He, however, said that real estate agents have agreed to get the glass fixed. Elections between two rival groups – founder group led by Sardar Tahir and progressive group led by Atif Jamil Butt were being held. It is said that a police official was also injured after being hit by a piece of broken glass.
Later on, the Butt Group held a press conference in National Press Club alleging polling of fake votes by the opposition group. 
However, polling was restarted and till the filing of this report, the results were not announced. Supporters of Sardar Tahir Group claimed that the Butt Group in fear of defeat, tried to halt the election process. A real estate agent said that there were 3,200 registered voters and out of them 400 because of expired renewal of membership, were not illegible to poll votes.

2,Probe launched after several land files of D-13 found missing,CDA official says probe ordered after suspicious activity found during digitisation of records,"ISLAMABAD: After the alleged fraudulent allotment of plots in D-13 a few years ago, a scam of missing files in the same sector has surfaced now.
Sources in the revenue department of the CDA told Dawn that during a recent inspection conducted by the member estate, the records of a number of files of D-13 and some files of E-13 were found missing.
A few days ago, said the sources, the member ordered a fact-finding inquiry which was currently being conducted by the security directorate of the CDA.
CDA spokesperson Syed Asif Raza, when contacted, said during digitisation of the records of D-13, “we found some suspicious activity, therefore, we ordered a probe to check the entire record.” He confirmed that the probe was in progress.

CDA official says probe ordered after suspicious activity found during digitisation of records

“Yes, a probe has been ordered and we are looking why files are missing and what is the role of CDA officials in it,” added an officer of the CDA.
He said the security directorate had been asked to complete the probe as soon as possible. “We will not spare anyone involved in the case,” he said.
It may be noted that earlier this year the security directorate had unearthed the fraudulent allotment of seven plots in D-13.
The sources said former additional director land Sobia Toru had earlier this year informed the security directorate that two plots in D-13 had been allotted with her fake signatures.
During the preliminary probe of the two plots, it transpired that at least seven such plots had been allotted with fake signatures. The probe committee also pointed out that the plots were allotted against fake claims of land as the allottees had no land in Shah Allah Ditta but were allotted alternative plots using fake claims.
The security directorate of the CDA during the last few years had pointed out a number of fraud cases and foiled many attempts to transfer plots on bogus documents. The sources said a tehsildar of the CDA has also in writing submitted that the record of some files in D-13 was missing.
The security directorate in 2019 had unearthed a massive scam of back-dated allotment of plots in I-12 and I-11. It raised questions on the allotment of around 200 plots, with backdated signatures, at a time when allotment was banned.
In 2017, the now defunct Ministry of Capital Administration and Development Division (CADD) banned the allotment of choice plots to land-affected people in various developed sectors.
Meanwhile, the land directorate prepared a list of vacant plots in different sectors such as I-11 and -12. Officials alleged that after the ban was imposed, the vacant plots, which were available in the lists, were shown  allotted to various people, meaning that these allotments were made with backdate signatures. However, surprisingly, all such allotment of plots is still intact.

3,PTI to move court to foil govt’s bid to ‘delay’ Islamabad LG polls,Says the plan to thwart the attempts of the federal government to escape from local government elections is finalised,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has decided to move the court against the passage of a bill in parliament increasing the number of union councils in Islamabad from 101 to 125, a move which would result in a delay of local bodies polls in the federal capital.
The decision was taken during a high-level meeting chaired by Central Secretary General Asad Umar. In the meeting, the former ruling party decided to approach the court and instructed its legal team to prepare a constitutional petition in this regard.
The PTI said the plan to thwart the attempts of the federal government to escape from local government elections was finalised. The party also discussed measures to stop the “imported government’s attempt to use the parliament undemocratically” for the delay in the polls.
Meanwhile, Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq on Thursday clubbed petitions filed by PTI and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), and Jamaat-i-Islami pertaining to local government elections in Islamabad scheduled to be held on Dec 31.
Justice Farooq issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan and the federal government on the petition filed by PTI leader Ali Awan and a PML-N candidate contesting from UC-Tarlai.
PTI’s Awan is seeking contempt proceedings against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his cabinet for increasing the number of union councils from 101 to 125 and introducing direct election for the post of Islamabad’s mayor. It may be noted that the ECP had rejected these amendments, which were brought at a time when the local government elections were just round the corner.
The PML-N nominee, however, challenged the ECP’s decision of conducting the elections as per schedule on Dec 31. Meanwhile, JI, in its petition, requested that polls be held as per the announced schedule.
During the course of the hearing, Attorney General (AG) Ashtar Ausaf Ali and Islamabad Advocate General Jahangir Khan Jadoon appeared before the court.
Mr Awan’s counsel argued that the government had increased the number of UCs from 50 to 101 about five months ago. He said that the federal government once again increased the number of UCs from 101 to 125 days before the elections day.
AG Ali informed the court that the petitioner did not challenge the notification of the increase in UCs. Justice Farooq inquired from the ECP director general if the commission was aware of the said development. The DG replied that the ECP perused the said notification and passed an appropriate order. He said that the ECP declared that the local government elections in Islamabad would be held as per schedule.
Justice Farooq asked the PTI counsel if the election watchdog was conducting elections as per schedule then how could there be grounds for contempt proceedings in the case. Mr Awan told the court that the government was going to legislate on the matter through parliament.

After approval of the structure plan, it will be sent to Deputy Commissioner Shoaib Ali to discuss it in the District Planning and Design Committee (DPDC) and notify after consultation with stakeholders.
The 61st meeting of the governing body of the RDA was held with Chairman Tariq Mahmood Murtaza in the chair.
“The basic aim of the peri-urban structure plan is to identify the areas in two tehsils of the district to allocate for industry, commercial, housing schemes and educational purposes. It will also put red lines on green areas where no structure will be constructed,” said RDA Director General Saif Anwar Jappa while talking to Dawn.
He said in the first step, RDA had prepared the plan for Gujar Khan and Kallar Syedan and after its approval a plan will be made forTaxila and Kahuta next month.
He said the government had assigned the task to RDA to make the peri-urban structure plan for four tehsils while for the fifth tehsil - Rawalpindi - the local government had hired the same consultant for preparing the plan.
According to the procedure, he said, the DPDC will review the plan for Gujar Khan and Kallar Syedan and will hold a public hearing. After rectifying the objections, the deputy commissioner will notify the areas allocated for industry, commercial, residential and green areas.
He said the RDA governing body held detailed discussions and decided to endorse the consultant’s proposal regarding peri-urban structure plan/side development zone in respect of Gujar Khan and Tehsil Kallar Syedan.
The governing body constituted a committee comprising the chief engineer, director admin and finance and others to give suggestions.
The Planning and Design Committee (DPDC), headed by the deputy commissioner, will take a decision under the Local Government Rules 2020 after a consultative meeting with the stakeholders.
The committee was of the view that if the DPDC needed any input from the consultant, the consultant and the director MP&TE will assist it.
On the other hand, the governing body also directed the land use and planning wing of the RDA to refer the matter regarding implementation of Rule 45 of Punjab Development Authorities Private Housing Scheme Rules 2021 for consultation.
The governing body has directed the consultant to make a presentation on the proposed peri-urban structure plan/side development zone for two tehsils of Taxila and Kahuta in the next meeting.

This was highlighted at an event organised in the capital focused on maritime security.
The two-day International Maritime Symposium concluded on Thursday with a focus on maritime security in the context of regional connectivity.
The symposium was organised by National Institute of Maritime Affairs (NIMA), the International Maritime Symposium (IMS) and the theme of the event was ‘Geo-Economic Dimensions of Indian Ocean Region (IOR) - Opportunities for Region and Beyond’. Speakers from home and abroad presented their views about the geo-economic importance of IOR.
Air Marshal Zahid Mahmood, vice chief of air staff was the chief guest. Retired Vice Admiral Iftikhar Rao spoke about maritime regional threats and challenges. He talked about the Malacca strait choke point and its importance for the world, especially China.  He also pointed out that Gwadar was a commercial port and its security was vital for economic dividends.
Dr Christian Beuger from University of Copenhagen, talked about the Security of Sealines of Communications (SLOCs) and emphasised on a collaborative strategy in IOR to meet non-conventional threats. 
In his remarks, Prof Azhar Ahmed from Bahria University was of the view that geo-economics was an instrument to achieve the objectives of geo-politics. He underscored that without political stability, no country could progress.
In his views, Air Marshal Mahmood highlighted the importance of maritime security and its link with national security. He emphasised on the need of developing operational strategies to meet maritime security threats. Dr Hassan Daud Butt of Bahria University spoke about the need for regional connectivity, both on land and over sea.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, who was the key note speaker, deliberating on the current global security scenario, said that this was the most dangerous decade after World War II. “The world is witnessing historic changes; economic and global powers are emerging from the East,” he said, adding that the next war was expected to be at sea and not on land. Pakistan needed to ensure fool proof maritime security.
The message of the prime minister of Pakistan was also read out during the session. While emphasising on the maritime security of Pakistan, the PM highlighted that Pakistan was heavily dependent on its sea lines of communications. Over 90 percent of Pakistan’s trade and almost 100 percent of its energy imports were through sea. Any disruption in maritime trade would have serious repercussions for national security. The government was well aware of this and was providing all out support to the maritime security apparatus especially to the Pakistan Navy.
Vice Admiral Faisal Rasool Lodhi, vice chief of the naval staff was chief guest at the closing session. 
He said that effective security was essential towards protecting the expanding maritime economic activities in Pakistan, the region and beyond. Pakistan needs proactive diplomacy, well considered economic policies and risk management as important ingredients to harness and sustain the pace of development and potential growth.
The symposium was attended by maritime professionals, security experts, academia, think tanks and media personnel.

People have also been urged to not travel via motorcycles. Transportation of police personnel should be carried out though official vehicles and use of motorcycles should be discouraged to avoid accidents, according to a directive issued by the inspector general of police (IGP) Punjab.
Under the guideline, the security apparatus should be put in place before the commencement of programmes till the complete dispersal of participants after closing of the ceremony. Extensive patrolling around the venue by the Dolphin Squad, Prompt Response Unit (PRU) and police mobiles shall be an integral component of the security plans.
Along with striking awe and fear in the hearts of criminals, the Quick Response Force (QRF) and Elite Police Force (EPF) teams will also be stationed at strategic points, the guideline stated.
Cable operators and flex manufacturers shall be directed not to broadcast or prepare any provocative material at the behest of any individual or organisation.
Provision of security is the responsibility of the police, however, police officials should not be oblivious to their own security at the same time. Law enforcement agencies are always at the top on the spectrum of threats by terrorist groups, hence all precautionary measures should be taken, the directive stated.
A similar guideline was issued to police for security arrangements ahead of Christmas which will be held throughout Pakistan on Dec 25. In view of the current threat perception and security situation, terrorists may attempt to perpetrate any act of terrorism or disrupt peace so the police have been directed to take all possible security measures including engagement of district peace committees to ensure peace.
Under the guideline, multilayer (3/4) security cover will be given to all churches, other places of congregation, parking, recreational places, Christian localities and colonies, missionary schools, diplomatic missions in particular where Christmas and new year celebrations are held.
A special emphasis shall be laid on security of foreigners working or residing in connection with different projects. Intelligence based IBO operations in the vicinity of churches and Christian colonies have been carried out. Activities of religious extremists, individuals placed on the watch list and other mischievous elements shall be monitored carefully.
Celebratory firing and wheelies during New Year’s have claimed many lives in the past henceforth strict legal action should be taken against violators of rules. Previous record holders, drivers as well as mechanics may be bound in advance and motorcycles prepared may be seized to save human lives.
“No festivity at the cost of human lives will be allowed,” the IGP’s guideline said.

10,Rapid population growth aggravates vulnerabilities of poor: experts,Shafqat Kakakhel says world population reached the mark of eight billion on November 15.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan contributes less than one per cent to global carbon dioxide (CO2)emissions, yet it has suffered enormous human and economic losses due to climate-related disasters. Rapid population growth aggravated the pre-existing vulnerabilities of poor people, especially children and women.
This was stated by retired ambassador Shafqat Kakakhel, Chairperson Board of Governors Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), in his address at a dialogue arranged by the Population Council on “Climate and population at COP27” at the 23rd annual conference of the Population Association of Pakistan (PAP).
He said population was not included in the agenda of COP27, yet the floods in Pakistan provided a compelling background in terms of minimising the devastation of climate change by reducing the population to sustainable levels.
He said that world population reached the mark of eight billion on November 15 and 2022 was also the sixth hottest year of the planet earth. Concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has now reached levels 50pc higher than the start of industrial revolution.
In her welcome remarks, Dr Zeba Sathar, Country Director Population Council, said: “Pakistan floods 2022 manifested the intensity of devastation caused by the climate change. Overlooking of population growth at COP27 is unwarranted as both are intrinsically intertwined. We need to make sure that resources provided through climate justice should go to most affected people for restoration of their livelihood and ensuring of food security”.
She also said climate change impacts lead to migration, increase in population density and maternal and child mortality which could be mitigated by curbing the rapid population growth through comprehensive family planning programmes.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed said: “Population management has been included in the political discourse through a unanimous resolution on the alarming rate of population growth passed by the Senate of Pakistan on January 20, 2020. This landmark resolution is a testimony of the seriousness of political support for population issues and followed by the establishment of a parliamentary forum on population to ensure cross-party political commitment and to advocate for population legislation in the parliament”.
Meanwhile, Ministry of National Health Services in collaboration with WHO commemorated the universal health day with the aim to raise awareness on the need for strong, equitable and resilient health systems and universal health coverage (UHC).
Minister of State Dr Mahesh Kumar Malani and WHO representative Dr Palitha Mahipala were chief guests at the ceremony. The event was attended by representatives from federal and provincial health departments, UN agencies, health development partners and other stakeholders.
In a statement, health minister Abdul Qadir Patel said the government was fully committed to the sustainable development goals and ensuring health and well-being of the people. Achieving universal health coverage is a foundational driver of inclusive and sustainable economic growth. Maintaining progress towards UHC is challenging and is first and foremost a political choice. Effective primary health care (PHC)-oriented systems are the bedrock of equitable and resilient health systems that deliver high-quality, health care to everyone.”
He added that strong political commitment from national and provincial/dederating area governments and partner organisations was an essential ingredient for overcoming barriers.
The WHO representative said this year UHC day theme “Build the world we want: a healthy future for all” emphasised that to build strong health systems we need equity, trust, healthy environments, investments and accountability.
