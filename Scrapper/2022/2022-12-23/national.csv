0,Speaker ready to call PTI MNAs again to verify resignations,Claims several members do not want to quit assembly,"ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf has decided to once again invite the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers to appear before him in person for verification of their resignations, which they had submitted after a successful vote on the no-confidence resolution against then prime minister Imran Khan in April, and reiterated his stance that he would not accept these resignations collectively.
In a video message here on Thursday, the NA speaker said he would soon allocate time for each PTI lawmaker to personally appear before him in his chamber for verification of his/her resignations.
The announcement from the speaker came a day after PTI Senator Shibli Faraz stated that his party had decided that its lawmakers would not go to the Parliament House, and instead, the PTI would approach the Supreme Court to seek acceptance of the mass resignations despite the fact that six days back, PTI’s senior vice-chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi had written a letter to the speaker, asking him to allocate some time for the party’s MNAs to verify their resignations.
Mr Ashraf in his video message said that his secretariat had already written a reply to Mr Qureshi’s letter, informing him that the PTI lawmakers would be issued notices asking them to appear before him for verification of their resignations as required under the rules. 

Claims several members do not want to quit assembly

He, however, said in categorical terms that the PTI lawmakers would have to come to his chamber “one by one” to satisfy him that they had submitted the resignations voluntarily and without any pressure.
The speaker claimed that a number of PTI lawmakers had approached him and asked him not to accept their resignations. He said the PTI lawmakers had told him that they were not in favour of leaving the forum of the parliament and even opposed the idea of en masse resignations in one of the party meetings, but they had to sign the resignations in line with the party’s “collective decision”. Moreover, he quoted the unidentified PTI lawmakers to have told him that they remained silent believing that their leadership was doing all this as a political move to put pressure on the government for early elections and the decision would not be implemented in the real sense.
Mr Ashraf said that he personally wished to see all the PTI lawmakers returning to the assembly to represent their constituents and discuss the public issues on the forum of the parliament. However, he said, if they still wanted to resign, then they would have to “satisfy” him that their resignations were genuine and had not submitted under duress. He claimed that most of the resignations were not hand-written as required under the rules and had similar text.
Mr Ashraf refuted the impression that he was delaying the acceptance of the resignations in violation of the rules, stating that he would make decision in accordance with the laws and rules.
“No one should have any doubt that I will violate the rules. No one can use me,” claimed Mr Ashraf in an apparent reference to the allegations by the PTI that he had been delaying the acceptance of the resignations for political gains and at the behest of the coalition government.
Mr Ashraf recalled that he had invited the PTI lawmakers in June to appear before him for verification of the resignations, but no one turned up thus implying that they did not want to quit the assembly.
The decision to resign en masse from the assembly had been taken at the PTI’s parliamentary party meeting, chaired by Imran Khan, and it was announced by PTI vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi on the floor of the assembly just minutes before election of Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister on April 11.
Former deputy speaker Qasim Suri, who was then functioning as the acting speaker, immediately accepted the resignations and directed the NA Secretariat to issue a notification. On April 14, the PTI had through social media released the NA Secretariat’s notification declaring that 123 party MNAs “resigned from their seats by writing under their hand” to the speaker. The notification, signed by NA Secretary Tahir Hussain, had declared that after submission of the resignations their seats had become vacant in terms of Article 64(1) of the Constitution, with effect from April 11. However, soon after his election as the speaker, Mr Ashraf directed the Secretariat staff to stop the process, and gave the ruling that he would verify each and every resignation.

1,IHC grants post-arrest bail to suspect in hate speech case,Counsel argues that registration of FIR on basis of private messages was “breach of the right to privacy”.,"ISLAMABAD: Justice Babar Sattar of the Islam­abad High Court (IHC) granted post-arrest bail on Thursday to a hate speech suspect against production of Rs50,000 surety bonds. 
The Federal Investigation Agency’s cyber crimes wing had registered an FIR aga­inst the suspect on Oct 15. 
According to the petitioner’s counsel, this was a “unique case” as police arrested the petitioner first and during analysis of his mobile phone, recovered some ‘objectionable’ content from its storage. The agency then booked the petitioner on the basis of the recovered content under section 11 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), and sections 295-A and 298-A of Pakistan Penal Code, the petitioner said. 
The FIA arrested the suspect on a complaint that he was uploading ‘hate material’ on his YouTube channel. 
The investigation agency did not find evidence during scrutiny of the petitioner’s mobile phone data, the counsel claimed. The cyber crimes wing registered an FIR on the basis of private messages the investigators found in the storage, he added.  
The counsel argued that registration of an FIR on the basis of private messages between two individuals was a “breach of the right to privacy”. 
Additional Attorney General Usman Warraich contended before the court that the complainant in the case had alleged the petitioner sent him a blasphemous video through a YouTube link. 
But he conceded that the agency was unable to recover the video from the suspect’s mobile phone. 
Justice Sattar noted that the alleged objectionable material was sent through Facebook messenger by the petitioner to his friend and since this was a private chat, it was not in the public domain. 
“There is no other material on record to establish that the petitioner had prepared or disseminated inf­or­mation to advance inter-faith, sectarian or racial hatred,” the court observed. 
Justice Sattar further noted that the prosecution did not place any evidence against the petitioner to show that he uttered derogatory remarks against revered personalities. 
He granted post-arrest bail to the petitioner with an observation that the “state has failed to establish that sufficient material exists on record that supports a belief by this court that the petitioner is guilty of an offence punishable for period of ten years for purposes of section 295-A or for the offences under section 11 of Peca and section 298-A and 109 of PPC”.  
Sections 295-A and 298 outline punishment for “de­­liberate and malicious acts” to outrage religious feelings and “derogatory remarks in respect of holy personages”, respectively, while Section 109 outlines punishment for abetment of a crime.

2,12m to face poverty in flood-hit areas: report,Says estimates indicate an increase in multi-dimensional poverty from 37.8pc to 43.7pc.,"ISLAMABAD: The supplemental report to the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) of Pakistan Floods 2022 fears that an additional 1.9 million households — around 12.1 million people — will be pushed into multidimensional poverty in calamity-hit districts of Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
These individuals and households will experience significantly increased deprivations around access to adequate health, sanitation, quality maternal care, electricity, and loss of assets. Estimates indicate an increase in multi-dimensional poverty from 37.8 per cent to 43.7 per cent, according to the supplement report published on Thursday.
The number of additional households falling into non-monetary poverty will be the highest in Sindh (4.8 million households), followed by KP (4.6 million households), and Punjab and Balochistan (both with an additional 1.2 million households). However, poverty rates will be the highest in Balochistan (81.1pc), followed by KP (60.6pc) and Sindh (54.9pc).
The report says between 87pc and 91pc of households in flood-affected rural areas are owner-occupiers, urban areas have a higher share of tenants (18 to 31pc). Female-headed households are a small share of the owned units in affected provinces, ranging between 4pc in rural Balochistan and 11pc in urban Sindh. 
Led by the Planning Commission and supported by ADB, the European Union and the United Nations, the supplemental report provides further analysis of the human impact assessment and the full 17 sector assessment. 
The geographic coverage of the PDNA is limited to 94 calamity-hit districts as of October 11, 2022, in Balochistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh.
Analysis of multidimensional poverty at the national level indicates an increase from 11.3pc to 15.5pc of the population in calamity-hit districts will be deprived of access to an improved source of water, representing an additional 1.5m households. Limited access to safe drinking water will increase the risk of waterborne and communicable diseases and infections, thus placing more pressure on overstretched health services, perpetuating a vicious cycle of disease and poverty.
Estimates indicate that the food-insecure population will increase from 7m to 14.6m people in the calamity-hit districts. The additional number of people in need of food assistance is the highest in Sindh (4.3m), followed by KP (1.7m), Punjab (0.9m), and Balochistan (0.8m).
The most impacted population groups include marginalised poor people who are dependent on informal labour/agriculture wage labour, persons with disabilities, and smallholders who cannot afford to buy agricultural inputs to resume their farming activities. Expected delays in the sowing of rabi crops, particularly wheat, is likely to further exacerbate the already precarious food security situation.
Food shortages and widespread disease associated with increased deprivation on access to safe drinking water and sanitation will have a significant impact on stunting rates in the long term.

4,Three remanded in FIA custody over Bajwa data leak,Govt ordered an investigation on Nov 21 into the leak of legally protected tax information of Gen Bajwa’s family.,"ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad court remanded three suspects in custody of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Thursday in connection with the income tax data leak of former army chief retired Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa. 
The federal government had ordered an investigation on Nov 21 into the leak of legally protected tax information of Gen Bajwa’s family. 
When the FIA produced the three suspects — Shahzad Niaz, Arshad Ali Qureshi and Mohammad Adeel Ashraf — before Judicial Magistrate Omer Shabbir, the prosecution stated that during the course of investigation, it was learnt that Qureshi had discarded his mobile phone on Nov 23, days after the leak of tax data of government functionaries on FactFocus, a website.
Shahzad Niaz and Ashraf also deleted tax data, which “they had accessed illegally”. 
Their mobile phones were sent for forensic analysis to enable the investigators to extract data obtained by the suspects, according to the prosecution. 
During further investigation, it was ‘established’ that Niaz had been “illegally facilitating Qureshi” since 2018 by providing him taxpayers’ records on payment of cash. 
According to the FIA, the amount to Qureshi was being sent by Sajid Aziz. 
The FIA requested the court to grant physical remand of the suspects for five days so that details about Sajid Aziz could be collected and records from bank and Easypaisa retrieved. 
The judge noted that since investigation was already under way, declining the request for physical remand would amount to halting the process. 
Custody of the three suspects was given to the FIA till Dec 24.

5,Heavy fog disrupts flight schedules across Punjab,Task force formed to facilitate passengers.,"RAWALPINDI: Heavy fog and poor visibility disrupted flights scheduled to land at Sialkot, Multan and Lahore airports, with at least seven diverted to Islamabad on Thursday.
Another PIA flight from Multan to Islamabad was cancelled due to bad weather.
According to flight information, three international flights scheduled to land at Sialkot International Airport were diverted to Islamabad.
Another PIA flight, PK-790 from Toronto to Lahore, was also diverted to Islamabad due to poor visibility and foggy weather. The flights from Dubai, Jeddah and Baku were also diverted to Islamabad due to dense fog in Lahore.

Task force formed to facilitate passengers

A PIA spokesman said the flights diverted due to weather conditions will be operated soon as the conditions improve.
Anticipating more disruptions, the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) has constituted a task force to handle the complaints of passengers of delayed, cancelled or diverted flights.
A spokesman for the PCAA said the decision to form the task force at all major airports was taken due to the foggy weather conditions. He said airport managers will head the task force to facilitate the passengers of the affected flights.
The spokesman added poor visibility and thick fog result in delays, cancellations and diversion of flights every year.
This leads to congestion at airports and causes inconvenience to passengers and their family members
The task force will ensure coordination with airlines, the Federal Investigation Agency and the Airport Security Force to facilitate passengers.
It will also coordinate with airlines’ staff to make arrangements for the accommodation, food and transport facilities for passengers. He added the task force will also communicate with the traffic police to ensure that there was no rush in the airport’s parking.
Moreover, airlines have been asked to inform passengers about departure times over phone to avoid inconvenience.
The task force will ensure up-to-date information is conveyed through display systems at airports.
The PCAA’s Airport Services Direc­to­rate has directed the airport managers of Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Multan, Qu­­etta, Faisalabad and Peshawar to ensure compliance with the directive regarding the constitution of the task force.

6,Shehbaz for solarisation of govt buildings before summer,"PM pays tribute to martyrs, expresses resolve to fight terrorism in all forms.","ISLAMABAD: In a bid to reduce the import bill and promote solar energy, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday directed authorities concerned to complete the solarisation of the government buildings before the onset of the summer season.
During a meeting, the PM said the utilisation of solar energy was inevitable to improve the economy by reducing the import bill of fuels. Calling for the promotion of solar energy by the private sector, he instructed all the departments to expedite the process of transparent bidding for the construction of solar power plants.
During the briefing, the prime minister was told that the federal cabinet had already approved a framework for the generation of electricity through solar energy instead of expensive imported fuels. Moreover, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority would define the tariff for mega solar projects by the end of this month which would follow the bidding procedure. 
The PM was apprised that three solar power plants were being planned which included a 1200MW project in Layyah, and two 600MW projects in Muzaffargarh, and Trimmu.

PM pays tribute to martyrs, expresses resolve to fight terrorism in all forms

According to the details, a consultant had been hired for the solarisation of government buildings. The premier said centralised and transparent procurement should be opted for by all the federal departments. The process should be started from the federal government buildings in Islamabad, he added.
Tribute to martyrs
While paying tribute to martyrs, PM Sharif said that the government was committed to establishing the writ of state at any cost and no one would be allowed to sabotage the hard-earned peace in the country. Addressing a ceremony held in the Prime Minister Office in connection with Christmas, the prime minister said, “Unfortunately our system suffered a lot due to decades-long terrorism in the country where our minorities remained under severe threat, but we had successfully eliminated terrorism in the country,” the PM said.
During the ceremony, the prime minister said Islam does not allow forced conversion. He said Islam and the constitution provided equal rights to all minorities. 
“The government also guarantees security. Where there is any injustice—no religion and government can tolerate it,” he added.
Earlier, the prime minister visited CMH, Rawalpindi, and inquired about the health of officers injured during the Bannu operation. The PM said the martyrs and their families rendered “supreme sacrifices for ensuring the safety and security of the people of Pakistan”. 
“We are determined to fight terrorism in its all forms and manifestations and breaking nexus between terrorists, their supporters and sympathisers till achieving peaceful and stable environment,” he said.

7,"Balochistan seeks more court benches, dual carriageways",Provincial assembly adopts two resolutions.,"QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly adopted two resolutions on Thursday, one demanding more high court benches to ensure speedy justice, especially for citizens living in far-flung areas, and the other for converting national highways into dual carriageways to curb road accidents, which have claimed 9,000 in the last two years.
However, another resolution moved by the provincial planning minister, Noor Muhammad Dummar, on shelling at civilians by Afghan forces in Chaman was disposed of by Acting Speaker Sardar Babar Khan Musakhail, who presided over the session, as it lacked the support of the majority members.
Nasarullah Zerey, a member of the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), moved the resolution on highways. He said the federal government had approved converting the Quetta-Zhob and Quetta-Karachi national highways into dual carriageways two years ago, but work could not be started yet.
He said many highways and roads had been built in Punjab and Sindh under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), but no road was built in Balochistan.
The second resolution, on more high court benches, was jointly moved by the parliamentary leader of the Awami National Party (ANP), Muhammad Asghar Achakzai, and Mir Akhtar Hussain Langove of the Balochistan National Party (Mengal).
They demanded the establishment of benches of the Balochistan High Court in Loralai, Sibi, Khuzdar and Turbat, which they said had already been approved by the authorities concerned.
They said people in far-flung areas of the province had to travel long distances to Quetta to file petitions and attend hearings.
