“Can’t say I expected this,” Ardern posted on social media after what she described as her  “faux pas with the old mic in parliament” raised the sum for New Zealand’s Prostate Cancer Foundation.
A microphone picked up New Zealand’s premier muttering the insult, aimed at political opponent David Seymour, following a heated exchange between the pair during a parliamentary session last week.
An exasperated Ardern was overheard saying  “he’s such an arrogant prick” as she retook her seat after answering a barbed question from Seymour, leader of the right-liberalist party ACT.
Seymour petitioned the speaker of New Zealand’s parliament to get an apology from Ardern, which meant her comment was entered into the official record, known as the Hansard.—

1,Elderly Covid patients fill hospital wards in China,CHONGQING: Elderly patients lined the wards of hospitals in major cities in China on Thursday as the country battled...,"CHONGQING: Elderly patients lined the wards of hospitals in major cities in China on Thursday as the country battled a wave of Covid cases.
The virus is surging across China in an outbreak authorities say is impossible to track after the end of mandatory mass testing.
Attached to a breathing tube under a pile of blankets, an old man racked with Covid-19 lay groaning on a stretcher in the emergency department of a hospital in central China.
A paramedic at Chongqing Medical University First Affiliated Hospital, who confirmed the old man was a Covid patient, said he had picked up more than 10 people a day, 80 to 90 percent of whom were infected with coronavirus. “Most of them are elderly people,” he said.
“A lot of hospital staff are positive as well, but we have no choice but to carry on working.” 
Millions of elderly people across China are still not fully vaccinated, raising concerns that the virus may kill the most vulnerable citizens in huge numbers. Under new government guidelines, however, many of those deaths would not be blamed on Covid. In Shanghai, the corridors of an emergency department were lined with stretchers filled with elderly people hooked up to oxygen tanks.
A reporter counted at least 15 such patients spilling out from the wards into the hallway, some with suitcases next to their trolleys. Swaddled in colourful duvets, they wheezed weakly through their masks as medical workers attended to them. Many appeared mostly unresponsive.
At a large crematorium on the rural outskirts of Chongqing, a long line of cars waited for parking spaces inside the compound on Thursday afternoon.
Dozens of bereaved relatives milled around in groups, some carrying wooden urns, as funeral gongs sounded and mourners burned incense.

2,Philippines boosts military in disputed sea after Chinese ‘encroachment’,"“Any encroachment in the West Philippine Sea is a threat to the security of Pagasa Island,” Philippine military says.","MANILA: The Philippines ordered its military to boost their presence in the South China Sea on Thursday, citing a  “threat” to a garrison in the disputed waterway after nearby Chinese  “activities”.
It comes two days after media reported that Beijing has begun reclaiming more land in the contested Spratly Islands, a major archipelago in the South China Sea that hosts military installations by a number of countries.
“Any encroachment in the West Philippine Sea or reclamation on the features therein is a threat to the security of Pagasa Island,” the Philippine defence department said.
Manila refers to the waters immediately west of the Philippines as the West Philippine Sea, while Pagasa Island, the second biggest in the Spratlys, is also known as Thitu Island.
The defence department said it had directed the armed forces  “to strengthen the country’s presence in the West Philippine Sea, following the monitored Chinese activities close to Pagasa Island”.
The agency did not specify the nature of the  “monitored Chinese activities”, but the Philippine military said its air and naval patrols had observed  “China militia vessels” in these areas.
Beijing claims almost all of the resource-rich South China Sea, through which trillions of dollars in trade passes annually.
Along with the Philippines, rival claimants are Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. China has ignored a 2012 ruling from a UN-backed tribunal that its claim is without basis.
In recent years it has built artificial islands on reefs while constructing military facilities and airstrips. Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing satellite images from US officials, that new land formations have emerged in the Spratlys, on Eldad Reef, Whitsun Reef, Lankiam Cay and Sandy Cay. China’s foreign ministry called the report  “completely groundless”.
A Philippine military statement said Thursday its regular air and naval patrols have  “observed the persistent presence of China militia vessels around areas stated in the Bloomberg article”. The statement did not say if the patrols monitored the reported reclamations themselves.
“WESCOM (the Philippines’ Western Military Command) shall continue conducting maritime patrols and sustaining our presence in the WPS (West Philippine Sea) to protect our nation’s territory and sovereign rights,” it said.

3,US to provide Patriot missile system to Ukraine,"“This is a very important step to create a secure air space for Ukraine,” says Zelensky.","WASHINGTON: The United States said on Wednesday it would provide Ukraine with the advanced Patriot air defence system to help counter Moscow’s relentless aerial attacks.
The system is part of $1.85 billion in security assistance unveiled in parallel with a visit to Washington by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, his first trip outside the country since Russia invaded in February.
The announcement is a significant victory for Kyiv, which had repeatedly pushed Washington for the Patriot system, and a strong sign of US support for Ukraine.
“Today’s assistance for the first time includes the Patriot Air Defence System, capable of bringing down cruise missiles, short-range ballistic missiles, and aircraft at a significantly higher ceiling than previously provided air defense systems,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.
The security assistance package features one Patriot battery, which consists of a command centre, a radar station to detect incoming threats, and missile launchers.
The package also includes tens of thousands of rounds of artillery, rocket and tank ammunition, mortar systems, grenade launchers and body armor.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the Patriot announcement, saying the system  “will strengthen our air defense significantly.”  
“This is a very important step to create a secure air space for Ukraine,” he told journalists through a translator at a news conference alongside President Joe Biden at the White House.
Russia’s former space chief injured
The former head of Russia’s space agency, Dmitry Rogozin, said on Thursday he was injured by shelling in Donetsk, a Russian-controlled city in eastern  Ukraine, and will require surgery.
Rogozin is an ardent supporter of President Vladimir Putin’s February offensive in Ukraine and is leading a team of military advisers to pro-Russian forces fighting alongside Moscow’s troops.
The outspoken official — known for his  Twitter spats with US billionaire and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — was removed from his position at Roscosmos in July.
Rogozin said on  his Telegram channel that he suffered a back  “injury” after a  metal fragment was lodged above his right shoulder blade and will be  needing surgery.
The incident took place on Wednesday evening in a  hotel in Donetsk, where Rogozin was staying with a local official and a  group of advisers, TASS news agency reported.
Russian investigators said that the strike, which had left others dead and injured, was carried out with  “high-precision munitions, presumably... a  Caesar” French artillery system.
Rogozin said the incident took place during a  “work meeting” in the restaurant of the hotel, while  Russian state news channel Rossiya 24 TV said the former space chief was celebrating his 59th birthday.
The channel broadcast images of  the heavily damaged hotel and restaurant with parts of the roof  destroyed and debris scattered around the rooms and outside in the garden.
Rogozin said he had regularly stayed in this hotel during trips to the Donetsk region, which Russia claimed to have annexed in  September along with three other Ukrainian regions, despite widespread condemnation from the West.
Blast kills official
A  car blast on Thursday killed an official in the Russian-controlled village of Lyubimivka in southern Ukraine, Moscow-installed authorities  said, the latest in a series of attacks against Russian-linked  officials.
“Today Andrei Nikolayevich Shtepa, a sincere patriot of  his native land, died tragically as a result of a car explosion,”  authorities said on Telegram, blaming  “Ukrainian terrorists” for the  death.
Lyubimivka is located on the eastern bank of the Dnipro  river, which is occupied by Moscow’s troops after they retreated from  Kherson city last month rendering the river a new frontline.
This is the latest in a series of targeted attacks against Russia-installed officials in occupied areas.

4,Right-wing Israeli govt sparks fear of escalation in occupied areas,"Washington says it will “unequivocally oppose” moves to expand settlements, or disrupt the status quo of holy sites.","JERUSALEM: Israel’s Benja­min Netanyahu has formed a coalition government but concerns are growing at what power he will exercise over his far-right allies, as violence surges in the occupied West Bank.
The incoming government, which veteran hawk Netanyahu announced he had formed late on Wednesday, is expected to be the most right-wing in Israel’s history.
It has sparked fears of military escalation in the West Bank amid the worst violence in the Pale­stinian territory for nearly 20 years.
Netanyahu’s Likud party secured the mandate to form a government in the Nov 1 election, with backing from ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and Religious Zionism, an extreme-right alliance of minor parties.
Leading voices within the new coalition will include Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, two leaders of the Religious Zionism bloc who occupy the extremity of Israel’s political right. Both live in Israeli settlements inside the West Bank, and will respectively take charge of settlement policy and national security. At least three senior Western diplomats have said they are concerned about the security impact of Ben Gvir’s role within the government.
‘Escalation’
Ben Gvir’s post as national security minister will include responsibility for Israel’s police, which includes the border guard who, along with the Israeli army, operate inside the West Bank.
In recent weeks Israel’s press has highlighted the risk of having  “two” separate armies in the West Bank, with the army on one side and the border guard on the other.
But former Israeli general Amir Avivi, who now runs a network for former security officials, believes the command structure of Israel’s forces will not be threatened. “I don’t see any scenario in which Ben Gvir will lead border guard operations” in the West Bank, he said.
However, Palestinian analyst Khaldoun Barghouti said the question was not about the structure of Israel’s security forces — but rather Israel’s policies on settlements and annexations of Pales­ti­nian territories in the West Bank.
“This Israeli government will lead to an escalation, because the position of Ben Gvir and Smotrich will destroy the possibility of a Palestinian state,” he said. At least 150 Palestinians and 26 Israelis have been killed this year across Israel and the West Bank, including Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.
A further 49 Palestinians were killed during three days of fighting between Gaza militants and Israel in August.
According to United Nations data, 2022 has been the deadliest year since the 2002-2005 Palestinian uprising, known as the Second Intifada.
‘Third intifada’ fear 
More than 475,000 Israeli settlers live in the occupied West Bank, and the UN warns their presence threatens the viability of a two-state solution to the decades-long conflict. Smotrich has already signposted an intention to legalise a number of  “wildcat” settlements that are not currently recognised by Israel.
Washington, Israel’s foremost ally, said it will  “unequivocally oppose” moves to expand settlements, annex areas of the West Bank or disrupt the status quo of holy sites, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned.
A point of frequent tension in annexed east Jerusalem is the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Under a historical status quo, non-Muslims can visit the sanctuary but not pray there.

5,Protesting Kosovo Serbs want ethnic Albanian police out of country’s north,RUDARE: Thousands of Kosovo Serbs protested on Thursday to back demands for the country’s Albanian-majority...,"RUDARE: Thousands of Kosovo Serbs protested on Thursday to back demands for the country’s Albanian-majority government to pull its police out of the country’s north where its Serb minority is concentrated.
Since Dec 10 local Serbs have erected nine roadblocks in the northern region and exchanged fire with police after the arrest of a former Serb policeman for allegedly assaulting serving police officers during a previous protest.
Thursday’s protest rally was held in the village of Rudare, a few kilometres from the ethnically divided, flashpoint town of Mitrovica, with the main road still blocked by gravel-laden trucks and heavy machinery.
Ethnic Serb mayors in northern municipalities, along with local judges and some 600 police officers, resigned last month in protest over a Kosovo government decision to replace Serbian-issued car license plates with ones issued by Pristina.
Prime Minister Albin Kurti’s government plans to replace the officers in the north but faces strong objection from Serbs who do not recognise Kosovo as a state and seek to rejoin Serbia, 14 years after Pristina declared independence from Belgrade.
“Maltreatment of the Serb people by Kurtis special forces is the reason why we gathered today ..., to send a message to Pristina and their tutors that we are here, that we want peace but freedom as well, and that we will not surrender,” Serb List party leader Goran Rakic told the crowd of protesters.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has said he fully supports Kosovo Serbs, who number around 50,000 in the north of Kosovo, and what he called their legitimate requests.
The protesters held up a 250-metre-(825-foot)-long Serbian flag, with Italian soldiers from the Nato peacekeeping mission monitoring the rally from a distance.

6,Holiday flights scrapped as massive winter storm sweeps US,"CHICAGO: More than 1,800 flights were canceled across the United States by Thursday morning as a massive winter ...","CHICAGO: More than 1,800 flights were canceled across the United States by Thursday morning as a massive winter storm upended holiday travel plans with a triple threat of heavy snow, howling winds and bitter cold.
At least five US states — Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, Georgia and North Carolina — have already implemented emergency plans and others were likely to follow, with the worst of the Arctic blast yet to come.
“This is not like a snow day when you were a kid,” President Joe Biden told reporters at a White House briefing on the weather and transport turmoil. “This is serious stuff,” he added, urging people to heed warnings from local authorities. Blinding whiteouts and hazardous road conditions were already being seen in parts of the country slammed by a dangerous cold front.
Beyond the 1,825 cancelations as of 1750 GMT, more than 3,700 other flights within, into or out of the United States have been delayed, according to flight tracker FlightAware. The majority of US flights called off have so far been at Chicago O’Hare or Denver, both international hubs, the data showed.
AccuWeather forecasters have said the storm could rapidly strengthen into what is known as a  “bomb cyclone” through a process known as  “bombogenesis,” when the barometric pressure drops and a cold air mass collides with a warm air mass.
National Weather Service (NWS) forecaster Michael Charnick tweeted a video showing drivers struggling along a highway between Colorado and Wyoming, where the temperature with wind chills plummeted to -40 degrees Fahrenheit (-40C).
The NWS released key safety messages on its Twitter account, warning snow squalls — bursts of moderate to heavy snow lasting an hour or two — had already happened or were expected from the Central Plains to the mid-Atlantic and Northeast.
“People exposed to extreme cold are susceptible to frostbite in a matter of minutes,” the agency cautioned.
“Areas most prone to frostbite are uncovered skin and the extremities, such as hands and feet. Hypothermia is another threat during extreme cold.”
In the Midwest, blizzard conditions stranded 100 motorists in Rapid City and Wall in South Dakota, the Pennington County Sheriff’s Office tweeted.

7,Two Iraqi soldiers killed in ambush,Army officers blamed the killing on fighters of the militant Islamic State group.,"KIRKUK: Suspected militants in northern Iraq detonated bombs targeting military vehicles, killing two soldiers and wounding three, security sources said on Thursday.
There was no immediate claim for the attack which took place late on Wednesday near Dibs outside the northern city of Kirkuk, but army officers blamed the killing on fighters of the militant Islamic State group.
Two army vehicles were hit by twin roadside blasts set off by  “IS elements”, before gunmen opened fire on those in the wreckage with automatic weapons, an officer said speaking on condition of anonymity.
Two soldiers were killed and three wounded, he said, a toll confirmed by a police source.
