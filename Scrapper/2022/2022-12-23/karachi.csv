Launched by the Pakistan Study Centre of the university, the idea behind the reading facility is to divert attention of the incarcerated adolescents from criminal activities. 
According to a statement issued by study centre director Dr Shuja Ahmed Mahesar, various books have been kept in the library set up at the juvenile prison of Hyderabad in a bid to provide an opportunity to the young offenders to read books, seek knowledge and get education. 
Inaugurated by Prof Dr Mahesar and Inspector General Sindh Prisons Kazi Nazir Ahmed, the facility is aimed at help the delinquents quit the habits of crime in future and become productive and useful members of society after being released from the prison. 
Dr Mahesar said that by providing educational opportunities in the prison, the increasing crime could be lessened to a great extent in society. Establish-ment of the library would help the imprisoned youth suffering from mental disorders, psychological tribulations and depression, adding that such corrective methods would prove to be more effective than violent techniques adopted for their reforms. 
IG Prisons Nazir Ahmed said the facility would have far-reaching results in the lives of young prisoners.

2,"Court restrains SBCA, HMC from converting status of residential plots",HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad circuit bench of the Sindh High Court on Thursday restrained the Sindh Building Control...,"HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad circuit bench of the Sindh High Court on Thursday restrained the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) and other civic bodies from converting status of residential area into commercial and ordered the status quo be maintained till government framed a uniform policy in the light of judgements of Supreme Court.
The division bench comprising Justices Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Adnanul Karim Memon announced the verdict, which had been reserved after detailed hearing on Dec 15, on a petition filed by Salman Ahmed and Faizan Ahmed, residents of Latifabad unit-8.
The petitioners represented by Ayatullah Khawaja advocate had cited as respondents regional director, deputy and assistant directors of SBCA, Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC), HMC’s deputy director land and Nasir Ali, a private citizen. 
The petitioners, who lived on plots No516 in block-B and plot No514 in block-II Latifabad unit No8, said the respondent Nasir Ali’s plots (No515 and 506) were adjacent to their houses. He had illegally amalgamated the plots and started illegal construction over them despite the fact that the plots and the houses of petitioners could not be converted into commercial plots, they said.
They said that Supreme Court had banned conversion of residential plots into commercial. On June 20 and July 9, 2019, they had filed applications in HMC to get certified copies of the allotment order and mutation of the properties in question but were not provided the same, they said.  
They said that no plan, to date, was approved for construction of banquet hall and the respondents failed to stop the illegal construction despite their requests which showed the respondents were working in league with HMC. They requested the court order the respondents to demolish the illegal construction.
Ayatullah Khawaja contended that the respondent amalgamated the plots illegally and started constructing the banquet hall. The property was situated in a residential area and allotted for residential purposes alone, he said.
The HMC’s counsel Ishrat Lohar said the respondent’s request for conversion and construction of banquet was allowed on payment of usual charges. 
The court said in its order that from clauses of NoC and documents it could be seen that at no point of time the respondents were allowed to raise commercial construction on the plot initially declared residential as per allotment orders. 
“It is a mystery under what circumstances the whole road has been declared as commercial without taking approval from residents of other properties excluding properties of private respondents,” said the order.
“SC has even ordered demolition of various buildings/marriage halls etc which are found to be illegally constructed on main roads and those which are found to be in any residential area being operated for commercial purposes,” read the order.
It said that law provided no residential plot shall be converted and used for any other use except with approval of competent authority after due notice to public at large. 
The above case explicitly showed the respondent departments had not taken into consideration factual position of the case and the dicta laid down by the apex court on the subject, it said.
The court said that without indulging in factual controversies it referred the matter to authorities concerned with directives to private respondent to move fresh application for conversion of properties from residential to commercial and amalgamation of two plots if they so desired.
It ordered that no construction would be carried out on disputed property involved in the present petition in any manner whatsoever. “In the meanwhile, respondent departments are restrained from converting residential area into a commercial [plot],” said the order.

KARACHI: Residents of Lyari suffering from prolonged power and gas load-shedding held a protest demonstration by blocked the main roads leading to the Shaheen Complex intersection in the downtown area.
A large number of men, women and children led by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leaders held a sit-in during busy evening hours causing traffic jams.

Ali Nawaz Baloch, one of the organisers of the protest, told Dawn that the KE had resorted to loadshedding for four times in 24 hours, each duration lasting three hours, hence 12 hours cut in a day. 
Similarly, he added, gas loadshedding was being enforced for 20 hours a day in Lyari.
He said the KE official named Humayun Sagheer assured the protesters that they would not carry out loadshedding on Thursday night and on Friday. However, when the protesters dispersed and returned to their homes in Lyari, the power went off at 8:30pm, Mr Baloch said.

5,Murad orders police-Rangers operation to crush street criminals in Karachi,Calls for intelligence-based action against banned outfits; says killings of citizens by muggers ‘unacceptable’,"• Calls for intelligence-based action against banned outfits
• Says killings of citizens by muggers ‘unacceptable’
KARACHI:  Top brass of police, Rangers and intelligence agencies in Sindh sat together at Chief Minister House on Thursday to evolve a coordinated strategy following a renewed wave of terrorism in other parts of the country and an alarming surge in incidents of street crime in the metropolis.
The meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Syed  Murad Ali Shah, discussed at length the threats of terrorism and street crime and decided to launch an operation to be jointly carried out by police and Rangers against those involved in street crime in Karachi. 
Chief Secretary Sohail Rajput, Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon, director general of Pakistan Rangers Sindh Major General Azhar Waqas,  officials of the Counter-Terrorism Department, Special Branch and provincial heads of intelligence agencies attended the meeting.
The chief minister gave 15 days to the police to launch aggressive operations against street criminals and called for close coordination among all the intelligence agencies and police.
While the meeting noted that banned militant outfits were not strong enough in Sindh, the CM stressed the need for strict vigilance to check the movement of suspected militants.
He asked authorities to launch an intelligence-based operation against militants belonging to banned outfits.
CM Shah was, however, quite worried about the situation of street crime in the metropolis.
According to a statement issued from CM House, he said: “Street criminals have created unrest among the citizens of Karachi. But their [criminals’]  number is not so high that they could not be crushed. I want the police  and Rangers to work out a plan to launch an operation against them and  ensure deployment of their forces at the hot spots, which are very much  identified.”
About the killings of a number of innocent citizens  by armed muggers over resistance in the city, he said: “This is  unacceptable and a challenge to the government … I want the police and  Ranger to work together to eliminate the menace.” 
The participants in the meeting decided that the hotspots where street criminals were more active would be secured through effective deployment of police. 
The gangs operating in the city would be busted  through a joint operation by the police and Rangers, they said, adding  that there was a need to improve prosecution in cases against muggers  and street criminals.  
The meeting was told that during the current year, 2,258 encounters with terrorists and street criminals had taken place and as a result, 1,259 gangs had been busted,  16,612 criminals arrested and 204 killed.
The chief minister directed the authorities to keep strict vigilance at the exit and entry points of Karachi and the province so that criminals’ movement could be checked. 
It was pointed out that various illegal immigrants were coming to Karachi, but they were being returned on a regular basis. 
The chief minister said that he would take up the issues of illegal immigrants’ influx into the city with the federal government so that they could be stopped at the borders.

7,Stakeholders to be taken on board before enforcing energy conservation plan,Khawaja Asif briefs Sindh CM about federal government’s intended measures,"KARACHI: The federal and Sindh governments on Thursday agreed to take into confidence traders, industrialists, restaurant owners and other stakeholders before enforcing measures to conserve energy.
A meeting between Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif took place at the conference room of Terminal 1 in which a roadmap of energy conservation came under discussion.
Federal ministers Makhdoom Murtaza Mehmood, Abdul Wasay, Dr Musadiq Malik, Power Secretary Rashid Langrial and Sardar Moazzam were part of the federal government delegation.
The CM was assisted by provincial ministers Imtiaz Shaikh, Saeed Ghani, Jam Ikramullah Dharejo, Law Adviser Barrister Murtaza Wahab, Karachi Commissioner Iqbal Memon, Health Secretary Zulfiqar Shah and Energy Secretary Abu Bakar Madani.

Khawaja Asif briefs Sindh CM about federal government’s intended measures

According to a statement issued from CM House, Khawaja Asif told the chief minister that various energy conservation measures were presented to the federal cabinet in October and the prime minister had constituted a committee to fine-tune the measures.
He added that the committee held five sessions to identify and strategies potential energy efficiency and conversion measures.
Citing the recommendations of the committee, the defence minister said 20 per cent of the staff would be allowed to work from home once a week which would save Rs56 billion annually. If closure of commercial markets at 8pm is observed, it would save Rs62bn per year. If alternate switching of street lights is observed, it would save Rs4.5bn annually.
CM Shah thanked the federal government delegation for its visit and for sensitising him about their roadmap and said that saving one unit of electricity was cheaper than producing one unit of energy.
He added that realising the fact that improvement in energy efficiency and conservation was one of the easiest and least cost-effective pathways to improve the country’s energy sector sustainability.
He said that Sindh as a whole and its urban centres especially Karachi alone got a huge potential for energy conservation and improving efficiency.
The CM said that the immense potential had made Sindh a key player with its vital share to be the leading contributor in achieving the energy conservation targets at the national level.
He pointed out that his government by utilising the provisions given in the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act had recently established the Sindh Energy Efficiency and Conservation Agency for proper coordination, facilitation and enforcement of the provisions of the law within the province.
He said that realising the need for electricity in public service buildings during the daytime, Sindh had already solarised 265 health facilities and during the current financial year schools, hospitals, water pumping stations and prisons would be solarised through development projects.
After thorough discussions and deliberations, it was agreed that all the stakeholders, particularly traders, industrialists and restaurant owners would be taken into confidence by the prime minister and chief ministers at their respective levels so that their cooperation could be ensured.

KARACHI: The Christian cemetery or Gora Qabristan off Sharea Faisal was the spot where the spirit of Christmas was witnessed on Thursday to spread cheer and joy and remind everyone to be grateful for all the blessings including having each other for support. 
On a grassy patch on one side of the road, the trees had been decorated with fairy lights and twinkling Christmas Stars along with big and small parcels wrapped with gift paper, piled over each other. Soon there were also lots of fireworks lighting up the sky. 
Cardinal Joseph Coutts arrived there wearing an off-white pakol cap. Bishop Benny Mario Travas, the bishop of Karachi, was also present with Reverend Father Mario Rodrigues of St Jude’s Church along with Reverend Father Arthur Charles of St Anthony’s Church, Reverend Father Edward Joseph, MPA Anthony Naveed, advocate Saleem Michael and Pervez Gill. 

Christmas Star installation ceremony held at Gora Qabristan

The chief guest on the occasion was Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani. 
“Christmas is a time of joy. It’s a time of sharing. We need to remember that when Jesus came, he chose to come among the poor, who became his priority. So in our celebrations we must also never forget the poor and also the rejected in society,” said Bishop Benny Mario Travas. 
“The Christmas festivities begin from December 17 along with the preparations for the main celebration of Christmas on Dec 25,” said Father Mario Rodrigues. 
Cardinal Joseph Coutts was glad to be there and appreciated all the decorations done there by the Christmas Decoration Committee. He met all the people who had come to specially meet him and be blessed. They included children and several physically-challenged people with whom the Cardinal sat down to chat. 
Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani also arrived without any protocol or security. “I am with our Christian community in their Christmas celebrations. I pray that they always remain happy and that we celebrate all our festivals together like this,” he told Dawn.

9,Two-day mini thesis show opens at Arts Council,20 students put their works on display,"KARACHI: The mini thesis show of third-year students at the Arts Council Institute of Arts and Crafts (ACIAC) began at the Ahmed Pervaiz Gallery on Wednesday. It will conclude today (Friday). No fewer than 20 young boys’ and girls’ artworks are on display. They were liked by a big number of art lovers and mediamen who attended the opening ceremony.
Provincial Minister of Sindh for Labour Saeed Ghani was the chief guest on the occasion. He appreciated the paintings on view claiming that it was difficult to pick which one was better than the other. He lauded the way the council had been functioning, getting transformed from a deserted (veeran) cultural space to a bustling one where activities keep happening on a regular basis.
The council’s President Ahmed Shah said the focus of his team at the ACIAC is on those students who come from the working class backgrounds. He argued that the affluent segment of society can afford to send their children abroad to grab more opportunities, but it is the less privileged which need attention. 

20 students put their works on display

It’s nice to see young artists employing a variety of media to express themselves visually – oil on canvas, watercolor on paper etc. But what’s heartening is to notice the wide array of ideas that they have touched upon through their works. They range from the loss of a parent to selfdiscovery and from the pangs of mental illness to the efforts required for a collective struggle. It wouldn’t be wrong to suggest that all of them should be appreciated. And yet, the young Yasir Noor’s watercolor paintings stand out both in terms of his craft and the choice of subject. He calls it Dhund (fog or mist) which he attributes to ‘a particular event in my childhood’. In a broader context, it reminded this writer of Eugene O’Neill’s poignant play Long Day’s Journey into Night. 
The other participating artists are: Zarnaab Baloch, Zeenat Khan, Habiba Mujeeb, Bakhtiar Ahmed, Lewis Sabir, Aakash Jivraj, Sehar Afsha, M Darab
Munir, M Jawwad Hassan, Fatima Khan, Shahzad Baloch, Wassama Baloch, Uzma Rehman, Kiran Aslam, Kabeer Atta Mohammad, Stephen Yaqoob, Naheed Noor, Muhammad Ashiq and Azka Lateef.

They, however, did not name any institution or individual for trying to bring different MQM factions on one platform.
They appealed to the army chief to play his role in ending an undeclared ban on activities of MQM-L.
It may be noted that Karachi has been abuzz with reports of an impending merger between different factions of the MQM, particularly the Pak Sarzameen Party and MQM-Pakistan.
Recently, PSP chairman Syed Mustafa Kamal and disgruntled leader Dr Farooq Sattar had separately met Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori — who is a nominee of the MQM-P — and discussed with him the overall political situation.
Also, MQM-P leader and former Karachi mayor Wasim Akhtar had told a press conference that the doors of the MQM-P were open to all those who wanted to return.

11,"Drinking water sources in flood-hit areas of Sindh, Balochistan found highly contaminated: expert","KARACHI: The post-flood situation in both Sindh and Balochistan is worrisome, requiring immediate government...","KARACHI: The post-flood situation in both Sindh and Balochistan is worrisome, requiring immediate government intervention. Water is still standing in several districts and the drinking water available to the masses is highly contaminated. 
These points were raised at a seminar -- Devastating floods in Pakistan: Mitigation measures and the Way Forward – organised at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FPCCI) head office here on Thursday. 
The speakers highlighted the losses caused by this year’s floods and the ongoing relief efforts in Sindh and Balochistan. 
The tragedy, they said, affected over 33m people and killed more than 1,700 people, including 647 children. Around 1,164,270 livestock died during the devastation.  
The World Bank, according to speakers, estimates that the economic losses to the country stand at $15.2bn while the flood damage is around $14.9bn. 
Speaking about the plausible reasons that led to the unprecedented floods in Pakistan, chief meteorologist Dr S. Sarfaraz explained that a combination of different phenomena contributed to the 2022 monsoon rains. 
“We need to prepare for the future. Our analysis and climate change data show that the country is likely to see an increase in extreme weather events including floods, drought, heatwaves, cyclones, sea-level rise and glacier melting. Hence, adaptation strategies along with early warning systems are the need of the hour.” 
Giving a presentation on post-flood water quality scenario in Sindh and Balochistan, Dr Ghulam Murtaza Arain representing the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), said most of the samples collected from Sindh and Balochistan were found to be highly contaminated with fecal matter. 
“We need to act swiftly otherwise we may have more disease outbreaks as soon as the temperature starts rising,” he said. 
The data shared in the event showed that 81 per cent of the 539 water samples collected from Jaffarabad, Nasirabad, Sohbatpur, Kachi Bolan and Jhal Magsi were contaminated with total coliform, 38 per cent with E.coli (a strong indicator of sewage and animal waste contamination) and 14 per cent with cholera bacteria. 
“The wide presence of these germs in the month of winter suggests that the outbreak risk in summer months would increase multiple times as hot temperatures help germs flourish.” 
Dr Arian also shared the several initiatives taken by the department in collaboration with Unicef for provision of drinking water to people in Sindh and Balochistan. 
Dr Ahmed Ali Gul from the University of Management and Technology, Lahore and Dr Quratulain Bakhteari from the Institute for Development Studies and Practices also spoke.

Syed Qasim Shah, the counsel for Ms Sultan, had moved an application requesting the court to summon the SHO and the MLO concerned to verify the evidence submitted with the court by his client on the last date. 
In October, the lawyer had submitted the medico-legal and emergency room reports in a case filed by his client’s former husband Feroze Khan. 
The family court is hearing two cases, one filed by Mr Khan for custody of their two children and another filed by Ms Sultan for maintenance money for the children.

NBWs issued for Waqar Zaka’s arrest
A local court on Thursday issued non-bailable warrant for arrest of television and social media personality Waqar Zaka, who is absconding in a case pertaining to around Rs86 million cryptocurrency scam. 
The Federal Investigation Agency had booked Zaka in connection with an inquiry into alleged virtual currency-related transactions to his bank account on Jan 29 this year. 
On Thursday, when the matter came up before the Judicial Magistrate (East), the accused failed to appear before him. 
The judge directed the office to issue non-bailable warrants for arrest of the suspect, who is allegedly absconding to avoid his arrest in the case. The matter was fixed on Jan 5.

ISLAMKOT: Contrary to the general impression that Tharparkar is miles and miles of wasteland, the soil here is actually fertile. The whole area can also be turned into an oasis if only there is water here. 
Now with plenty of water for the plants, Islamkot in Tharparkar is turning green, but not with envy. 
Just five or six years ago, the land where now the Bashir Ansari Green Park exists here in Islamkot was barren. Now it serves as a recreational facility for the local community with a park, a zoo with multiple species of animals and birds, a designated ladies area, etc., etc. 
Bashir Ansari, after whom this park has been named, was a geologist. When the coal reserves were discovered in Islamkot, he was researching and working on where these reserves were available and at what levels. For this work, he had dug a few deep wells some of which collapsed unfortunately for some strange reason. But the wells were associated with the geologist’s longtime in-depth research. He couldn’t bear the loss of his years of work and took it to heart. It resulted in his death. 
The Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) wanted to preserve the wells so they developed a park around it. This park was stretched across 30 acres initially, but it has spread to over 65 acres now with various sections. Today there are also around 100,000 to 150,000 plants and trees planted here. 

Biosaline groundwater is transforming the town into an oasis

“We try not to plant trees that need sweet water to grow because human beings and animals have the first right to the sweet water, which as it is doesn’t come by easily,” said deputy manager environment Nimra Hussain, who leads all the green projects of the health, safety and environment (HSE) department and SECMC. 
“We get plants that do well in saline water that is pumped out from the coal mines. This ground water needs to be pumped out to reach the coal seams for mining. This water from the mines is not poisonous or anything. But it cannot be used for conventional purposes due to its higher salt content. Still, it is a resource that we can use to benefit the community and the environment by using it in growing plants and trees and different crops. 
The native plant species here actually do quite well on this water. Considering this our strategy is to grow young plants or saplings on RO plant-treated water for six to eight months before switching to saline water,” she explained. 
Another SECMC project is the Thar Million Tree Project. It was decided by the company back in 2016 to plant one million trees in Tharparkar. It started in 2017. The sustainable trees in the area include Neem, Moringa and Australian Barber. Many of them are growing at the Bashir Ansari Green Park. 
And the saplings for these trees are growing in Sindh’s biggest private sector nursery in Islamkot, which has a capacity of 500,000 saplings. “We grow different saplings in-house there,” said Ms Nimra. 
“So having started in 2017, the Thar Million Tree Project met its goal of planting one million trees in 2021, on the World Environment Day [June 5]. Obviously all plants don’t survive hundred per cent for many reasons. We have recorded a 72 per cent survival rate here. Therefore, we are doing over and above plantation to ensure 100 per cent survival,” she explained. 
Also started in 2017, the Biosaline Fruit and Fodder Farm, a joint collaboration between the SECMC and the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC), which is another green or sustainable project spread over 40 acres of agriculture land. 
It is a pilot project with various crops growing on saline water such as aloe vera and jujube fruit, and fodder grasses such as Rhodes grass and Sesbania for livestock. 
“We collaborated with different research and educational institutes to do this, including the local agriculture promoting institute PARC to see what species of plants, including fodder, could be grown here because the locals depend on agriculture and livestock, but whatever they grew themselves from stored rain water was not enough. But the way we are growing crops here a normal peasant can also replicate. 
“The labour at the farm, around 50 to 60 persons, is also free to take home the fruits and fodder growing there for themselves and for their animals,” Ms Nimra shared. “We donate plants too. For example, we donated our saplings to the Sindh forest department, the Urban Forest, Hands, Dua Foundation who were also working on smaller scale with the same aim as us,” she added. 
And with so many targets met and things looking up on the vegetation front, the SECMC is now turning attention to now also looking at the impact of all the greenery on the environment and biodiversity in the area. “We are looking at tangible results of how much carbon is sequestered, and how many more species of animals and birds are seen here as a result of biodiversity. We will devise further plantation strategies on all that.”

Kakar police station’s SHO Gulzar Khushik lodged the FIR under Sections 341, 247 and 149 PPC against Qurban Mallah, Hameed Mallah, Dilber Mallah, Waheed Brohi, Saleem Khoso, Sharif Mallah, Rafiq Mirani, Gulsher Naich, Nadeem Malik and 20 unknown protesters for blocking the road and causing nuisance. 
“During the protest, the persons nominated in the FIR created a law and order situation and smashed windscreens of passing vehicles on the highway,” said the SHO. 
The registration of the FIR sparked another protest by flood victims who once again blocked the highway on Thursday. 
The protesters’ leaders complained that instead of listening to their grievances the government had tried to silence them with the FIR.
Rafiq Mirani, one of the leaders of the protesters who was also nominated in the FIR, said that even after four months since the flood took place the authorities had failed to drain floodwaters from their villages and areas. 
How could they rebuild their houses and return when five feet water was stagnating in their villages, he said. 
Nadeem Malik, another flood victim nominated in the FIR, said that they had blocked the highway in protest against the government failure to clear their abodes of floodwaters and their inability to reconstruct their houses but the authorities responded them with the FIR.
