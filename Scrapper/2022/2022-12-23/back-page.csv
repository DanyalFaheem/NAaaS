0,NIH stops typhoid tests in health centres,Blames them for spread of drug-resistant typhoid fever in country.,"ISLAMABAD: The country’s top public health institute, the National Institute of Health (NIH), has directed health facilities and practitioners across the country to stop prescribing two basic tests of typhoid due to the possibility of false positive result, and only stick to “blood culture tests” for diagnosis of typhoid.
“Widal” and “Typhidot” tests are being prescribed as a majority of labs don’t have the facility to conduct blood culture tests.
According to an expert, both tests are becoming the reason for spread of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid fever in the country that does not respond to most antibiotics. He said the country was already exporting poliovirus and for the last few years it was being blamed for exporting Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) bacteria of typhoid.
NIH said in a letter that it has come to the knowledge of the institution that some clinical laboratories and hospitals, particularly in flood-affected areas, are still using “Widal” and “Typhidot” tests for confirmation of typhoid fever.

Blames them for spread of XDR typhoid fever in country

“Keeping in view the outbreak of typhoid fever in the country, it is re-emphasised that Widal and Typhidot tests cannot be used for confirmation of typhoid fever and should be discontinued with immediate effect. The only confirmatory test is blood culture test,” it stated.
Through the letter, sent to health departments of the four provinces, Surgeon General of the Pakistan Army and the federal health ministry, authorities have been requested to have a thorough check on laboratories performing those tests.
A senior officer of NIH, who is an Infectious Disease Specialist, told Dawn that almost a decade ago Widal test was discontinued across the world and Typhidot test was also either stopped or discouraged in most of the countries of the world.
“Both tests can show false positive reports which means that a patient is not suffering from typhoid, but report shows him infected with typhoid bacteria. Resultantly doctors prescribe antibiotics to those patients which become a reason for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR),” he said.
He said the cost of Typhidot test was just Rs150, but it was charged around Rs1,000.
“Although blood culture test, which is the best test to diagnose typhoid, costs around Rs2,000, a majority of labs don’t have the facility to conduct that test. So labs pay commission to doctors to prescribe Typhidot test and it is mostly prescribed across the country,” he said.
In 2018, an advisory, issued by leading national public health institute of the United States regarding the outbreak of XDR typhoid fever in Pakistan, had panicked national and international health circles as Pakistan was already exporting the polio virus and then it was being blamed for exporting AMR bacteria of Typhoid. The advisory issued by the US institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stated that there was an ongoing outbreak of XDR typhoid fever in Pakistan that did not respond to most antibiotics. During 2018, cases had been reported in the United Kingdom and in the United States among travellers returning from Pakistan.
The bacteria have an internal intelligence due to which, because of excessive use of antibiotics, it changes itself according to the medicine and creates resistance against the medicines. In the past, bacteria could be killed with low potency medicines but now for the same bacteria high potency medicines are required which is due to AMR.
The NIH official further said that if irrational use of antibiotics continued Pakistan will have a large number of patients having XDR typhoid virus.
The NIH is involved in multi-disciplinary public health-related activities like diagnostic services, research and production of biologicals for the last over 40 years.
The institute is a World Health Organisation (WHO) collaborating centre for viral diagnostics and regional reference laboratory for polio in addition to being a national reference center for diagnosis of influenza. It also works as the national laboratory for quality control of drugs and quality control of food.

1,Israeli troops kill Palestinian in Nablus,"Hamas says deceased was a member of its military wing who ""was killed by occupation bullets during clashes"".","NABLUS: Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian during an incursion into the West Bank city of Nablus early Thursday, Palestinian sources said.
The exchange of fire came just hours after veteran Israeli hawk Benjamin Netanyahu announced he had formed a new government, returning to power as the head of the most right-wing coalition in Israel’s history.
The Palestinian health ministry said Ahmed Atef Daraghmeh, 23, a footballer from the nearby town of Tulkarem, sustained bullet wounds to the back and foot.
Hamas group, which rules the Gaza Strip, said Daraghmeh was a member of its military wing who “was killed by occupation bullets during clashes at dawn on Thursday”.
The Israeli army said its troops had entered Nablus to “secure the coordinated entrance of Israeli civilians to Joseph’s Tomb,” a contested religious site that Muslims believe houses the grave of a local sheikh, but many Jews revere as the burial place of the Biblical patriarch Joseph.
“Armed Palestinians hurled explosive devices and fired toward the soldiers, endangering their lives,” the army said.
“The soldiers responded with live fire. Hits were identified.”
Joseph’s Tomb lies within the built up area of Nablus, and Jewish pilgrims can visit only in groups escorted by the Israeli army.
Their entry often sparks clashes with Palestinian residents.
Nablus has seen frequent clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians in recent months.
As the army has stepped up its incursions into Palestinian towns and cities in response to a wave of deadly attacks on Israeli targets earlier this year.
The flare-up has seen the rise to prominence of a new armed group, dubbed the “Lions’ Den”, that has brought together fighters from established Palesti­nian factions united in their opposition to the longstanding security coordination between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli army.
The army killed some of the group’s top leaders in early October, but its fighters said on Telegram that they had taken part in Thursday’s clashes.
Members of the new governing coalition announced by Netanyahu late Wednesday have called for an even tougher crackdown on Palestinians.
The prospective national security minister in the new government, Itamar Ben Gvir of the far-right Jewish Power party, has repeatedly urged Israeli security personnel to use more force when countering Palestinian unrest.
At least 150 Palestinians and 26 Israelis have been killed this year across Israel and the West Bank, including Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.
A further 49 Palestinians were killed during three days of fighting between Gaza fighters and Israel in August.

2,SHC invalidates backdated super tax,Says special levy will apply from coming tax year.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Thursday invalidated a super tax that was applied retrospectively for the previous fiscal year, but said that the special levy would come into force from the next tax year.
However, the court suspended its judgement for 60 days.
A two-judge bench, headed by Justice Mohammad Junaid Ghaffar, announced the verdict on petitions that challenged the constitutionality of Section 4C of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, claiming that the said law was discriminatory and amounted to double taxation.
The court found that “the first proviso to Division IIB of Part I of the First Schedule to the Income Tax Ordinance 2001” was discriminatory, hence ultra vires to the Constitution, meaning it exceeded its scope and went beyond its authority.

Says special levy will apply from coming tax year

“The operation of this judgement shall remain suspended for a period of 60 days from the date hereof;
hence, the securities furnished pursuant to respective ad interim orders shall remain intact for the said period,” it said.
Section 4C — titled ‘Super tax on high earning persons’ — of the Income Tax Ordinance says that a “super tax shall be imposed for the tax year 2022 and onwards at the rates specified in Division IIB of Part I of the First Schedule, on the income of every person”.
Brokerage house AKD Securities said in a brief note that the SHC decision was “positive for companies”, but it was “unlikely to bode well from a broader economic context given difficult ongoing negotiations with the IMF”.
Similarly, Arif Habib Ltd noted that the suspension of the judgement for 60 days “implies that companies may not undertake any reversal in the same period,” and the government could file an appeal in the Supreme Court.
It also noted that the judgement would only apply to Sindh-based registered companies and would not have any impact on super tax booked by banks.

KABUL: A small group of Afghan women staged a defiant protest in Kabul on Thursday against a Taliban order banning them from universities, an activist said, adding that some were arrested.
In the latest move to restrict human rights in Afghanistan, the Taliban’s minister for higher education on Tuesday ordered all public and private universities to bar women from attending.
“They expelled women from universities. Oh, the respected people, support, support. Rights for everyone or no one!” chanted the protesters as they rallied in a Kabul neighbourhood, footage obtained by AFP showed.
A protester at the rally said “some of the girls” had been arrested by women police officers. Two were released, but several remained in custody, she added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Around two dozen women dressed in hijabs, some wearing masks, could be seen raising their hands and chanting slogans as they marched through the streets.
Women-led protests have become increasingly rare in Afghanistan since the Taliban took over the country last August, after the detention of core activists at the start of the year.
Participants risk arrest, violence and social stigma for taking part.
The women had initially planned to gather in front of Kabul University, the country’s biggest and most prestigious educational institution, but changed locations after the authorities deployed a large number of security personnel there.
Tuesday’s late-night announcement triggered international outrage, with the United States, the United Nations and several Muslim nations denouncing it.
The ban caused disbelief, coming less than three months after thousands were allowed to sit for university entrance exams. “Afghan girls are a dead people... they are crying blood,” said Wahida Wahid Durani, a journalism student at the University of Herat, who was not at the protest.

4,Registration centres set up for Afghan refugees,These 11 new centres will serve Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration Cards with an expiry date of June 2023.,"ISLAMABAD: The government, with the support of UN refugee agency UNHCR, has opened 11 Proof of Registration Card Modification centres (PRCMC) across the country to facilitate Afghan refugees.
The PRCMC located in Peshawar, Quetta, Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Nowshera, Mianwali, Lower Dir, Haripur and Kohat, will serve Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration Cards (PoRC) with an expiry date of June 2023.
Run by the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), these centres will update, correct and modify information pertaining to Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders.
A PRCM centre in Islamabad was formally inaugurated on Thursday by Nadra Chief Project Officer Gohar Ahmed, Commissioner for Afghan Refugees Faridullah, and UNHCR Repre­sentative in Pakistan Noriko Yoshida.
Speaking on the occasion, Nadra official said that operations of these centres had been extended to 11 nationwide sites equipped with 80 counters and 140 IT professionals to serve Afghan citizens effectively.
“By virtue of support from UNHCR and other development partners, PoR card holders can register their newborn children and obtain a birth certificate,” he said.
In addition, as part of services offered by these centres, registered children who turn five years of age can avail of their own PoR card.
Faridullah Jan noted that it was a landmark achievement that the data of Afghan refugees had been verified and updated last year.
He appreciated the donor community for their continued support and expressed the hope that these centres would enable refugees to get swift services in their respective areas.
Speaking on the occasion, the UNHCR representative underscored the significance of the identity document which grants legal status and protects Afghan refugees from arbitrary detention and deportation during their stay in Pakistan.
“It is important for Afghan refugees to hold updated cards that help ensure access to health, education and other facilities,” she said.

5,"In US, Zelensky follows in Churchill’s footsteps — to a point","“Ukraine holds its lines and will never surrender,” he tells US Congress, echoing one of Churchill’s most famous phrases.","WASHINGTON: Ukra­inian President Volo­dymyr Zelensky addressed the US Congress on Wednesday as a wartime leader appealing for Ameri­can support, as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill did more than 80 years before.
Zelensky’s visit to Washington — much like Churchill’s in December 1941 — came with his country under relentless attack and international aid essential to its ability to fight on.
“Ukraine holds its lines and will never surrender,” Zelensky told Congress, echoing one of Churchill’s most famous phrases and earning a standing ovation.
Zelensky earlier this year channeled Churchill in a video address to Britain’s House of Commons, pledging to “fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets”.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was among US politicians drawing parallels to Churchill, saying Zelensky was leading his country with “Churchillian courage and resolve”. “Our message now must be the same from all quarters as it was then: We are with you,” she said.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi recalled that her father was a lawmaker when the British leader made his famous address to Congress.
“This is a moment fraught with meaning for me. My father, congressman Thomas D’Alesandro, Jr., was a member of the House in 1941 when Winston Churchill came to the Congress on the day after Christmas to enlist our nation’s support in the fight against tyranny in Europe,” Pelosi said.
Limits of US support
The comparison between Churchill’s and Zelensky’s trips to the United States has its limits, however, including in the length of the Ukrainian leader’s stay.
Churchill spent three weeks in Washington at the invitation of president Franklin Roosevelt — a lengthy visit that historians say wore on the nerves of first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who did not enjoy the two men’s late night cigar and brandy-fueled conversations.
Zelensky’s trip lasted only a few hours, and included a meeting in the Oval Office, a joint press conference with President Joe Biden, and the speech to Congress.
Churchill ventured across the Atlantic by ship despite the threat of submarines, while Zelensky made the journey via aircraft.
When Churchill arrived in the United States, he found a country shaken by the Japanese attack on the naval base at Pearl Harbor and drawn into an international conflict it had sought to avoid.
While Biden is willing to be compared to Roosevelt for his ambitious economic reforms, he does not want to be drawn into a third world war, making clear that he will not send troops to Ukraine, nor even certain types of weapons, in a bid to avoid escalation.

6,Bilawal ends US visit with call to help flood victims,"Says Pakistan will not launch war on Kabul; claims Imran wants to rig elections through ""his men"" in army.","WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari concluded his week-long visit to the United States on Thursday with an appeal to the international community to help Pakistan recover from the devastation of floods.
His talks with senior US officials and lawmakers — including Secretary of State Antony Blinken — also focused on Pakistan’s rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts.
“The deputy secretary and the foreign minister discussed Pakistan’s continuing efforts to recover from devastating floods and noted the upcoming Jan 9 International Conference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in Geneva,” said a statement issued on Wednesday afternoon after his meeting with the US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman.
A day ago, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had a telephone conversation with Secretary Blinken which also focused on the floods and the UN-sponsored conference in Geneva. They did not have a face-to-face meeting.

Says Pakistan will not launch war on Kabul; claims Imran wants to rig elections through ‘his men’ in army

The statement issued after his meeting with Ms Sherman said that they “committed to strengthen counterterrorism cooperation between the two nations.”
They also spoke about economic, energy, and environmental cooperation.
The deputy secretary and the foreign minister also discussed “the Taliban’s deplorable decision to further restrict women’s and girls’ access to education as well as efforts to hold the Taliban to its commitments regarding the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan,” the statement added.
On Wednesday evening, the foreign minister had his first, and only meeting with the Pakistani media on the trip to Washington, in which he too spoke about the need to stay focused on rehabilitation and reconstruction works, particularly in Sindh and Balochistan.
“No, I am not on a SOS plan,” said Mr Bhutto Zardari when asked if he had come to Washington with an SOS message to save the Pakistani economy from a possible collapse.
“We talked about not just the floods but also the economic situation,” he said, adding the floods had caused “a historical humanitarian crisis” in Pakistan as it inundated more than one-third of the country.
“It is the right of the victims that we talk about them first, but there was no SOS call,” he said.
The foreign minister said he reiterated this message in his meetings with US officials, lawmakers, and think-tank scholars.
The Jan 9 meeting in Geneva, he said, will be the first of many as Pakistan will soon do roadshows to highlight the issue.
“We also need support from international financial organisations, like the World Bank,” he said.
The foreign minister pointed out the Ukraine war had gravely impacted the international economy and Pakistan was facing the consequences too. “That’s why it needed help from the international community,” he added.
When asked to explain his earlier statement saying the TTP was an “absolute red line” for Pakistan and it would not allow anyone to conduct cross-border attacks into Pakistan, he said Pakistan will not declare war on Afghanistan.
“But Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers must stop these cross-border attacks.”
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said holding direct talks with the TTP would not help because they did not listen to logic and soft persuasions would not compel them to end violence.
“They will not become peaceful, chant Pakistan Zindabad and lay down weapons” like this.
“Only a hammer and anvil approach, with Kabul’s support, would work,” he said. But he did emphasise the need to engage the Afghan Taliban.
“They are our neighbours. We need to talk to them and stay engaged,” he said.
Commenting on the political situation, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said former prime minister Imran Khan was seeking early elections “because he still has his men in certain institutions.”
The foreign minister said Mr Khan wanted to use his assets in those institutions to rig the elections “but we will not allow this. Elections will be held on time.”
The last two parliaments, he said, completed their five-year terms and “this parliament will too. Elections will be held when due, in 2023.”“We cannot hold elections before time just to please Imran Khan. The sky will not fall if his desire to return to power is not fulfilled.”
