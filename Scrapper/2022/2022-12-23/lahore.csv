The petitioners, through their counsel, submitted that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) had no jurisdiction to levy the tax on the citizens for owning immovable properties abroad. They argued that the property tax was a provincial subject and the federal government could not interfere in it. They asked the court to set aside the tax recovery notices issued by the FBR. 
Opposing the petitions, Assistant Attorney General Sheraz Zaka argued that the capital value tax on the immovable properties was a federal subject. He relied upon a 1992 judgment, saying that the situation remained the same even after the 18th Amendment. He said no statute could be declared unconstitutional on the basis of extraterritoriality. 
The law officer said the courts should refrain from indulging in the policy matters, particularly pertaining to the economy and the fiscal statutes. He argued that the courts were to presume constitutionality of a law enacted by the legislature. 
Justice Asim Hafeez dismissed the petitions and declared the impugned show-cause notices issued to the petitioners by the FBR valid.

Justice Shahid Karim observed that the court would see whether the opinion of the international town planners had been sought by the government before finalising the master plan of Lahore.
The judge noted that the world opted for vertical housing instead of expanding cities on land.
“Smog has reached a dangerous level and nobody cares here,” he regretted.
The judge was hearing several petitions of farmers challenging alleged forced acquisition of land and its sale by the Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda).
Hammad Rasheed and other farmers contended through counsel that the Ruda occupied their lands with the use of force and started selling the same to new buyers. They said the Supreme Court had restrained the Ruda from forcibly acquiring the land of the farmers.
They alleged that the respondents violated the apex court’s direction and continued its illegal activities. They asked the court to restrain the Ruda from acquiring and selling their land.
After hearing the arguments, Justice Karim issued notices to the Punjab government and the Ruda for submission of reply within a week.

2,Four batchmates of new Punjab IG made officers on special duty,Official says govt wants to give IG ‘authoritative’ position.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has made four senior policemen (grade-21) officers on special duty (OSD) within hours of appointment of Aamir Zulfiqar as new inspector general of Police Punjab.
The development caused a concern among Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) cadres as to what prompted the government to “remove so suddenly” four senior police officers from their respective posts.
Meanwhile, the federal government also transferred Bilal Siddiuqe Kamyana, Deputy Director General of IB, Islamabad, and placed his services at the disposal of the Punjab government.  
The transfer has also raised many an eyebrow as Mr Kamyana is said to be in bad books of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and PML-Q when he was serving as Lahore capital city police officer (CCPO).

Official says govt wants to give IG ‘authoritative’ position

The Parvez Elahi government had removed him from the post of the CCPO and surrendered his services to the Establishment Division (ED), declaring that he was [allegedly] ‘favouring’ the PML-N.  
The four police officers, who have been made OSDs, included additional IG police investigation Ghulam Rasool Zahid, additional IG establishment B.A Nasir, additional IG south Punjab Ehsan Sadiq and additional IG welfare Farooq Mazhar.
Sharing background of the government’s move, a senior official said all the officers were batchmates [19th Common] of the newly-appointed IG Aamir Zulfiqar.
He said Mr Zahid was posted as acting IG and he was transferred and directed to report to the S&GAD, the same day of his appointment.
He said as soon as the notification of Mr Zulfiqar’s appointment surfaced, the Punjab government suddenly removed all of his batchmates.
There were conflicting reports about the motives and one of the prime reasons was that both sides, including the IG and his batchmates, might not be ‘comfortable’ with each other.
The official said the government wanted to give the IG an ‘authoritative position’ and it was possible only by replacing his batchmates with relatively junior officials.  On the other side, some reports suggested that the senior police officers, made OSD, were themselves not willing to serve under the command of their batchmate IG.
The official said moment they learnt that Mr Zulfiqar had been appointed new IG, they wanted an ‘honourable exit’ from the province. He said with the transfer of the four BS-21 policemen, the next challenge would be the selection of appropriate officials to fill the posts due to non-availability of officers in the same grade.
He said the only option for the government would be to replace them by DIG-ranked officers.
About the transfer of Mr Kamyana, the official said he may be the next choice for new Lahore CCPO as the police circles believed that he would not like to hold a non-field assignment at Central Police Office because of his previous task in IB which was [relatively] ‘authoritative’ as compared to any other in CPO Punjab.
Sources said a massive reshuffle across the province is expected after the posting of the new IG.

3,PML-N MPAs allowed to attend session on no-trust motions,"LHC allows 18 MPAs to attend the Punjab Assembly sessions and vote, if needed, till Jan 19, 2023.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Thursday allowed 18 MPAs of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) to attend the Punjab Assembly sessions and vote, if needed, till Jan 19, 2023.
Previously, the court had permitted the MPAs to participate and vote in a session summoned by the governor requiring Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi to obtain a vote of confidence.  
Advocate Mansoor Usman Awan appeared before the court on behalf of the MPAs and stated that the petitioners also wanted to attend the assembly sessions likely to be convened to take up no confidence motions against the chief minister, the speaker and the deputy speaker.  
The counsel asked the court to extend the interim relief already granted to the petitioners.
The court allowed the civil miscellaneous applications by the petitioners and allowed them to attend and vote, if required, in the sessions of the assembly till Jan 19.
The petitioners including Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan, Saba Sadiq and other MPAs were barred by speaker Sibtain Khan from attending 15 sittings of the assembly through two different orders issued on July 7 and Oct 23.
The counsel argued that the petitioners being elected members of the assembly had an inalienable right to participate in the sessions. They argued that the law provided a ban for 15 days only but the speaker unlawfully imposed a ban on the petitioners for attending 15 sittings of the assembly. They asked the court to suspend the impugned decisions of the speaker regarding the ban on the participation of the MPAs in the assembly sessions for being unconstitutional.  
The judge had suspended the impugned decisions of the speaker allowing the petitioners to participate and vote, if needed, in the session of the assembly summoned by the governor requiring the chief minister to secure a vote of confidence, however, the session has not been held so far.

Proceedings in two references made by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) are pending against Cheema, also a former director general of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA).
A counsel told the court that Cheema was required to visit the United Arab Emirates with an official delegation. He asked the court to give a one-time permission to the petitioner from Dec 25 to Jan 2.
The court allowed the application and directed Cheema to furnish surety bonds of Rs2 million.
The NAB had arrested Cheema in the references of illegal assets and the Ahiana-i-Iqbal Housing scheme. However, an inquiry against him and others regarding alleged corruption in the LDA-City Housing Scheme was closed after the development partners promised to give plots to all the allottees.
In the scheme’s reference, the NAB alleged that Cheema and other accused caused a huge loss to national exchequer by awarding the contract of the housing scheme to a company without bidding.

6,CMIT seeks IUB VC’s removal over irregularities,"VC rubbishes allegations, cries foul","LAHORE:  The Chief Minister’s Inspection Team (CMIT) has requested Punjab  Governor/Chancellor Balighur Rehman to remove Islamia University of  Bahawalpur (IUB) Vice Chancellor (VC) Dr Athar Mahboob from the post  after allegations of financial irregularities and illegal appointments  were proved in its inquiry.  
The chancellor can remove the VC in exercise of his powers under Section 14(6) of the Islamia University Bahawalpur Act 1975.  
The CMIT further recommended to the government that Dr Mahboob should also  be barred from serving in any government institution/ department.  
It  sought lodging a case with Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE)  regarding financial irregularities and irregular  appointments/recruitments, which caused ‘serious financial loss’ to both  the universities, i.e. the IUB and Khawaja Fareed University of  Engineering and Information Technology (KFUEIT), Rahim Yar Khan, where he completed his  tenure as the VC before joining the IUB about two-and-a-half years back.   

VC rubbishes allegations, cries foul

The CMIT had launched an inquiry against Dr Mahboob on  complaints of Dr Syed Shakir Ali Ghazali, the ex-director of the IUB  Rahim Yar Khan Campus, and Nadeem Advocate.  
The CMIT report, available with Dawn,  states that the charge of financial irregularities worth Rs5m against  by the VC for holding a two-day cultural activity in 2020 was proved  during the probe.  
The other allegations, including the appointment of  three additional treasurers against one advertised post, were also proved  as the posts were filled in violation of the service statutes.  The allegation of 100 illegal appointments referred to in the audit  paras, as pointed out by the applicant, also stood proved. There were  proofs that the appointment of Dr Munir Ahmed as professor was made without approved statutes and in violation of merit and  criteria. The financial irregularities worth Rs10m were committed  during payment to M/s Technas and it was proved as per the available  record, the report said.  
The CMIT has found proof of the  allegations of misuse of emergency powers also in appointments of  chairmen/chairpersons of various departments. It states that the posts  of associate lecturers did not exist in the existing Service Statutes of  the IUB and the approval by the VC for appointments of 300 associate  lecturers without having service statutes was also declared as illegal.  The recruitment of 176 junior clerks against 18 advertised posts was  also found to be illegal as any IUB authority, including the selection  board, had no power to increase the number of seats after the  advertisement or during the selection process.  
Regarding the CMIT report, Dr Mahboob told Dawn that  all the allegations leveled against him were a pack of lies and the  CMIT had conducted one-sided inspection. He said he was working as the  VC and he knew more about the university act than the CMIT.  
“All  the finances used for the development of the university were completely  approved by the syndicate of the university,” he said and alleged that  the people who had lodged complaints against him wanted to malign him.  
Dr  Mahboob further said the selection board was conducted to make all the  appointments during his tenure and these appointments were duly approved  by the syndicate. He said the syndicate also had the power to create a  post and it might have created associate lecturers posts, claiming that  all the people were hired while completing legal formalities.

Naveed has already been on physical remand since his arrest.
The suspect, Waqas, had been in police custody for the last few weeks in connection with the investigation of the case as main suspect Naveed had bought the pistol used in the attack through his close friend Waqas; however his formal arrest was made by the police on Thursday.

Sources said Mudassar had been taken into custody more than a week ago and now his brother Tayyab too was detained by the law-enforcement agencies in connection with the investigation of the case.
Out of total six members of the JIT, only three arrived in Gujranwala and Wazirabad for Thursday’s proceedings as main suspect Naveed was presented in a local court of Wazirabad on completion of judicial remand in the case of possessing illegal weapon. The case had been registered with Wazirabad city police station and his judicial remand was extended until Jan 3.

According to a notification, the decision was made in response to complaints filed against DMD Manzoor Ahmed. However, the officer dismissed the complaints as unfounded. He stated that he was not even named in any complaint. “Because I’m an open book, I’d go home if any wrong proves against him,” he said.
Several complaints and inquiries were launched against several NTDC officers during the previous four years or so, under various pretexts.In April, the NTDC management, which reportedly is under the strict monitoring of the government, stopped its officials from leaking any information to the media.
It, through a letter titled “Secrecy of official confidential or secret document(s), information and use of press or any media platform by NTDC employees” warned the officers of strict departmental action if any of them was found involved in supplying any information related to the company.
The director general audit (power) — a wing of the Department of the Auditor General of Pakistan — in April launched an investigation into corruption of billions of rupees in the NTDC. The director general also constituted an inquiry team with a direction to complete and submit a fact-finding report on the allegations against the NTDC MD within seven days.
Similarly, the federal ombudsman in May 2022 said that the suspension of a senior officer of the NTDC and the initiation of an inquiry against him 15 days before his retirement were smacked of arbitrariness and maladministration by the management. In its recent decision, the ombudsman also declared delay in processing the pension case of the complainant on the pretext of pending inquiry and non-completion of codal formalities discriminatory, blatant violation of the rules and unjustified; hence, legally not tenable on the basis of the record made available by the parties.
