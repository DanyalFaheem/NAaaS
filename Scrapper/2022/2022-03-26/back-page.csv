0,SITUATIONER: MQM’S DELICIOUS DILEMMA,It has been getting renewed attention from both the ruling and opposition parties.,"THE Muttahida Qaumi Movement is aware of the flak it has been taking after its meetings with opposition parties, particularly the Pakistan Peoples Party, and an apparent indecision on the no-trust move.  
It is also aware of how its own workers and supporters feel about its alliance with the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf at the Centre.   
Nonetheless, the MQM-Pakistan has a tough decision on its hands. Background conversations with senior leaders and workers suggest that the party is considering abstaining from the National Assembly sitting on the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan rather than coming out in support of the opposition or the government.  
But those who are in favour of abstaining from the no-trust vote would like Muttahida to quit the PTI-led coalition if Imran Khan survives the move, stay in touch with the opposition and focus on the next elections. 
This is all new stuff for a party which claims to have liberated itself from the clutches of the London-based leadership six years ago, but does not seem to find the strength to break the unseen shackles put around its neck by a powerful establishment.  
Altaf Hussain, the party supremo, used to take all the decisions until that fateful day on Aug 22, 2016, when those who matter found his incendiary speech one too many.   
But Mr Hussain would never take responsibility for unpopular decisions and routinely made the coordination committee a scapegoat.   
In the post-2016 era, Mr Hussain’s role was assumed by the establishment. It started giving orders to the MQM leadership about do’s and don’ts disguised as ‘advice’ or ‘suggestions’ that quite often came through phone calls. The party had no choice but to follow these advices and own the decisions taken by invisible actors sitting far from the party’s Karachi headquarters. 
The Nov 8, 2017 press conference jointly addressed by MQM-P and Pak Sarzameen Party leadership at the Karachi Press Club to announce their merger was a classic example. The forced marriage didn’t last for 24 hours though.
However, the MQM-P is not naive. To its voters, it has cleverly painted itself as a victim that has no choice but to merely carry out the will of the establishment. It has made it clear to the electorate that the decision to join the PTI-led coalition had been thrust upon it and by the same token, it has had to stay in the ruling coalition out of compulsion.  
But things began to take a turn with the change of command at a key institution. While it is still on a tight leash vis-à-vis organisational affairs, the powers-that-be have communicated to the MQM-P that it is free to go its own way on the no-trust move.  
But this is just limited freedom as the party was not even allowed to tweet a congratulatory message to its founder when he was acquitted in a case by a British court last month or to condole the death of his sister.  
So, it’s tough to take a decision and own it in front of the voter.  
Since the filing of the no-confidence resolution, the MQM-P has been getting renewed attention from both the ruling and opposition parties. Prime Minister Imran Khan visited its headquarters earlier this month for the first time since coming to power.  
Maulana Fazlur Rehman was not far behind.  
But the constituents found Muttahida’s dalliance with the PPP leadership hard to swallow. Reports that MQM was trying to stitch together a working relationship with PPP in Sindh drew murmurs of betrayal from the former’s die-hard supporters. 
Rivals like the Pak Sarzameen Party, Jamaat-i-Islami and MQM-Haqiqi saw it as a godsend and heaped scorn on MQM-P with undisguised glee. 
The MQM-P was vilified for “selling its mandate for a few ministries” and eating its own words that the PPP-led Sindh government was “corrupt, racist and biased” and   the source of injustice to the province’s urban areas.

Although PPP leaders have been declaring their party had accepted all demands of the MQM-P, the latter is not impressed.  
It recently came up with two posers for Maulana Fazlur Rehman: (1) how could he become the PPP’s guarantor after Asif Ali Zardari “deceived the PDM over the issue of resignations” and (2) it got Yousuf Raza Gilani elected leader of the opposition in Senate through government votes.  
The Bahadurabad-based party now finds itself in a quandary. It believes that it is damned if it sides with Peoples Party and damned if it declares its unequivocal support for the PTI. Hence it feels that the least of all evils for it would be to stay on the sidelines.  
Many MQM leaders think that the prime minister had gained Karachiites’ sympathy after all opposition parties, especially the PPP, joined hands to oust him. If Imran Khan turns out to be the loser at the end of the day, the MQM voters would feel let down because there’s no love lost between them and Mr Zardari and they are no ardent fan of Shehbaz Sharif either.  
All options are on the table and MQM-P has to pick one all by itself. And all indications suggest it will keep the window open for talks with PPP and abstain from voting on the no-confidence move.  
A senior MQM leader summed up the party’s predicament: “It’s a catch-22 situation for us. I think staying neutral in the no-confidence motion will be our best bet.” 
According to him, PPP and MQM had set up a committee to explore prospects for cooperation. “It appears that the general election is just round the corner. We should leave the treasury benches and prepare for elections.  
“I am sure whichever party wins, it will need us.”

1,Houthi attack on Jeddah oil depot triggers massive fire,The rebels claimed 16 attacks on a number of targets including an electrical station in Jizan.,"DUBAI: Yemen’s Houthi rebels attacked a Saudi Aramco oil facility setting off a huge fire visible from Jeddah’s Formula One track as part of a wave of attacks on Friday. 
“We did several attacks with drones and ballistic missiles,” the Iran-backed Houthi rebels said in a statement, including an “Aramco installation in Jeddah (and) vital installations in Riyadh”. 
Smoke billowed near Jeddah’s F1 track as drivers took part in practice runs, with Red Bull’s world champion Max Verstappen saying he could smell the blaze as he drove. 
“I can smell burning... is it my car?” the Dutchman asked over team radio.
The rebels claimed 16 attacks on a number of targets including an electrical station in Jizan, bordering Yemen, which was set ablaze. 
The attack targeted the same fuel depot that the Houthis had attacked in recent days, the North Jeddah Bulk Plant sits just southeast of the city’s international airport, a crucial hub for Muslim pilgrims heading to Makkah. 
The Saudi Arabian Oil Company, known as Saudi Aramco, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Saudi state TV only acknowledged a hostile operation targeting the depot, without elaborating. 
The attacks came as Saudi Arabia still leads a coalition battling the Houthis, who seized Yemen’s capital of Sanaa in September 2014. The kingdom, which entered the war in Yemen in 2015, has been internationally criticised for its airstrikes that have killed civilians something the Houthis point to as they launch drones, missiles and mortars into the kingdom.
The second-ever Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in Jeddah is taking place on Sunday, though concerns had been raised by some over the recent attacks targeting the kingdom.
The F1 said in a statement that: “The position at the moment is that we are waiting for further information from the authorities on what has happened.” The F1 did not elaborate.
The al-Masirah satellite news channel run by Yemen’s Houthi rebels later claimed they had attacked an Aramco facility in Jeddah, along with other targets in Riyadh and elsewhere. The report provided no further details.
Meanwhile, Saudi state TV also acknowledged attacks in the town of Dhahran targeting water tanks that damaged vehicles and homes. Another attack targeted an electrical substation in an area of southwestern Saudi Arabia near the Yemeni border, state TV said.
The North Jeddah Bulk Plant stores diesel, gasoline and jet fuel for use in Jeddah, the kingdom’s second-largest city. It accounts for over a quarter of all of Saudi Arabia’s supplies and also supplies fuel crucial to running a regional desalination plant.
The Houthis have twice targeted the North Jeddah plant with cruise missiles. One attack came in November 2020. The last came on Sunday as part of a wider barrage by the Houthis.

2,PTI challenges ECP decision on secrecy of party funding,Senate panel rejects draft bill allowing office holders to take part in electioneering.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Friday moved the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision to dismiss its applications for keeping the disgruntled party member out of the foreign funding case and for seeking confidentiality of its funding sources. 
PTI secretary general and federal minister Asad Umar filed a petition before the IHC to challenge the March 15 decision of the commission.
The ECP had earlier rejected the PTI’s pleas seeking to keep Akbar S. Babar — the disgruntled founding member of the PTI and the complainant in the case — out of the foreign funding proceedings and for not sharing the documents requisitioned through the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) with him. Mr Babar had filed the foreign funding case in November 2014.
In his petition, the PTI secretary general said the ECP had been briefed in detail about reasons for keeping the complainant out of its proceedings and not sharing the record, including details obtained from State Bank of Pakistan. But, he said, the ECP “failed to appreciate the real issue in the matter, which was contained in the report of the [ECP] Scrutiny Committee”. 

Senate panel rejects draft bill allowing office holders to take part in electioneering

The petitioner said the record not collected from Mr Babar ought to be kept confidential and urged the IHC to set aside the ECP’s decisions to share the record with the complainant and to allow him to be part of the foreign funding case. 
Senate panel rejects draft bill
Meanwhile, a Senate panel by a majority vote rejected the elections amendment bill allowing public office holders to take part in poll campaign. 
During a Senate committee meeting, the opposition members observed the ECP powers couldn’t be curtailed under Article 222 of the Constitution. They said framing and modifying the election code of conduct was constitutional mandate of the ECP and the ‘controversial’ ordinance was a clear interference in the exclusive domain of the ECP.
ECP Secretary Umar Hameed Khan told the senators that the ordinance promulgated on February 19 allowed public office holders to take part in campaigns for electoral candidates, but it denied level-playing field to parties and asked the government to revisit it. 
Farooq H. Naek said ordinances with far-reaching implications should not be allowed to be promulgated in the darkness of night.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan said implementing the ordinance was responsibility of all when it was struck down neither by a court nor by the parliament. 
Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said for supremacy of the Constitution and the law, the notices issued to and fines imposed on the prime minister and other public office-holders should be reversed. 
Senator Kamran Murtaza said the president promulgated the ordinance to achieve political objectives, thereby encroaching upon the domain of the ECP that was constitutionally responsible to hold free and fair elections. 
Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar questioned if the powers given to the ECP could be taken away or abridged under an ordinance, in negation of Article 222 of the Constitution.
The ECP secretary said the code of conduct in recent days had been violated 98 times due to the ordinance, revealing that 62 of the violations had been committed by the ruling side.

3,"Israel to host ‘historic summit’ of US, Arab diplomats","The summit will be attended by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterparts from UAE, Bahrain and Morocco.","JERUSALEM: Israel said it will host a “historic summit” from Sunday of top diplomats from the United States and three Arab states with which it has normalised ties. 
“At the invitation of Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, this upcoming Sunday and Monday... a historic diplomatic summit will be held in Israel,” the foreign ministry said on Friday. 
A series of diplomatic meetings would be attended by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterparts from the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco, it said, without giving further details. 
The United Arab Emirates forged diplomatic ties with Israel in 2020 under a series of US-brokered deals known as the Abraham Accords. 
Bahrain and Morocco followed suit, while Sudan also agreed to normalise ties with Israel although it has yet to finalise a deal. The agreements — reached under former US president Donald Trump — broke with decades of Arab consensus that there would be no relations with Israel while the Palestinian question remains unresolved. 
But the Arab countries said they were motivated by economic benefits of ties with Israel. The upcoming talks come against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a conflict that has sparked wider security concerns and sent oil and food prices soaring. 
It also follows a three-way summit hosted by Egypt on Tuesday at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh between Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and the UAE’s de facto ruler, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.

4,Pakistani virus found in Malawi; WHO extends polio-related curbs,The WHO had imposed travel restrictions on Pakistan in May 2014 due to increasing cases of poliovirus in the country.,"LAHORE: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has extended restrictions on travel from Pakistan for another three months for ‘transferring’ the poliovirus to the African nation of Malawi.  
The WHO had imposed travel restrictions on Pakistan in May 2014 due to increasing cases of poliovirus in the country.  
“This is the first WPV1 detection in the WHO African Region since 2016, when four cases occurred due to endemic transmission in Nigeria,” the Polio International Health Regulations (2005) emergency committee noted with serious concern.  
The committee expressed concern that for the first time since the Public Health Emergency of International Concern had been declared in 2014, there had been a case of polio due to new international spread from the Afghanistan-Pakistan epidemiological bloc, with WPV1 confirmed in a three-year-old child from Lilongwe, the capital of Malawi, with onset of paralysis in November 2021.  
“The genomic sequencing indicates the closest matching virus to that found in the case is a virus found in 2019 in Pakistan,” it said.  
In Pakistan, it said, there was concern about persistent low grade WPV-1 transmission in the central epidemiological corridor (including South KP and South East of Afghanistan) and there was a need to strongly address gaps in surveillance and SIA quality. 
The emergency committee also noted that another key challenge was the children still missed in core reservoirs which were being reduced through approaches such as dealing with refusals before the campaign starts and using ‘influencers’, tracking of vaccinators to identify missed children and areas, performing sweeping activities and health camps. As per the polio control room data, more than 22.19 million under five-year-old children had been vaccinated during the campaign.

5,"With military support high on agenda, Biden lands in Poland",Poland hopes the visit will underline security assurances already made by US that it will defend “every inch” of Nato territory.,"RZESZOW: US President Joe Biden landed in Poland, on Friday to get a firsthand look at international efforts to help some of the millions of Ukrainian refugees fleeing war in their country, and speak to American troops bolstering Nato’s eastern flank.
His first stop was to meet soldiers from the US Army’s 82nd Airborne Division stationed in the area of Rzeszow airport as part of Nato’s protection of the alliance’s eastern flank. TV footage showed him sharing pizza and chatting with several military personnel.
Biden’s schedule was delayed after the plane carrying Polish President Andrzej Duda was turned back on route to Rzeszow and made an emergency landing in Warsaw. Duda later boarded a different aircraft and headed back to eastern Poland. An official in his office said Duda had not been in any danger.
Biden was due to receive a briefing on the humanitarian response to help civilians sheltering from Russian attacks inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees fleeing Ukraine.
Biden told reporters in Brussels on Thursday that his visit will “reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine.” In the evening, Biden was to travel to the capital Warsaw for talks with Duda. On Saturday, he was scheduled to give what the White House described as a major address.
Poland hopes that Biden’s visit will underline the security assurances already made by the United States that it will defend “every inch” of Nato territory. Warsaw is keen to see even more US troops stationed on Nato’s eastern flank.
Poland is also likely to raise the idea of an international peacekeeping mission involving troops being stationed in Ukraine, an idea first proposed by ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski during a trip to Kyiv.
En route to Poland on Air Force One, national security adviser Jake Sullivan briefed reporters. Asked whether Russia would try to bomb convoys carrying supplies to Ukraine over land through Nato countries, Sullivan said: “We are doing contingency planning for the possibility that Russia chooses to strike Nato territory in that context or in any other context.
“And the president has been about as clear as one can be about his absolute determination to respond decisively, alongside the other members of our alliance if Russia attacks Nato,” Sullivan said.
He also suggested the United States and its allies could still impose new measures to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
“Of course, there are additional measures to tighten the screws on sanctions, and we will be constantly reviewing those,” he said.
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation” to disarm its neighbor. Kyiv and its Western allies call it an unprovoked war of aggression and say Russia’s true aim was to overthrow the government of what President Vladimir Putin regards as an illegitimate state.
