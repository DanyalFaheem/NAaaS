0,"Admin, police reports differ in Pattoki vendor’s lynching case",The police have so far arrested 12 suspects for their involvement in the incident.,"KASUR: Punjab government on Friday approved financial compensation worth Rs500,000 for the family of a cracker vendor who was allegedly lynched at a wedding at Pattoki a couple of days back amid contradictory reports of the incident filed by police and the administration. 
Official sources say the report on the incident submitted by the district administration contradicts the police and medical reports. 
Ashraf alias Sultan, a rice cracker of Jaggowala village died mysteriously at a wedding held at a banquet hall at Pattoki on March 21. 
The reports prepared by the Chunian assistant commissioner’s office and the tehsildar concerned confirmed that Ashraf was tortured to death by a mob at Aljannat Marriage Hall, Pattoki.  
The reports further said the victim was unmarried, having no family of his own, and was living with his brother Aslam, who should be given the compensation amount. 
It was suspected that the deceased was lynched by the wedding guests, taking him for a pick pocket, the reports said. 
The incident was highlighted by the media for callousness of wedding guests who could be seen in a video clip having dinner, while the vendor’s body was lying in the banquet hall. 
The police have so far arrested 12 suspects for their involvement in the incident, besides the owner of the banquet hall for deleting the CCTV camera footage of the episode.   
Meanwhile, the medical report could not confirm torture of the victim, while the police also had no video or other evidence to show that the deceased was beaten up before he died. 
However, the police claimed in the report to have video clips obtained from the CCTV camera, the movie maker and phones of wedding guests. 
Sources said the police were waiting for the forensic report and some other solid and admissible evidence before arriving at any conclusion, while the administration report “confirmed” the vendor was brutally tortured to death by a mob.  
The report, however, is silent on the reason for his lynching.

1,"Minor maid, burnt by employer, dies at hospital","SAHIWAL: A minor maid who was burnt allegedly by her employer for resisting sexual assault at Chak 189/9-L, Harappa,...","SAHIWAL: A minor maid who was burnt allegedly by her employer for resisting sexual assault at Chak 189/9-L, Harappa, succumbed to her burns at the Nishtar Hospital, Multan.  
On Wednesday, Sawera (14) was burnt by Dilbar Shah, the son of Pir Riaz Shah, who had sprinkled her with kerosene and gave it fire. The victim got severe burns to most of her body, especially face, chest, shoulder and legs.  
She was admitted to the District Headquarters Teaching Hospital for treatment of burns where doctors referred her to the Nishtar Hospital, Multan, because of her critical condition.  
Sawera died at the Multan hospital after struggling for life for 24 hours.  
District Police Officer Sadiq Baloch, talking to Dawn, said although the girl’s parents did not mention in the first information report (FIR) that their daughter was sexually abused or assaulted by the suspect but police would investigate all aspects of the case to find the cause of the murder.  
The sources at the DHQ Teaching Hospital told Dawn that the girl’s postmortem report had been completed and swabs had been collected for the DNA analysis and other tests.  
The sources, privy to the situation, said, on condition of anonymity, the police suspected that the victim girl was tortured and murdered because she resisted the sexual assault.  
The FIR identified Sawera, the daughter of farm worker Muhammad Jahangir, who has seven daughters and two sons. It said because of poverty, Jahangir handed over one of his daughters, Sawera, to Pir Riaz Shah in 2012 when she was just four years old. In the recent past, she had complained to her family many times that Pir’s son Dilbar Shah, a married man with kids, used to threaten her. She refused to work at the Pir’s house because of the suspect.  
Two weeks back, Sawera came to her parent’s house to attend the marriage of her siblings and again complained to her mother, Khursheed Bibi, about Dilbar Shah’s behaviour. She said Dilber would ‘harass’ her whenever his wife and children were out of the house. However, her family again left her at the Pir’s House on March 12. On March 23, the family got the news from Pir Riaz’s employees that their daughter was burnt by Dilbar.  
The family rushed to Pir’s house and found Sawera in a critical condition while Dilbar had escaped. She was shifted by Rescue 1122 to hospital.  
The Harappa police claimed that Dilbar had been arrested and a murder case had been registered against him on complaint of Jahangir. After completing forensic analysis, the police sent the body for autopsy.  
Punjab Inspector General of Police Rao Sardar Ali Khan took notice of the incident and directed DPO Baloch to investigate the matter. The IG ordered the Sahiwal police to provide security and justice to the family of the deceased.

The artist has used miniscule technique in the oil medium on the canvas. Ms Kausar who hails from Madrassa Chattah, a village near Gujranwala told Dawn: “It’s my very first solo exhibition. I have tried to capture the pastoral beauty of my village through my artworks. Nature is close to my heart and I have tried to depict the serenity and beauty of my village through my paintings”.  
Safeena Kausar has earlier participated in the Young Artists Exhibition organised by the Lahore Arts Council. A novel aspect of the exhibition was the coins, capturing nature on them, painted with oil.  
“I use such things which seem redundant, even children and beggars don’t accept coins these days and they often remain lying unused in one’s wallet. I thought of painting them to turn them into mini-art pieces” says Kausar who has done the Master’s in Fine Arts from the College of Art and Design, University of Punjab University and she is currently doing another Masters in Visual Art from the National College of Arts. She has put about 500 artworks on display at the exhibition.  
To the question that why she only painted her village, Kausar said when she came to Lahore for studies, the noise and hustle and bustle of the city made her miss her village, its peace, serenity, the scenes of dawn and dusk and the starry nights and thought of painting all the beauty of her village.  
Safeena Kausar is inspired by iconic artists like Allah Bux, Khalid Iqbal and Van Gogh.  
Shakir Ali Museum Director Taniya Sohail inaugurated the exhibition. The exhibition will remain open till April 5.

The government had allocated Rs500m to provide the missing facilities in colleges and universities; however, the Punjab Finance Department had shifted the budget towards sewerage and road construction projects in Sheikhupura and Gujranwala. 
A senior Higher Education Department (HED) official, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn Rs500m allocated for missing facilities were blocked by the Planning and Development Department and now the finance department had shifted Rs300m out of the total amount to other schemes. He said the HED had a plan to use the funds to provide facilities, including infrastructure, building classrooms, laboratories and other things of the colleges and universities, but now it won’t be possible since funds had been diverted to another department. 
The official said the HED was already facing shortage of funds as the government had turned a number of colleges into universities. He said the department had to upgrade the infrastructure in colleges to smoothly run four-year bachelor’s programmers and funds were needed for that too.

8,Gas shortage despite reduction in demand,SNGPL MD disagrees,"LAHORE: Several parts of Lahore continue facing the shortage of gas despite its dwindling demand in the wake of rising mercury as there is either no gas or gas with extremely low pressure after 9pm on a daily basis. 
“Facing such issues since November last, we expected the problem will be over with the start of summer,” Ikram, of Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF) Housing Society, said. 
“There is no gas from 9pm to 5am daily,” he added. 
He argued that generally, the tail-end areas face such a situation in winter but not in summer. But despite the fact, the OPF scheme is not located at the tail-end areas, the residents continue to face such a terrible situation since November. 

SNGPL MD disagrees

“We demand the government to look into the matter immediately by taking up it with the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) authorities,” he sought. 
Besides OPF Housing Society, the areas reportedly facing gas shortage in night hours include Old Anarkali, Valencia Town, Johar Town (in some blocks), Township, Garden Town, Gulberg, Super Town situated along Walton Road, Iqbal Town, Chungi Amarsadhu, Cavalry Ground, Sahafi Colony (Harbandspura), Shad Bagh, Mughhalpura, Kotli Pir Abdul Rehman, Garhi Shahu, Paragon City, College Road and some localities along Multan Road. 
“It seems that there is no government in the country at the moment, as the rulers, on one hand, are busy fighting the no-trust motion, the public at large, on the other hand, is facing low gas pressure or no gas, expensive LPG, inflation and unemployment,” mourns Ahmad, of a locality along Walton Road. He said though, for the last 30 days, temperatures have increased considerably, the gas shortage persists. 
“I never witnessed such a situation,” he continued. 
Talking to Dawn, Akhar, of Township, said the gas shortage in summer is really shocking. “Though it is a matter of great concern, the government and the SNGPL are mum,” he said. 
“The government must resolve this issue.” 
Mehmood, of Sahafi colony, Anwar of Shad Bagh, Akram of Chungi Amar Sadhu, Asghar of Gulberg and others from various residential areas also complained about gas shortage in their localities. 
“Whenever we ask the SNGPL field officials (meter readers, bill distributors etc) about the gas shortage, they show ignorance about the issue,” said Asghar while talking to Dawn. He said Gulberg always faced extreme low gas pressure in winter but not in the summer.
“The non-provision of gas after 9pm till early morning hours is really an ordeal,” he added.
SNGPL Managing Director Ali Hamdani , however, says there is no gas shortage at all. 
“Due to the sudden and early start of summer, we are forced to provide gas to the gas-fired power plants to meet the increasing demand for electricity. On the other hand, the hydel power generation has also been affected owing to insufficient rain,” he explained. 
He said despite all this, the SNGPL is trying to provide gas uninterruptedly to domestic gas consumers. 
“I think that such complaints (gas shortage after 9pm) exist in some isolated areas but not those being reported,” he said.

9,American girl’s suicide: FIA seeks US record of blackmail by two suspects,Official says the suspects will not be extradited to the US.,"LAHORE: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has sought record from the relevant department of the US about the two suspects allegedly involved in uploading objectionable videos and pictures of a teenage American girl on social media that is believed to be the ‘sole reason’ for her suicide.
The FIA on Thursday arrested Arsalan Saeed alias Mikram Saeed (prime suspect) and Kamal Anwar, both residents of Dijkot, Faisalabad, under sections 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca) in connection with the girl’s suicide.
“Both suspects have been arrested on the information provided by the US Embassy for their alleged involvement in sharing objectionable videos and pictures of 17-year-old New York girl Shylynn Dixon among her friends on social media (Facebook) that made her to commit suicide,” FIA cyber crime chief Babur Bakht Qureshi told Dawn on Friday. 
When asked whether the FIA would hand the suspects over to the US authorities, Mr Qureshi said: “They [suspects] will not be extradited (to the US) as we will try them here. Our law is very strict on such crime and they will surely be convicted for their alleged crime.”
“We have sought relevant evidence/record of involvement of the suspects [in the matter] from the department concerned of the US. The required evidence will reach here through its (US) court,” Mr Qureshi added. 
The US Embassy had told the FIA that both suspects were involved in blackmailing and “sextortion” through Facebook of Ms Dixon (a resident of Lisbon town of New York), that led her to commit suicide.  
“The suspects shared objectionable pictures and videos of the victim among her friends and school fellows on the social media networking site,” the FIA said. The agency has also seized digital devices used by the suspects during a raid on their residence. The suspects confessed to have committed illegal act of blackmailing and sextortion,” the agency said. 
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), during investigation into the suicide of Ms Dixon, found that Arsalan Saeed (residing in Punjab, Pakistan) sexually exploited her (on social media) leading to her suicide. “Saeed received sexually explicit media of/from Ms Dixon over Facebook and later made her to provide him more sexually explicit material. Ms Dixon committed suicide owing to Saeed’s sextortion threats,” the FBI report sent to the FIA mentioned.
On March 3, 2021, members of the New York State Police visited the town of Lisbon to investigate the suicide of Ms Dixon by the use of a firearm.
“Information gathered through investigation had revealed that the victim had sent a nude image to an unknown person (Saeed) through a social media platform (Facebook), and she was being harassed,” the FBI report said.

“It is regrettable that a process that is well within the ambit of the Constitution – and clearly defined in it – has been made controversial and the basis for greater political polarisation in an attempt to trigger a constitutional crisis in the country,” a statement issued by the commission said.
It added that the commission firmly believed in constitutionalism and the primacy of the parliament in undertaking processes within their domain. 
“Measures to obstruct parliamentary functions and the smooth conclusion of a constitutional process are no less than attempts to derail the democratic process and deny people the benefit of their right to representative government. Both the government and the opposition are obliged to adhere to the rule of law defined by the Constitution,” the statement said. 
It added that it’s against the public interest if the matters to be settled in the Parliament were taken to the streets or intervention of other institutions was sought to determine the fate of a process that was within the parliamentary domain. 
The commission said that civil society was indispensable to the democratic dispensation and it could not be a silent spectator of the events that could result in regressive long-term constitutional effects.

11,Millers see flour shortage at start of Ramzan,"LAHORE: Flour millers fear a shortage of wheat flour at the start of Ramazan, accusing the Punjab Food Department of...","LAHORE: Flour millers fear a shortage of wheat flour at the start of Ramazan, accusing the Punjab Food Department of reducing the grain quota of the mills located in south Punjab though the new crop has not yet hit the market. 
A senior food official, however, downplays the problem, saying that the millers are used to making the mountain of a molehill every year. 
Pakistan Flour Mills Association Punjab chairman Tahir Hanif Malik said here on Friday that the official grain quota of the mills situated in the south Punjab had been cut by the food department while harvesting of the wheat crop was weeks away. He said the flour mills were dependent on the release of the official wheat because of unavailability of the commodity in the open market at this time of the year. 
The cut in quota, he warned, could create problems for the millers and consequently cause shortage of flour in the market during Ramazan. He demanded that the department should continue supply of wheat from its storages to the south Punjab flour mills for some more days so that the supply of the commodity was not disturbed till the new crop reached the market by mid-April. 
The wheat harvesting season in south Punjab districts is likely to begin in the first week of April due to early ripening of the crop as a result of higher temperature this year. 
A food department official tells Dawn that the wheat quota of south Punjab mills is reduced each year after mid-March as grain from adjacent Sindh province starts reaching the border districts of Punjab by this time. He says there is nothing new this year. 
“The wheat from Sindh has hit Rahim Yar Khan, Bahawalnagar and Bahawalpur districts, etc and is available at around Rs2,250 per 40kg (against the official minimum support price of Rs2,200 per 40kg) there right now. In view of this, the wheat quota of these mills has been reduced while that of the central Punjab mills has been increased to maintain the supply and demand balance,” he adds.

They congratulated Prime Minister Imran Khan and Mr Buzdar over the bill for the creation of south Punjab province to be tabled in the National Assembly.
Those who met the chief minister included Asif Nakai, Akhtar Malik, Rai Taimoor Bhatti, Taimoor Lali, Waris Aziz, Malik Wasif Mazhar Raan, Saleem Akhtar and others. 
While assuring the parliamentarians of resolving the problems related to their constituencies, Buzdar emphasised that the “propaganda by the anti-development elements” could not cheat the masses.  
He said the country needed stability instead of anarchy, regretting the opposition parties were involved in negative politics. He said the public meeting of March 27 would prove a public referendum against the opposition.
Mr Buzdar said the opposition intended to destabilise the country through the politics of anarchy and maintained that its attempts would be frustrated. He said the March 27 meeting would prove a turning point in the history of the country.
He said tabling of the south Punjab province bill would be a solid step towards the fulfillment of another promise by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf.  
HAMMAD:  Federal energy minister Hammad Azhar has urged the Lahorites to come out  in droves to participate in the historical March 27 public gathering in  Islamabad to eliminate the traditional “corrupt politics”.
“We are  fighting a war for the sake of Pakistan and the traditional corrupt  politics will take its last breath on March 27, when millions of people will turn up at the PTI’s public gathering at Parade Ground in Islamabad on  March 27,” Mr Azhar told the media at the PTI  Lahore office on Friday.
The minister stressed that the  Lahorites should join the PTI rally to show that the masses were against the politics of corruption and horse-trading. 
“The March 27 public gathering will  outnumber the PTI’s Nov 30, 2011, public gathering at Minar-i-Pakistan,”  he claimed. “If people did not come out in droves, the country may yet again fall under the siege of corrupt mafia,” he said.
He said it would be very difficult for PTI MNAs to attempt floor-crossing, when millions of people come out to condemn the  politics of corruption and bribe. “It is legally and morally unfair that an MNA elected on ‘bat’ election symbol votes for another party,” he asserted.
Meanwhile, it is learnt that Foreign Minister Shah  Mahmood Qureshi and Defence Minister Parvaiz Khattak will visit the  Chaudhrys of Gujrat and deliver prime minister’s message to them.
