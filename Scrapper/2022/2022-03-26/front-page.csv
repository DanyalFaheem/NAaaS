• Opposition turns out in full force, most govt members stay away
• Shehbaz not allowed to speak; Asad Qaiser accused of being ‘Imran’s stooge’
ISLAMABAD: The first day of one of the most crucial sittings of the National Assembly, which could potentially alter the country’s political landscape, ended shortly after it commenced when Speaker Asad Qaiser — sticking to parliamentary tradition — adjourned the session until Monday (March 28) without allowing the opposition’s no-trust resolution to be tabled. 
As a result, the opposition leaders vented their anger at the speaker after the session, saying he was in violation of the Constitution and running parliament “like a member of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and not the custodian of the house”.
However, the speaker’s decision to adjourn the session until Monday surprised some as well — there had been reports that the government may announce a longer adjournment in an effort to delay the no-confidence vote. 
There were even reports that the speaker could issue a ruling that the vote would have to be deferred until a decision on the presidential reference that is currently before the Supreme Court.
The opposition definitely tried to show its strength in the house, where a who’s-who of mainstream opposition parties was in attendance, 160-strong. From Opposition Leader Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari to Balochistan National Party-M (BNP-M) Akhtar Mengal, all were present and accounted for.
On the other hand, the attendance on the treasury benches was lacklustre with merely 50 to 60 members present. Those in attendance included some cabinet members such as Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Asad Umar, Shireen Mazari, Murad Saeed, Shibli Faraz, Ghulam Sarwar Khan, Shaukat Tarin, Pir Noorul Haq Qadri and Ali Muhammad Khan.
Allies of the ruling coalition — Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) and Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) – also showed their presence in the session with Dr Fehmida Mirza and Khalid Magsi being seen in the house. However, two other parties that usually sit on the treasury benches, Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q) and Muttahidda Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) were conspicuous by their absence.
The session, which started at 11:18am, lasted a mere 15 minutes, ending after fateha was offered for the late MNA Khayal Zaman. Prayers were also offered for the departed souls of senator Rehman Malik and former president Rafiq Tarar.
Speaking on the occasion, Speaker Asad Qaiser said he was adjourning the session until March 28 in keeping with parliamentary tradition. 
But when opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif, who wanted to speak, rose in his seat, the speaker ignored him and proceeded to wrap up proceedings. 
Before leaving for his chamber, the speaker said he will proceed on the no-confidence motion according to the law and Constitution.
He said it was an old tradition that the house was adjourned after a brief proceeding following the death of any member of the National Assembly. He said that in 2012 the house was adjourned this way nine times, in 2013 on four occasions, six times in 2014 and five times under the present government.
Pre-session ‘goodwill’
Interesting scenes were witnessed during the session as the opposition leader, in a rare show of goodwill, walked up to the treasury benches and greeted Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin, among others.
Earlier, PML-N leader Khawaja Asif also had a chat with the finance minister before the start of proceedings.
BAP parliamentary leader Khalid Magsi and GDA leader Ghaus Baksh Mehr went up to the PPP Co Chairman Asif Ali Zardari and Mr Mehr sat with the PPP leader for quite some time.
Later, while talking to reporters in the corridors of parliament, Mr Magsi said the speaker should clear the ambiguity and table the no-trust resolution on March 28. 
He said the government’s allies were assessing the situation and would give their decision on voting day.
Former NA speaker and GDA leader Dr Fehmida Mirza said Mr Qiaser should table the motion in the current session, but recalled that his decision could not be challenged in any court of law.
Before the start of the NA session, opposition parties held a preliminary meeting in Parliament House, while PTI skipped convening such a sitting. 
After their meeting, Asif Zardari said he was quite confident that PM Khan’s days were numbered.
Qaiser ‘stooge of Imran Khan’
Speaking to reporters outside Parliament House shortly after the session was adjourned, Shehbaz Sharif lashed out at the speaker, calling him a “stooge” of Prime Minister Imran Khan.
The PML-N president said that Qaiser had violated the rules of procedure by conducting proceedings as “a PTI worker”.
He said that the motion and requisition for the session was submitted on March 8 and, under the rules, the NA speaker was supposed to summon the session within 14 days. “This was a constitutional obligation and he violated the Constitution by not doing this,” he added.
He also called for the speaker to be tried under Article 6 of the Constitution, which deals with high treason.
“After the Fateha, I stood up to speak on a point of order but my microphone was not turned on,” he claimed.
It is also parliamentary convention that whenever the leader of the opposition requests time on the floor of the house, the speaker nearly always allows them to speak. 
Mr Sharif agreed that according to parliamentary convention, the session would be limited to prayers for the departed MNAs, but maintained that Friday was “an important day”.
“The Constitution and the law is above tradition and voting should have been allowed [...] tradition aside, the speaker should have taken up the motion [but] he did not listen and simply left.”
Shehbaz declared that if the same thing happened at the next sitting, the opposition would use all “constitutional, political and legal” options to take the no-trust move forward.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari claimed that the PM was “fleeing the pitch” and reiterated that Speaker Asad Qaiser had violated the Constitution. “The opposition parties are united and would not let the premier ran away,” he added.
“The no-trust motion is going to be our democratic weapon. We will move towards free and fair elections,” he said, adding that the prime minister had lost “his majority and government”.
He added that the speaker had provided a “weak excuse” to avoid tabling the no-trust move. “Imran can’t run forever. The PM has no sportsman sprit and cannot face defeat with grace. The once great kaptaan will go down like a rat on a sinking ship,” he recalled ironically on the anniversary of Pakistan’s victory in the final of the 1992 cricket world cup.
Reacting to the opposition leader’s remarks, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi demanded an apology from Shehbaz for his tirade against the NA speaker
“The words you have used against Asad Qaiser are inappropriate and I want you to retract the remarks immediately,” he said, adding that the speaker was responsible for conducting proceedings in whatever manner he saw fit.
He also refuted claims that the government was “running away” from the no-confidence motion. “We will deal with it in a democratic, political, and legal way.”
Responding to a question, the minister the opposition was set to receive another surprise on March 27.

1,"Pardoning graft cases would be treachery,  says PM Imran","“Three cowards have been cursing me and trying to intimidate me, but they will never succeed,” he says.","MANSEHRA: Continu­ing his onslaught on rivals who seem determined to kick him out of power through a no-trust vote, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday said if he pardoned the former rulers in the cases of kickbacks and bribery they were facing, it would be tantamount to treachery 
“They (opposition leaders) have been pressurising and blackmailing me to clear them of corruption charges. However, if I give them a clean chit, as Pervez Musharraf did, then I would be committing sedition,” Mr Khan declared while speaking to a cheering crowd here at Thakra Stadium.  
Referring to PTI lawmakers who had openly come out against him, PM Khan said: “The horse-trading in the federal capital is at its peak as Rs250 million and even more is being offered to each MNA for my character assassination, but I cannot find words to admire the loyalty of lawmakers like Salah Mohammad Khan who didn’t sell his conscience. I am sure he would not have thought of going against me even if he was offered Rs500 million,” Mr Khan said.  
The prime minister stayed at the rostrum for over 40 minutes, mostly talking about his government’s performance, their mega-development projects and key achievements. 
In an apparent reference to Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari, PM Khan said: “Three cowards have been cursing me and trying to intimidate me, but I want to make it clear that they would never succeed in their evil mission.”  
PM Khan predicted that Sharif family’s role in Pakistan’s politics had come to an end forever and now they could only get themselves enrolled in British politics.   
“If this family would indulge in British politics, the country would go bankrupt because of their corruption and the government would soon be compelled to seek loans from the international community to run its affairs,” he said.  
Mr Khan recalled that because of his bold narrative at the UN General Assembly the latter had declared March 15 as the international day to mark Islamophobia.  
“Maulana Fazlur Rehman has been using Islam as a stunt for his political and personal gains but he couldn’t make any such achievement which could have helped bring an end to blasphemy being committed in the garb of freedom of speech,” Mr Khan said.  
He said his politics was for the dignity and respect of the country and he would prefer to maintain relations with the US and other western countries based on mutual respect and equality but would never accept their hegemony.  
“I would extend a hand of friendship to the Indian government if it revokes its constitutional article 370 which ended Kashmir’s independent status on August 15, 2019,” Mr Khan said.  
The prime minister invited the people of Mansehra to attend what he called an historic rally in Islamabad on March 27.  
Poll code violations
In a related development, the Election Commission of Pakistan served a notice on Prime Minister Khan for using state resources in the campaign of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) candidates contesting the second phase of local bodies elections and violating the code of conduct by addressing a rally in Mansehra.  
The notice was served by Mansehra District Monitoring Officer Hayatullah Jan through secretary to the PM. The DMO also served similar notices on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, Speaker KP Assembly Mushtaq Ghani and MNA Saleh Mohammad Khan Swati.  
It may be recalled that the PM had been advised through a letter issued on March 21, not to violate any provision of the code of conduct.  The fresh notice to PM Khan follows the imposition of a fine of Rs50,000 on him and other public office holders by the ECP Peshawar on Thursday for addressing a rally in Malakand on March 20. Earlier, Prime Minister Khan was fined Rs50,000 each by the respective DMOs for addressing public meetings in Lower Dir and Swat.  
Similarly, DMO Malakand Zia Ur Rehman served a second notice on Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for violating the code of conduct framed for the second phase of local bodies election in the province. The first such notice was served on March 23 after he addressed a rally in Malakand.  Meanwhile, DMO Kolai-Palas district Wajid Ali imposed Rs20,000 fine on the PTI candidate for tehsil council Palas Mohammad Akram for violating the code of conduct.

2,PPP not in favour of opposition’s power show,"Party's secretary general says PM Imran ""deserves political death, not martyrdom"".","ISLAMABAD: The PPP is pressing the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) — a multi-party opposition alliance — to cancel its planned long march and public meeting in the capital on March 28 in response to the power show being organised by the ruling PTI ahead of the crucial vote on the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan.
Sources in the opposition camp told Dawn that PPP had formally conveyed its reservations to PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif over their planned public meeting in Islamabad.
The sources said PPP had also informed the PDM leaders that if they insisted on going ahead with their planned public meeting, then party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari might not attend the gathering and the party would nominate the second-tier leaders to symbolically participate in it.
Talking to Dawn on condition of anonymity, a senior PPP office-bearer said the party had decided not to give a call to its workers to participate in the long march and the opposition’s public meeting.
He said the PPP believed that after the Supreme Court’s decision to stop the PTI from holding the public meeting at D-Chowk, there was no need for them to hold public gatherings, as such a move could provide an opportunity to the PTI to create some sort of situation to further delay the vote on the no-trust resolution.
Besides, some “undemocratic forces” could also take advantage of the situation and the country could face an “unforeseen incident”, he said.
He believed that since the opposition had succeeded in completing the required numbers to make its no-confidence move a success, there was no need for it to arrange such a power show.
The PPP leader was of the view that the opposition was justified in giving the call for a public meeting when the PTI had threatened to stop MNAs from entering the National Assembly through a public gathering at D-Chowk.
“But now, when the PTI has shifted its venue to Parade Ground in line with the court’s directives and it has also assured the court that no member will be stopped from casting their vote, we should also call off our march and public meeting,” he said.
He said the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had expressed concern over the increasing polarisation in the run-up to the National Assembly session on the no-confidence motion against the prime minister and had also requested both the PTI and the PDM to cancel their power shows.
The PTI has announced to hold its public meeting at Parade Ground in Shakarparian on Sunday (tomorrow), whereas the PDM has announced that it will hold its power show at Peshawar Mor in Islamabad on March 28.
Moreover, the PPP leader said that since the National Assembly speaker had called the session on March 28, it would become difficult for the opposition’s leadership and the members to participate in the rally.
Meanwhile, PPP secretary general Farhatullah Babar through his official Twitter account has publicly pleaded with the PDM leadership to reconsider its plan to hold the public meeting.
“(The) opposition should seriously rethink plans to hold jalsa in Islamabad on 27th. Imran Khan is on the run anyway. Deny him the wish to create mayhem, run away from no trust, derail democracy and then claim political martyrdom. He deserves political death, not martyrdom,” Mr Babar tweeted.

 





 
In a joint statement on Thursday, the PFUJ and the HRCP stated that there was “a danger of violent clashes” between supporters of the rival political camps on the eve of the vote in the NA.
“A breakdown of law and order will not only undermine a constitutional political process inside the [National Assembly] but also play directly into the hands of undemocratic forces,” said the statement, noting that separate venues had now been allotted for the public meetings of the ruling party and the opposition.
But since the route to the two venues for rival workers is almost the same, there is a real danger of clashes between workers on the day, it feared.
It may be recalled that after the announcement by the PTI to arrange a gathering of “one million people” at D-Chowk on March 27 on the eve of voting on the no-confidence resolution against the prime minister, the opposition PDM had also given a call to the public and workers of the component parties to begin a long march towards Islamabad on March 23 to stage a sit-in, which could continue until the completion of the voting process in the National Assembly.
The decision to hold the long march towards the capital on Pakistan Day was announced by PDM president Maulana Fazlur Rehman while talking to media persons after attending a meeting of the joint opposition at the residence of PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif.
Since the PPP is not a part of the PDM, the Maulana had expressed the hope that the PPP would also announce its decision to participate in the long march, saying he and Mr Sharif had extended a formal invitation to the PPP.

3,Lawmaker is not bound to declare loyalty to party: CJP Bandial,Questions why parliament chose to restrict disqualification to de-seating even though it had powers to add more provisions.,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial observed on Friday that the Constitution did not bind a lawmaker to declare allegiance to a political party.  
While referring to an argument by Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan in which he had tried to equate defection under Article 63A of the Constitution in the presidential reference with that of “Khayanat” (dishonesty), the CJP observed that Khayanat was a serious offence and the holy Quran speaks of serious punishment for it. 
But the question demanding attention is: whether the Constitution speaks of dishonesty to a political party or to the constituents who elect legislators. 
The AGP will have a good case if he established that those who switched their loyalty had betrayed their voters, the CJP observed. 
He made the remarks during the hearing by a five-member bench of a presidential reference seeking interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution. 
The CJP wondered why parliament chose to restrict disqualification to de-seating of a member even though it had the powers to add more provisions like a life-long bar from being elected to any legislature. 
Was there some fear behind this omission, Chief Justice Bandial wondered. 
He observed that through the 18th Amendment, parliament had even added punishment to Article 62(1)(f), but made it conditional upon a declaration by a court of law. The observation came when the AGP highlighted that some of the members who had taken refuge at the Sindh House were elected on reserved seats under Article 51(6) of the Constitution, which talks of special seats for women and minorities proportionate to the number of seats won by a party. 
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel wondered whether members were bound to follow the dictates of their party head if the prime minister loses trust of the majority or if an action went against the national interest. 
“Would it not be better for the President to call a meeting of all the parliamentary parties for evolving a consensus than instituting a reference before the court,” Justice Mandokhel wondered.
“This is what former President Ghulam Ishaq Khan used to do — holding meetings to oust the government of the day,” the AGP quipped.
Justice Mandokhel also observed could the court exercise judicial function while sitting to interpret Article 63A in the advisory jurisdiction especially when the Supreme Court cannot even add a full stop in the constitution. 
“What is the issue with the President that he is seeking our opinion,” Justice Mandokhel observed, stressing that he would be the last person to favour ‘Lotas’ (turncoats). Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel observed that the government was apprehensive about defection when actual defection had taken place. 
Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan spoke of a membership form which requires an undertaking that the member would be bound by the party discipline and must face consequences in case of breach of trust. 
An occasion has arisen as the President had sought interpretation of certain provision of the constitution and it becomes the job of the top court to interpret the same. “We may refuse to interpret as the constitution court or interpret if there are certain confusion or return the same,” Justice Ahsan observed. 
The AGP said the laws were made before the crime was  committed and explained that the requirement of oath of the prime minister, as well as lawmakers, were different. Moreover, the party issued a certificate for the issuance of a symbol for election by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) if the member subscribes to the party manifesto. 
The AGP argued that in Pakistan, Bangladesh and India, the stature of leaders were such that parties thrive on an individual’s name. To substantiate, the AGP cited the example of senior counsel Raza Rabbani who cried his heart out when the military courts were being established through a constitutional amendment, but chose to vote along party lines. 
Any disagreement on policies in the party should not translate into vote against the prime minister, the AGP stated, adding unless “you sever your relationship with the party you belong to, you cannot create relationship with any other party”. 
“if someone’s conscience has awakened suddenly, the person should write two lines and simply resign since defection is not a badge of honour.”
Let parliament decide by evolving a consensus, observed Justice Mandokhel. 
The attorney general contended that the Constitution always speaks through the Supreme Court.

4,How FATF-compliant database is helping microfinance,"Directory of over 200,000 politically exposed persons helps financial institutions track potential risks.","KARACHI: Microfinance institutions have started using a locally developed database to identify “politically exposed persons” (PEPs) in Pakistan to manage financial, regulatory and reputational risk, especially in compliance with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, officials and sources told Dawn. 
The database — recently developed by non-banking financial institute First Paramount Modaraba (FPM) — maintains data of more than 200,000 politically exposed persons.  
According to the FATF, the Paris-based global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, a politically exposed person “is an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent function”. 
Because such people hold positions that can be abused for laundering illicit funds or other predicate offences such as corruption or bribery, “FATF recommendations require the application of additional AML/CFT measures to business relationships with PEPs”.  

Directory of over 200,000 politically exposed persons helps financial institutions track potential risks

Banks operating in Pakistan, public and private financial institutions and organisations dealing with monetary affairs and even realtors have already been using such a database for some time, especially after June last year, when it was announced that Pakistan would stay on FATF’s terrorism financing “grey list”.
Pakistan was placed on the list in 2018, which made foreign firms more cautious about investing in the country. With just two unmet targets out of the 34 action points, the FATF earlier this month retained Pakistan on the list and asked the country to address the remaining deficiencies in its financial system as soon as possible.
The situation has pushed the authorities and local financial institutions to adopt modern solutions to comply with the watchdog’s guidelines.
Microfinance institutions say they have taken the initiative both in line with the directives from the regulatory bodies and financial market watchdogs and also to secure their clients’ database amid growing challenges of its security and transparency in regular business operations.
A senior official of a local microfinance organisation said his institution had recently acquired FPM’s services to determine PEPs.
He said the need emerged after directives from the regulatory body and then to remove the risk of unknowing involvement of any such client or individual under their database that could put their operations at risk.
“Before finding this fresh technological solution, we had a certain mechanism to check their credentials, personal details and a brief history of past of individuals approaching us for loans and to avail the lending facility,” he said. “But that mechanism was falling short to comply with the emerging regulations amid FATF recommendations and that was mainly about keeping an eye on PEPs. Now with this initiative, we and all our competitors are at ease to a considerable extent. It has almost made us do our job.”
The Pakistan Microfinance Investment Company Limited (PMIC), a national-level apex institution for microfinance providers, has recently put in place the system to keep an eye on PEPs. The company, with a loan portfolio of over Rs23 billion, says it has finally found the solution for the “national requirement” and the initiative would help its 26 partners and more than 732,000 clients.
“We as a wholesale facility are also strengthening our clients for compliance,” a PMIC official said. “Some of our clients, offerings microfinance to different individuals, are not operating at a much higher level so they don’t have enough resources or facility for the required information. With the fresh partnership with the FPM, we are also facilitating them in meeting regulatory requirements and adopting financial security.”
FPM’s policies to acquire PEP data “are fully compliant with the guidelines given by international bodies”, its CEO Syed Wajih Hassan said, adding that the mechanism adopted for this purpose was based on the best global practices. “In terms of data update, PEP sources where frequent data updates are expected, FPM research team keeps a constant watch through automated or semi-automated means and any new information found, is scheduled for acquisition on an immediate basis,” he said.
The FPM, a non-banking financial institute managed by Paramount Investments Limited, which is the first to develop the system for that particular compliance, says microfinance institutions in Pakistan now find it crucial to put the system in place for their own business safety and transparency along with meeting regulatory requirements.
