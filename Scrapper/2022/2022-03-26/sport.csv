Ecuador slumped to a 3-1 defeat in Paraguay but still qualified for a World Cup for the just the fourth time thanks to Uruguay’s victory and Brazil’s 4-0 win over Chile.
Uruguay and Ecuador both have 25 points with one match to play and can no longer be overtaken by other teams. Peru are on 21 points in fifth place.
Peru and Chile (19 points) will now vie for the fifth-place intercontinental play-off spot against an Asian team alongside Colombia (20 points), who emphatically ended a seven-match goalless streak with a 3-0 win over Bolivia.
Peru host Paraguay, Colombia travel to Venezuela and Chile are at home against Uruguay on Tuesday in the final round of games.
Uruguay earned the win over Peru thanks to De Arrascaeta’s goal from close range three minutes before half time. Peru were adamant a late looping shot held by Uruguay keeper Sergio Rochet had crossed the line but the referee waved away their claims for an equaliser.
Peru’s defeat meant Ecuador qualified regardless of their result in Paraguay and they were overrun by the home side, who gave coach Guillermo Barros Schelotto his first win since he took over in October last year.
Robert Morales put Paraguay ahead after 10 minutes and Piero Hincapie put through his own goal on the stroke of half time to give the hosts a 2-0 lead at the break.
Miguel Almiron made it 3-0 nine minutes into the second half before Jordy Caicedo scored for Ecuador with five minutes left. It was Paraguay’s first win in eight games.
Brazil beat Chile at the Maracana stadium, with the aid of two penalties from Neymar and Philippe Coutinho.
Vinicius Junior got his first international goal and substitute Richarlison completed the scoring in stoppage time.
Colombia hit the net for the first time in eight games in their victory at home to Bolivia with goals by Luis Diaz in the 39th minute, Miguel Borja in the 72nd and Mateus Uribe shortly before the final whistle.

Heavy rain before the match at McLean Park made the outfield wet and the bowlers run-ups slippery.
While the rain abated shortly before the start of play, the umpires decided the playing area was in no condition to allow play to begin. Rain returned later and the match was called off shortly after 8:00pm.
The teams are due to meet in three ODIs beginning on Tuesday.
For the Netherlands, it was a familiar experience. On a recent tour to South Africa all matches were rain-affected. The team then moved to Qatar to play Afghanistan and though there had been no significant rain for two years, the game was washed out.

2,Italy miss second straight World Cup in rapid  fall from grace,"Portugal, Wales and Sweden reach play-off","PARIS: Italy have gone from winning the European Championship to failing to qualify for the World Cup in just eight months.
In a rapid and stunning fall from grace, the Azzurri were upset by North Macedonia in a 1-0 loss that headlined a night of drama in the European qualifying playoffs on Thursday.
Four-time World Cup winners Italy will miss out on back-to-back World Cups for the first time in the national team’s storied history, having also failed to get to the tournament in 2018.
It was only in July that Roberto Mancini and his players were celebrating winning Euro 2020 at Wembley Stadium, supposedly completing Italian football’s redemption story.

Portugal, Wales and Sweden reach play-off

On Thursday, there were tears of a different kind, and a general feeling of disbelief inside the Stadio Renzo Barbera in Palermo.
“Just as last July was the best thing I experienced at a professional level, this is the greatest disappointment,” Mancini said. “Football is like that, sometimes incredible things happen.”
While the failure to qualify for the 2018 tournament in Russia when they lost in a play-off to Sweden was a traumatic experience for a nation that had previously been to every tournament since 1958, this failure is all the more remarkable given that they are the European champions.
That success for Mancini’s side came during a world record 37-game unbeaten run, but four draws in their last five qualifiers last autumn saw them finish second in their group to Switzerland, exposing them to the dangers of the play-offs again.
“It’s hard to explain, it’s such a huge disappointment,” captain Giorgio Chiellini said to RAI. “We’ve made mistakes since September and we’ve paid for them. We’re distraught.”
The winner for North Macedonia, who haven’t played at the World Cup since gaining independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991, came in the second minute of stoppage time from Aleksandar Trajkovski’s low shot into the corner from outside the area.
It sparked wild scenes of jubilation among the North Macedonian players, who also beat Germany away almost a year ago to the day before appearing at their debut European Championship last year.
“We won the Italian way against the Italians, a goal from just two shots,” said their coach, Blagoja Milevski.
Standing in their way in Tuesday’s playoff final will be another of Europe’s leading football nations, Portugal, who beat Turkey 3-1 to keep alive Cristiano Ronaldo’s hopes of appearing in what is likely to be his final World Cup.
PENALTY MISS COSTS TURKEY
Euro 2016 winners Portugal­defeated Turkey at the Estadio do Dragao in Porto, albeit only after Burak Yilmaz missed a crucial late penalty for the visitors.
The home side were cruising thanks to first-half goals by Brazilian-born midfielder Otavio and Liverpool forward Diogo Jota.
But Turkey’s veteran skipper Yilmaz pulled a goal back in the 65th minute, setting up a tense finish.
Turkey were then awarded a penaltywith five minutes remaining when a foul on Enes Unal was detected following a VAR review, but Yilmaz put the spot-kick over the bar, meaning the Portuguese were able to avoid another late implosion like in November when they let in a 90th-minute goal against Serbia to drop into the playoffs.
Portugal went on to score again in stoppage time, through substitute Matheus Nunes.
Turkey have not appeared at the World Cup since coming third in Japan and South Korea in 2002.
Portugal have not missed out on the tournament since 1998 and, at 37, Ronaldo is hoping to reach a 10th straight major tournament.
BALE BRILLIANCE
Ronaldo’s former team-mate at Real Madrid, Gareth Bale, could also be at the World Cup after inspiring Wales to a 2-1 win over Austria and leaving his country one victory away from a first appearance at the tournament since 1958.
Bale has only played five times for Real this season, and just twice since August, but the Wales captain started at the Cardiff City Stadium and opened the scoring from a sensational free kick into the top corner in the 25th.
He then struck again, with a superb hit across goalkeeper Heinz Lindner into the far corner, to double the lead six minutes after half-time.
Wales then held on after Austria reduced the deficit in the 64th minute when Marcel Sabitzer’s shot deflected in off Ben Davies.
“I’ll run myself into the ground for this country, we all did tonight,” Bale, who came off right at the end with cramp, told Sky Sports.
Wales will host either Scotland or Ukraine in the playoff final in June. Their semi-final match was postponed until that month as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
IBRAHIMOVIC’S DREAM ALIVE
Robin Quaison kept alive Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s hopes of playing in another World Cup for Sweden.
With the suspended Ibrahimovic watching on, Quaison came off the bench and scored in the 110th minute after a one-two with Alexander Isak as Sweden beat the Czech Republic 1-0 after extra time to advance to the final in the other qualifying bracket.
Quarter-finalists in 2018, Sweden will travel to play Poland on Tuesday for a spot in the tournament in Qatar.
Poland received a bye to the playoff final after their scheduled opponents Russia were thrown out of qualifying following the war in Ukraine.
Scotland and Poland drew 1-1 in a friendly in Glasgow, with Kieran Tierney giving the home side the lead only for Krzysztof Piatek to level with a stoppage-time penalty.

Canada need a win or a draw on Sunday when they host Jamaica to book a spot in Qatar, while Costa Rica moved into fourth place in the CONCACAF standings with two matches remaining.
Canada played with 10 men after Mark-Anthony Kaye was sent off with a red card in the 34th minute and things went from bad to worse when Borges netted a header.
With Panama’s 1-1 draw with last-placed Honduras earlier Thursday, Canada needed a win or a draw at Costa Rica’s National Stadium in San Jose to secure a berth. Canada also could have clinched with a Mexico win over the US, but that game ended in a 0-0 draw at Azteca Stadium on Thursday.
The US headed into the fixture in the knowledge they had never beaten Mexico in a World Cup qualifier in Mexico City but Gregg Berhalter’s side carved out the better chances in a scrappy encounter.
Canada still sit atop the North and Central America and the Caribbean qualifying standings with 25 points, ahead of the US and Mexico with 22 points apiece. The US have the edge on goal difference. Costa Rica have 19 points.
The top three CONCACAF finishers secure World Cup berths. The fourth-place team will face a team from Oceania in an intercontinental playoff.
In Panama, the home side needed a victory over winless Honduras to try to scrap their way into the top three. But they were forced to settle for a draw when a Kevin Lopez 65th minute header cancelled out Rolando Blackburn’s first half strike.
The draw dropped Panama into fifth, a point behind Costa Rica, but still in the chase for a spot.
In Kingston, Andre Gray scored in the 72nd minute and Jamaica eliminated El Salvador from World Cup contention with a 1-1 draw. Eriq Zavaleta, who plays for the LA Galaxy, scored in the 21st for El Salvador.

6,Osaka cruises past Kerber as 11 seeds fall in Miami,MIAMI: Naomi Osaka’s impressive return to form continued on Thursday after she took just an hour to dispatch...,"MIAMI: Naomi Osaka’s impressive return to form continued on Thursday after she took just an hour to dispatch 13th-seeded German Angelique Kerber in straight sets and head into the third round of the Miami Open, where Garbine Muguruza and Simona Halep withdrew with injuries.
The Japanese star, who left Indian Wells in tears earlier this month after being heckled by a fan, looked in great shape as Kerber was beaten 6-2 6-3 at Hard Rock Stadium.
She’s the highest seeded player I have beaten this season and I am really happy, ” a delighted Osaka said afterwards. I came into the match wanting to dictateand hopefully as I keep playing I will keep getting better.”
Osaka, 24, now faces Karolina Muchova for a place in round four. Muchova advanced on Thursday with a straight sets defeat of 2021 US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez. The unseeded Muchova eliminated the Canadian 18th seed 6-4, 7-6 (7-3).
Osaka’s win set the tone for a day where 11 seeded women were ousted from the tournament, a stunning series of results headlined by Romania’s Irina-Camelia Begu defeating top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 6-4.
Also gone was third seed Anett Kontaveit. She lost to Ann Li, a 21-year-old American who got her first win over a top-10 opponent with a 6-0, 3-6, 6-4 triumph.
Sixth seed Karolina Pliskova, in just her second match after missing about four months with a broken arm, lost 6-3, 6-3 to qualifier Anna Kalinskaya.
Elina Svitolina, the 15th seed who had a number of fans wearing pro-Ukraine shirts watching her match in tribute to her homeland, lost to Britain’s Heather Watson 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
In other second-round action, Olympic doubles champion Katerina Siniakova was down a set and a break but rallied to secure a 3-6 6-4 7-5 win over US Open champion Emma Raducanu in a match lasting nearly three hours.
Vera Zvonareva topped 19th-seeded Tamara Zidansek, 6-3, 6-2 while 25th seed Kasatkina fell to Aliaksandra Sasnovich of Belarus 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.
Alize Cornet was another seeded player to exit early, the French 31st seed bowing out to Alison Riske of the United States 6-2, 6-2 and 32nd-seeded Sara Sorribes Tormo was ousted by Kaia Kanepi of Estonia 3-6, 7-5, 6-0.
There were no such problems for ninth-seeded American Danielle Collins, who battled past Hungary’s Anna Bondar 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
Eighth seed Ons Jabeur was another winner, getting past Polands Magda Linette 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, and Belinda Bencic eased by Maria Kostyuk 6-3, 6-1.
Spanish seventh seed Muguruza, who was supposed to face qualifier Lauren Davis on Friday, withdrew with a shoulder injury and said she hopes to be ready for claycourt action in Madrid in late April.
Romanian 21st seed Halep also withdrew ahead of her second-round match against Australian wildcard Daria Saville due to a leg injury the former world number one said would keep her out of action for three weeks.
On the men’s side, Briton Andy Murray looked sharp in his 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 win over Federico Delbonis. The former world number one held his nerve through a tight first set before breaking serve to open the second and pulling away.
Murray, who has won the tournament twice, will face top seed Daniil Medvedev of Russia in the second round.
Other first round winners included Americans Tommy Paul, Sebastian Korda and Jenson Brooksby, Australian Jordan Thompson and Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka.

7,Relentless Australia clinch series as Pakistan collapse on final day,"Chasing 351 to win, Pakistan folded for just 235.","LAHORE: There was no grandstand finish this time. The heroic resistance of the National Stadium never came at the Gaddafi Stadium for Pakistan. Once Australia removed captain Babar Azam after tea, the writing was on the wall for the hosts.
Nearly quarter of a century from when they last toured Pakistan, Australia will return home after a Test series here with the same result — a 1-0 victory — and the Benaud-Qadir Trophy to show for after they completed a 115-run triumph in the series-deciding third Test on Friday.
Chasing 351 to win, Pakistan folded for just 235 in just about an hour after tea with Nathan Lyon being the wrecker-in-chief with 5-83 and captain Pat Cummins grabbing 3-23. It was Cummins’ bold declaration on Thursday that set up the Aussies for the victory and he was naturally overjoyed with how things panned out for his side.
They had been denied a victory in the second Test in Karachi by Pakistan’s brave rearguard action which saw Babar score 196 after a drab draw in the opening game in Rawalpindi. Pakistan were in the ascendancy at the start of the final day here, needing 278 more runs to win with all their wickets intact but Australia got the reward for their positive intent throughout the series. 
“Winning overseas just does not happen very often,” he told an online news conference at the end of the match. “It has been a real toil for the last 25-30 days really. And to come away with a series is hugely satisfying.”
Australia arrived on their first tour of Pakistan since 1998 on the back of a 4-0 Ashes triumph over England at home but Cummins, who became the first Australian captain since Michael Clarke in 2011 to claim a series victory in Asia, said that winning here will build the team’s confidence.

“The amount of confidence we will get out of winning over here, not just as a team but every individual showed... their game can stand up to Asian conditions,” he said. “It’s huge for [the tour of] Sri Lanka later in the year, India next year. So yeah, that’s awesome.”
Babar, whose dismissal for 55 signalled the end of Pakistan’s hopes, reckoned there was nothing wrong with his side’s planning but the “soft dismissals” eventually cost them. 
“The plan was to go for the chase after tea with wickets in hand,” he told reporters during a news conference afterwards. “But the soft dismissals didn’t allow us to keep up with that plan.”
Inevitably, there were questions asked about players who failed to perform during the series despite pitches having being laid keeping Pakistan’s strengths in mind. 
“We should not forget the old performances of these players and expel them from the team over just one defeat,” he argued. “We had a good series overall but just one bad session here cost us.”
Australia had last won a Test in Lahore back in 1959 and Pakistan looked poised to extend their wait when openers Imam-ul-Haq and Abdullah Shafique strode out to the pitch to resume their chase from an overnight position of 73-0.
But Abdullah went without adding to his overnight score of 27 when he was caught behind of Cameron Green and Australia sensed blood. Azhar Ali made a laborious 17 before becoming Lyon’s first victim.
Attempting a sweep, the veteran could only get an edge that kissed his pad and gave an easy catch to Steve Smith, who by then had a poor game by his fielding standards and dropped Abdullah on the penultimate delivery on Thursday.
Babar and Imam negotiated the passage of play through to lunch, the latter having earlier raised his half-century. But Imam soon departed for 70, having hit five fours in his 199-ball innings, when an inside edge off Lyon hit his pad and looped to Marnus Labuschagne at silly point.
The incoming Fawad Alam, who has fared poorly with the bat throughout the series joined Babar but he went soon after for 11 when Cummins trapped him lbw.
It brought Mohammad Rizwan to the crease. But Rizwan, whose valiant century in Karachi was also crucial in Pakistan drawing that Test, had no answer to a searing yorker by Cummins which hit his toe and was lbw for a duck.
Babar had been lucky to be there in the middle with Australia having opted not to review with replays suggesting he had gloved a catch to Smith in the slips.
But with him there, Pakistan still had hope and the skipper alongside Sajid Khan (21) took the hosts to tea without any further damage.
Resuming their chase, Babar and Sajid seemed keen to push their scoring rate. Sajid hit Mitchell Starc for back-to-back fours and Babar, who was dropped by Travis Head of Lyon, raised his half century with a four off the Australian pacer.
He followed that with his the sixth boundary of his innings off Cummins but then he was gone, as were Pakistan’s hopes.
Smith flooring Abdullah’s catch on Thursday had seemed like a pivotal moment of the Test but this time he held on to one that would prove game-defining as plucked Babar’s edge of Lyon low by his left foot.
Sajid fell in the next over, giving Starc his only success before Hasan Ali dragged Lyon onto his stumps and the wily Australian off-spinner completed his five-wicket haul with the wicket of Shaheen Shah Afridi.
It was player-of-the-match Cummins, though, who fittingly wrapped up the victory when he cleaned up Naseem Shah to spark Australia’s celebrations.

9,England take three wickets to put West Indies on back foot,An opening partnership of 50 saw the hosts in early ascendancy but the complexion of the morning later changed dramatically.,"ST. GEORGE’S: England claimed three wickets after a bright West Indies start as the home side stuttered to 71 for three in reply to the tourists’ first innings total of 204 at lunch on the second day of the third and final Test on Friday.
A bright opening partnership of exactly 50 saw the hosts in the early ascendancy but the complexion of the morning changed dramatically with the dismissal of Kraigg Brathwaite by Ben Stokes in the second hour.
That was followed by the demise of new batsman Shamarh Brooks to Saqib Mahmood.
When the other opener John Campbell, who had survived a torrid examination from Craig Overton, fell to the same bowler just before the interval, England were in much better heart than midway through the session when the openers looked very comfortable on a pitch expected to encourage the faster bowlers.
Brathwaite, a virtual immovable object in the previous match in Barbados where he faced more deliveries than ever before by a West Indies batsman in Test cricket, looked in similar mood as Campbell did most of the scoring at the other end in bringing up the half-century stand.
But it took a delivery from Stokes which barely got off the ground to remove him as he was trapped plumb leg-before for 17 off 56 deliveries.
Brooks looked comfortable in his early moments at the crease, stroking two boundaries before he also became an lbw victim, Mahmood getting a delivery to skid through on the right-hander to send him on his way for 13.
Campbell found Overton to be his greatest challenge, eventually succumbing to the pacer.
Twice the left-hander was struck on the helmet and though he resumed his innings both times, he never looked settled against the continued hostility of his opponent, eventually gloving another lifting delivery on the body down the leg-side for wicketkeeper Ben Foakes to take the catch and end his effort on 35.
Nkrumah Bonner and Jermaine Blackwood will be the pairing to resume the contest for the West Indies after lunch with England keen for their faster bowlers to continue to exploit a helpful surface in defence of a modest first innings total.
On Thursday, England recovered from the brink of disaster thanks to a 10th-wicket stand of 90 between Jack Leach and Mahmood. England were 114 for nine, after earlier being 67 for seven but Mahmood (49) made his highest first-class score while the bespectacled Leach was equally impressive in scoring 41 not out.

10,Hamza suspended over positive dope test,JOHANNESBURG: South African Test cricketer Zubayr Hamza has been provisionally suspended by the International ...,"JOHANNESBURG: South African Test cricketer Zubayr Hamza has been provisionally suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC) under its anti-doping code after testing positive for a prohibited substance, the cricket governing body said on Friday.
Cricket South Africa (CSA) said earlier this week that Hamza, who was left out of the squad for the series against Bangladesh, did not dispute the positive test and agreed to a voluntary suspension.
“Hamza has been charged with the presence and/or use of a prohibited substance following the detection of Furosemide in a sample collected out-of-competition on 17 January 2022,” the ICC said.
Furosemide, a medicine used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure and a build up of fluid in the body, is on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s Prohibited List as a diuretic or masking agent.
CSA said Furosemide is not a performance enhancing substance.
The 26-year-old batter, who has played six Tests for South Africa, is suspended pending the outcome of the disciplinary process.
South Africa host Bangladesh in a two-Test series starting on March 31.

12,Australia overcome gritty BD to stay unbeaten in Women’s World Cup,WELLINGTON: Favo­urites Australia beat Bangladesh by five wickets in howling winds to maintain their perfect record...,"WELLINGTON: Favo­urites Australia beat Bangladesh by five wickets in howling winds to maintain their perfect record in the ICC Women’s World Cup here at the Basin Reserve on Friday.
It ends Bangladesh’s slim hopes of securing a semi-final berth, altho­ugh the Tigers pushed the six-time champions hard in a match where innings were reduced to 43 overs because of the weather.
Bangladesh made 135-6 after being put in to bat, with Lata Mondal top-scoring on 33 in a match that was essentially a dead-rubber for Australia, who are guaranteed a playoff spot.
The wind was so strong at the Basin Reserve that the bails would not stay on the stumps and the umpires made the rare decision to play on without them.
Players from both teams waited to bat huddled on the sidelines wrapped in blankets, rubbing their hands to ward off the cold.
“It’s certainly the hardest conditions I’ve played in,” Australia captain Meg Lanning said.
“I was freezing cold... today was about finding a way to get through it and win. We certainly had to fight, Bangladesh put us under pressure and played extremely well.” Bangladesh’s batters made a slow start in the atrocious conditions, reaching 58-2 after 18 overs.
Sharmin Akhter’s departure on 24 made runs even harder to come by, with Bangladesh scoring only eight from the next eight overs as Australia’s spinners piled on the pressure.
Mondal showed aggression late in the innings but fell in the final over as Bangladesh finished on 135-6.
Beth Mooney anchored Australia’s reply with an unbeaten 66, backed up by Annabel Sutherland’s 26 not out, while Salma Khatun took 3-23 for Bangladesh.
Australia remain the only undefeated team at this year’s tournament and are overwhelming favourites for a seventh title.
Bangladesh’s chances of advancing were always remote and required a string of unlikely results, but they will take heart from a win over Pakistan and close losses to the West Indies and South Africa in their debut World Cup campaign.
They could still throw a spanner in the works by defeating England on Sunday to eliminate the defending champions.
Summarised scores:
Australia bt Bangladesh by five wickets.
BANGLADESH 135-6 in 43 overs  (L. Mondal 33, S. Akhter 24; J. Jonassen 2-13, A. Gardner 2-23); BANGLADESH 136-5 in 32.1 overs (B. Mooney 66, A. Sutherland 26; S. Khatun  3-23).
