ISLAMABAD: Even tho­ugh it hailed the verdict as favourable, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has decided to move the Islam­abad High Court (IHC) aga­inst the Election Commis­sion of Pakistan (ECP) for its “unilateral decision” aga­­inst the former ruling party in the prohibited funding case.
The decision to go to the court was announced by PTI leader Asad Umar, flanked by party leaders Farrukh Habib, Azam Swati, and Ghulam Sarwar Khan, during a press conference in Islamabad following the election watchdog verdict that confirmed the political party led by Chairman Imran Khan received funds from prohibited sources. Before the presser, Imran Khan had chaired a meeting at his Banigala residence.
He said the decision “proved” that the election watchdog was “biased and prejudiced” and demanded that it should be reconstituted. “The PTI will file two different petitions — one contempt of court petition against ECP for violating the Supreme Court and high court’s decisions for not giving verdict against PPP and PML-N together with PTI, whereas the second petition would be filed against the ECP’s decision for having too many loopholes in the verdict,” the PTI leader said.
‘ECP transgressed domain’
Mr Umar, who is PTI’s secretary general, claimed that the ECP transgressed its legal and constitutional domain in the decision against the PTI.

He claimed that the government was disappointed with the decision as, despite years of scheming to disqualify Imran Khan, they got nothing except “embarrassment and humiliation”.
Asad Umar repeated allegations of the ECP being in cahoots with the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) and said the ECP and the PDM tried to “block the doors of funding being collected from overseas Pakistanis so as to leave the political ground open for a few corrupt families”.
He said Imran Khan eme­rged as a threat to the “corrupt political elite” who reg­ularly indulged in horse-trading.
“People trust Imran Khan that’s why they sent their money to him when he started the fundraising events. If you block the [political] donations, the only way remaining is that of powerful people,” he said.
He urged that the ECP should publish all PTI funding-related documents submitted to the commission along with the record submitted by the PPP and PML-N so the masses could know the reality.
Speaking about the ramifications of the decision on the PTI head, Mr Umar claimed that Imran Khan did not submit an affidavit in a personal capacity, rather it was a certificate; therefore there was nothing to worry about it.
Speaking on the occasion, Farrukh Habib said that the ECP violated the courts’ decisions as per which the commission had to examine the records of all political parties without any discrimination.
“Look at the prejudice of the ECP that even the donations given by PTI ticket holder(s) were declared prohibited funding,” he said.
Just after the decision was announced, PTI leader Fa­­wad Chaudhry said that most of the money was donated by overseas Pakistanis.
He said that he could not understand why the PML-N, JUI-F and PPP declared overseas Pakistanis as the “enemy.
“We consider overseas Pakistanis to be the backbone of Pakistan’s economy and will continue to rely on them for our funding,” he said. While replying to a question, he said that certificates were made by the auditors and Imran Khan had just signed them so responsibility cannot be put on Mr Khan.
Prohibited funding case lasted 2,818 days, 2 CECs

ISLAMABAD: Terming the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) verdict in the prohibited funding case of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) a “charge sheet” against the party, members of the ruling coalition claim it has proved ‘anti-Pakistan forces’ were behind establishment of the party, and labelled party chief Imran Khan everything from a liar, corrupt, foreign agent to a money launderer.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday maintained the ECP decision declared Mr Khan a “certified liar” for submitting false affidavits, while PPP Chairman and foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s spokesman said the verdict proved the former premier was a corrupt person and running his political party under the name of Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital.
“The ECP verdict on PTI foreign funding case charge-sheets Imran Niazi for violating the Constitution, submitting false affidavits, and accepting foreign money,” the prime minister tweeted after the ECP announced its decision on Tuesday morning.
“Proven yet again that he is a certified liar,” he added, and urged the nation to ponder over the implications of Mr Khan’s politics funded by foreigners.

 





 
From London, former prime minister and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif urged the federal government to take “immediate legal action” against Imran Khan following the ECP verdict, saying that Imran used to give “lectures” to people about honesty. “Today, the ECP’s verdict has shown that it is actually him who is the biggest thief in history.
Also taking potshots at the PTI chief, PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz said Imran Khan had finally been proved to be a “foreign agent”.
“This foreign agent was launched to stop CPEC and the progress of Pakistan. This man who used to give sermons on liberating the nation from slavery, in fact, turned out to be a slave of foreign powers. He took money from these foreign powers to create anarchy in Pakistan,” Ms Nawaz said in a series of tweets.

 





 
She said Mr Khan’s narrative of honesty and self-respect had been fully exposed. “The anti-Nawaz Sharif narrative was based on blatant lies & conspiracies but IK is guilty of startling, mind-boggling wrongdoings the evidence of which is irrefutable.”
Recently ousted Punjab chief minister and the prime minister’ son, Hamza Shehbaz, said the ECP verdict had exposed the alleged foreign conspiracy against Imran Khan. “Taking money from citizens and companies of countries like the US and India, Imran Khan created anarchy in his own country,” he said, adding the “judicial Sadiq and Amin” had been declared a “proven liar and money launderer”.
Speaking at a press conference here, PML-N leader Tallal Chaudhry demanded a lifetime ban and imprisonment for Mr Khan.
Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said a “thief, liar involved in foreign funding and money laundering” has finally been caught after eight years. In a statement, she demanded Mr Khan resign from the party chairman post immediately.
Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Shazia Marri of the PPP, which is an ally of the PML-N in the ruling coalition in the Centre, stated legal action would be pursued after the ECP proved financial crimes committed by the PTI.
Addressing a news conference along with party leader Faisal Karim Kundi, the minister said Mr Khan, anticipating a decision against him, had already started blaming other parties for receiving foreign funding. “The PTI must come forward with proof if the PPP or PML-N has received foreign funding.”
The PTI chief submitted false affidavits before the ECP and delayed the decision for eight years through writ petitions, she remarked. “Now a legal process will be followed in light of this decision,” Ms Marri declared.
Pakistan Democratic Movement head and chief of his own faction of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, demanded the PTI be banned and Imran Khan disqualified.
In a press conference, he said: “The ECP decision has proven that Imran Khan has been working against the country’s interests and the PTI working against the country by using funds from foreign sources.”

3,PAC decree against former NAB chairman Javed Iqbal suspended,IHC seeks replies from NA committee as petitioner challenges PAC's scope to take up application against sexual harassment.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday suspended the decision of the National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee that last month barred former National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman Javed Iqbal from heading the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances.
While taking up the petition of Mr Iqbal, Justice Aamer Farooq of the IHC also sought replies of the PAC, interior secretary and secretary for parliamentary affairs on the matter by August 11.
Since its establishment in 2011, the Commission of Inq­uiry on Enforced Disappea­ra­nces has been headed by Mr Iqbal while the PAC considering the serious allegations being levelled against him had stop­ped him from working in the position.
The commission was formed to trace missing persons and fix responsibility on individuals or organisations found inv­olved in enforced disappearances.

IHC seeks replies from NA committee, govt officials as petitioner challenges scope of PAC to take up Tayyaba Gul’s application

On July 7, the PAC took up an application moved by Tayyaba Gul seeking action against Mr Iqbal for allegedly sexually harassing her. The applicant also claimed to have a video evidence to corroborate her allegation.
The committee in its meeting also observed that in a TV show, chairperson of Defence of Human Rights Amna Masood Janjua also accused Justice Iqbal of flirting with the spouse of missing persons.
The committee further noted, “[Since] a serious allegation has been levelled against former NAB chairman who is also currently heading the commission of inquiry on enforced disappearances, [he] should not hold such office.”
The PAC also decided to approach the Prime Minister Office over this issue.
As per a recent report of the commission, only one third of the missing persons have retur­­ned homes since its establishment.
In his petition, the counsel for Mr Iqbal argued that the PAC lacked jurisdiction to entertain Ms Gul’s application and to restrain his client from holding the office of chairman of the commission.
Scope of PAC
The counsel pointed out that the mandate of the PAC was to examine audit reports and financial irregularities of the ministries in Rule 198, 201(5), 202 and 203 of the Rules of the Procedure and Conduct of Bu­­siness in the National Assem­­b­­ly, framed under the provision of Article 67 of the Constitution.
He requested the high court to set aside PAC’s directions for being contradictory to the rules.
While taking up the petition of Mr Iqbal, Justice Farooq observed that the IHC was already examining PAC’s powers in two identical petitions.
In separate petitions, NAB’s Lahore office director general Saleem Shahzad and acting chairman of the bureau Zahir Shah had earlier challenged the PAC’s directions, which are still pending adjudication.
The IHC issued notices to the respondents seeking their replies till August 11, while also restraining the PAC from taking any adverse action against Mr Iqbal till then.

6,DI Khan revenue officials accused of Rs70m corruption,"They allegedly made fake entries in the property registers in 2019-20 in lieu of stamp duty and the withholding tax, say sources.","DERA ISMAIL KHAN: The sub-registrar office of the local revenue department allegedly made fake entries in the property registers in 2019-20 in lieu of stamp duty and the withholding tax, causing the national exchequer a loss of over Rs70 million, sources said on Tuesday. 
They told Dawn that a group of deed writers was involved in issuing fake Federal Board of Revenue vouchers regarding the two per cent withholding tax and two per cent stamp duty levied by the federal government on all types of agricultural and commercial properties in 2016. They said the illegal activity continued for a long time, allegedly swindling over Rs70 million.
The sources said the FBR had directed the Dera sub-registrar office not to register any citizen’s property without them first depositing the stamp duty and withholding tax.
An official at the sub-registrar office on condition of anonymity said in 2019-20, some deed writers used to produce fake FBR vouchers with certain registration code to embezzle the tax amount. 
“Instead of depositing the amount received in this regard with the said counter, the deed writers used to prepare fake FBR vouchers and attach them to the property registry,” the official disclosed.
He said when the then sub-registrar Habibur Rahman checked the records and investigated the vouchers attached to the registry, he found the total amount of fake tax receipts to be over Rs70 million, which were pocketed by deed writers.
He claimed some officials close to the sub-registrar were also involved in the corruption.
The official said instead of taking action against the deed writers and others, the sub-registrar colluded with them, getting huge benefits in return for covering up the scam. He said the sub-registrar purchased a new luxury car and an expensive plot.
The official said the sub-registrar was a clerk and lived in a small rented house in Bilalabad area when he came to Dera from Tank. “However, now the sub-registrar, who is currently posted in Tank, owns dozens of plots and has a palatial house.”
He said the sub-registrar had transferred his properties in the name of other people.
The sources said the sub-registrar also used to collect commissions from people. They said the sub-registrar had also developed close relations with some property dealers and also acquired properties from them. 
When contacted to seek his views on the charges levelled against him, the former sub-registrar, Dera, Habibur Rahman referred to a letter dated December 28, 2021 of the revenue department, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and a letter dated December 31, 2021 by Director General Audit, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in which there was no mention of corruption in the property registries conducted in 2019-20.
