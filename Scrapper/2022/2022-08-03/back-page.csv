0,Samples from seven cities found positive for polio,"Samples from Islamabad, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Bannu, Nowshera and Swat found positive, says NIH official.","ISLAMABAD: Contrary to the government’s claims that poliovirus was restricted to southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts, environmental samples from seven cities have returned positive, indicating the presence of the virus in major urban centres.
The virus was also reported in sewage samples collected from Islamabad and Lahore after a gap of 16 months. Both cities were declared polio-free in March 2021.
An official of the National Institute of Health (NIH), on condition of anonymity, said samples from Islamabad, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Bannu, Nowshera and Swat were found positive.
“Samples were collected from July 18 to 20 and were sent to the polio virology lab for testing,” he said.

Virus found in Islamabad, Lahore after 16-month gap

“Since the virus has again reached Islamabad and Lahore, we should be ready for polio cases from all seven cities, said the official.
In a statement, Minister of National Health Services Abdul Qadir Patel said the government was committed to eradicating the virus and had devised a strategy to achieve its goal.
“We have been taking steps to control the virus in seven cities which have reported positive environmental samples. I appeal to the parents to make sure that their children are vaccinated during every polio campaign,” he said.
The minister also sought cooperation from civil society, religious scholars and media to raise awareness against the virus.
Mr Patel said that since the start of this year, 14 cases of polio have been reported from KP — 13 in North Waziristan and one in Lakki Marwat —and therefore, the government has decided to start a polio campaign in the region from Aug 15.
He said that a country-wide campaign would kick off on Aug 22.
Sewage water samples were collected on a monthly basis from 58 sites across the country under the supervision of provincial health departments and tested by Regional Polio Reference Laboratory housed at the NIH in Islamabad.
If polio virus is found in sewage water, the sample is called ‘positive’. Samples of sewage water from the area are a basic parameter to determine the success of polio campaigns.
Moreover, the presence of virus in sewage also shows that the immunity level of children in the area has fallen and they are at risk of catching the disease.

1,Israel army closes areas near Gaza,"Cites risk of reprisal following arrests; heatwave, power cuts make lives of Palestinians in Gaza Strip miserable.","

JENIN: Israel’s army closed areas near the Gaza border to civilians on Tuesday, citing a risk of reprisals, following the overnight arrest of two senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad members, the military and Palestinian sources said.
A 17-year-old Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli forces during a late Monday raid in the flashpoint West Bank district of Jenin.
Islamic Jihad identified the teenager as Dirar al-Kafrayni, and said he was a member of the group and “our heroic martyr”.
The army said it had operated alongside police, who arrested “two wanted terror suspects”. A Palestinian security source said that one of those detained was Bassem al-Saadi, a senior figure in Islamic Jihad’s political wing in the West Bank.

Searing heatwave, power cuts make lives of Palestinians living in Gaza Strip miserable

The source identified the second person detained as Saadi’s son-in-law, a Jenin-based fundraiser for the militant group.
The Israeli military said it was preventing civilian access to areas near Gaza “due to a direct threat”.
“After terrorist activities were identified with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist organisation, it was decided to block off areas and routes adjacent to the Gaza Strip security fence,” an army statement said.
Israel also closed its only border crossing for people entering or leaving Gaza, while the government said Prime Minister Yair Lapid was reviewing security.
As news of the deadly raid spread, crowds began to gather in Jenin refugee camp and the nearby city of Nablus, as supporters voiced solidarity with Islamic Jihad.
“We declare alertness and raise the readiness of our mujahideen (fighters),” the group said in a statement on Monday.
Saadi was injured by an Israeli army dog during his arrest, the Palestinian source said.
Home to some 2.3 million Palestinians, Gaza has been under Israeli blockade since 2007 when Islamist group Hamas ousted forces loyal to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.
Power cuts
For Palestinians living in Gaza Strip, a searing summer heatwave has been made worse by power cuts that leave them without electricity for as much as 10 hours a day.
“The fan is broken, the battery is not working and we are fanning ourselves with trays,” said Alaa Zidan as she sat with her husband in their home in the southern zone of Khan Younis, a rusted electric fan hanging motionless from the ceiling.
“We can’t eat or sleep because of the heat,” she said.
More than 2.3 million people are packed into the narrow strip of land squeezed between Egypt and Israel, an area that would normally require around 500 megawatts of power per day in summer, according to local officials.
It receives 120 megawatts from Israel while the enclave’s lone power plant supplies another 60 megawatts.
Mohammad Thabit, of Gaza’s power distribution company, said in April, with moderate weather, they could supply 20 hours of electricity per day, but the capacity of the power generating plant has been impacted by greater demand due to high temperatures and soaring energy prices.
“We are currently unable to feed more than 10 hours of electricity per day to people and public institutions, which would have a direct impact on all aspects of life in Gaza,” Thabit said.
Money for the fuel to operate the power plant comes from Qatar, which pays $10 million to purchase it from Israel, but rising fuel prices have left the local company with a shortfall of some $3 million.

2,Chinese vlogger under probe for eating white shark,"Maintains she acquired shark through “legal channels”, but authorities say her claim is ""inconsistent with the facts"".","BEIJING: A Chinese influencer is under police investigation after a clip of her roasting and eating a great white shark went viral.
Footage of the vlogger, popularly known by her online pseudonym Tizi, showed her feasting on the predatory fish, which police in the central city of Nanchong confirmed on Sunday was a great white.
“It may look vicious, but its meat is truly very tender,” Tizi said while tearing off large chunks of the animal’s barbecued meat, in a video posted in mid-July.
In the video, since deleted, she is seen unwrapping a two-metre-long fish and lying down next to it to show that it is taller than her.
The shark is then sliced in half, marinated and barbecued, while the head is cooked in a spicy broth.
Great white sharks are listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature — just one step before being classed as endangered.
Populations of sharks — some of the oceans’ most important apex predators -- have been battered over the last few decades, the main culprits being finning and industrial longline fishing.
In China, they are listed as protected. Illegal possession can lead to a five-to-10-year prison term.
“It is flabbergasting that an internet celebrity can eat a protected animal in front of millions in broad daylight!” wrote one commentator in response to the story.
“These uncultured attention-mongers will stoop very low to attract eyeballs!” another said.
It is unclear whether Tizi, who has almost eight million followers, will be punished.
She told local media that she acquired the shark through “legal channels”, but the local agriculture bureau said on Monday her claim was “inconsistent with the facts” and that police were investigating.
Dried baby shark flesh is used as a cat food in China and can be bought in many online stores.
Chinese state media has long waged war on viral binge-eating videos, known by the Korean slang “mukbang”, while livestreaming platforms have for years promised to shut down accounts promoting excess eating and food wastage.

3,Yemen’s warring parties agree to renew two-month truce,"Truce extension includes commitment to intensify talks to reach expanded truce agreement as soon as possible, says UN envoy.","SANAA: Yemen’s warring sides agreed to renew a two-month truce expiring on Tuesday, the United Nations envoy said, despite international pressure for an extended and expanded deal that would build on the longest stretch of relative calm in over seven years.
“This truce extension includes a commitment from the parties to intensify negotiations to reach an expanded truce agreement as soon as possible,” special envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg said in a statement.
Grundberg had been pushing for a six-month truce with additional measures, sources had told Reuters, but both sides have had grievances about implementation of the existing truce deal and mistrust runs deep.
US and Omani officials had also been engaging with parties to back Grundberg’s proposal following a visit by President Joe Biden to Saudi Arabia last month, where he announced following bilateral talks an agreement to “deepen and extend” the truce.
The conflict, which pits a coalition led by Saudi Arabia against the Iran-aligned Houthi group, the de facto authority in north Yemen, has killed tens of thousands and caused millions to go hungry.
The internationally recognised government has accused the Houthis of intransigence in talks to reopen main roads in disputed Taiz, while the Houthis accused the coalition of not delivering the agreed number of fuel shipments into Hodeidah and select flights from the capital Sanaa, both held by the group.

4,Russia accuses US of direct role in Ukraine war,"US says Russia using ""nuclear shield"" in Ukraine.","ISTANBUL: Moscow on Tuesday accused the United States of direct involvement in the Ukraine war.
Russia said it was responding to comments by Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence, about the way Kyiv used US-supplied long-range HIMARs rocket launch systems based on what he called excellent satellite imagery and real-time information.
Skibitsky told Britain’s Telegraph newspaper there was consultation between U.S. and Ukrainian intelligence officials before strikes and that Washington had an effective veto on intended targets, though he said U.S. officials were not providing direct targeting information.
Russia’s defence ministry, headed by a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said the interview showed that Washington was directly involved despite repeated assertions that it was limiting its role in the conflict to arms supplies because it did not want a direct confrontation with Moscow.

US says Russia using ‘nuclear shield’ in Ukraine

“All this undeniably proves that Washington, contrary to White House and Pentagon claims, is directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine,” the Russian defence ministry said in a statement.
“It is the Biden administration that is directly responsible for all Kyiv-approved rocket attacks on residential areas and civilian infrastructure in populated areas of Donbas and other regions, which have resulted in mass deaths of civilians,” the defence ministry said.
There was no immediate reaction to the defence ministry’s allegations from the White House or Pentagon.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of carrying out devastating missile attacks on civilian targets on an almost daily basis. Both sides deny deliberately targeting civilians.
Supplies of sophisticated long-range weapons systems from Western nations to Ukraine are seen as vital if Kyiv’s forces are to turn the tide of the war, in which Russia relies heavily on long distance bombardments of urban areas.
‘Nuclear shield’
The United States has accused Russia of using Ukraine’s biggest nuclear power plant as a “nuclear shield” by stationing troops there, preventing Ukrainian forces from returning fire and risking a terrible nuclear accident. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States was “deeply concerned” that the Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia was accused of firing shells dangerously close to in March, was now a Russian military base used to fire on nearby Ukrainian forces.
“Of course the Ukrainians cannot fire back lest there be a terrible accident involving the nuclear plant,” Blinken told reporters after nuclear nonproliferation talks at the United Nations in New York on Monday.
Russia’s actions went beyond using a “human shield” Blinken said, calling it a “nuclear shield.” At the New York talks, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Mykola Tochytskyi said “robust joint actions are needed to prevent nuclear disaster” and called for the international community to “close the sky” over Ukraine’s nuclear power plants with air defence systems.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has sparked the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two, killing thousands, displacing millions and leaving large parts of Ukraine in rubble.
The war has also caused a global food crisis, with Russia and Ukraine producing about a third of the world’s wheat, while Western sanctions on Russia, a major energy provider to Europe, have caused a global energy crisis.

5,"Defying China threats, Pelosi lands in Taiwan",Beijing plans military exercises in response to visit; Taiwan says trip displays “rock solid” support from US.,"TAIPEI: US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan on Tuesday evening, defying a string of increasingly stark warnings and threats from China that have sent tensions between the world’s two superpowers soaring.
Pelosi, second in line to the presidency, is the highest-profile elected US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years and Beijing has made clear that it regards her presence as a major provocation, setting the region on edge.
Live broadcasts showed the 82-year-old lawmaker, who flew on a US military aircraft, being greeted at Taipei’s Songshan Airport by foreign minister Joseph Wu.
“Our delegation’s visit to Taiwan honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy,” she said in a statement upon her arrival, adding that her visit “in no way contradicts” US policy towards Taiwan and Beijing.

Beijing plans military exercises in response to visit; Taiwan says trip displays “rock solid” support from US

Taiwan said the trip displayed “rock solid” support from Washington.
Pelosi is currently on a tour of Asia and while neither she nor her office confirmed the Taipei visit, multiple US and Taiwanese media outlets reported it was on the cards — triggering days of mounting anger from Beijing.
China military exercises
China’s military said it was on “high alert” and would “launch a series of targeted military actions in response” to the visit.
It promptly announced plans for a series of military exercises in waters around the island to begin on Wednesday, including “long-range live ammunition shooting” in the Taiwan Strait.
“Those who play with fire will perish by it,” Beijing’s foreign ministry added.
China considers self-ruled, democratic Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to one day seize the island, by force if necessary.
It tries to keep Taiwan isolated on the world stage and opposes countries having official exchanges with Taipei.
In a call with US President Joe Biden last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Washington against “playing with fire” on Taiwan.
While the Biden administration is understood to be opposed to a Taiwan stop, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Pelosi was entitled to go where she pleased.
“There is no reason for this to erupt into conflict. There’s no change to our policy,” he told CNN shortly after Pelosi’s arrival.
Editorial: Taiwan tensions
The last speaker of the US House of Representatives to visit Taiwan was Newt Gingrich in 1997.
Kirby reiterated that US policy was unchanged toward Taiwan.
This means support for its self-ruling government, while diplomatically recognising Beijing over Taipei and opposing a formal independence declaration by Taiwan or a forceful takeover by China.
Russia terms visit ‘pure provocation’
Russia said it was “absolutely in solidarity with China,” calling the prospect of a Pelosi visit “pure provocation”.
China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has been accused of providing diplomatic cover for the Kremlin by blasting Western sanctions and arms sales to Kyiv.
All eyes on Taiwan
Pelosi left Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday after meeting Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri and Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah.
So many people were tracking the US military plane ferrying her on FlightRadar that the website said some users experienced outages.
The plane took a circuitous route that avoided the South China Sea — which Beijing claims — before heading up the east coast of the Philippines.
Press access around Pelosi has been tightly restricted and limited to a handful or short statements confirming meetings with officials.
Her itinerary includes stops in South Korea and Japan — but the prospect of a Taiwan trip dominated attention.
Taipei’s government had stayed silent on whether she would visit but news kept leaking out. The capital’s famous Taipei 101 skyscraper was illuminated with the words “Speaker Pelosi... Thank You” on Tuesday night an hour before Pelosi’s plane arrived.
Taiwan’s 23 million people have long lived with the possibility of an invasion, but that threat has intensified under Xi, China’s most assertive ruler in a generation.
“Beijing shouldn’t get to decide who can visit Taiwan or how the US should interact with Taiwan,” Wang Ting-yu, a lawmaker from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said ahead of the visit.
“I think China’s open intimidation is counter-effective.” Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia programme at the US-based German Marshall Fund think tank, said the probability of Beijing choosing war was “low”.
“But the probability that... (China) will take a series of military, economic, and diplomatic actions to show strength & resolve is not insignificant,” she wrote on Twitter.

 





 
Taipei’s Council of Agriculture on Tuesday said China had suspended the import of some Taiwanese goods, including some fishery products, tea, and honey.
