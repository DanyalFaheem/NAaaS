In a statement here on Tuesday, QWP provincial president Sikandar Hayat Khan Sherpao said the flash floods triggered by heavy monsoon rains caused human and material losses in various parts of the province, badly disrupting lives of the people. He said the floods badly damaged standing crops, roads, bridges, houses and other infrastructure in Mardan, Charsadda, Swabi, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank, Chitral and other districts.
However, he said neither the chief minister nor the provincial ministers bothered to visit the flood-hit areas to assess the damage and provide relief to people.
Sikandar Sherpao expressed grief over the loss of precious lives during the rain-related incidents and asked the government to announce a comprehensive compensation package for the affected people. He condemned the use of teargas and batons against peaceful protesters in Dera. He added the flow of water was diverted to save certain villages from floods in Dera, which prompted the local people to protest. He said three protesters were injured during the use of force.
The QWP leader said the incidents of targeted killings were taking place in North Waziristan, Khyber, Dera Ismail Khan, Peshawar and other districts. He said 50 policemen had been martyred since January this year, urging the government to take steps to prevent targeted killings or else the situation would take a turn for the worse.
Criticising the PTI government for failing to notify the rules of business for the newly-elected representatives of the local government, he said the rulers seemed not interested in ensuring the transfer of powers to the grassroots after tasting defeat in the local body elections.

2,Special courts for business disputes in sight as KP Assembly passes bill,Opposition asks govt not to curtail powers of LGs.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on Tuesday passed the establishment of commercial courts for resolution of commercial disputes bill, 2022 to provide effective legal regime for expeditious resolution and disposal of commercial disputes.
The Establishment of Commercial Courts for Resolution of Commercial Disputes Bill, 2022, said contract enforcement was the key area of commerce but the existing system of contract enforcement and dispute resolution was a barrier to the ease of doing business due to long period of enforcement and resolution.
“In the existing mechanism in case of commercial disputes the business parties have to approach civil courts for redressal, however due to heavy burden of works on the civil courts the litigation process take years to resolve disputes between the parties and businesses,” read the bill moved by labour minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai.
It added that the weak contract enforcement mechanism besides adversely affecting the commerce and trading system in the province also discouraged prospective both local and foreign investors and adversely affected the business environment.

Opposition asks govt not to curtail powers of LGs

The provincial government intends to provide effective legal regime for expeditious resolution and disposal of commercial disputes. Commercial courts or appellate tribunal under the exceptional circumstances may adjourn hearing of a case for not more than seven days.
The appellate tribunal will comprise chairman and two members, one legal member and one technical member to be appointed in consultation with the chief justice of the Peshawar High Court and will be appointed for a term of three years.
Anyone aggrieved from the judgement or decree or an order of the commercial court may prefer an appeal in appellate tribunal within a period of 30 days from the days of announcement of such judgement, decree or order.
On a point of order, the opposition benches criticised the government for amending the local government law and termed it unconstitutional.
On a point of order, MMA lawmaker Mian Nisar Gul drew the attention of Idrees Khan Khattak from the panel of chairmen towards the protest staged outside the assembly building by members of tehsil councils from across the province.
He said tehsil councillors demanded development schemes and powers.
The opposition member asked the government not to curtail the powers of local governments.
Responding to the point of order, labour minister Shaukat Yousafzai said the provincial government had allocated Rs40 billion for district governments in the current budget.
He said the main purpose of amendment to the law was to maintain a check and balance system.
The minister said the councillors should approach the relevant quarters for the approval of development schemes.
Meanwhile, the house unanimously passed four resolutions, including one advocating the right of the residents of Shivah tehsil in Bannu district to the gas discovered there.
A resolution moved by PTI MPA Pakhtoon Yar said the relevant department was laying a gas pipeline to transport gas to other parts of the country aggrieving the locals, who blocked work on the pipeline.

The exhibition-cum-workshop was organised by Pakistan Community Support Project (PCSP) to provide a bigger platform to the budding women entrepreneurs from the project’s implementation areas to exhibit their skills and products and connect them with government departments and private institutions.
A statement issued here said that a large number of people from different walks of life attended the event.
Speaking at the event, the director general of sustainable development unit of the planning and development department, Sohail Khan, said that 50 per cent of the global workforce consisted of women. He added that the work being done by them accounted for almost 66 per cent of the total input.
“It is high time that we provide economic and income generation opportunities to the women in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, particularly in the merged areas, so that they can participate in the uplift of rural economy,” he said.
The exhibition was followed by a round of focused group discussions wherein experts interacted with the community members. They discussed as to how the women in the project-specific areas in Khyber, Peshawar and Nowshera districts could be facilitated to play a more active role in raising their household income and contributing to the overall economic development.
The project director, Tillat Fahad, stated that the key objective of the exhibition was to connect the potential women entrepreneurs from Khyber, Peshawar and Nowshera with the officials and experts who could provide them with access to markets, facilities and resources.

8,PHC allows Muharram activities at new imambargahs,Bench directs police to make proper security arrangements for the purpose,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court on Tuesday allowed members of Shia community to carry out religious activities during Muharram in imambargahs apart from the places enlisted by the government and directed police to make proper security arrangements in that regard.
A two-member bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khursheed Iqbal issued the order in two petitions filed by Imamia Jirga’s Muharram Committee and a representative of Shia community, Wajahat Ali, seeking orders for the government to permit them to carry out religious activities at new places of worships set up during the last few years in different parts of the province and also to chalk out a proper security plan.
The petitioners also requested the court to restrain the respondents, including the chief and home secretaries and commissioners and deputy commissioners of different divisions and districts from placing any unlawful restrictions on peaceful religious processions during the month of Muharram. They sought orders to stop respondents from taking any ‘illegal’ action, including registration of FIRs against participants of Muharram processions.
The petitioners contended that the law enforcement agencies were having a decades-old list of imambarghs and mourning procession routes and every year the same controversy emerged as they were not permitted for religious activities at new worship places.

Bench directs police to make proper security arrangements for the purpose

The bench decided that as interim relief, the petitioners should be permitted that year to use the imambarghs apart from those enlisted with the government.
The bench adjourned hearing to October 26, directing the government to upgrade their lists in consultation with the stakeholders.
Advocate Shabbir Hussain Gigyani appeared for Imamia Jirga, whereas Syed Yahya Zahid Gillani represented the other petitioner.
Mr Gigyani stated that in accordance with court’s order, a meeting was convened by provincial home secretary and secretary of Imamia Jirga Akhunzada Muzzafar Ali also attended it.
He stated that the meeting was also attended by the relevant commissioners and district police officers through video link. He added that the petitioner had handed over its list of places of worship to the secretary.
Barrister Babar Shehzad Imran appeared for the government and submitted the government report.
He contended that as Muharram had already started, it would be difficult for the law enforcement agencies to provide security to scores of new places of worships pointed out by the petitioners.
He stated that giving permission for carrying out religious activities at places not in the government schedule would affect the security plan.
He said that according to the plan, the government permitted religious activities at the already enlisted places and would also be providing proper security to them.
Mr Gigyani stated that the petitioner had filed almost identical petitions in the year 2017, 2019 and 2020 and all those years the government had been making the same excuses.
He contended that the government was having four decades-old list of places of worships and was not upgrading it despite manifold increase in population.
He stated that it had become a routine practice each year that after religious processions in Muharram police in different cities register FIRs, claiming that the participants violated Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by holding processions.

11,Afghans continue to avail free treatment at cancer hospital,Dr Faisal Sultan says international policies needed to provide healthcare to people in conflict areas,"PESHAWAR: Afghan nationals continue to avail free treatment at the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (SKMCH&RC), Peshawar due to non-availability of such facilities in their homeland.
“The number of new registrations of Afghan nationals at SKMCH&RC has risen since 2012, when we recorded 215 cases, to 426 in 2021, with a peak of 746 cases in 2016 of the approximately 12,000 patients we treat annually,” Dr Faisal Sultan, the chief executive of SKMCH told Dawn.
Most of the patients visit SKMCH, inaugurated by Imran Khan in December 2015 over 50 kanals of land donated by the then provincial government of Awami National Party. Afghans continue to visit Peshawar due to lack of specialised health services in their native country.
Dr Faisal is a former federal health minister. He has also co-authored a study “Cancer care in times of conflict: cross border care in Pakistan of patients from Afghanistan” in March 2020. He said that the flow of people with cancer from Afghanistan seeking care in Pakistan continued through the years, regardless of the situation of refugees.

Dr Faisal Sultan says international policies needed to provide healthcare to people in conflict areas

In the study, he looked at the typology of cancer patients seeking care in Pakistan over a 22-year period from 1995 to 2017. He said that 60 per cent of the patients were men, over a third had upper gastrointestinal cancer and more than half were diagnosed at an advanced stage.
“The real issue is that Afghanistan has weak facilities for cancer treatment and care as decades of conflict have devastated the country’s health infrastructure. This situation impacts the ability of Afghan refugees, migrants and cross-border patients to access to care and complete treatment. We have treated nearly 3,500 Afghan patients from 1995 to 2017,” said Dr Faisal.
The number of patients is most likely to be much higher as the staffers at the hospital don’t ask for national identity papers. They register only those patients, who have an address in Afghanistan, as Afghan refugees.
In the study, Dr Faisal stressed the need for devising new national and international policies and adopting practices to provide relevant models of care in situation of conflict and in the neighbouring regions that welcomed refugees.
He said that those polices should account for complex migration patterns and respond to the particular physical and mental needs of population from diverse socioeconomic and political environments.
Pakistan has a mixed health system with services, including cancer care, are provided by public sector hospitals, private institutions and the non-profit sector. About 200,000 cases of cancer are recorded every year in Pakistan. “An estimated 50,000 patients contact SKMCH for care but we can only treat about 12,000 patients annually,” said Dr Faisal.
He said that 22 per cent of patients paid fully from their own pockets and most were treated freely through the donations fund raised by SKMCH. “These patients also include people with cancer from Afghanistan, seeking care in Pakistan. They also benefit from free care if they are unable to pay,” he added.
Dr Faisal said that the centre was visited by people from the entire social spectrum and the staff did not know a person’s particular life situation. UNCHR has been assisting SKMCH, Peshawar as part of its Refugee Affected and Hosting Areas (RAHA) programme.
“We have provided high-tech medical equipment to SKMCH Peshawar,” said Qaisar Khan Afridi, the spokesman for UN refugees agency.
He said that RAHA was meant to mitigate the impact of the protracted refugee presence and promote social cohesion between Afghan refugees and their Pakistani host communities.
Since its launch in 2009, the programme has benefited more than 12 million people across the country through some 4,300 projects worth more than $ 200 million. About 85 per cent of the beneficiaries of the programme are Pakistanis.

They told Dawn that a group of deed writers was involved in issuing fake Federal Board of Revenue vouchers regarding the two per cent withholding tax and two per cent stamp duty levied by the federal government on all types of agricultural and commercial properties in 2016. They said the illegal activity continued for a long time, allegedly swindling over Rs70 million.
The sources said the FBR had directed the Dera sub-registrar office not to register any citizen’s property without them first depositing the stamp duty and withholding tax.
An official at the sub-registrar office on condition of anonymity said in 2019-20, some deed writers used to produce fake FBR vouchers with certain registration code to embezzle the tax amount. 
“Instead of depositing the amount received in this regard with the said counter, the deed writers used to prepare fake FBR vouchers and attach them to the property registry,” the official disclosed.
He said when the then sub-registrar Habibur Rahman checked the records and investigated the vouchers attached to the registry, he found the total amount of fake tax receipts to be over Rs70 million, which were pocketed by deed writers.
He claimed some officials close to the sub-registrar were also involved in the corruption.
The official said instead of taking action against the deed writers and others, the sub-registrar colluded with them, getting huge benefits in return for covering up the scam. He said the sub-registrar purchased a new luxury car and an expensive plot.
The official said the sub-registrar was a clerk and lived in a small rented house in Bilalabad area when he came to Dera from Tank. “However, now the sub-registrar, who is currently posted in Tank, owns dozens of plots and has a palatial house.”
He said the sub-registrar had transferred his properties in the name of other people.
The sources said the sub-registrar also used to collect commissions from people. They said the sub-registrar had also developed close relations with some property dealers and also acquired properties from them. 
When contacted to seek his views on the charges levelled against him, the former sub-registrar, Dera, Habibur Rahman referred to a letter dated December 28, 2021 of the revenue department, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and a letter dated December 31, 2021 by Director General Audit, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in which there was no mention of corruption in the property registries conducted in 2019-20.

The IWMB officials received a complaint from a citizen who went to the pet shop to buy a domesticated animal and found the turtles.
An official said the Indian roof shell turtle, black pond turtle, crown river turtle, Indian flap shell turtle and ganges soft shell turtle were confiscated. Pakistan has four soft shell and four hard shell turtle species inhabiting its various ecosystems.
The IWMB is strictly enforcing the Islamabad Wildlife Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management Ordinance 1979 that bans trade of wild animals in the capital.
The board is controlling illegal trade of wild animals and campaigning among masses to contain illicit trade of wildlife species, he said, adding during monsoon season, turtles start roaming on greenbelts and open spaces of the capital due to humidity. Recently, a citizen spotted a turtle on the greenbelt in front of Islamabad Club and informed the board. The animal was then safely relocated to a safer place.
There have been such accumulative complaints and reports submitted by people pertaining to turtles and other wild animals which are safely rescued and rehabilitated at the IWMB office and then released into their natural habitat, the IWMB official said.
According to the International Union of the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, the ganges soft shell and Indian peacock soft shell turtles were listed as vulnerable while the Indian flap shell turtle was listed as least concerned.
Furthermore, the IWMB officials also rescued five chakor and one grey partridge from Sihala. They were handed over to Haripur Forest and Wildlife Department and were later released by Forests and Wildlife Secretary Abid Majeed.
