The export proceeds fell 5.17 per cent to $2.21 billion in the first month of the current fiscal year from $2.34bn in the corresponding month last year, data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed on Tuesday.
On a month-on-month basis, the export proceeds tumbled by 23.95pc indicating a downward trend in the export sector. Last time, the exports posted a negative growth of 14.75pc in August 2020.
In FY22, for the first time, not only the export target was achieved but it exceeded the psychological barrier of $30bn. Pakistan’s exports remained below this level for the last decade.

Import bill dips 38pc month-on-month

Pakistan’s exports increased 26.6pc to $31.845bn in the just-ended fiscal year, up from $25.160bn a year ago. Exports grew 6.48pc to $2.89bn in June, up from $2.72bn in the previous year.
The textile sector has already complained about the rising cost of energy and raw materials mainly due to massive rupee depreciation. Moreover, exporters have also complained about refunds that stuck with the Federal Board of Revenue.
Import bill shrinks
The import bill also dropped by 12.81pc to $4.86bn in July from $5.57bn over the corresponding month of last year. On a month-on-month basis, the import bill dipped by 38.31pc.
In June alone, the import bill edged up to $7.74bn from $6.28bn over the same month last year, reflecting an increase of 23.26pc. The decline in July will reduce pressure on the rupee-dollar exchange rate.
The import bill increased 43.45pc to $80.51bn during 2021-22, up from $56.12bn a year ago.
Taking to Twitter Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said “Our efforts to reduce imports have finally borne fruit. Imports in July, per PBS data, were only $4.86b compared to $7.7b in June. Given that we have pulled Pakistan back from the brink of default, he further claimed.
“Our government is determined to minimise the large current account deficit left by PTI”, the minister further remarked.

 





 
The government imposed a ban on the import of nearly 800 luxury and non-essential goods on May 19. Last week the government announced the withdrawal of the ban on all items except automobiles and mobile phones.
According to the Pakistan Economic Survey 2021-22, the jump in imports is recorded in all the major groups. Multiple factors have contributed to the steep rise in imports during the period under review. Rising global commodity prices contributed significantly to the increasing import volume.
Disaggregated data on imports indicates that the energy group is the largest source of the increase in imports, contributing to a one-third of the year-on-year increase in imports during the period.
Similarly, price-led pressures were also noted across non-energy commodities imported by Pakistan, such as edible oil (palm and soya bean), sugar, tea, fertiliser and steel. At the same time, the domestic demand for imported raw materials — such as cotton, steel and capital goods — was also elevated in the wake of the policy-induced economic rebound.
Pakistan’s trade deficit declined by 18.33pc to $2.64bn in July from $3.23bn over the corresponding month of last year. The month-on-month decline in trade deficit was recorded at 46.76pc.
In FY22, the trade deficit reached an all-time high of $48.66bn from $30.96bn a year ago, indicating an increase of 57pc on the back of higher-than-expected imports.

1,‘Natural disaster losses hit $72bn’,"Losses propelled by storms and floods, Zurich-based group says.","ZURICH: Total economic losses caused by natural disasters hit an estimated $72 billion in the first half of 2022, fuelled by storms and floods, Swiss reinsurance giant Swiss Re estimated on Tuesday.
Though the figure is lower than the $91 billion estimate for the first six months of 2021, it is close to the 10-year average of $74 billion, and the weight is shifting towards weather-induced catastrophes.
“The effects of climate change are evident in increasingly extreme weather events, such as the unprecedented floods in Australia and South Africa,” said Martin Bertogg, Swiss Re’s head of catastrophe perils.
The Zurich-based group, which acts as an insurer for insurers, said the losses were also propelled by winter storms in Europe as well as heavy thunderstorms on the continent and in the United States.
So-called secondary natural disasters like floods and storms -- as opposed to major disasters such as earthquakes -- are happening more frequently, the reinsurer said.
“This confirms the trend we have observed over the last five years: that secondary perils are driving insured losses in every corner of the world,” Bertogg said.
“Unlike hurricanes or earthquakes, these perils are ubiquitous and exacerbated by rapid urbanisation in particularly vulnerable areas,” he said.
“Given the scale of the devastation across the globe, secondary perils require the same disciplined risk assessment as primary perils such as hurricanes.” Swiss Re said floods in India, China and Bangladesh confirm the growing loss potential from flooding in urban areas.
Man-made catastrophes such as industrial accidents added on a further $3 billion of economic losses to the $72 billion from natural disasters, taking the total to $75 billion — which is down on the $95 billion total for the first half of 2021.
Insured losses at $38bn 
Total insured losses stood at $38bn: $3bn worth of man-made disasters and $35bn worth of natural catastrophes — up 22pc on the 10-year average, said the Swiss reinsurer, warning of the effects of climate change.
February’s storms in Europe cost insurers $3.5bn, according to Swiss Re estimates.
Australia’s floods in February and March set a new record for insured flood losses in the country so far close to $3.5bn — one of the costliest natural catastrophes ever in the country.
Severe weather and hailstorms in France in the first six months of the year have so far caused an estimated four billion euros ($4.1bn) of insured market losses.

2,Cement sales plunge 47.7pc on construction slowdown,"Drop in sales attributed to monsoon rains, higher construction costs and longer Eidul Azha holidays.","KARACHI: The country’s overall cement despatches – local sales and exports – declined by 47.7 per cent in July to 2.009 million tonnes, down from 3.899m tonnes a year ago.
According to the data shared by the All Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association (APCMA), local cement despatch fell 45.28pc to 1.88m tonnes in July 2021 from 3.44m tonnes in July 2021 due to monsoon rains and longer Eidul Azha holidays. Exports fell by 66pc to 153,517 tonnes in July from 452,777 tonnes a year ago.
Cement mills in the North shipped 1.68m tonnes in July, a 44.3pc decrease from 3.02m tonnes in July 2021. South-based mills shipped 352,747 tonnes in July, a 59.53pc decrease from 871,601 tonnes a year ago.
According to the APCMA data, North-based cement mills sold 1.61m tonnes in domestic markets, a 44.11pc decrease from 2.89m tonnes in July 2021. South-based mills shipped 269,477 tonnes to local markets in July 2022, a 51.4pc decrease from the previous year’s total of 554,442 tonnes.
Exports from North-based mills fell by 48.2pc, falling from 135,618 tonnes in July 2021 to 70,247 tonnes in July 2022. Exports from the South also plunged by 74pc to 83,270 tonnes in July 2022 from 317,159 tonnes during the same month last year.
Mehroz Khan of Top Line Securities attributed July’s sales fall to a slowdown in construction activities owing to rain and higher construction costs.
He said exports suffered owing to the global economic slowdown, disruption in the global supply chain and higher sea freight.
Industry utilisation during July was estimated at 34-36pc versus 67pc in the same period last year.
The start of FY23 looks bleak despite the summer season, where usually the cement dispatches are higher as compared to the winter season. This shows a clear reflection of the economic downturn where the cost of all the construction materials is on the higher side, thus eroding demand, Mr Khan said.
According to him, cement prices are hovering around Rs1,050 per 50 kg bag, up 20pc from Rs875 per bag in May due to higher coal prices (including Afghan coal), rupee depreciation against the US dollar and rising fuel prices.
The Afghan coal prices (factory cost) increased by 33pc to Rs66,000 per tonne as the Afghan government raised ex-mine prices and export taxes which were procured by the north’s cement industry players, he said.
With rising interest rates, an expected slowdown in economic growth and a contained Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), he expected cement dispatches to remain under pressure in FY23.
A spokesman of APCMA emphasised that massive currency devaluation, political uncertainty and a deteriorating economy need to be addressed by the government to provide a stable environment for industries. “The situation is very alarming and government must come up with a solution to bring the country out of this crisis,” he added.

3,OICCI voices concerns over curbs on LCs,OICCI leadership meets SBP acting governor to discuss urgent fiscal and monetary policy measures for stabilising economy.,"KARACHI: The Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) drew the attention of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) leadership on Tuesday to the concerns of multinational companies about the pre-approval procedure for letters of credit (LCs) for the import of machinery and spare parts, timely remittance payments and low approval exemptions for shipping values.
The OICCI leadership met SBP Acting Governor Dr Murtaza Syed, Deputy Governor Dr Inayat Hussain and Deputy Governor Sima Kamil to discuss urgent fiscal and monetary policy measures that should be taken to help stabilise the country’s economy, a press release said.
OICCI President Ghias Khan and OICCI Secretary General Abdul Aleem led the discussion. They urged the SBP leadership to set timelines so that the industrial supply chain remained uncompromised.
The SBP team presented a comprehensive overview of the current economic situation and its strategy to tackle the challenging issues in 2023. The SBP team said Pakistan’s economic problems were temporary and urged the members of the OICCI to work on increasing exports to help balance the exchange rate fluctuations and currency depreciation.
Mr Khan said it was imperative that the SBP implemented cogent measures to halt the accumulation of the circular debt.
The statement quoted the SBP acting governor as saying that the central bank was taking tough measures and making difficult decisions to help avert the economic crisis. “Global inflationary pressures coupled with a pro-cyclical expansionary fiscal policy during a pro-cyclical period is one of the main reasons why Pakistan is at this crossroads today. Once these measures are implemented and the International Monetary Fund’s loan is received, the pressures on the economy will ease, specifically with regard to the depreciating rupee,” he said.

4,Oil sales down 26pc,Analyst says depressed oil sales mainly occurred due to Eidul Azha holidays and monsoon season.,"KARACHI: The first month of FY23 began with a 26 per cent year-on-year (YoY) decline in oil sales to 1.442 million tonnes, the lowest since February 2021.
Oil sales in July 2021 and June 2022 were 1.938m tonnes and 1.936m tonnes, respectively. The drop in sales of furnace oil (FO), high speed diesel (HSD), and petrol by 5pc, 38pc, and 27pc, respectively, to 350,000 tonnes, 444,000 tonnes, and 594,000 tonnes in July from 367,000 tonnes, 721,000 tonnes, and 808,000 tonnes in July 2021 was the main reason for the overall drop in country’s oil sales.
Saad Ziker of Top Line Securities said depressed oil sales mainly occurred due to Eidul Azha holidays during the first half of July, when inter-provincial transportation activity subsided, leading to low HSD sales, and the monsoon season across the country resulted in lower traffic on the roads.
Furthermore, he believed that the 26pc and 41pc increases in petrol and diesel prices since 2June 2022 resulted in lower demand for petroleum products and an increase in use of public transportation and carpooling. 
He predicted that oil sales would fall by 15-20pc YoY in FY23, owing to low agricultural growth, a likely decline in auto sales, and an increase in petroleum prices.

5,Switzerland’s second top bank downgraded,Moody’s downgrades Credit Suisse's ratings by one notch for its long-term senior unsecured debt.,"ZURICH: Ratings agencies Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s downgraded scandal-hit Credit Suisse on Tuesday, given the restructuring Switzerland’s second-biggest bank will have to undertake in a more challenging environment.
Moody’s downgraded the bank’s senior unsecured debt ratings by one notch from Baa1 to Baa2, and from A1 to A2 for its long-term senior unsecured debt, it said in a statement. “The negative outlook on these ratings has been maintained,” it said, following the  “large financial losses” published by Credit Suisse last week.
The ratings agency justified its decision in view of the  “more difficult macroeconomic and market environment” the bank will have to deal with in order to stabilise its investment banking business, which is showing signs of  “market share erosion”.
“Stabilising the group under the leadership of a new board and senior executive team will require time,” the US agency said.
Last week Credit Suisse said it booked a quarterly net loss of 1.593bn Swiss francs ($1.65bn) in the period from April to June, wider than the loss of 273 million francs in the preceding three months and down from net profit of 253m francs in the second quarter of 2021.

6,Govt halves fixed tax for non-filers: KCCI,"Several trade bodies have been holding protests against Rs6,000 fixed tax introduced in the Finance Act 2022.","KARACHI: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail has announced a plan to reduce the fixed tax rate to Rs3,000 for non-filers from Rs6,000 on electricity bills, besides exempting consumers whose bills were up to 150 units.
A press release in this regard was issued by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) while referring to a zoom meeting held between the Finance Minister, Chairman Businessmen Group (BMG) Zubair Motiwala, President KCCI Muhammad Idrees and small traders on Monday night.
Several trade bodies have been holding protests against the Rs6,000 tax introduced in the Finance Act 2022.
The Finance Minister promised to remove all the other taxes from the electricity bills once the fixed tax regime is activated to avoid double taxation. Only GST on electricity consumption will be applicable and at the year-end, they will be required to submit a document to intimate the tax authorities about the payment of taxes during the year. He also agreed to consider the demand of small traders when increasing the threshold.
During the session, KCCI leadership expressed concerns over the high rate of taxes being charged on electricity bills. They argued that commercial consumers are already paying multiple taxes on their monthly electricity bills, including fuel adjustment surcharge, electricity duty, income tax, general sales tax, extra GST, and further GST.
The KCCI leadership urged the government to accept the genuine demands of small businessmen who are already struggling to make both ends meet and increase the suggested threshold of 150 units of electricity consumption from the fixed tax regime and remove other taxes from electricity bills.

7,ICI to become Lucky Core Industries,Posts 69pc jump in annual profit,"KARACHI: ICI Pakistan Ltd is going to change its name to Lucky Core Industries Ltd, the company said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.
“This decision has been taken primarily to align the company’s name with its holding company, Lucky Cement Ltd, which is a part of the Yunus Brothers Group. The proposed name draws on the strength of the Lucky brand,” it said.
AkzoNobel, one of the largest coatings and chemicals companies globally, became the ultimate holding company of ICI Pakistan Ltd in 2008. Lucky Holdings Ltd acquired the majority shareholding from AkzoNobel in 2012 and became the ultimate holding company of ICI Pakistan Ltd.
The company then went on an acquisition spree in the following years and acquired assets in pharmaceutical, chemical and formula milk businesses. “From textiles and glass to healthcare, food and agriculture, the application of the company’s products position it at the centre of its stakeholder’s daily life,” it said.

Posts 69pc jump in annual profit 

Meanwhile, the company reported on Tuesday its net profit for 2021-22 amounted to Rs8.86 billion on a consolidated basis, up 69 per cent from a year ago. Its consolidated turnover increased 56pc to Rs100.86bn in the same year. Enhanced efficiencies, recovering consumer demand and the acquisition of an additional shareholding in NutriCo Pakistan Ltd contributed significantly to the higher profitability, it said.
In addition, the one-off net positive impact resulting from the re-measurement of the previously held equity interest of NutriCo Pakistan Ltd also improved the financial strength of the company. Adjusting for the one-off gain of Rs1.84bn as a consequence of the re-measurement of the previously held equity interest, net earnings of the company would’ve clocked in at Rs7.01bn, up 34pc year-on-year.
The company announced a final cash dividend of Rs15 per share, which is in addition to the interim cash dividend of Rs20 apiece.
