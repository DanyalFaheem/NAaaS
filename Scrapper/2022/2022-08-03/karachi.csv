0,"Flood situation at Sindh’s barrages not alarming despite record rains, says official",Above-normal rainfall expected later this month likely to change the scenario,"HYDERABAD: Like Guddu, Sukkur Barrage is also in a state of low flood while inflows at Guddu upstream are constantly increasing, according to officials. 
Irrigation authorities have reduced water discharges for left bank canals in anticipation of another spell of monsoon rainfall in Sindh this week.
Low flood level persists at Guddu Barrage since 6pm on July 25 after which Sukkur Barrage attained low flood status at 6pm on July 27. Since then discharges at Guddu, Sukkur and Kotri barrages have been increasing.
On Aug 2, Guddu Barrage recorded a flow of 357,628 cusecs upstream and 329,326 cusecs downstream recorded at 6am. Sukkur Barrage recorded a flow of 294,810 cusecs upstream and 258,900 cusecs downstream while Kotri Barrage upstream flow stood at 174,237 cusecs upstream and 147,082 cusecs downstream.

Above-normal rainfall expected later this month likely to change the scenario

Kotri downstream discharges are seen only in flood season otherwise they either remain zero or inadequate as against the Water Apportionment Accord 1991.
Today (on Aug 2), the storage in Tarbela Dam stood at 1,532 feet – 18 feet short of its optimum level – while Mangla Dam storage stood at 1,155.8 feet. At 6pm, Guddu Barrage had a discharge of 361,095 cusecs upstream and 331,943 cusecs downstream; Sukkur had upstream flow of 294,810 cusecs and 258,900 downstream. Kotri Barrage upstream flows were recorded at 180,960 cusecs and 153,475 cusecs downstream.
Irsa official, Khalid Idris Rana said that rim stations were showing a reduction in flows in the river system. “Lately we had seen a flow of 550,000 cusecs which will drop to 250,000 cusecs in the river system soon,” he said. Referring to flows of Indus at Tarbela, he said they dropped from 270,000 cusecs at 6am to 241,000 cusecs at 6pm today. He further said that Chenab and Kabul rivers’ flows were also recording a decline. 
“Storage will improve in Tarbela while Mangla will have a maximum storage of 1,170 feet,” he said.
However, he added, going by rainfall forecasts of Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), another spell would start soon and this would again trigger increased supplies into the river system. “PMD says that above-normal rainfall is expected in the system,” he pointed out. He said that provinces had sufficient water flows at their barrages and it would take around 15 days to utilise these flows completely.
Another official said lowest temperature of 18 degree centigrade in Skardu ensures supplies but if it drops to below this point then flows would reduce. Today, he said, the maximum temperature was recorded at 29.4 degree centigrade which was expected to rise to 30 degree centigrade. “Rainfall is also expected in upper catchment that may benefit flows in Mangla,” he said.
Situation not alarming
While flows in Indus have inundated parts of Sindh’s riverine area, the situation is not alarming. “Flows are sufficient and flood situation is not alarming,” said Sukkur Barrage official Aziz Soomro. He said that now water was being stored at Chashma while flows at Tarbela were showing a decline. “All right bank canals of Sukkur barrage are being supplied water. Month of July witnessed adequate flows and ongoing month of August will also be comfortable as far as flows are concerned,” he said.
Sukkur barrage’s left bank canals are now getting reduced flows. Rohri Canal superintending engineer Zaheer Memon said the canal was now getting discharges of 5,500 cusecs. “It remained closed with zero flows between July 22 and 28 during recent rainfall. But now flows are allowed in the canal,” he said.
Similarly, Nara canal is also getting 4,500 cusecs which, until recently, had been receiving 8,500 cusecs. 
According to Nara Canal superintending engineer Mansoor Memon, the very flows are being used for filling Chotiyari reservoir. “The reservoir is filled through Ranto Canal,” he said, and noted that there was a forecast of heavy rainfall from Aug 5. “Command area of Nara Canal doesn’t have a proper drainage system. So, flows from the canal coupled with anticipated rainfall can aggravate situation in its command areas from drainage point of view,” he said. This was the reason that flows in Nara Canal had been reduced, he said.
Meanwhile, in view of massive flooding caused by the monsoon rains, Balochistan is only receiving flows from Khirthar Canal of Sukkur barrage while provincial irrigation authorities have stopped getting flows through Pat Feeder Canal of Guddu Barrage at RD-109. At Garang regulator of Khirthar Canal, the province is getting 1,530 cusecs. This is perhaps due to the fact that the areas fed by Khirthar Canal remained less-affected by flooding.

Police officials said that two groups of Malik community exchanged fire with each other over some dispute early on Sunday morning in Bachal Shah locality, which resulted in the death of one Asghar Ali Malik. Airport police led by SSP Singhar Malik rushed to the area and shifted the dead body to Sukkur Civil Hospital where doctors conducted post-mortem examination and handed it over to heirs, said officials.
They said that they took action on time and arrested the suspected assailants with the weapons used in the crime. Despite the fact that the suspects were in police custody, armed protesters blocked a section of Sukkur bypass at City Point for hours and demanded that police must arrest their rivals’ women and demolish their homes as well, said police officials.
They said that when police refused to carry out the illegal action according to their wishes, the protesters flew into a rage and argued with them. Instead of clearing the road, they took the law into their own hands by smashing windscreens of passing vehicles, pelting motorists and commuters with stones, setting things on fire and creating mayhem in the area, they said.
Forced by their violent actions, police registered an FIR under relevant ATA sections against the miscreants, who had rampaged on the road for hours and created scare, they said.

3,"Khuhro alleges Imran deceived overseas Pakistanis, nation",Demands ex-PM’s disqualification after ECP decision,"LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party Sindh president Senator Nisar Ahmed Khuhro has said that Election Commission of Pakistan’s verdict in the case of prohibited funding of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf proves that Imran Khan has not only deceived overseas Pakistanis but also entire nation.
Khuhro said in a press statement issued here on Tuesday that PTI’s registration should be cancelled, its entire leadership and Imran Khan should be disqualified for life in the light of ECP’s decision as he had ceased to be Sadik and Ameen under Article 62 and 63 of the constitution.
He said the verdict did not allow Imran Khan to lead the PTI or any other political party and claimed the man declared ‘Sadiq’ and ‘Ameen’ by former Chief Justice Saqib Nisar had turned out to be a ‘certified’ thief, who had illegally obtained funds from Canada, Israel, India, United States and several other countries.
He said that securing funds from foreign countries was unconstitutional and a crime. Imran Khan had concealed 13 bank accounts and used donated funds to create unrest in the country under a conspiracy, he said.

Demands ex-PM’s disqualification after ECP decision

Khuhro alleged that the one who received funds from India and Israel was imposed on Pakistan under a foreign agenda. Hence, Imran Khan and PTI were themselves imported and not others, he said.
He said that Imran Khan‘s real face had been unmasked and the ‘deceiver’ would not be able to further cover his ‘lies’ through pressure tactics.
He wondered Imran Khan was criticising and hurling allegations at the Chief Election Commissioner whom he himself had appointed. When Imran Khan sensed the ECP was going to pass verdict against him in the prohibited funding case he began targeting and mounting pressure on it, he said.
He lauded ECP for ignoring the PTI’s pressure and going ahead to unmask the ‘thieves’. In 2008 and 2013, Imran Khan had filed ‘incorrect’ undertaking which amounted to his disqualification, he said.
Khuhro said the man [Imran Khan] who had been pointing finger at others had himself stood as international money launderer and nation was waiting for his logical end.
He asked PTI to bring forth if it had any proof regarding prohibited funding of other political parties.

5,Sindh worst-hit by rains after Balochistan: Sherry,Says will prepare a comprehensive report on the widespread damage to infrastructure.,"THATTA: Federal Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman has said that Sindh has sustained more financial losses after Balochistan inflicted by recent torrential rain.
The senator told media persons at naval base in Keti Bunder following a whirlwind visit of the flooded coastline that she and her team was visiting the Thatta coastal belt to ascertain ground realities, prepare a report and recommend a special package for the rain-hit province.
She said that she would prepare a comprehensive report on the widespread damage to infrastructure, including bridges, sim nullahs, katcha and pakka houses and crops in the flooded area in order to recommend sufficient compensation for the affected population.
Federal Minister for IT Aminul Haq, who also accompanied the senator, said that more than 9,000 houses were damaged and 10 people lost their lives in the recent heavy rain, overflow and overtopping of drains and backflow of oceanic water.
Sadiq Ali Memon, special assistant to Sindh chief minister, said that elected representatives were assisting the district administration in its efforts for rescuing and rehabilitating the marooned population in Thatta coastal belt.
Kesoo Mal Kheel Das Kohistani, Sadiq Ali Memon and senior vice president of PPP Thatta chapter Abdul Hamid Panhwar were also part of the federal minister’s entourage.  
Meanwhile, PPP MPA Ali Hassan Zardari visited submerged areas in Ghorabari and Keti Bunder and asked the administration to expedite efforts to drain out stagnant rainwater from urban and rural areas.
‘Survey of flooded villages in Larkana soon’
Larkana Commissioner Ganhwar Ali Laghari on Tuesday said that a survey of submerged villages would be undertaken shortly to assess the extent of damage in the rain-hit areas of this division so that  affected people could receive assistance and compensation, our Larkana correspondent adds. 
Accompanied by MNA Sardar Khan Chandio, chieftain of Chandio tribe and Qambar-Shahdadkot deputy commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso, the commissioner visited rain-hit areas and met marooned people in the villages of Gabidero, Sono Khan Chandio, Haji Mohammad Hassan Buriro, Denar Buriro and others.
He assured rain-affectees who had taken shelter in relief camps of providing them all possible assistance and was briefed about the government help so far provided to the affectees. The survey was being carried out so that the government could extend help to people, he said.
Later, the officer visited Flood Protective Bund in Faridabad area, which was sustaining heavy pressure of water coming down from mountains after heavy rains and asked the irrigation and other departments concerned to be vigilant about the state of the embankment.
Sources said that locals had cut Saroh lake’s dykes at certain points to reduce pressure on its banks and drain out water into Hamal Lake.  The water would further travel through Main Nara Valley Drain into Manchar Lake, said the sources.
However, the cuts in the lake’s banks had led to inundation of road link between Qambar, Gaibidero and other villages, said the sources.
Meanwhile, the commissioner held a meeting with the highway department’s engineers in Larkana and called for assessing the damage and making efforts to repair and restore the road link between Gaibidero and Qambar at the earliest.

8,PTI stages walkout after rejection of privilege motion against police,"House rejects two private bills of GDA lawmaker; 33 child labour cases registered in 2021, PA told","KARACHI: The private members’ day in the Sindh Assembly was on Tuesday marred for the umpteenth time as the members of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf boycotted the proceedings in protest against the rejection of their member’s privilege motion by the chair.
Majority of the private members’ business including bills and resolutions were not taken up due to the PTI’s boycott, depriving themselves to introduce seven private bills of their members in the house.
PTI’ Rabistan Khan had tabled a privilege motion against Gulshan-i-Maymar police for ‘raiding’ his residence three times on May 23 and 24 and then on July 24. “My privilege was breached with the raids and my privilege motion be referred to the committee,” Mr Khan demanded.

Date, Kharif crops losses 
The cabinet was told that heavy monsoon rains had caused havoc throughout the urban and rural areas of the province. 
CM advisor on agriculture Manzoor Wassan said that date crops were almost ready to harvest, but heavy rains washed them away in Khairpur and caused a loss of billions of rupees to date growers. 
He also took up the issue of damages caused to other Kharif crops in the province. 
The chief minister directed all the deputy commissioners across the province to assess the losses, including lives, katcha and pacca houses, road network, drainage and sewerage system.

12,Agonising outages hit Karachiites as KE power plant develops fault,KE spokesman says problem may take 8-10 weeks to rectify.,"KARACHI: As the city struggles with rain and crumbling infrastructure, frequent power outages and loadshedding — at times for 12-16 hours a day — are making life impossible for Karachiites. 
Following the announcement by the KE about a technical fault in one of the generating units of its Bin Qasim plant, citizens across the city, who continue to face loadshedding, believe that the fault will exacerbate the situation. 
The KE on Tuesday said that the first unit of its Bin Qasim Power Station-3 (BQPS-III) was currently offline following a fault identified during a test being conducted as part of the plant’s commissioning, with an estimated restoration time of eight to 10 weeks. 
A KE spokesman told Dawn that no blast took place at the facility, which was taken offline late on Monday night. 

KE spokesman says problem may take 8-10 weeks to rectify

“The development arose during testing being performed by Siemens AG as part of the final stages of commissioning. Representatives from Siemens AG and Harbin Electric International, the contractor’s consortium, immediately initiated assessment,” the KE said in a statement and added: “While the plant is still under test run, we are closely monitoring the progress and have full confidence in the team of global experts tasked to resolve this on priority.” 
According to a media brief, early assessment showed that the fault is isolated to a section of the gas turbine. “Restoration time is currently estimated at 8-10 weeks. A detailed root cause analysis is also underway.”
The utility said that BQPS-III had achieved full load multiple times in the past month. Currently, power supply to the city is as per the routine schedule announced on June 30, it added. 
With an investment of over $650 million, BQPS-III completed the first firing of its generation unit of 450 megawatts on March 14 earlier this year. 
‘Paying consumers being penalised’
Paying consumers in very high loss (VHL) areas continue to suffer the most compared to those with low loss (LL) feeders, which are mostly exempted from loadshedding. 
The utility defines LL feeders as those where billing recovery is 80 per cent or above, while VHL feeders are those where recovery losses are 70pc, meaning most consumers are not paying bills and electricity theft is high. 
Speaking to Dawn, Ahmed Chandio, a resident of Ramazan Gabol Goth near Safoora Chowrangi, said that paying consumers in his area were being penalised. “We have no power for 10 hours every day, sometimes more.”
“KE needs to come up with a mechanism where paying consumers are not made to suffer. What is a bill-paying consumer supposed to do? My entire lane pays electricity bills, but we are penalised,” says Mr Chandio. 
In a tweet, Salman Mohsin from Saudabad said that his area had been facing announced loadshedding for 10 hours daily. According to a screenshot of the schedule, the first spell of loadshedding in his area begins at 8:05am to 11:05am; then 1:35pm to 4:35pm; 7:05pm to 9:05pm, and 11:35pm to 1:05am.
Meanwhile, responding to enraged consumers on social media, KE in a tweet said, “In light of the ongoing power supply constraints, K-Electric announced a rationalised load shed schedule for its customers. The shortfall is round the clock in KE territory and is persisting due to rising temperatures and curtailed fuel supply.”
The representative insisted that there was no unscheduled loadshedding.
Aneel Iqbal, a resident of Garden west, tweeted that loadshedding in his locality lasted for nine hours every day, primarily due to kundas. KE says it can’t do anything about the kundas so they shut the whole area. 
“In my area, there is at least 7 hours of loadshedding daily. This was a loadshedding exempted area earlier,” says Abdul Ghaffar, a sports journalist and an anchor. 
A resident of Drigh Road said the locality is one of the most liveable places in Karachi, but is plagued by loadshedding. “Between January and March, we had over 20 maintenance shutdowns which lasted from 9am to 5pm. Cabling was changed and our local IBC official assured us that no power outages would happen. However, things have gotten worse.”

13,"Hepatitis, pregnancy-related complications claim 146 lives daily in country: experts",KARACHI: Hepatitis and pregnancy-related complications together claim 146 lives daily in Pakistan where the spread ...,"KARACHI: Hepatitis and pregnancy-related complications together claim 146 lives daily in Pakistan where the spread of hepatitis E is intensifying due to contaminated water.
People in Karachi, Hyderabad, Larkana, Sukkur and Mirpurkhas are particularly at a high risk of acquiring hepatitis A and E due to poor sanitary conditions.
These concerns were raised by experts at a seminar held on Monday at the Dow Medical College. The event was jointly organised by the Pakistan Society of Gastroenterology and World Gastroenterology Organisation in connection with the World Hepatitis Day.
Speaking at the seminar, Dow University of Health Sciences Pro Vice Chancellor Prof Nusrat Shah said that a silent tragedy affecting the large population in Pakistan remained unnoticed as every 16th minute a person died of hepatitis while every 31st minute a woman lost her life during childbirth.
“We seem helpless. There is neither news about it nor government institutions pay attention to it. We are being counted among the underdeveloped countries of Africa while our neighbouring countries, India, Iran and Bangladesh are ahead of us,” she observed.
Highlighting the WHO data on hepatitis, Dr Sajjad Jameel said hepatitis A and E killed 100,000 and 60,000 people, respectively.
“The death rate is much higher among pregnant women. In Pakistan, hepatitis A accounts for 50 to 60 per cent of acute viral hepatitis cases in children. Almost 96pc of individuals are found to be exposed to hepatitis A by the age of five years,” he said.
He pointed out that the symptoms of hepatitis A included fever, jaundice, indigestion, severe yellow urine, weakness, vomiting, right sided abdominal pain, nausea and dizziness.
“It’s a vaccine preventable disease. Healthy eating habits and ensuring good hygiene also help in prevention,” he said.
He also shared findings of a local study that showed out of the 2,735 patients infected with hepatitis, 232 were admitted to the hospital and 30 patients suffered from liver failure.
Dr Huma Qureshi said Pakistan was the second most affected country by hepatitis C and the country reported 164,000 new cases of hepatitis C in 2020.
“The risk of getting hepatitis C from blood transfusion is the highest with a rate of 14.8pc. Other sources of infection include contaminated syringes or injection use, hospital history, dental treatment, surgical history etc,” she said, urging provincial governments to invest in disease prevention.
According to Dr Qureshi, a significant majority of people being tested positive for hepatitis C are not being transferred to hospitals for treatment. “Unfortunately, people don’t know that now we have an effective oral treatment for hepatitis C and people are being cured within a few months. There is no effective vaccine against hepatitis C.”
Dr Abdul Qadir Memon said the combination of hepatitis B and D infection was considered the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis.
“Hepatitis D has remained a neglected disease mainly due to lack of an effective antiviral treatment. The availability of new drugs now may be a strong incentive to identify its patients who may benefit from therapy,” he noted.

The IES selection board, first organised in January this year, was declared null and void by the secretary of universities and boards on the grounds that the vice chancellor had not taken permission for the process from the government. The step was strongly contested by KU teachers. Later, the university acquired permission from the provincial government for the selection board and planned it twice, but they were postponed.
On Tuesday, teachers gathered in front of the administrative block and shared their grievances.
They demanded that the administration announce a schedule for the selection boards pending since 2019 without any further delay.
“The process is being delayed for one or the other reasons due to which many teachers, who had been waiting for their promotions for a long time, have either retired or are about to hit their retirement age,” stated a press release by the KU selection board action committee.
Currently, there are 136 vacant posts for lecturer, 45 for assistant professors, 37 for associate professors and 110 vacant posts for professors, on the campus.
Speaking to Dawn, KU Vice Chancellor Prof Khalid Mahmood Iraqi said he would soon meet the secretary universities and boards over the issue.
“I am told that the university couldn’t get permission for holding the selection boards [from the government] other than IES. So, I will be meeting the secretary soon to sort out the issue,” he said, adding that he held selection boards of 2012, 2014 and 2016 when he headed the university as the acting vice chancellor of KU for three years.

15,Notice issued on maintainability of plea for court automation,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Tuesday issued a notice to the provincial law officer on a petition seeking...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Tuesday issued a notice to the provincial law officer on a petition seeking judicial automation, digitisation of legal record and e-court.
The petitioner also submitted that establishment of a national judicial database and online hearing must be initiated to deal with the deadlock of around two million cases pending across the country.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Salahuddin Panhwar conducted the preliminary hearing of the petition and stated in its order: “Subject to maintainability particularly on the point of non-joinder misjoinder of the parties, issue notice to the AG Sindh for 17.08.2022.”
Sheema Kermani, through her lawyer, petitioned the SHC stating that she was a senior citizen and founder of a non-government organisation and she approached the court for court automation.
She submitted that the concept of e-court had gained momentum in Canada, Singapore and Thailand and the basic idea behind it was to decrease the third-party intervention, which paved the way for corruption. Neighbouring India was also excelling in e-court, she added.
Citing the ministry of law & justice secretary, Sindh chief secretary and others as respondents, the petitioner argued that digitisation of court record would help faster adjudication of cases, improve accessibility to legal documents and make it faster for multiple government agencies to access and utilise information.
She further submitted that an e-court project should be initiated, which could perform scanning and digital preservation of cases record in district judiciary as record rooms had no further space to keep up with the piling cases and rainwater seepage in storage facility was damaging the record considerably.
The petitioner stated that the federal government had established a Rs1.5 billion access to justice development fund, which could be utilised for setting up national judicial database to keep the record and status of pending cases and provision of information from national to provincial and district level in real time.
She sought directives for the respondents to formulate a policy and framework to introduce latest use of information technology in the field of judiciary and law, and allocation of necessary budget for the purpose.
The petitioner also asked the SHC to issue directives for the respondents to establish a judicial national database, enhance e-court and online court projects, improve IT infrastructure in courts and computerise the court documentation.
