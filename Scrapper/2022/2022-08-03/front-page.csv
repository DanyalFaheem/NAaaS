• Notice issued to party over forfeiture of prohibited funds; matter forwarded to federal govt for action
ISLAMABAD: Announcing a widely anticipated decision on a petition filed eight years ago against the supposedly dubious sources of funding of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) ruled that the party did receive millions of dollars of funds from 351 foreign companies and 34 foreign nationals, including a US-Indian businesswoman, and ordered issuance of a notice to the PTI, seeking an explanation as to why the prohibited funds it received should not be forfeited.
“…the matter falls within the ambit of Article 17(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan, Article 6(3) and Article 2(c)(iii) of PPO, 2002. Hence, the Commission directs that a notice may be issued to the respondent party in terms of Rule-6 of PPR, 2002 as to why the aforementioned prohibited funds may not be confiscated. The office is also directed to initiate any other action under the law, in the light of this order of the Commission, including forwarding the case to the federal government,” stated the verdict that is being interpreted by both the ruling side and the opposition to suit their narratives; the PTI feels it vindicates its stance that it never received foreign funding, but could be a case of prohibited funding, while the government considers the decision a ‘charge sheet’ against ‘crimes’ of the party and its chie f Imran Khan.
The decision was announced by a three-member ECP bench headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikander Sultan Raja in a case filed by PTI’s founding member Akbar S. Babar that had been pending since Nov 14, 2014.
About the donation received from Wootton Cricket Club, the order states it appears the “PTI Pakistan knowingly received and accepted donations from a company which was being operated by a business tycoon who was involved in a criminal fraud”. It says the owner of the offshore company, Arif Naqvi, in his affidavit admitted “he voluntarily participated in personally providing and from others, collecting party (PTI) funds, contributions and donations... from within the jurisdiction of UAE”.
The ECP notes the collection of donations by companies and people by any means and for any purpose, other than registered permissible category charities, is prohibited under UAE laws.
“Therefore, the [PTI] was a willing recipient and beneficiary of prohibited money to the tune of $2.12 million funneled to its accounts by Mr Arif Masood Naqvi using Wootton Cricket Limited,” the order reads. It says details of the transactions have not been disclosed by the PTI that has willfully concealed, misstated and misrepresented facts. On the basis of available evidence on record, these transactions are hit by prohibition under Pakistani laws on donation.
It further says examination of record reveals that M/s Bristol Engineering Services LLC, a UAE-based company, transferred $49,965. The PTI received funds into its accounts in the form of donations of $100,000 from a Zurich, Switzerland-based entity operating as E Planet Trustees.
It says the PTI formed companies in the US, Canada and the UK for fundraising purposes. The donations and contributions collected by these companies were transferred to the party accounts in Pakistan. Similarly, the party received funds into its accounts as donations worth $1,741 from S.S. Marketing, a Manchester, UK-based private limited company.
About two limited liability companies (LLCs) registered by the PTI in the US, the ECP order says irrespective of the finer motive, the platform opted by PTI agents was to run the LLCs as non-profit business entities, as distinct entities from charitable organisations to meet the stipulations of the US laws. However, this act is in direct violation of the Pakistani laws (Article 6(3) of PPO 2002) which disallows fund collection from any sources other than “individuals”.
All amounts raised by the LLCs are considered in departure of Article 6(3) of PPO 2002, while it can also not be ignored that the PTI agents, while raising funds, did not discriminate between “individuals” and “entities” and “Pakistani origin Americans and foreign nationals”. To identify and record accurate sources of funds received (donations and contributions) in the US by PTI agents was obligatory as per Article 17. The list of donations available on record illustrates the PTI received and accepted donations from 351 companies and 34 foreign nationals.
The party in contravention of Article 17 of the Constitution failed to disclose and account for the source of funding. It knowingly received and accepted donations from and through US-based companies and foreign nationals, violating the provisions of Article 2(C) (iii) and Article 6(3) of Pakistan Political Order 2002.
The order states the PTI Canada was registered with Corporation Canada under Canada Business Act Part 2 on Oct 23, 2007. As per procedure, it is a federal company having Canada-wide jurisdiction. Such companies must comply with provincial legislation wherever they are operating, register in the province(s) of operation, file an annual return with Corporations Canada every year on the anniversary date of incorporation of the company and hold an annual general meeting of shareholders and directors.
The Canadian Federal Accountability Act (2006) “totally bans contributions by corporations, trade unions and associations to candidates and the nomination contestants of a registered party during an election period”.
It also says the PTI UK is registered as a public limited company in the UK that transferred funds to PTI accounts in Pakistan worth 792,265 pounds. These funds donated by UK-based companies are hit by prohibition contained in Article 6(3) of PP0 2002. Pakistani laws do not permit any type of funding by a Pakistani- or overseas-incorporated company. Therefore, by not making full disclosure, the PTI Pakistan has committed acts of willful concealment, misstatement and mis­representation of facts.
The ECP verdict also says the PTI disowned 13 accounts, but the disclosure made by respective banks through the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for each of the accounts belies the claim. One of the accounts in Lahore was opened and operated by Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, the PTI Lahore president, and another by Mian Mohammad Farooq, the PTI Punjab general secretary.
It said a Bank Islami (KASB) account in Peshawar was opened and operated by former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser with Shah Farman and lmran Shehzad. Mr Qaiser also operated a Habib bank Limited, Peshawar account with Muhammad Ashfaq and Mohsin Wadud. Two Habib Bank Limited accounts were opened and operated by PTI Sindh President lmran Ismail with Samar Ali Khan and Muhammad Najeeb Haroon. Another Habib Bank Limited account was opened and operated by Mrs Seema Zia of the PTI Sindh Women Wing, with Mrs Roshna. A Bank of Punjab, Quetta account was opened and operated by former National Assembly deputy speaker Qasim Suri with Syed Abdul Wahab and Dawood Khan.
Further providing details of accounts, the order states a KASB, Islamabad account was opened on the request of former premier Khan with the title of ‘PTI Disaster Fund’. The account signatories included Imran Khan, Sardar Azhar Tariq Khan, retired Col Younas Ali Raza and Saifullah Khan Niazi. It also provides details of withdrawals and deposits, and discloses that amounts had been transferred from undeclared accounts to the declared accounts.
The decision also reveals that as per information obtained from respective banks, Rs11.104 million were deposited in the personal accounts of four PTI paid employees, who had been authorised by the party’s Finance Board to receive funds from within and outside Pakistan.
PTI chief Imran Khan has for five successive years (2008-09 to 2012-13) under review and examination, submitted Form-1 and signed a certificate, which is not consistent with the accounting information gathered and compiled on the basis of details obtained from banks through the SBP. The submissions Mr Khan filed were grossly inaccurate and wrong, it added.
The PTI Pakistan has also been found to have received donations by Romita Shetty, a US-based businesswoman of Indian origin. The $13,750 donated by Ms Shetty is hit by prohibition on donations by foreign nationals and in violation of Article 2(C)(iii) of PPO 2002, and Article 6 (3) of PPO 2002.
Through its submission before the ECP, the PTI has accepted ownership of only eight accounts, while it declared 13 more under the category of ‘unknown’ and not pertaining to the party. The data obtained from the SBP reveals that all the 13 accounts disowned by the PTI were opened and operated by senior PTI management and leadership. It also failed to mention and disclose three accounts being operated by senior party leadership. Non-disclosure and concealment of 16 bank accounts is a serious reporting lapse on the part of PTI leadership and in violation of Article 17(3) of the Constitution.

1,ANALYSIS: No immediate threat to party despite ruling,"Ruling, however, may not bring glad tidings for party chairman Imran Khan in the days to come.","THE Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) decision in the prohibited funding case against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) does not pose an imminent danger to the political party, though it may not bring glad tidings for party chairman Imran Khan in the days to come.
On the political front, the decision has given its arch-rivals ammunition that may help them launch a vilification campaign against the party, especially by “putting the ball” into the federal government’s court.
The government can wait for a proper reference from the commission or move on its own to declare the PTI “a foreign-aided party” if satisfied on the basis of available information on the decision.
For the time being, the commission that has show-caused the party will commence proceedings whether to impose the penalty of confiscating the funds, held to be declared as foreign funds, commented senior counsel Mansoor Usman Awan.
Confiscation of funds
Under the rules governing political parties, the commission can decide whether the contributions or donations, which a political party accepted, were prohibited under Article 6(3) of Political Parties Order (PPO-2002) and after giving an opportunity of hearing, can direct confiscation of the funds in favour of the state to be deposited in the government treasury, according to him.
“I believe there is a strong case for the confiscation of the party funds,” commented a senior counsel on condition of anonymity but said the judgment also carries a serious implication and may put the party head into deep trouble.
The party head cannot absolve him or hide behind the excuse that he was not responsible for the accounts, because he gave a “certificate or affidavit under his signature” before the ECP claiming the party did not receive any funds that may fall into the category of prohibited financing.
New round of litigation
But whatever the implication may have in store for the senior party members, the decision has opened up a new round of litigation before the superior courts since the PTI intends to challenge the issuance of show cause notice by the commission before the high court.
The Supreme Court will have a final word on party’s fate, because any such declaration by the federal government, if taken, will be subject to endorsement by the apex court that can uphold federal government’s declaration or reject the same but after a complete satisfaction of its own through proper hearing into the matter.
If the apex court upholds federal government declaration, then according to Section 15(3) of PPO-2002, the foreign-aided political party will stand dissolved forthwith. In addition, the members who contested elections on the tickets of the party will also be disqualified for the remaining term. But it is far-fetched idea as legally the ECP decision is “too weak” and any federal government move to declare the party foreign-funded will not be a prudent decision, according to him.
Danger not over
But Mr Awan believes the danger for party leaders is not over especially in view of the 2017 Hanif Abbasi case.
A three-judge Supreme Court bench had absolved Imran Khan of the allegations of corruption in that case but had held it was ECP’s duty to scrutinise accounts of political parties on the touchstone of Article 6(3) PPO, read in the light of Article 17(3) of the Constitution, according to him. The allegation that the PTI received prohibited funding can be declared by no one but the federal government, through a reference to the apex court, the judgment had explained, adding that the commission must act transparently, fairly and justly, without discrimination among different political parties seeking election symbols to contest the elections to the constitutional legislatures of Pakistan, it had declared.
The alleged falsity of the certificates signed by Mr Khan and submitted to the ECP about the party funds under Article 13(2) PPO is a secondary fact, ascertainable by a competent court after ECP gives its findings whether any prohibited funding has been received and collected by the party, the judgment had commented.
Advocate Faisal Fareed cited 2018 Khawaja Mohammad Asif case in which the Supreme Court had held that an elected member could not be disqualified for life by invoking Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution unless dishonesty was established in an appropriate judicial proceedings.
Attributing dishonesty to every omission to disclose an asset and disqualify a member for life could never have been the intention of the parliament while incorporating Article 62 (1) (f) in the Constitution, the SC had observed, while setting aside the Islamabad High Court disqualification of PML-N stalwart Khawaja Asif under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution for not disclosing salary drawn from a UAE firm.
The certificates on part of Mr Khan before the ECP that no foreign funding was received by the party could have brought problems for him if he had furnished “unaudited accounts” before the ECP, according to the lawyer. Besides the affidavits were not deposited by the party head “on oath”, he said.
Intention of party head
Thus the superior courts will definitely go into the “intention of the party head” before handing down any damning penalty upon the party head, the attorney believed. Also, it would have to be established before the Supreme Court, in case any reference on part of the federal government landed into the court that the ECP decision was not biased, not based on any “political vendetta” and that the commission had not overstepped its jurisdiction.
Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar somehow agreed when he said as far as the endorsement certificate submitted by party head to the ECP was concerned, it would not have the same legal repercussion as that of an affidavit submitted in court of law.
Options in front of govt
In case the funding matter lands at the Supreme Court through a challenge to ECP’s decision, he said, the moot point before the court would be the words mentioned in law, the receipt of substantial or portion of foreign funding or the application of the Elections Act, 2017 with prospective or retrospective effect.
Section 204 of the Elections Act legally obliges a political party to provide complete information about the sources of fund to submit details of accounts to the ECP within 60 days from the close of a financial year with a consolidated statement of its accounts audited by a chartered accountant, including information of annual income and expenses, sources of its funds and assets and liabilities, with the declaration that no funds from any source prohibited under the Elections Act was received by the party.
Section 212 of the act explains that where the federal government is satisfied on the basis of a reference from ECP or information received from any other source that the political party is a foreign-aided political party or has been formed or is operating in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan or is indulging in terrorism, the government can, by a notification in the official gazette, make such declaration.
Within 15 days of making such a declaration, the government can refer the matter to the Supreme Court and if it upholds the declaration, such political party shall stand dissolved forthwith, he explained.
Section 212 of the Elections Act also speaks of legal consequences that where a political party is dissolved under Section 212, then any member of such political party, and if he is a member of the Parliament or a Provincial Assembly or a local government, will be disqualified for the remaining term to be a member parliament, provincial assembly and local government.

2,Pakistan meets final condition for release of funds: IMF,ISLAMABAD: The Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF) confirmed on Tuesday that Pakistan had completed all prior ...,"ISLAMABAD: The Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF) confirmed on Tuesday that Pakistan had completed all prior actions for the revival of its loan progra­mme but linked the approval of a $1.18 billion disbursement by its executive board later this month to confirmation of $4bn in additional inflows from Islamabad’s friendly countries.
“With the increase in PDL (petroleum development levy) on July 31, the last prior action for the combined seventh and eighth review has been met,” IMF’s Resident Representative in Islamabad Esther Perez Ruiz said, adding that the Fund’s board meeting was tentatively planned for late August “once adequate financing assurances are confirmed”.
The IMF has evaded talking about the financing gap required to be arranged through friendly countries, but Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said soon after reaching the staff-level agreement with the Fund on July 13 that the lender had estimated a $4bn financing gap for the current fiscal year that the government had pledged to arrange from a group of “friendly countries” before the close of July.
When asked on July 31, the minister said efforts were in progress and funds would be arranged in a couple of days.
Mainly because of the delay in formal commitment from those friendly countries, the exchange rate has been under continuous pressure amid declining foreign exchange reserves.
The government has been engaged with these countries at different levels over the past weeks, including through political, military and diplomatic channels, but formal announcements have not come through.
As part of the process, the government also tried to promulgate an ordinance for swift transfer of minority shares of listed state-owned entities to generate about $2bn to 2.5bn but had to take the parliamentary route instead. The relevant bill is now pending with the National Assembly for passage.
Mr Ismail and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) have been blaming the political turmoil in the country for steep currency depreciation and a bullish stock market.
The finance minister earlier announced the government had lined up $8.5bn to 10bn inflows from friendly countries against a financing gap of $4bn estimated by the IMF.
The IMF last month announced the much-awaited staff-level agreement with Pakistan with a nine-month extension in tenor and a $1bn increase in the size of the bailout package to $7bn, including upfront disbursement of about $1.18bn.
Its approval from the executive board of the IMF was, however, linked to a series of prior actions, which the government has now fulfilled over the past two weeks.
These included a revised federal budget envisaging over 2.5 per cent of GDP worth of additional taxes, signing of agreements with provinces for over Rs700bn cash surplus, hike in SBP’s policy rate, increase in power tariff, and the reviving and continuously increasing the petroleum development levy on the sale of petroleum products.
Under the staff-level agreements, authorities pledged a primary budget surplus of 0.4pc of GDP, or about Rs310bn, under the revised target given by the Fund’s team.
This meant the government would have to finance all its expenditures, excluding debt servicing, through its own revenues and yet spare about a Rs310bn buffer by making further fiscal adjustments of about Rs155bn through additional revenue measures, expenditure cuts or both.
On top of this, the IMF has also made it binding on the authorities to “stand ready to take any additional measures necessary to meet programme objectives, given the elevated uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets”.
Since then, the government has decided to impose Rs30bn in additional taxes to make up for an unseen supplementary grant required to bailout state-run Pakistan State Oil, whose more than Rs610bn are stuck with the government, its entities or private companies choked by non-payments by the public sector.
Likewise, the government also committed to ensuring the timely implementation of power tariff rebasing as already determined by the power regulator Nepra along with quarterly and monthly adjustments to rein in rising circular debt, which the IMF estimated to have increased by Rs850bn last fiscal year ending June 30. The government has now announced a schedule for a gradual power tariff increase.
The government has since also revised the petroleum development levy on petroleum products at the rate of Rs10 on petrol and Rs5 per litre on high-speed diesel, light diesel and kerosene on July 14 and these rates have now been doubled to Rs20 per litre on petrol and Rs10 per litre on three other products with effect from Aug 1 — the last prior action under the commitment.
Going forward, the authorities would improve and consolidate anti-corruption laws and efforts as committed under the original 2019 agreement and then made a structural benchmark for end-December 2021, revised to end-June 2022 in January this year by former finance minister Shaukat Tarin.
The original $6bn worth of 39-month extended fund facility (EFF) — provided to countries facing serious payment imbalances because of structural impediments or slow growth and an inherently weak balance-of-payments position — was to end in September this year, but only three tranches of about $3bn could so far be disbursed as the programme suffered repeated breakdowns.

3,How the CIA found and killed Zawahiri,"WASHINGTON: Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri had been in hiding for years, and the operation to locate and kill him...","WASHINGTON: Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri had been in hiding for years, and the operation to locate and kill him was the result of “careful patient and persistent” work by the counter-terrorism and intelligence community, a senior Biden administration official told reporters.
“Now justice has been deli­vered, and this terrorist leader is no more,” US Presi­dent Joe Biden said in televised remarks from the White House on Monday eve­ning as he announced the killing of Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in a drone strike in downtown Kabul.
“No matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out.”
The elusive 71-year-old
Al Qaeda leader had evaded US efforts to take him out for 21 years. His predecessor Osama bin Laden was killed in May 2011 in Abbottabad, a decade after the 9/11 terrorist attacks they planned and executed.
While Bin Laden was the face of Al Qaeda, Zawahiri was considered its brain,
who did most of the strategic planning for the group. US media reports claimed that Zawahiri was living in the Helmand province before he moved to Kabul after the Taliban captured the Afghan capital in August 2021. He lived in the leafy Kabul neighborhood called Sherpur.Until the US announcement, Zawahiri had been rumored variously to be in Pakistan’s tribal areas or inside Afghanistan.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official provided Reuters the following details on the operation: For several years, the U.S. government had been aware of a network that it assessed supported Zawahiri, and over the past year, following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, officials had been watching for indications of Al Qaeda’s presence in the country.
This year, officials identified that Zawahiri’s family - his wife, his daughter and her children - had relocated to a safe house in Kabul and subsequently identified Zawahiri at the same location.
Over several months, intelligence officials grew more confident that they had correctly identified Zawahiri at the Kabul safe house and in early April started briefing senior administration officials. Jake Sullivan, National Security Advisor, subsequently briefed President Joe Biden.
“We were able to build a pattern of life through multiple independent sources of information to inform the operation,” the official said.
Once Zawahiri arrived at the Kabul safe house, officials were not aware of him leaving it and they identified him on its balcony – where he was ultimately struck – on multiple occasions, the official said.
Officials investigated the construction and nature of the safe house and scrutinized its occupants to ensure the US could confidently conduct an operation to kill Zawahiri without threatening the structural integrity of the building and minimizing the risk to civilians and Zawahiri’s family, the official said.
In recent weeks, the president convened meetings with key advisors and Cabinet members to scrutinize the intelligence and evaluate the best course of action.
On July 1, Biden was briefed on a proposed operation in the White House Situation Room by members of his cabinet including CIA Director William Burns. Biden “asked detailed questions about what we knew and how we knew it” and closely examined a model of the safe house the intelligence community had built and brought to the meeting.
He asked about lighting, weather, construction materials, and other factors that could affect the success of the operation, the official said. The president also requested analysis of the potential ramifications of a strike in Kabul.
A tight circle of senior inter-agency lawyers examined the intelligence reporting and confirmed that Zawahiri was a lawful target based on his continuing leadership of Al Qaeda.
On July 25, the president convened his key Cabinet members and advisors to receive a final briefing and discuss how killing Zawahiri would affect America’s relationship with the Taliban, among other issues, the official said. After soliciting views from others in the room, Biden authorized “a precise tailored air strike” on the condition that it minimize the risk of civilian casualties.
The strike was ultimately carried out at 0148 GMT (around 6:48am Pakistan time) on July 30 by a drone firing so-called “hellfire” missiles.–Reuters
Task Force Orange
The operation that killed Ayman al-Zawahri in a posh Kabul neighbourhood was partially the work of a US military unit so clandestine that its actual name is a state secret, Vice News reported, quoting Nato officials briefed on the operation.
“It was a huge operation led by the CIA as is typically the case for something like this and everyone plays a specific role,” a senior NATO military official who works closely with the US on counterterrorism told Vice News. “But at the tip of the operation are the people who have to get actual eyes on the target, and that’s where [Task Force] Orange comes in.”
According to Vice, the unit currently known as Task Force Orange was founded in 1980 and initially called the Intelligence Support Activity, before its name became a secret and started being frequently changed.
The unit works within the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), and is charged with collecting real-time intelligence to prepare for specifically planned operations, the Vice report said.
“The CIA can tell you a lot about a country and the personalities of its government and opposition, but they’re not designed to figure out things like is there a specific person in that specific house, which way do the doors open, how high are the fences,” the NATO official said.
“That’s what Orange does to prepare for an operation, whether it’s a drone strike like with [Zawahri] or sending in a team of shooters as with [Osama] bin Laden or Baghdadi. They collect the specific details and they do it in person from close up,” the publication quoted the official as saying.

4,Six embrace martyrdom as copter wreckage found,"• Destroyed chopper’s debris found in Lasbela’s Musa Goth, says ISPR • Crash occurred due to bad weather; locals helped spot","


 
• Destroyed chopper’s debris found in Lasbela’s Musa Goth, says ISPR
• Crash occurred due to bad weather; locals helped spot wreckage at 12:30pm on Tuesday
• President, PM and others express condolences
KARACHI/QUETTA: Six Pakistan army officials, including Commander XII Corps Lt Gen Sarfraz Ali, were announced martyred after the wreckage of their helicopter, earlier reported missing since Monday night, was found on Tuesday in Musa Goth, a hilly area in Winder town of Balochistan’s Lasbela district.
In a brief statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) blamed bad weather for the crash. “The wreckage of the unfortunate helicopter, which was on flood relief operation, was found in Musa Goth, Winder, Lasbela (district). All six officers and soldiers … embraced shahadat (martyrdom),” the ISPR tweeted.
Initial investigations suggested the accident occurred due to bad weather, it said, adding that more details would follow.
Besides Lt Gen Ali, the other martyred officers included Pakistan Coast Guards Director General Brig (approved Maj Gen) Amjad Hanif; Commander Engineers XII Corps Brig Muhammad Khalid; Maj Saeed Ahmed (pilot); Maj Muhammad Talha Manan (co-pilot); and crew chief Naik Mudassir Fayyaz.
Civilian authorities depend heavily on the army during natural calamities. Fierce monsoon rains and deadly flooding have hit Pakistan hard this year, particularly in Balochistan. At least 478 people have died so far, including 136 in Balochistan.
The military reported a little before 11pm on Monday night that a helicopter carrying senior army officials had lost contact with air traffic control and gone missing in Balochistan.
Amid anxious wait and prayers from leaders of political parties to celebrities to citizens over social media, the military finally confirmed the fate of the missing chopper on Tuesday afternoon.
Rough terrain
Police officials said rescue teams struggled to locate the helicopter because the mountainous terrain didn’t even have jeep paths and the area could only be accessed by air, on foot or through motorcycles. A lack of cellular network coverage and electricity only aggravated the problem. The police had to engage local volunteers in the search operation.
The helicopter’s wreckage “was found at a place called Haji Musa Goth, which is situated over top of the mountain, some seven to eight kilometres from form the Abbas post of Sakran police,” Tariq Abul Hasan, the only journalist to reach the site, told Dawn.
The difficult terrain was hard to pass, he said. “With no road or thoroughfare for a smooth drive, no source of communication or cellular service signals, and darkness that couldn’t even allow seeing the land, it was a tough job to reach the place.”
The local people helping official teams finally spotted the wreckage at around 12:30pm on Tuesday, Mr Hasan said.
Pervez Umrani, deputy inspector general of Khuzdar Range, told Dawn the bodies of all the six officers were found near the destroyed helicopter.
Officials said the bodies were shifted to Karachi’s Malir Cantonment in the afternoon, where the funeral prayers were offered. The bodies were later dispatched to the native towns of the deceased by C-130.
Lt Gen Ali, who belonged to Lahore, is survived by a daughter and two sons. He was commissioned in the Six Azad Kashmir Regiment in March 1989.
Brig Amjad Hanif is also survived by a daughter and two sons and hailed from Rawalakot, the capital of Poonch district in Azad Kashmir. He was commissioned in the 19 Azad Kashmir Regiment in April 1994.
Brig Khalid of Faisalabad, survived by three daughters and as many sons, was commissioned in the 20 Engineer Battalion in 1994.
Maj Ahmed of Larkana is survived by a son and a daughter, Maj Manan is survived by two sons, and Naik Fayyaz of Narowal is survived by his wife.
Condolence messages pour in
The ISPR’s tweet triggered an outpouring of grief. President Dr Arif Alvi was among the first to react to the incident. He reached out to the army chief and expressed deep grief over the martyrdom of the army officers and soldiers, according to his official Twitter account.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted: “Nation is deeply grieved on the martyrdom of Lt Gen Sarfraz Ali and five other officers of Pakistan Army. They were doing a sacred duty of providing relief to flood affectees. Will remain eternally indebted to these sons of the soil. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families.”
In his tweet, PTI chairman Imran Khan called it “tragic news” and recalled his memory of knowing Lt Gen Ali.
“Tragic news about the army aviation helicopter crash and the martyrdom of all six on board. My condolences and prayers to the families of the martyrs. I had the privilege of knowing Lt Gen Sarfraz Ali, whom I found to be a thorough professional and an upright, honest human being,” he said.
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, former president Asif Ali Zardari, PML-N Leader Maryam Nawaz and many other leaders expressed their grief and sent condolence messages to the families of the martyred officers.
