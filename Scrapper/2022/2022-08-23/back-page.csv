The decision to pursue the initiative to help stabilise Afghanistan’s collapsed economy underscores growing concern in Washington over a humanitarian crisis as the United Nations warns that nearly half the country’s 40 million people face “acute hunger” as winter approaches.
At the core of the US-led effort, as Reu­ters reported last month, is a plan to transfer billions in foreign-held Afghan central bank assets into a proposed Swiss-based trust fund. Disbursements would be made with the help of an international board and bypass the Taliban, many of whose leaders are under US and UN sanctions.
The Taliban presented a counterproposal in talks in Doha in late June.

US has frozen $7bn held in Federal Reserve Bank, other countries hold around $2bn

US State Department and Treasury officials told independent analysts at an Aug 11 briefing — 12 days after a CIA drone strike killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri on a balcony of his Kabul safe house — they will pursue the talks despite frustration with the pace, two sources said on condition of anonymity.
The Taliban and Afghan central bank known by the initials DAB — are not acting swiftly, a US official said, according to one source. “The Taliban sit on their hands and it’s infuriating.”
The State Department declined to comment on the briefing. A knowledgeable US source who requested anonymity confirmed the briefing’s substance.
“The strike did not change the US government’s commitment to setting up the international trust fund” and it is “working with the same speed and alacrity as before the strike,” said the US source.
The Taliban-run foreign and information ministries and DAB did not immediately respond to requests for comment. US officials also have discussed the trust fund plan with Switzerland and other parties.
Afghanistan’s economic and humanitarian crises deepened when Washington and other donors halted aid that funded 70 per cent of the government budget following the Taliban’s seizure of Kabul on Aug 15, 2021, as the last US-led foreign troops departed after 20 years of war.
Washington also stopped flying in hard currency, effectively paralysing Afgha­nistan’s banking system, and froze $7 billion in Afghan assets in the US Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In February, Biden ordered half the sum set aside “for the benefit of the Afghan people”.
Other countries hold some $2bn of Afghan reserves.
Initially, the $3.5bn Biden sequestered would be released into the proposed trust fund and potentially could be used to pay Afghanistan’s World Bank arrears and for printing Afghanis, the national currency, and passports, both in short supply.
The other $3.5bn is being contested in lawsuits against the Taliban stemming from the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, but courts could decide to release those funds too.
The assets also eventually could go to recapitalising DAB, bolstering its ability to regulate the Afghani’s value, fight inflation, and provide hard currency for imports.
But after Zawahiri was killed, the State Department excluded recapitalising DAB as “a near-term option,” saying that by harboring the Al Qaeda leader in breach of the 2020 US troop pullout deal, the Taliban had fueled concerns “regarding diversion of funds to terrorist groups.”
Two sources quoted the US officials as telling the briefing that proceeding with the talks has become more difficult because of Taliban resistance to several internationally backed demands.
One calls for replacing the two senior militants heading DAB — one is under US and UN sanctions — with experienced professionals to help build confidence that the bank was insulated from Taliban interference.
The Taliban and DAB also have not formally agreed to installing independent anti-money laundering monitors at the bank although they have consented in principle, the officials said, according to the sources.
The officials, the sources said, presented examples of what they described as Taliban and DAB intransigence.
They included refusing to cooperate with a UN-administered scheme to funnel badly needed international aid funds held by the World Bank to humanitarian agencies in Kabul.
The officials also told the briefing that Washington in March asked other governments to encourage private banks to restore “correspondent” relationships with Afghanistan by which international transactions are facilitated, the sources said.
There “wasn’t a whole lot of appetite” for the outreach made through U.S. embassies in diplomatic notes called demarches, a US official said, according to one source. That was partly due to the absence of independent anti-money laundering monitors at DAB, the official said, according to the sources.

1,"Once a celebrity, now the face of destitution","His house, like others in his village, has been destroyed by rain, and he is living with a friend.","

BUGTI became a sensation in January when his song Kana Yaari was released, but this week the country saw a different face of the singer.—Dawn

 
QUETTA: For decades, Balochistan has been synonymous with heartbreak and destitution. Nothing good comes out of it, and even when something does happen miraculously, it remains ephemeral. The province’s multiple crises engulf everything from music, art, literature and politics, leaving behind a land haunted by its miseries.
With floods wreaking havoc across the length and breadth of the province, gut-wrenching tales of devastation, tragedy and destruction were found everywhere. Even among those tales, the story of Wahab Bugti, who was a national sensation a few months ago, broke many hearts.
When his hit song Kana Yaari on Coke Studio, released in January, Bugti, along with fellow singers Kaifi Khalil and rapper Eva B, created waves throughout the country and even beyond. The song was played over 18 million times on YouTube alone. Bugti, who was then one of the faces of music in the country, is now a picture of devastation. The flood in his native province has claimed over 216 lives.
Today, Bugti’s face is all over social media again, but not because of his hit song, but as a flood victim.
In photos shared all over social media, Bugti is seen wearing a shalwar kameez, holding his child as he stands in front of a collapsed wall and inundated fields in Dera Murad Jamali.
The floods have reportedly damaged over 30,000 houses, leaving thousands of families homeless.
Unlike other victims, Bugti’s tale managed to rattle some souls, thanks to his fame.
“Yes, many people have called me today [on Monday] after my pictures were shared on social media,” Bugti told Dawn over the phone.
“We are fine, and have moved to another place in my town. But we will move back after things become normal.”
Unlike his gloomy and hopeless expressions in the pictures, his voice appeared confident and calm.
Goth Mohammad Umar, his native village in Dera Murad Jamali, is situated at a distance of three kilometres from the main town.
While talking about torrential rains, he said his house, like others in his village, was destroyed, and he was living with a friend, away from his village, along with his children.
The father of eight children, Mr Bugti has been fond of singing since his childhood.
Talking about his musical journey, he said that he was introduced to Coke Studio by singer Xulfi.
After his pictures went viral, Xulfi wrote: “We are and will continue to be with Wahab Bugti Sahib and his loved ones to help overcome the difficult situation. Rest assured, he is being given all possible support on ground.”
Several other celebrities also took to Twitter to express solidarity with him.
While thanking them, Mr Bugti said many people have called him, and even asked him to move with them to other cities.
“But I am good here,” he said, adding that he only wants to go back to his village where his livestock and agriculture are.
Sher (lion) was the word he used before hanging up the phone. “I am a lion here. I want to be here in my village and my hometown, instead of moving to a tent,” he said.
Like Wahab Bugti, other flood-hit victims also do not want to leave their homes. However, they were compelled to migrate as help still evaded them in remote areas where access was difficult due to washing away of roads and bridges.
His concluding remarks sound like an artist or musician who attached great importance to his soil, land, and people, just like one of the verses he sang in the song Kana Yaari: “Love is for the stoics who do not fear loss.”

2,Protesting farmers return to Indian capital,Shout slogans against PM Modi for what they say are govt's unfulfilled promises.,"

NEW DELHI: Protesters broke barricades and shouted slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Indian capital of New Delhi on Monday, after thousands of farmers gathered to protest against what they said were unfulfilled promises by the government.
More than eight months after farmers called off a year-long protest and the government conceded to several of their demands, more than 5,000 farmers gathered in the centre of the capital to protest against Modi and his government.
Farmers are demanding that the government guarantee a minimum support price for all produce and clear all farmer debts, among other things, according to a statement from the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the farmer organisation that organised the protest on Monday.
A spokesperson for the federal agriculture ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Protesters wielded banners and flags and broke through barriers as they marched towards the venue, shouting slogans against Modi.
Last November, Modi said he would roll back three farm laws that had aimed to deregulate produce markets but which farmers said would allow corporations to exploit them.
The federal government also agreed to set up a panel of growers and government officials to find ways of ensuring minimum support prices (MSP), as the guaranteed rates are called, for all farm produce.
Last month, the federal government set up the panel and invited representatives of farmer organisations to join in.
Security around the borders of the national capital was tightened and police presence was heightened in and around the protest area.

3,Iran accuses US of delaying revival of nuclear deal,"""Until we agree on all issues, we cannot say that we have reached a complete agreement,"" says foreign ministry spokesperson.","DUBAI: Iran accused the United States on Monday of procrastinating in indirect talks aimed at reinstating Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal, and said a prisoner swap with Washington was not linked to the negotiations.
After 16 months of fitful, indirect US-Iran talks, with European Union officials shuttling between the sides, a senior EU official said on Aug 8 it had laid down a final offer and expected a response within a “very, very few weeks”.
Iran last week responded to the EU’s text with “additional views and considerations”, while calling on Washington to show flexibility to resolve three remaining issues.
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Monday he hoped the United States would respond positively as early as this week to the bloc’s proposal.
Tehran had given a “reasonable” response to it, he said.
Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, said Tehran wanted a sustainable deal that would preserve Tehran’s legitimate rights.
“The Americans are procrastinating and there is inaction from the European sides...America and Europe need an agreement more than Iran,” Kanaani told a news conference.
“Until we agree on all issues, we cannot say that we have reached a complete agreement.”
The United States has repeatedly called on Tehran to release several Iranian-Americans held in Iran on security charges.

4,Police arrest Indian ‘Robin Hood’,Gang leader of 25 merry men had been robbing the rich and giving some of the proceeds — but not all — to the poor.,"NEW DELHI: Police in the Indian capital Delhi said on Monday that they had arrested a “Robin Hood” gang leader of 25 merry men who robbed the rich and gave some of the proceeds — but not all — to the poor.
Wasim Akram, 27, alias Lambu (“Lofty”) and his outfit robbed “big houses in posh areas in Delhi”, stealing cash and jewellery and giving some of the loot to the financially deprived, police said.
“Due to this trait, he has got many followers in the area. These sources give him immediate information about the movement of police so as to enable him to escape,” Delhi police said in a statement on Sunday.
The “notorious absconding history sheeter” — an Indian English term meaning a habitual criminal — would frequently change his hideouts across several Indian states, the statement said.
With 160 crimes allegedly to his name, including robberies, attempted murder and rape, a special cell on Akram’s tail for the past four months finally caught him on Friday.
“A team led by (Inspector) Shiv Kumar was formed and a trap was laid near Anand Vihar railway station from where Wasim was nabbed,” the police statement said.
“A single shot pistol with 3 live cartridges was recovered from his possession at the time of apprehension,” it said.

5,"Nearly 9,000 Ukrainian troops killed since Russian invasion",EU mulls military training for Ukrainian forces.,"KYIV: Nearly 9,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded, the country’s top military officer said on Monday, two days before the country’s independence anniversary.
Ukraine’s Commander-in-ChiefGeneral Valeriy Zaluzhny said Ukraine’s children needed particular attention “because their fathers have gone to the front and are maybe among the nearly 9,000 heroes who have been killed”.
Zaluzhny’s comments on the Ukrainian death toll, reported by Interfax-Ukraine news agency, was the first indication of Kyiv’s military losses since April.
On Wednesday, Ukraine will mark its independence day — and six months since Russian troops invaded.

EU mulls military training for Ukrainian forces

After Ukrainian resistance thwarted an early Russian push on the capital Kyiv, Moscow’s forces have focussed on gaining ground in the east of the country.
The shockwaves of the war are being felt around the world with soaring energy prices and food shortages.

The European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, meanwhile, told reporters in Spain that the EU was considering military training for Ukraine’s forces.
In Spain, Borrell told reporters that EU defence ministers would next week discuss launching a major training operation for Ukrainian forces in nearby countries.
“It seems reasonable that a war that looks set to last requires an effort not only in terms of supplies of material,” Borrell said.
EU defence ministers have a two-day meeting in Prague from next Monday.
