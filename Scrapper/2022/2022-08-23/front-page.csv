ISLAMABAD / QUETTA/ PESHAWAR: As heavy monsoon rains and flooding continued to cause widespread damage to areas across the country, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Monday declared a state of emergency in four districts, relief goods were airdropped in Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur districts of Punjab, dozens of families were shifted to tents in Gilgit-Baltistan after their villages were destroyed and efforts still under way to restore the National Highway link between Punjab and Balochistan.
The KP government dec­l­a­­red a state of emergency in Dera Ismail Khan, Upper and Lower Chitral and Upper Kohistan districts, while glacier melting in Gil­git-Baltistan wreaked havoc on Hoper Valley and Nagar Khas where flooding was­h­ed away small villages of Sha­man and Tokerkot rendering around 50 families homeless.
While taking stock of the deteriorating situation and reviewing relief measures in the flood-affected areas at two separate meetings, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the federal government decided to hold a donors’ conference to apprise international institutions about the devastation caused by floods as well as the ongoing relief and rehabilitation efforts by the federal and provincial governments.
Editorial: Rain d]isaster
The meeting regarding donors’ conference was att­ended by Minister for Plan­ning and Development Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Information and Broad­casting Marriyum Aurang­zeb, Minister for Climate Cha­nge Sherry Rehman, Adv­iser to PM Ahad Che­e­ma, Member of the Punjab Assembly Awais Leghari, National Disaster Manage­ment Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt-Gen Akhtar Nawaz.
The prime minister ordered immediate provision of 40,000 tents and 100,000 ration packets to the flood-hot people and take measures for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of flood-hit areas. He also appealed the philanthropists to generously contribute to the PM’s Flood Relief Fund.
While an aerial operation for the supply of relief goods to the flood-affected areas of Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur districts was launched later in the day, high floods in the Indus River is expected to rise further due to Taunsa hill torrents, threatening the already battered areas of the two districts.
Also, as two primary schools near Lundi Pittafi in Muzaffargarh washed away by flooding, the district administration asked people to evacuate the Lundi Pittafi, Jhuggi Wala and Araien villages, alerting them that water flow in the Indus was more than 500,000 cusec. The administration believed the level would not start receding before August 26.
DG Khan Commissioner Mohammad Usman Anwar said relief supplies were being delivered by helicopter spared by the government for the purpose. Besides the choppers, ration, medicines and tents were being sent to the tribal area of Suleman Range through the Border Military Police and Baloch Levis, who were using camels, motorcycles and other vehicles, he said.
The commissioner said traffic on the Dera-Quetta highway — a vital trade route between Punjab and Balochistan — was still suspended due to a landslide though the National Highway Aurthority was working on it.
In Balochistan, heavy rains badly affected Quetta, Sohbatpur, Musakhail, Duki, Dera Bugti, Chaman and Loralai districts where scores of human settlements were destroyed. Hundreds of flood victims were shifted to tents and government buildings in different areas.
Corps Commander Lt-Gen Asif Ghafoor along with IG Frontier Corps (North) Major General Ameer Ajmal, Provincial Disaster Management Authority director general, Quetta division commissioner and deputy commissioner visited the flood-affected areas, including Hazara Town, and other localities which were badly affected due to hill torrents after heavy rains. Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa had earlier directed the corps commander to assist the provincial administration in rescue, relief and rehabilitation of the flood-stricken people.
Officials said flash floods and hill torrents were wreaking havoc on Nasirabad, Jaffarabad and Jhal Magsi districts as Lehri and Mula Rivers were carrying heavy flood after more heavy rains in their hilly catchment areas of Dera Bugti, Khuzdar and other areas.
Editorial: Monsoon misery
In Nasirabad district, the Pat Feeder Canal was breached at different points inundating many villages in Sohbatpur and Nasirabad districts. The floodwater was putting pressure towards Dera Murad Jamali town, which is the divisional headquarters of Nasirabad districts and authorities were making all-out efforts to save Dera Murad Jamali as heavy floodwaters threatened to submerge the town.
Meanwhile, the KP relief, rehabilitation and settlement department issued four separate notifications announcing the imposition of emergency in four affected districts.
According to the notifications, upon the requests of the district administration and recommendations of the PDMA, the competent authority declared emergency to the extent of flood/rain affected areas of Lower and Upper Chitral, Dera Ismail Khan and Upper Kohistan districts till August 30 for carrying out relief activities.
An official statement issued here said the notifications were issued on the special directives of the KP chief minister Mahmood Khan, who would soon visit the flood-hit districts to look into the damages caused by flash floods. It said the CM would also announce a relief package for the rehabilitation of flood-affected infrastructure in the districts.
Mr Khan said he was monitoring the flood situation and was in contact with concerned district administrations. He said the district administrations had been asked to submit assessment reports of damages.
In Bajaur, two children were killed after their house collapsed due to heavy rains in Nawagai tehsil, Rescue 1122 officials and residents said. Residents told Dawn that two children of Abdul Khaliq, identified as Eman Khan, 8, and Yasra Bibi, 6, who were sleeping in the room, died on the spot.
Soon after the mishap, people of the nearby areas reached the site of incident to retrieve the bodies of victims from the debris. A team of Rescue 1112 workers also moved the area to help the residents in retrieving the bodies, said a statement issued on Monday.
Donors’ conference
Meanwhile, the government decided to hold a donors’ conference for the rehabilitation of flood affected areas of the country, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered to provide 40,000 tents and 100,000 ration packets to the flood-hot people and said international institutions should be briefed about the devastation caused by floods as well as the ongoing relief and rehabilitation efforts.
He also appealed to the philanthropists to generously contribute to the PM’s Flood Relief Fund and directed the institutions concerned to speed up the rescue operation, and relief and rehabilitation process.
At a separate meeting, the prime minister was apprised by Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qaddus Bizenjo, about the flood situation in the province as well as damages it caused and the ongoing rescue and relief operation.

1,Imran granted protective bail in terror case,IHC constitutes larger bench for his ‘contempt’ trial,"

ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan was granted protective bail for three days in a terrorism case, after the Islamabad High Court (IHC) overruled the registrar office’s objections to his pre-arrest bail on Monday.
However, the IHC taking strong exception to uncharitable outburst of Mr Khan against a female judge decided to initiate contempt of court proceedings against him and constituted a larger bench to hear the matter.
The Supreme Court Bar Assoc­i­a­tion (SCBA) welcomed the decision about contempt proceedings against the PTI chief, pointing out that the legal fraternity could not close the eyes to the “malicious act” that undermined the dignity and prestige of judiciary.
For the contempt proceedings, the larger bench comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kay­ani, Justice Miangul Hassan Aur­ang­zeb and Justice Babar Sattar was constituted only a day after the former prime minister had been booked under terrorism charges for ‘threatening’ a female judge and top police officers.

IHC constitutes larger bench for his ‘contempt’ trial

On Monday, the IHC registrar, Farhan Aziz Khawaja, put up a note regarding the ‘threatening’ remarks of Mr Khan before acting chief justice of the IHC Aamer Farooq and annexed new­spapers clippings of his speech.
Justice Farooq as well as other judges of the high court delibera­ted upon the matter, sources said, adding that the decision was taken unanimously to initiate con­t­empt proceedings against him.
Addressing a crowd in the federal capital on Saturday evening, Mr Khan had threatened to file cases against Islamabad inspector general of police and deputy inspector general of police and declared: “We won’t spare you.”
The PTI chief then warned the judiciary against its ‘biased’ attitude towards the party and said it should brace itself for consequences. He warned Judge Zeba Chaudhry, who had recently approved remand of Mr Khan’s close aide Shahbaz Gill on police request, that she would also face ‘dire consequences’.
An FIR was registered at the Margalla police station the next day on a complaint of a judicial magistrate, Ali Javed, under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. The FIR also reproduced the Mr Khan’s remarks about the female judge and Islamabad police officials. It was pleaded in the FIR that the public address was meant to ‘terrorise’ top police officials and the judiciary so that they do not perform their functions and abstain from pursuing any action against PTI leaders if required to do so.
Protective bail
On Monday, the ex-premier was granted protective bail in the terrorism case.
While the registrar office earlier objected that Mr Khan did not complete the mandatory requirement of biometric verification at the time of filing of the petition, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani overruled the objection and converted his pre-arrest bail plea into protective bail petition.
The PTI chief was then granted protective bail for three days with the direction to seek bail from the sessions court before the expiry of three-day period.
SCBA’s reaction
SCBA President Ahsan Bhoon welcomed the IHC’s decision of initiating the contempt proceeding.
As per the SCBA statement, Mr Bhoon “lambasted the way in which the name of female ADSJ was hurled publicly”.
He said, “It was not only offensive and derogatory but also undermined the dignity and prestige of the entire judicial system.” Mr Khan’s conduct “exposed how much he cares about the respect and reverence of honorable judges”, the SCBA president stated, adding that the legal fraternity “cannot turn a blind eye towards such malicious act, which undermines the dignity, decorum and prestige of judiciary.”
The SCBA demanded that the IHC “take strict cognizance against those found involved in such contemptuous act with iron-fist so that no one dare to indulge in such malicious act ever again.”

2,All roads lead to Banigala,"Throughout Sunday night, large number of party leaders and followers remained camped outside Imran's hilltop residence.","ISLAMABAD: Banigala — the residence of former prime minister Imran Khan — remained a hotbed of political activity on Monday as hundreds of supporters answered the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief’s call, a day after he was booked by the government in a terrorism case.
The political drama was not just limited to Banigala, as protests in support of Mr Khan erupted across Pakistan, with people coming out in Lahore, Faisalabad, and Karachi among other cities, following rumours of Mr Khan’s imminent arrest.
In fact, the United States — a country Imran Khan blames for his removal from power — also witnessed an impromptu demonstration in Virginia, where a bridal party turned into a PTI corner meeting on the back of these rumours. The protest was prompted by the “social media reports” of Mr Khan’s arrest continued for an hour, amid slogans against the Pakistani government.
The seeds of a large gathering were sown on Sunday night when a large crowd gathered outside the residence of Imran Khan, amid speculations that a heavy contingent of Islamabad police was coming to detain the PTI chairman.
Throughout the night, a large number of party leaders and followers remained camped outside the hilltop residence. Videos shared on social media showed protesters chanting slogans in favour of the PTI chairman and vowing to resist any government’s move to arrest Mr Khan.
Besides the on-ground presence, PTI supporters also dominated online spaces as pro-Imran Khan hashtags, including ‘Imran Khan is our red line’ trended through the night into Monday morning.
However, by Monday afternoon, things had started to calm down; the heavy contingent of police was withdrawn and the PTI chief was granted bail by the high court. The Islamabad police also clarified that the personnel present outside the ex-PM’s residence were there to avert a possible “law and order situation” due to the presence of a large number of PTI supporters outside Mr Khan’s house, and had no designs on the former PM.
By Monday afternoon, only a couple of hundred party supporters were left in the surroundings of Imran Khan’s residence, staying on to “protect” him from the police and the government. Emotions ran high among the supporters of Mr Khan, who had gathered in small groups on the route leading to his house – performing duties as Mr Khan’s security staff and expressing support for their embattled leader.
They lacked discipline, however, and seemed to enjoy “their monopoly” as protectors of Imran Khan. One of the protesters said they had been “present outside Banigala since last night” and that they “would not let the police touch Imran Khan”.
By evening, there was no police contingent outside Mr Khan’s Ban­i­gala estate though; only a handful of policemen were present at the main check post on the road leading towards the residence of Imran Khan and they hardly bothered with stopping anyone.
The next checkpost, blocked by a barrier, was managed by supporters of Mr Khan, who were diligently performing their duties despite the sweltering heat. On both sides of the barrier, media personnel and party supporters, including women, were present.
No one was allowed to access Mr Khan’s residence – at least one km from this point – without the permission of these volunteers who had come to provide security to Mr Khan.
Those whose names had been communicated ‘from inside’ were allowed to pass through this barricade. But for Mr Khan’s supporters and most media personnel, the barrier was the end of the line.
Journalists who managed to reach the front gate of Mr Khan’s residence saw that at least a dozen supporters were there as well, chanting slogans against the “imported government” in chorus.
Photos circulating on social media showed that the leader had not limited himself to meeting political delegations within the confines of his home, but had also popped out to wave to his supporters who had gathered on the other side of the iron gate.

3,Hike in power bills draws PM’s ire ahead of Qatar trip,ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday took strict notice of public complaints about inflated ...,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday took strict notice of public complaints about inflated electricity bills and directed authorities concerned to submit an urgent report on the matter.
“Khadim-i-Pakistan is ans­werable to his people for resolution of their grievan­ces. I am committed to tell­ing truth to my people,” the PM was quoted as telling participants of the meeting.
Mr Sharif took the notice after people in several parts of the country started taking to streets to protest against the federal government’s approval of massive increase in power charges which led to inflated power bills for both domestic and industrial power consumers.
Last week, farmers from several villages in Punjab blocked motorways for hours, chanting slogans against the federal government and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco) for massive increase in electricity charges.
The protesters were carrying electricity bills, demanding the government to issue bills according to units they had consumed.
Last month, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) allowed distribution companies to charge an additional Rs155 billion to compensate for the higher fuel generation cost in June.
The authority allowed an unprecedented fuel cost adjustments (FCA) of Rs11.37 to Karachi power utility K-Electric and Rs9.89 per unit to electricity distribution companies previously owned by Wapda, or Discos.
Earlier, the government had also announced an increase of Rs7.91 per unit in the average base tariff across the country in three phases starting with effect from July. It had approved Rs1.55 per unit increase in the base tariff across the country under a quarterly adjustment.
The huge increase of Rs7.91 per unit in power charges, which raised the national average electricity tariff up to Rs24.82 per unit from the existing Rs16.91, from July, was just one of several unpopular decisions the government has taken to obtain dollars from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral and bilateral creditors.
Other government decisions include reversal of unsustainable fuel subsidies and imposition of massive taxes in the budget.
Visit to Qatar
Meanwhile, the prime minister would travel to Qatar on Tuesday for a two-day visit to boost up trade and energy cooperation while Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has postponed his trip to four European countries because of rains and floods in the country.
The Foreign Office said that PM Sharif would visit Doha from Aug 23 to 24 on the invitation of Amir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.
This would be Mr Sharif’s first visit to Qatar since assuming office in April.
In his meetings with Qatari leaders, the prime minister will review the entire spectrum of bilateral relations, with a particular focus on advancing energy-related cooperation, deepening trade and investment ties, and exploring greater employment opportunities for Pakistanis in Qatar, the FO said.
“They will also exchange views on a range of regional and international issues of mutual interest,” it added.
Ahead of Mr Sharif’s visit, Bloomberg reported that Qatar had agreed to provide $2 billion in bilateral support to save Pakistan from default. It is part of $4 billion that the government is expecting to get from its Arab friends.
The remaining $2 billion are likely to be provided by Saudi Arabia and UAE.
It is not clear if the Qatari government will formally announce this support during Mr Sharif’s visit or would do it later.
The prime minister will also visit Stadium 974 in Doha, where he would be briefed on extensive preparations undertaken by Qatar government for hosting the FIFA World Cup.
Pakistan Army will provide security at FIFA World Cup being hosted by Qatar in November and December.
The federal cabinet on Monday approved the agreement between Government of Qatar and Pakistan Army for the security of World Cup matches and participants.
The FO said that PM Sharif’s visit to Qatar would give a renewed impetus to deepening cooperation between the two countries in diverse fields and further strengthen their growing economic partnership.

4,Gill handed back to police for 48 hours,"Pistol, satellite phone, among items seized during late-night search; echoes Imran’s claim that he was ‘sexually assaulted’","

MR Gill is escorted by police after his court appearance.—Tanveer Shahzad

 
ISLAMABAD: Imran Khan’s chief of staff Shahbaz Gill was shifted to a police installation for further interrogation after he was handed over to police custody on a two-day physical remand.
Judicial Magistrate Islamabad West Malak Aman gave Mr Gill into police custody, with the condition that he be medically examined before and after the remand period.
A report by a medical board formed to examine Mr Gill, dated August 21, stated that the patient had mild intermittent bronchial asthma, with no signs of exacerbation. “At the moment he is clinically stable on inhalers and nebulisation,” it added.
During Monday’s proceedings, while a special prosecutor argued for a two-day remand, the defence counsel said since the period of 14 days, provided under the law, had already expired, further physical custody should not be granted. After hearing arguments from both sides, the magistrate ordered: “The time for physical remand would start when the custody of accused would be given to investigation officer for interrogation and recovery and by no stretch of imagination the time spent by accused in hospital can be considered as a time of physical remand therefore, request of learned counsel for accused is hereby turned down.”

Pistol, satellite phone, among items seized during late-night search; echoes Imran’s claim that he was ‘sexually assaulted’

After taking custody of the suspect, police shifted him to the CIA centre for interrogation, sources said, adding that devices including one of his mobile phones, a laptop and a USB had been recovered from him.
Editorial: Pawn sacrifice
In a late-night raid, the Islamabad police searched Mr Gill’s residence at Parliament Lodges in his presence and took some of his belongings in custody, TV channels reported.
Footage showed police took him with them during the search. They seized a pistol, a satellite phone, wallets, ATM cards and some other documents from his residence.
Mr Gill, who was handcuffed, managed to speak to some media persons during the raid and claimed the weapon did not belong to him. It might be his security guard’s pistol or someone intentionally placed it there, he said.
He told the media his driver and a servant had also been living with him but someone else had also access to his lodge, because many of things were out of their place. “For example my wallet was not in my room. It was in my car, and I don’t know that how it came to the bedside table,” he said.
Asked if it was true what Mr Khan had said about sexual assault in custody, he said: “Yes this is true.”
According to the TV channels, police later took him to Punjab House where he used to keep one room.

6,Govt passes ordinance to reverse taxes from last budget,"Tax rates on tobacco sector raised to collect Rs18bn; passenger, goods transport vehicles made capital value tax-exempt.","• Tax rates on tobacco sector raised to collect additional Rs18bn
• Passenger, goods transport vehicles made capital value tax-exempt
• Sales tax exemption on natural gas subsidy restored
ISLAMABAD: While withdrawing the budgetary fixed tax scheme for traders, the government on Monday increased tax rates to collect additional Rs18 billion from tobacco sector to meet lateral demand of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) before it clears Pakistan’s bailout package on August 29.
Through the Tax Laws (second amendment) Ordinance 2022, issued on Monday, the government has also reversed several revenue measures announced in the last budget in a bid to facilitate different sectors and taxpayers and comply with some international obligations.
In the budget 2022, the government had introduced the fixed tax scheme for retailers (other than tier-I retailers) on commercial electricity connection with an aim to collect Rs42bn alone from these documentation measures. However, the FBR has now withdrawn fixed tax scheme retrospectively from July 1 this year.
The previous tax regime for retailers, which was prevailing prior to the Finance Act, 2022, has now been restored.
Through the ordinance, federal government has been empowered to make any future scheme and determine its modalities, including tax rate or amount and the date when it will be implemented for retailers to collect tax on commercial connections.
Till the new scheme is announced by the federal government, the previous regime prior to the Finance Act will remain in force. The ECC in its next meeting will approve the new scheme with new rates to charge variable taxes to traders to collect Rs27bn from the retail sector as committed with the IMF.
To compensate the revenue loss from the scheme from traders, the government has increased federal excise duty (FED) on un-manufactured tobacco to Rs390 per kg from Rs10. This will hit the poor farmers of tobacco.
At the same time, government raised FED on Tier-1 cigarettes to Rs6,500 from Rs5,900 per 1,000 sticks and that on Tier-2 to Rs2050 from Rs1850.
Through the ordinance, the government did take measures to remove difficulties of taxpayers and corrective measures were also taken to rationalise certain taxes and rates. As per the ordinance, advance tax rates on passenger transport vehicles have been rationalised. The government exe­mpted vehicles of passenger and goods transport and of foreign diplomats and missions from capital value tax (CVT).
In the budget, the government had introduced CVT on all types of motor vehicles either having engine capacity exceeding 1,300cc or 50kWh in case of electric vehicles. The government restored exemption, retrospective from July 1, on allowance and perquisite paid or allowed outside Pakistan by the government to its citizens for services rendered outside the country. This was withdrawn through the Finance Act 2022.
At the same time, the government restored exemption from July 1 on the income derived by Kuwait Foreign Trading Contracting and Investment Company or Kuwait Investment Authority being dividend of Pak-Kuwait Investment Company in Pakistan as per sovereign agreement.
The government restored sales tax exemption on subsidy provided by the federal or a provincial government on natural gas to consumers, including RLNG under the Sales Tax Act 1990. The government also restored sales tax exemption from July 1 on local supply of single cylinder agriculture diesel engines of three to 36 HP. This exemption was withdrawn vide Finance Supplementary Act 2022.
Pakistan has completed all conditions and prior actions required by the IMF under the 7th and 8th reviews for the disbursement of $1.18bn and complied with an additional funding arrangement of $4bn from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and re-rolling of payable debt by China.
