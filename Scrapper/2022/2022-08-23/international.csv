0,First Palestinians to use an Israeli airport land in Cyprus,"Palestinians from areas Israel occupied in the 1967 war cannot fly from Ben Gurion, near Tel Aviv, without special permission.","JERUSALEM: A group of Palestinian passengers flew to Cyprus from an Israeli airport on Monday, but the flight was not organised under a promised arrangement easing travel restrictions for residents of the occupied West Bank, an airports authority spokesperson said. 
Israeli authorities agreed earlier this month, following pressure from the United States, to ease some of the strict travel restrictions which prevent Palestinians from using Israeli airports _ including Ben Gurion, Israel’s main international hub _ without special permission. 
Israel’s airports authority said on Aug 9 it would allow special flights from Ramon Airport, near the Red Sea resort of Eilat, to take Palestinian passengers to some destinations in Turkey. 
The programme had been due to start this month, but was delayed for unspecified reasons by the airport authority, according to a statement on Sunday. 
The change came amid continuing tensions on the West Bank where Israeli troops have conducted near daily operations against groups it sees as hostile and clashed repeatedly with Palestinian protesters. 
An airports authority spokesperson said the Palestinian passengers departing from Ramon Airport for Cyprus on Monday were not part of the programme, but were leaving under a separate arrangement. 
“It’s a regular scheduled flight. I’m not checking who the passengers are on a scheduled flight,” the spokesperson said, referring any further questions to the carrier, Arkia Israeli Airlines. 
Amir Assi, a strategic consultant to Arkia, described it as a “private” initiative coordinated with Palestinian and Israeli authorities. 
The travellers — from the cities of Bethlehem, Hebron, Nablus and Jericho — gathered at Meitar checkpoint in the southern part of the West Bank and were taken directly to the airport, he said. 
Assi said he had previously organised similar trips for Palestinian passport holders out of Ben Gurion Airport. 
Palestinians from areas Israel occupied in the 1967 war cannot fly from Ben Gurion, near Tel Aviv, without special permission. They typically travel to Jordan to catch international flights, a trip that entails crossing checkpoints and can take hours. 
Ramon Airport, which opened in 2019, is about 300 km from Jerusalem and designed to take any planes rerouted from Ben Gurion.

1,Russia blames Ukraine for killing of Putin ally’s daughter,Ukraine has denied involvement in the fatal attack.,"Moscow: Russia’s Federal Security Service on Monday accused Ukraine’s secret services of killing Darya Dugina, the daughter of a Russian ultra-nationalist, in a car bomb attack near Moscow.
Dugina, whose father Alexander Dugin is considered close to President Putin, was killed on Saturday evening when a bomb blew up the Toyota Land Cruiser that she was driving, Russian investigators said.
Ukraine, which is defending itself from what it says is an imperial-style war of conquest mounted by Russia, has denied involvement in the fatal attack. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a  “special military operation”.
Alexander Dugin, 60, has advocated violence to achieve the unification of Russian-speaking and other territories in a new Russian empire. Darya, who appeared regularly on state TV, was a strong supporter of Russia’s actions in Ukraine.
In his first public statement on his daughter’s death, he said Darya had been savagely killed before his own eyes by Ukraine.
“Our hearts are not simply thirsting for revenge or retribution,” Dugin wrote.  “We only need our victory (against Ukraine). My daughter has sacrificed her young life on the altar of victory. So please win!”  The FSB security service was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying the attack on Dugina was carried out by a Ukrainian woman born in 1979, whom it named and whose picture and personal information appeared on Russian news websites.
The websites linked her to Ukraine’s security services and accused her of being a member of the Azov battalion, a unit of Ukra­ine’s army that Russia has designated a terrorist group.
The woman and her teenage daughter had arrived in Russia in July and spent a month preparing the attack by renting an apartment in the same housing block as Dugina, the FSB was quoted as saying.
It said she had driven a Mini Cooper around Moscow which she used to spy on Dugina and for which she had three different sets of licence plates to avoid detection.
She had attended an event outside Moscow on Saturday evening which Dugina and her father were also at, before carrying out a  “controlled explosion” of Dugina’s car. She fled Russia to Estonia in the same Mini Cooper, the FSB was quoted as saying.
There was no immediate response from Ukraine to the FSB statement.
Russian law enforcement agencies had placed the Ukrainian woman on the country’s wanted list, the TASS news agency reported, with Moscow seeking her extradition from Estonia.
Estonia’s foreign ministry declined to comment and there was no immediate comment from Estonia’s interior ministry or police and border guard service.
President Vladimir Putin paid tribute to Dugina as a Russian patriot, while Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the Kremlin-backed RT media organisation, suggested Russian agents could track the woman down in Estonia.
“Estonia, of course will not give them away,” Simonyan wrote on Telegram.
“I think we have professionals who want to admire the spires in the vicinity of Tallinn,” she added, an apparent reference to a 2018 attack in England on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal which Britain said Moscow was behind.
A memorial service for Dugina would be held on Tuesday at Moscow’s TV centre, her father said.

2,Rhinos still  in danger despite decline in poaching,GENEVA: Poaching and the illegal trade in horns have fallen in recent years but remain grave threats for the...,"GENEVA: Poaching and the illegal trade in horns have fallen in recent years but remain grave threats for the rhino’s survival, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said on Monday.
The Switzerland-based body said 2,707 rhinos were poached in Africa between 2018 and 2021, of which 90 percent were killed in South Africa, mainly in the Kruger National Park. South Africa is home to nearly 80 percent of the world’s rhinos.
“Rhino poaching rates in Africa have continued to decline from a peak of 5.3 percent of the total population in 2015 to 2.3 percent in 2021,” it said in a report.
“The overall decline in poaching of rhinos is encouraging, yet this remains an acute threat to the survival of these iconic animals,” said Sam Ferreira, Scientific Officer with the IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group. 
The IUCN said 2020 was an abnormal year for rhino poaching with Covid confinement and curbs on trade and movement.
“Global lockdowns and restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic saw several African countries experience dramatically reduced poaching rates in 2020 compared to previous years.
“South Africa lost 394 rhinos to poaching in 2020, while Kenya recorded no rhino poaching that year. However, as Covid-19 travel restrictions lifted, some range states reported new increases in poaching activities — for example, South Africa reported 451 and Kenya six poached rhinos in 2021,” it said.
“These numbers are still significantly lower than during the peak in 2015, when South Africa alone lost 1175 rhinos to poaching.” 
The population of rhinos in Africa has fallen by 1.6 percent annually, from 23,562 in 2018 to 22,137 at the end of last year.

3,A viral meme’s humble origin story,"The internet has recently been inundated with a photo of a girl speaking intently to her, rather indifferent, male...","The internet has recently been inundated with a photo of a girl speaking intently to her, rather indifferent, male companion. The viral ‘Girl Explaining’ meme has now been used by a multitude of people to voice their opinion on assorted issues — from a Star Trek series to climate change. 
But the girl in the picture, Denise Sanchez, had no intention of taking social media by storm.  The image, she told the Washington Post in a recent interview, was taken in 2018, when she was attending a New Year’s Eve music festival in her native country, Argentina.
She was talking to her now ex-boyfriend when she was captured in the background of someone else’s picture, The Post reported.
Refuting the popular perception about the meme that Ms Sanches was shouting in a void, the report stated that she was actually singing along to a song. 
However, this was not the first time Ms Sanchez has gone viral. The same image was widely circulated in 2019 as well, for the same reasons. 
“The meme was born when the photo’s actual subject posted it on social media two months after it was clicked,” Mr Sanchez told the Post, adding that they had captioned it: ‘When strangers mess up your photos’.
Later, an eager social media user cropped the duo from the background, giving Ms Sanchez her first shot at fame.
The resurgence of the meme came around Aug 15, when a Twitter user shared it with a message about the incompatibility between Geminis and Scorpios, The Post reported while quoting Know Your Meme.

4,"Anthony Fauci, face of US Covid fight, to step down in December",Says he now intends to “pursue the next chapter of my career” .,"WASHINGTON: Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert who became the face of America’s fight against Covid-19, announced on Monday that he will leave government service after more than 50 years in December, stepping down as adviser to President Joe Biden.
In the chaotic early days of the pandemic, Fauci became the nation’s most trusted expert on Covid — but his clashes with former president Donald Trump over the virus response drew anger from the right, and he now lives with security protection following death threats against his family.
The 81-year-old, who has served under seven presidents beginning with Ronald Reagan, said in a statement he would be leaving both his position as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and that of chief medical adviser to Biden.
But he added:  “I am not retiring.” Instead Fauci, who had said he would leave by the end of Biden’s current term, said he now intended to  “pursue the next chapter of my career.” 
Biden extended his  “deepest thanks” to Fauci in a White House statement, adding that the country is  “is stronger, more resilient, and healthier because of him.” Fauci has helmed the United States’ response to infectious disease outbreaks since the 1980s, from HIV/AIDS to Covid-19.
When Covid first spread globally from China in 2020, he became a credible source of reliable information, reassuring the public with his calm and professorial demeanor during frequent media appearances.
His straight-talking approach won him legions of fans, who bought T-shirts and bobbleheads in his likeness and made cocktails named after him.
But his honest takes on America’s early failures to get to grips with the virus brought Fauci into conflict with Trump. 
The White House at one point barred him from doing TV interviews and launched a media blitz against him.
The clash helped turn him into a hate figure for many on the right -- already incensed by the pandemic protections Fauci was advocating, from masks and vaccines to school and business closures.
Earlier this year, Fauci recounted  “threats upon my life, harassment of my family, and my children with obscene phone calls.” 
This month a West Virginia man was sentenced to three years in prison for threatening to drag Fauci and his family into the street and beat them to death.
But despite the threats, Fauci has been conciliatory towards Trump in recent interviews, telling Politico last year that they developed  “an interesting relationship.” 
It was not the first time he has faced criticism and clashes. In the 1980s he became a lightning rod for accusations the government was not doing enough to stem the rise of HIV/AIDS — but he later forged a close collaboration with activists.
His accomplishments include implementing a fast-track system that widened access to antiretroviral medicines, and working with former president George H.W. Bush to plow in more resources.
Later, under president George W. Bush, Fauci was the architect of the President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), credited with saving millions of lives in sub-Saharan Africa.
As a scientist, he is credited with developing effective treatments for formerly fatal inflammatory diseases, as well as for contributions into understanding how HIV destroys the body’s defenses.
Despite his many duties, he had continued to treat patients at the NIH’s Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. It was not clear if that was part of his plans going forward. Biden said that after winning the 2020 election, as he was trying to build a team to lead the Covid-19 response, 
Fauci was  “one of my first calls.”  “In that role, I’ve been able to call him at any hour of the day for his advice as we’ve tackled this once-in-a-generation pandemic,” the president stated. Fauci said it had been the  “honor of a lifetime” to lead the NIAID, which he has done since 1984.
He did not spell out what he will do next, but said he wants to inspire and mentor the next generation, citing the  “energy and passion” he still has for the field despite his decades of service. “I am proud to have been part of this important work,” he said.

The latest monthly analysis by the European Union’s Global Drought Observatory (GDO) highlighted the risk of ongoing soil dryness caused by successive heatwaves since May and a  “persistent lack” of rainfall.
It maintained its warning issued with the previous report that nearly half of the EU’s territory is at risk of drought, and noted that shrivelling rivers and shrinking water sources are impacting energy generation at power plants and reducing crops.
“The severe drought affecting many regions of Europe since the beginning of the year has been further expanding and worsening as of early August,” said the report, published by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre.
Increasing  “drought hazard” was predicted for big chunks of Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, Romania and Hungary, as well as non-EU countries Britain, Serbia, Ukraine and Moldova. In all, it calculated that 17 percent of Europe was now in its red-alert category, higher than the 11 percent given in July.
“Recent precipitation (mid-August) may have alleviated drought conditions in some regions of Europe. However, in some areas, associated thunderstorms caused damages, losses, and may have limited the beneficial effects of precipitation,” it said.
Mediterranean parts of the EU should expect  “warmer and drier than usual conditions” up to November, it said.
Regions hit with rain  “anomalies” in the past three months included parts of Portugal, Spain, southern France, central Italy, Switzerland, southern Germany and much of Ukraine.
The GDO report said that normal levels of rain were likely to now come to parts of Europe between 
August and October but they  “may not be enough to fully recover from the deficit cumulated in more than half a year”.

6,Odinga challenges ‘criminality’ of election result in court,NAIROBI: Veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga on Monday challenged Kenya’s presidential election results in the...,"NAIROBI: Veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga on Monday challenged Kenya’s presidential election results in the Supreme Court and alleged the tally had involved  “criminality”, sharpening a political contest gripping East Africa’s powerhouse.
In the petition, Odinga asks the court to nullify the vote’s outcome on several grounds, including a mismatch between the turnout figures and the result, and alleges the election commission failed to tally ballots from 27 constituencies, rendering the result unverifiable and unaccountable.
“We have enough evidence to prove all of the criminality that occurred,” Odinga told a news conference after the filing.  “We are confident that in the end, the truth will be revealed.”  This is Odinga’s fifth stab at the presidency; he blamed several previous losses on rigging. Those disputes triggered violence that claimed more than 100 lives in 2017 and more than 1,200 lives in 2007.
Last week the election commissioner declared Odinga’s rival, Deputy President William Ruto, had won the Aug. 9 election by a slim margin, but four out of seven election commissioners dissented, saying the tallying of results had not been transparent. The commission, its chairman and Ruto have four days to respond to Odinga’s claims through court filings.
Last week Odinga said the results were a  “travesty” but said he would settle the dispute in court and urged supporters to remain peaceful. His supporters have said the results were the outcome of intentional fraud by election authorities. The election commission has denied any wrongdoing.
In 2017, the Supreme Court overturned the election result and ordered a re-run, which Odinga boycotted, saying he had no faith in the election commission.
This time, Odinga is backed by the political establishment. President Uhuru Kenyatta endorsed Odinga’s candidacy after falling out with Ruto after the last election.
At stake is control of East Africa’s wealthiest and most stable nation, home to regional headquarters for firms like General Electric, Google, and Uber. Kenya also provides peacekeepers for neighbouring Somalia and frequently hosts peace talks for other nations in the turbulent East Africa region.
The case will be heard by the seven-member Supreme Court and presided over by Martha Koome, Kenya’s first female chief justice, who was appointed by Kenyatta last year.

7,SOS! Scientists sound climate alarm with exclamation mark,Activists hope that exclamation marks can spur greater efforts to cut the greenhouse gas emissions heating it up.,"OSLO: Most scientific studies — even those with remarkable findings — have long had their wider appeal dimmed by unremarkable titles. But as researchers — who mostly err on the side of cautious understatement — grow more alarmed by worsening climate change impacts including heatwaves, droughts and melting ice, an unfamiliar piece of punctuation is creeping into their work: the exclamation mark.
“SOS! Summer of smoke” reads the title of one study referenced in a flagship series of reports by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released this year. Another trumpets,  “Too hot to help!”. Climate protesters have long deployed the punctuation on banners urging  “Climate Action Now!” or warning  “There is no planet B!”.
Activists hope that exclamation marks, by stirring visceral feelings to match scientific findings about the deteriorating state of the planet, can spur greater efforts to cut the greenhouse gas emissions heating it up.
“It’s about emotions this affects all our lives,” said Nuala Gathercole Lam, a spokeswoman for the Exti­nction Rebellion (XR) activist group in Britain. But, she warned,  “exclamation marks can seem like over-labouring” an already-clear message.
XR’s global website starts with the sober sentence:  “This is an emergency”, followed by a lower section urging  “Act Now!”.
Some researchers say the appearance of the exclamation point in scientific work reflects growing concern about rising temperatures among the wider public.
Adeniyi Asiyanbi, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia, wrote a report cited by the IPCC entitled:  “‘I don’t get this climate stuff!’ Making sense of climate change among the corporate middle class in Lagos”.
He drew the emphatic punctuation from a Nigerian businessman he spoke to, who expressed frustration that climate solutions are hard to understand. “I wont be surprised if more exclamation is being used ... deliberately to create a sense of urgency and a sense of fear too,” said Asiyanbi.
“I personally have my reservations about (doing it) — but that’s what I see around increasingly now,” he added in emailed comments.
The IPCC’s February report on adapting to the impacts of climate change refers to more than a dozen studies that include an exclamation mark in the headline, up from just four in the previous albeit shorter — IPCC science assessment in 2014.
The IPCC, whose findings must be approved by all governments ranging from oil-producing OPEC nations to climate-vulnerable Pacific island states, has no specific guidance to authors on using exclamation marks, said spokesman Andrej Mahecic. As a rule, IPCC reports avoid using  “!”, except when citing titles of other scientific studies. But a single exclamation mark slipped into Chapter 2 of the February IPCC report in the sentence:  “Hotter temperatures also increase mosquito bite rate, parasite development, and viral replication!”.
Editors spotted the rogue  “!” and it will be deleted in the final version, said Camille Parmesan, a coordinating lead author of the chapter who is affiliated with Frances National Centre for Scientific Research, the University of Plymouth and the University of Texas at Austin. “No, generally exclamation marks are not used in IPCC (!!!!!),” she wrote in an email interview.

8,Sri Lanka faces international censure over arrests,COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s new government came under international censure on Monday over the use of tough anti-terror...,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s new government came under international censure on Monday over the use of tough anti-terror laws to detain protesters who forced Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down from the presidency last month.
Three student activists arrested last week during the first anti-government rally after the end of a state of emergency were being held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), authorities said on Sunday, including student leader Wasantha Mudalige. The PTA allows suspects to be detained for 90 days without judicial review.
“Using laws that don’t conform with international human rights standards — like the PTA — erodes democracy in Sri Lanka,” said US ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung. “We encourage the government to uphold the rights of the people to express their views,” she tweeted.
The European Union said it was  “concerned” by the development, with the EU office in Colombo tweeting that there had been a  “de-facto moratorium of the use of #PTA”.
Another 13 demonstrators arrested at Thursday’s protest have either been released on bail or are being held under normal procedures. 
UK-based rights group Amnesty International said the use of anti-terror laws against peaceful protesters was a sign authorities were  “unwilling to withstand any form of criticism and are systematically stifling dissenting voices”.
“Charges of terrorism do not commensurate with any offences the protesters are alleged to have committed,” said its South Asia Director Yamini Mishra.
“Time and time again, the Act has been used as a tool to silence government critics, journalists and minorities.” An unprecedented economic collapse sparked often huge anti-government rallies in Sri Lanka this year, after the country ran out of foreign currency to finance imports, leaving its 22 million people enduring chronic shortages of essential goods, rolling blackouts and spiralling inflation.
The government imposed a state of emergency that gave security forces sweeping detention powers, but the ordinance lapsed last week.

9,US cops suspended after video of violent arrest goes viral,Two of the officers are from Crawford County Sheriff’s Office while one is with the Mulberry Police Department.,"WASHINGTON: Three police officers in the US state of Arkansas have been suspended and are under investigation, authorities said, after video showing them violently beating a suspect during an arrest went viral.
The video, taken by a bystander during the incident near the city of Mulberry on Sunday, shows the three male officers punching the suspect repeatedly in the face and kneeing him while he is on the ground.
“This is bad,” a woman can be heard saying. When bystanders call out to the officers, one orders them to stay back. It is the latest incidence of police brutality to be caught on camera and spark outrage in the United States.
Two of the officers are from Crawford County Sheriff’s Office while one is with the Mulberry Police Department.
“In reference to the video circulating social media involving two Crawford County deputies, we have requested that Arkansas State Police conduct the investigation and the deputies have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation,” the Crawford County Sheriff’s Office said on Facebook on Sunday.
“I hold all my employees accountable for their actions and will take appropriate measures in this matter,” the statement added. Mulberry mayor Gary Baxter said the third officer had also been placed on administrative leave and that Arkansas State Police were investigating.
The video left him  “shocked and sickened,” he said in a statement on Facebook. He promised to take the results of the investigation  “very seriously” and to  “take any actions necessary to insure this never happens again.” Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson also confirmed the investigation on social media.
Local television station 40/29 News reported that the man was being detained after threatening a gas station clerk earlier on Sunday. He initially cooperated with the officers before trying to attack them, it said. It did not say if he had been armed or not.
The suspect was taken first to hospital before being booked in to Crawford County jail and charged with a slew of offences including battery, assault and resisting arrest, the station reported.

Video clips of Marin, 36, at a party with Finnish celebrities began circulating on social media last week and they were soon published by several media outlets in Finland and abroad.  
On Thursday, Marin said she was upset that videos of her dancing at private parties were published online as they were meant to be seen only by friends. 
Marin, who became the world’s youngest serving government leader in Dec 2019, agreed on Friday to take the drug test, saying she had never taken drugs and that she had not seen anyone doing so at the party she attended. 
Social Democrat leader Marin also said her ability to perform her official duties had remained unimpaired on the Saturday night in question and that she would have left the party had she been required to work. 
Some Finns have voiced support for Marin and others have raised questions about her judgement.

Last week, New Zealand police said they had discovered the remains of two children, who are thought to have been between five and 10 years old when they died, in suitcases.
The bodies were discovered after an unsuspecting family bought a trailer-load of items — including the suitcases — at an auction for abandoned goods.
New Zealand police have said the bodies were likely to have been in storage for several years, which has complicated the investigation into the crime. Police said that a woman of Korean descent, who is believed to be related to the children, is currently in South Korea.
“We confirm that she is in South Korea, and that she is a New Zealand national of Korean descent,” an official at the Korean National Police Agency said.
She arrived in the South in 2018 and had no record of leaving the country since that year, he added.
“New Zealand police are leading this investigation and we intend to cooperate at their request,” the official added.

12,China’s scorching region extends power curbs as heatwave lingers,State weather forecasters have issued a heat  “red alert” for the 11th consecutive day.,"SHANGHAI: China’s scorched southwestern regions extended curbs on power consumption on Monday as they deal with dwindling hydropower output and surging household electricity demand during a long drought and heatwave.
State weather forecasters issued a heat  “red alert” for the 11th consecutive day on Monday, as extreme weather continues to play havoc with power supplies and damage crops. They also raised the national drought alert to  “orange” — the second-highest level.
The drought has already  “severely affected” mid-season rice and summer corn in some southern regions, the ministry of agriculture said on Sunday.
The National Meteorological Centre said as many as 62 weather stations, from Sichuan in the southwest to Fujian on the southeastern coast, recorded record temperatures on Sunday. The situation could improve starting on Wednesday as a cold front moves into China via Xinjiang.
The region of Chongqing, which hit temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) late last week, announced that opening hours at more than 500 malls and other commercial venues would be shortened starting on Monday to ease power demand.
Two malls on the list contacted on Monday confirmed that they had received the government notice and would abide by the new opening hours. Two hotels on the list said they were still operating normally but were restricting air conditioner use.
In neighbouring Sichuan province, a major hydropower generator, authorities also extended existing curbs on industrial power consumers until Aug 25, financial news service Caixin said on Sunday. Power generation in Sichuan is at just half the normal level.
It cited firms in the battery industry as saying that industrial power users in the cities of Yibin and Suining had been told to remain closed until Thursday.
A Sichuan-based pesticide producer, Lier Chemical Co Ltd , confirmed in a notice on Monday that output restrictions at two of its production bases in the province would continue until Aug 25. Toyota Motor Corp gradually resumed operations at its Sichuan plant in China on Monday using a power generator after suspending operations last week, the company’s spokesperson said.
Other regions have also sent 50 emergency power generating vehicles to Sichuan since last Thursday to help alleviate shortages, the Global Times newspaper said.

The Philippines is one of the last countries in the world to resume full-time, in-person lessons — sparking warnings that the prolonged closure of classrooms had worsened an education crisis in the country.
Children in masks and uniforms lined up for a temperature check and squirt of hand sanitiser at Pedro Guevara Elementary School in Manila, which had shut classrooms since March 2020.
The school has adopted a hybrid system of in-person and remote learning as it transitions its nearly 6,000 students back to face-to-face classes by November — a deadline set by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr soon after he took office two months ago.
Grade six student Sophia Macahilig said she was  “excited” to meet her classmates and teachers after two years of Zoom lessons. “We used to have fun and now I can have fun again,” 11-year-old Macahilig said. But many students have a lot of catching up to do.
Even before the pandemic, nine out of 10 Filipino children could  “not read a simple text with comprehension” by age 10, the World Bank and other agencies said in a recent report. Only 10 countries were worse off, including Afghanistan, Laos, Chad and Yemen.
