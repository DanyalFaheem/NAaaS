Proceedings of the 41stsession, the longest one so far, began as the budget session on June 15 and the assembly secretariat (read speaker) is running it since then, though it lacked any business and ironically budget was not presented in it as the then government of Hamza Shehbaz chose to convene a separate sitting for the purpose in an adjacent building.
Soon after the recitation of some Quranic verses and Na’at on Monday, PML-N lawmaker Tahir Khalil Sindhu sought the floor from Mian Sharif, who was chairing the sitting in the absence of the speaker and deputy speaker, on a point of order.
When he was denied an opportunity to speak his mind, Mr Sindhu pointed out the short quorum in the house.
The chair ordered the ringing of bells for five minutes, giving time to the lawmakers if present in the lobbies to join the proceedings. However, the proceedings were postponed for Wednesday when the presence of a minimum of 94 lawmakers, one-fourth of the total membership of 371, could not be ensured in the house.

3,Voices of dissent in PML-N over Imran’s possible arrest,"Javed Latif wants to prioritise Toshakhana, foreign funding cases.","LAHORE: Revealing differences among the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz on arrest of the PTI chairman, party leader and Federal Minister Mian Javed Latif has demanded giving priority to deciding Toshakhana, corruption and foreign funding cases against Imran Khan instead of arresting the former prime minister for threatening the judiciary and the police.
“The Toshakhana, corruption and foreign funding cases against Imran Khan should be adjudicated at the earliest instead of taking him into custody for his threats to a woman judge and police officers in his Rawalpindi public meeting speech,” Mr Latif told reporters here on Monday.
The nation must be informed of the corruption by Imran Khan and how he sold off national secrets to foreign countries (apparently a reference to sharing details of the CPEC project with the IMF), he said.  
He challenged double standards being adopted in adjudicating cases of the PTI chairman and other politicians. “If dozens of PML-N leaders can be disqualified under contempt of court and other charges then why cannot be Imran Khan? Who are those who are not disqualifying Imran Khan after the Toshakhana case is proved? Do we have to wait for eight years for (Khan’s) disqualification?”

Javed Latif wants to prioritise Toshakhana, foreign funding cases

Saying that states do not give decisions by seeing faces, he questioned why Imran Khan was not being disqualified in Toshakhana case, while Nawaz Sharif had been disqualified for life for not receiving salary from the firm of his son.
Demanding a level-playing field for all political players, the federal minister said Imran Khan’s recorded speech was being broadcast while there was a complete ban on broadcasting speeches of Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz.
He said the sacrifice of politics to save the state is not complete until the role of the people who brought the national economy to the current state is not exposed.  
He said Chief Minister Parvez Elahi had been saying as the Punjab Assembly speaker that the PTI was formed by breaking up the Q-League.  
He said people could not become a nation without the supremacy of constitution and law and that the situation would not improve until Nawaz Sharif’s narrative of giving respect to the vote is adopted.

5,Police trace inter-province ring behind youth’s kidnap,He was recovered from KP with the help of mediators,"LAHORE: Recovery of a youth, who was kidnapped in Lahore by an inter-province crime gang, from Lakki Marwat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, after hectic efforts by police, has exposed serious flaws in law enforcement and poor surveillance of traffic in Punjab and KP.    
The youth who was kidnapped some three weeks back, has been recovered with dozens of torture marks on his body.
The recovery of Mohammad Azeem (22) was made possible only when some elders of Lakki Marwat, who were running a business in Lahore, mediated between the police and the kidnappers.
To recover Azeem safely, the Lahore Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) held many rounds of talks for two weeks with the mediators as they had set the condition that the police should forgo their demand of handover of the prime suspects behind the kidnap.

He was recovered from KP with the help of mediators 

An official privy to the information say the kidnap case has exposed the highly compromised security arrangements by the law enforcers, resulting in almost unhindered transportation of the youth from Lahore to KP despite several checkpoints on the way.
He said the kidnappers covered nearly 490 kilometers distance from Lahore to the Lakki Marwat in KP with the blindfolded boy stuffed in their car’s boot, without being checked or noticed by the police of two provinces despite registration of a kidnap case and its details uploaded on the central online system of the Punjab police.
“The kidnappers belonging to the former tribal areas were equally influential in their home province as well as in Lahore, fearlessly running a kidnap-for-ransom network”, the official said.
Explaining their modus operandi, the official said the kidnappers trapped the boy using a young girl and their two “facilitators” in Lahore.  
The mastermind of the crime hired the girl to develop friendship with Azeem and call him for a “date” at the Model Town Park in Lahore, where the facilitators would already be present.  
As par the plan, the girl befriended the youth and later asked him to reach the park at 2:30pm on Aug 2, to meet her. As Azeem reached there, she gave a signal to the kidnappers to get him. After her job was done, the girl took money from the kidnappers and went away.  
Moments later, they kidnapped the boy at gunpoint, injected him with some drug to weaken resistance and took him to an undisclosed place in Lahore, the official said.
He said the kidnappers kept Azeem there for a couple of days and then handed him over to their ringleader, who then transported the youth to Lakki Marwat, KP.  
The official added that Lahore police had lodged a case against “unknown kidnappers”.
Azeem, after his recovery, told the police that the kidnappers had subjected him to severe torture nd detained him in the basement of a building located in the hilly area of Lakki Marwat.
The official said the police tracked down the facilitators using modern techniques and arrested them in a raid.
The police officers were also in contact with the mediators to get their help for the arrest of the actual culprits from Lakki Marwat, he said.

The indifference of the federal and provincial governments and the political opposition is evident from their inability – even amid a growing death toll – to prioritise human life over confrontational politics, palace intrigue and dangerous rhetoric. 
The scale of destruction needs to be mapped urgently along with provision of clean drinking water as well as basic food and medical supplies to the affected persons. The state must prioritise the most vulnerable households and communities, including women, dependent children, persons living with disabilities, the sick, and the elderly. 
The HRCP urged the government as well as all elected representatives to urgently implement well-conceived and practical measures to counter the food shortages, disease, displacement and loss of livelihood. 
However, it added, this year’s weather patterns must also serve as a warning to the state that its survival in the long term would depend on its ability to begin to deliver climate justice to its people.

At the outset of the hearing, Additional Advocate General Akhtar Javed requested the court to allow two weeks to submit a reply on behalf of the government. He said several notifications and documents were needed to be placed on record.  
Opposing the request of the law officer, Advocate Mian Dawood, the counsel for the petitioner, argued that the respondent principal secretary had been exerting pressure on the chief secretary and other bureaucrats illegally.  
He pointed out that the respondent got the development budget of his native district Mandi Bahauddin increased massively within a few days from Rs3 billion to Rs31bn. 
The counsel contended that the chief secretary twice requested the federal government for his transfer owing to the ‘illegal’ pressure by the respondent.
Justice Anwaar Hussain observed that the court would look into these issues after the submission of the government’s reply.
The judge turned down the request of the law officer for two-week time and directed him to submit the reply within a week.

20,Turkmenistan interested in TAPI project,"LAHORE: Turkmenistan wants to speed up work on the Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India (TAPI) gas pipeline...","LAHORE: Turkmenistan wants to speed up work on the Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India (TAPI) gas pipeline project, says the country’s ambassador to Pakistan.
“My country gives great importance to having better relations with Pakistan and wants to speed up work on the TAPI gas pipeline project,” ambassador Atadjan Movlamov said at Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI). The ambassadors of Nepal and Azerbaijan were also present.
Mr Movalmov said a logistics centre has been established for transit trade in Turkmenistan but one route cannot meet the requirements, so access to the ports of Karachi and Gwadar is very important.
Ambassador of Nepal Tapas Adhikari said Nepal sees Pakistan as a preferred partner and is keen to expand trade relations.
“The Nepal Chamber has also inked a memorandum of understanding with the LCCI to help increase bilateral trade,” he added.
“I’ll bring a delegation of Nepali businessmen to Pakistan soon,” he added.
Ambassador of Azerbaijan Khazar Farhadov praised the LCCI for playing a key role in maintaining good economic relations between the two countries. “We want to further improve the trade relations with Pakistan,” he added.

21,PM asked to amend journalists’ protection law,ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Journalists Safety Coalition (PJSC) has declared the ‘Protection of Journalists and Media...,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Journalists Safety Coalition (PJSC) has declared the ‘Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act 2021’ passed by the previous government as “fundamentally flawed” in some respects and urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to amend the law to make it optimally beneficial for stakeholders.
This unanimous demand was made during a meeting of the coalition, which brings together representative associations of media workers, senior journalists, human rights commissions, digital rights groups, female journalists and political parties, says a press release issued on Monday.
It was highlighted in the meeting that section 6 of the law mandates proof of “good faith” before it can benefit journalists. 
The meeting’s participants said this was akin to a pre-qualification clause, which was anathematic to press freedom and principles of lawmaking. Journalists, media bodies and civil society have been demanding removal of this clause.
Furthermore, participants of the meeting raised concern about how the law was “gender blind” in terms of its failure to mandate a minimum number of women to the proposed Safety Commission that is to be set up under the law and demanded that an amendment should mandate that at least 25pc members of the commission be women to make it a progressive law.
“We unanimously demand the Shehbaz Sharif government to make these amendments on an urgent basis to convert what is a law good in intent but bad in draft, and hence misplaced in functionality, so that journalists can benefit from the law,” the statement said.
The law was passed by the current parliament in late 2021 with unanimous support of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, Pakistan Peoples Party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and other parties but section 20 was sneaked into the draft by the previous government rendering it practically redundant.
The government has also been urged to be consultative rather than secretive in the process.
