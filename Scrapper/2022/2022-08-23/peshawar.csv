Health Foundation Managing Director Dr Adnan Taj in a statement said that the government was in the process of contracting out three regional blood centres, one each in Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan and Abbottabad, under the public-private partnership programme to ensure provision of safe blood transfusion to the patients in public sector hospitals.
“I strongly deny the statement attributed to me. The figures attributed to me are incorrect. The government is trying its level best to resolve the issue of shortage of blood in the rural as well as in urban-based hospitals and save lives,” he said.
Dr Adnan said public-private partnership programme had already been approved by the provincial cabinet and several health facilities had been outsourced to private parties as per law while other were being contracted out. “The patients will receive free of cost blood under the programme,” he added.

Nasir Ali Khan said on the occasion that in 1960s, per capita income in Pakistan was $150 while in Korea it was $160. However, he said, because of development in technology and producing skilled labour, the Korea’s per capita income currently stood at $50,000, which was almost equal to that of the USA.
“We are working on a programme under which 25,000 youth would be trained through different course of information technology across the province in the second shift of more than 250 government colleges,” he said.
Secretary Khalid Khan told the ceremony that there was a lot of potential in the youth of merged areas and the government launched different schemes for them.
He said that skill development programmes for merged areas would not only bridge the gap in the local industry but also the countries where most of Pakistanis went in search of jobs.
Under the programme, the youth are expected to improve their skills and apply those skills on online platforms to earn livelihood. It will also enhance the efficiency of the almost 200 professionals per year by developing their capacity.

Abdul Waheed and Mohammad Khan fired gunshots in the air after employees of a parasailing club in Khanpur Dam allegedly harassed and hit women tourists at Khanpur Dam here.
Talha Munir, an industrialist based in Faisalabad, alleged that the club’s staff members scuffled with his family over an overcharging complaint, attacked and intimidated women, and even tried to ‘molest’ one of them.
However, the club’s employees denied allegations and told police that Talha Munir’s guards fired in the air and thrashed a boatman, who helped one of the women tourists land safely during parasailing.
They insisted that the boatman, a member of the parasailing club, stepped forward only after seeing the woman fail to land twice but the move didn’t sit well with the family’s head, who ordered his guards to fire at the boatman. Boat owners and residents snatched guns from guards and informed the police.
A police team led by Khanpur SHO Chanzeb Khan Tanoli reached there and arrested guards Abdul Waheed and Mohammad Khan.
District police officer Imran Shahid ordered the SHO to look into the matter and register a case under the relevant law.
However, both parties reached a settlement and formally approached the police saying they don’t want to pursue cases against each other.
The police registered a criminal case against the guards for firing in the air and produced them before the judicial magistrate, who fined them and ordered their release.

5,Drive launched to enhance admissions on health cards in govt hospitals,Official says number of people availing free treatment has risen to 10pc,"PESHAWAR: The health department has started holding capacity-building workshops to enable the public sector hospitals to enhance admissions under Sehat Card Plus programme as the number of families availing cashless treatment services rose to 10 per cent.
“When we started the programme in 2016, card utilisation was only two per cent because the coverage was limited. After extending the scheme to the entire population of the province in November 2020, the number of families using the Sehat Card Plus has risen to 10 per cent,” chief executive of the programme, Dr Mohammad Riaz Tanoli, told Dawn.
He said that even in October 2020, when the target coverage of the scheme was above 64 per cent, the utilisation of the card was only three per cent. Now, all 9.2 million families of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are entitled to get free treatment in more than 1,100 empanelled hospitals in the country due to which the number of families getting services on the card has increased.
The programme covered three per cent population in first phase started in 2016 in four districts. The scheme was extended to 51 per cent population in second phase in 2017 and to 64 per cent in third phase in 2017.

Official says number of people availing free treatment has risen to 10pc

“Previously, the people didn’t utilise cards as they were not sure if they were included or not due to which they stayed away but after the universal coverage, the people are coming to hospitals in droves. Last month, we recorded 68,000 admissions,” said Dr Riaz Tanoli.
However, he said that public sector health facilities were yet to get financial benefit from the programme as they received only 32 per cent revenue through the patients treated on SCP whereas 68 per cent of the amount, spent on treatment of patients under the programme, went to the private sector.
Dr Riaz Tanoli said that Health Minister Taimur Khan Jhagra, who was constantly monitoring the flagship programme of the provincial government, was concerned about the less number of admissions in state-owned facilities under the scheme and wanted to improve their performance to treat more patients.
“Therefore, we have started series of workshops to inform public sector hospitals to get more patients on SCP. Of the total 14 sessions, we have held five in as many hospitals in Mardan, Swat, Peshawar and nine more will take place by end of October,” he said.
Dr Riaz Tanoli said that during those sessions, they informed the private health facilities about the issues due which they lagged behind private sector in admissions of patients under the free treatment scheme. He added that government wanted to improve facilitation of patients on card.
He said that patients were treated free of cost in each government hospital but they required some tests, medicines and surgical items that weren’t not available in their respective stores. He said that all the public sector hospitals were overcrowded by patients and if they stated using SCP, it would not only enhance their income but could also ensure standard treatment of patients.
“The amount generated from SCP patients could be spent on upgradation of services and giving financial incentives to the staff involved in the diagnosis and treatment of the patients,” said Dr Riaz Tanoli.
He said that there were a total of 22,000 beds for SCP patients including 14,000 (60pc) in public sector health facilities but their income was far less than private hospitals. Of the total 192 empanelled hospitals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 138 were private, he said.
“We are also concentrating on medical teaching institutions to help them increase admissions on card as they have vast infrastructure and senior consultants in addition to well-equipped laboratories and operation theatres,” he said.

10,Tribunal seeks Imran’s response to plea against NA-22 candidature,Appellant insists PTI chief didn’t disclose details of assets and Toshakhana gifts,"PESHAWAR: An appellate tribunal on Monday issued a notice to former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chief Imran Khan asking him to respond to an appeal for his disqualification from contesting by-election for a National Assembly seat from Mardan district, NA-22.
Peshawar High Court Justice Ijaz Anwar of the one-member tribunal fixed Aug 24 for next hearing into the appeal filed by voter Ali Haider, who called for the rejecting of the NA-22 returning officer’s order for accepting the PTI chief’s nomination papers and declaring that he was not qualified to become a member of the National Assembly.
The appellant claimed that Mr Imran concealed information about retaining gifts from Toshakhana and some other assets in his annual income tax returns; received prohibited funds in the name of his party; did not disclose details of the assets of the Al-Qadir University Project Trust to which he and his wife were trustees.
Senior lawyer Naveed Akhtar appeared for the appellant, whereas the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was represented by its senior law officer, Riaz Khattak, and advocate Mohsin Kamran Siddique.

Appellant insists PTI chief didn’t disclose details of assets and Toshakhana gifts

The appellant’s counsel said his client had filed an objection petition before the returning officer but he turned down the same on August 17.
He contended that perusal of income tax returns of Imran Khan for the financial year 2018-19 and 2019-20 revealed that he concealed the valuable assets acquired from Toshakhana during the period 2018 to 2020.
The lawyer alleged that Mr Imran, with mala fide intentions, had concealed the gifts, which he discretely acquired after entering the office of prime minister, from the public eye, the ECP and the Federal Board of Revenue.
He said certain gifts were retained by the former prime minister, adding that the candidate and his spouse procured 52 items in the form of gifts from August 2018 to December 2021. He alleged that the total assessed value of the valuable assets was Rs142 million whereas the candidate paid only Rs38.98 million and retained the gifts but never disclosed those gifts.
The counsel claimed that the candidate also concealed the fact that the ECP concluded in the ‘Akbar S. Babar versus PTI’ case that prohibited funds were received by Mr Imran and the law was being set on motion for confiscation of those funds.
Moreover, he added that Mr Imran also concealed that a reference had already been sent to ECP by the NA speaker under Article 63(2) of the Constitution for initiation of disqualification proceedings against him.
He contended that the respondent did not disclose as to why and for what material contribution he was contesting the by-elections from NA-22 and eight other constituencies despite of the fact that he had already been receiving salary as an MNA.
Meanwhile, the tribunal also issued notices to two candidates for NA-31, Peshawar, Shaukat Ali and Emran Khan,in appeals filed by contesting candidate and former MNA, Shaukat Ali, seeking rejection of their nomination papers.
Appellant Shaukat Ali is a PTI leader and covering candidate of party chief Imran Khan for by-election in that constituency.
The appellant’s counsel contended that the two candidates had not properly filled their nomination papers and left several of the portions blank, which was violation of the Elections Act.
He said those candidates had also not provided information about bank accounts, which had to be opened for election expenses purposes.
The lawyer added that the opening of bank accounts was mandatory under the law.

11,Traders say chances for increase in trade with Afghanistan bleak,"Term agreement on visa relaxation to transporters ""too little too late"".","KHYBER: The local traders have termed reciprocal visa relaxation to Pakistani and Afghan transporters for promotion of bilateral trade between the two neighbouring countries as ‘too little and too late’.
They said that currently the facility would not provide substantial financial benefits to traders.
Reacting to the federal government’s recent agreement with Kabul about the grant of six months reciprocal visas to transporters to facilitate cross-border movement of goods, Zahidullah Shinwari, the former president of Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that it was ‘wishful thinking’ on part of government that the relaxation could either expedite bilateral trade or could bring about positive changes in the existing trading relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“Unfortunately successive governments failed to accept our demands in the recent past about bringing about prompt, timely and productive changes in the trading relations with Afghanistan,” he said.

Term agreement on visa relaxation to transporters ‘too little too late’

He said that their demands were met only when the appropriate time for taking such steps already passed and demand for prompt supply of Pakistani goods reduced considerably.
“Now when the present Taliban government in Afghanistan is faced with acute economic problems and their banking system has almost collapsed, appeasing transporters with six months visa facility could fetch us little financial gains,” said Mr Shinwari.
He said that development activities in Afghanistan were almost at a standstill while there was a serious shortage of funds and the urge for enhancing bilateral trade from the Afghan side had also diminished.
“We need to think big and act big if we are serious in multiplying our existing dwindling trade with Afghanistan,” he said. He added that both the neighbouring countries should facilitate traders by granting them quick visa facilities. He said that traders should be granted visas on their arrival at the border rather than subjecting them to three to four months of frustrated wait.
Sabir Khan, a clearing agent at Torkham, said that businessmen from both sides could accelerate the pace of trade and enhance its quantum rather than the transporters, who were acting only as carriers and not the actual trading party.
“Transport could only move when traders are active in business on both sides of the border,” said Mr Khan. He said that traders needed relaxation in grant of visas by both the countries.
Haji Azeemullah Shinwari, a representative of local transporters, welcomed the decision and said that it would help to resolve their longstanding issues.
He, however, requested the authorities to treat the cleaners or assistant drivers in a similar way as they too were faced with restrictions at border due to one-time grant of visa.

13,Tank flood victims block highway over denial of relief package,DI Khan records seven deaths by calamity in five days,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Flood victims from Pai village in Tank district blocked the South Waziristan Highway to protest the ‘denial’ of compensation announced by the federal and provincial governments.
During the two hours long demonstration, the villagers demanded immediate payment of Rs1 million for every destroyed house and Rs0.4 for a damaged house as announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during the last month visit as well as Rs0.8 for a destroyed house and Rs0.25 million for a damaged house as announced by Chief Minister Mahmood Khan.
They earlier staged a protest outside the District Press Club building in Tank city and surrounded the offices of the deputy commissioner.
The downpour-induced flash floods have caused large-scale damage to public life and property in Tank since July 11 with two-thirds of houses in Pai, the largest village in the district, being washed away in floodwaters.

DI Khan records seven deaths by calamity in five days

Flood victims in Pai complained that even one and a half months after making compensation announcements, both federal and provincial governments had yet to give them the promised money.
They said the destruction of houses and denial of rehabilitation had forced them to spend days and nights in the open amid hot and humid weather.
“The district administration hasn’t come to our [flood victims’] help yet and even, the compensation promised by the PM and CM last month has yet to reach us,” a protester said.
He said repeated requests to the authorities for help fell on deaf ears.
The protesters warned that if their demands were not met immediately, they would stage a sit-in outside the Chief Minister’s House.
They dispersed after the administration’s officials showed up and promised an early action on their demands.
FLOOD DAMAGES: The flash floods killed seven people, injured 15 and wreaked havoc on infrastructure in several areas of Dera Ismail Khan district during the last five days, show official figures.
The calamity badly hit 147 villages in Prova, Daraban and Kulachi tehsils and damaged around 8,500 houses.
In a video message, Dera Ismail Khan deputy commissioner Nasrullah Khan said the administration was mobilising all available resources to extend relief and rescue to flood-hit people.
He said four relief camps had been established in Prova and one each in Darazinda and Daraban areas to provide shelter, food and medicines to the people.
The DC said 11 well-equipped rescue teams, including six from neighbouring districts, were carrying out rescue and relief operations in calamity-hit areas, while around 2,000 food packages had been given away to people.
He added that 7,000 people were provided with meal three times a day at relief camps.
Mr Nasrullah said the required heavy machinery such as tractors, bulldozers and excavators were available and utilised as they needed.
He said the people should cooperate with the district administration, rescue agencies and staff in the field and should learn about flood situation or relief activities from the district administration.
The DC also said a flood control room had been established and people in case of any emergency or complaint may contact at 09669280116.
“Dera Ismail Khan commissioner Amir Afaq regularly conducts meetings with officials of the relevant departments, Pakistan Army and police to ensure effective coordination and successful relief and rescue operations,” he said.
Mr Nasrullah said all relevant authorities were making collective efforts to provide the sought-after relief to flood victims and bring life to normal in their calamity-hit areas.

In Swat, residents of Amankot, Faizabad, Rahimabad, Saidu Sharif, Gul Kada, Panr and other suburbs of Mingora marched from their respective areas and gathered in front of the Peshawar Electric Supply Company office in Saidu Sharif.
They held banners and placards inscribed with slogans and chanted against the inclusion of high FCA charges in their power bills.
Later, the protesters marched towards the Swat Press Club, where their leaders, including local government members, said the current month’s bills were heavily laden with FCA and other taxes.
“My actual electricity bill, the cost of the units consumed, is Rs2,000, but the overall bill goes up to over Rs6,500, including FCA and other taxes. I am a day labourer and don’t have enough money to pay the huge bill,” said Izhar Ali, a resident of Amankot.
Abdul Khaliq, a resident of Miangano Cham area, said his salary was Rs18,000 and received an electricity bill of Rs21,000 with over Rs10,000 FCA in it.
The protesters said Swat was a tax-free zone, and collection of any tax from people was illegal.
In Swabi, power consumers staged a demonstration against imposition of FCA and other taxes in power bills, and demanded that such levies be withdrawn.
The consumers belonging to 20 union councils of Razaar tehsil gathered in Shewa Adda, the tehsil headquarters, holding electricity bills in their hands and chanting slogans against the government.
The protesters also went to the Pesco office, but the power company officials refused to meet the charged protesters. Later, the people blocked the Swabi-Mardan Road.
