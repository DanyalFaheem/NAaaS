Muttahida sees ‘flaws’ in delimitation of constituencies in Karachi, Hyderabad

On Friday, the MQM-P warned that it would review its decision to participate in the upcoming August 28 local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad while reiterating its protest over unjustified delimitation, fake voters’ list and less count of the population of Karachi in the National Census, 2017.

1,Anchor held in Karachi for ‘maligning’ Islamabad police,"Moved to capital after judge grants transit remand; Farooqui claims he was stripped, tortured; KUJ condemns arrest","

Jameel Farooqui

 
KARACHI: Bol TV anchor and YouTuber Jameel Farooqui was arrested in Karachi on Monday for “falsely accusing” Islamabad police of physically and sexually assaulting PTI leader Shahbaz Gill. Hours later, while being taken to the capital, Mr Farooqui claimed that he was tortured, stripped and kept at an undisclosed location for over 12 hours.
Meanwhile, a Karachi judge handed custody of Mr Farooqui to Islamabad police after granting a three-day transitory remand to shift him to the capital.
Bol TV Editor-in-Chief Nazir Leghari and a journalist body claimed, however, that Mr Farooqui was allegedly picked up late Sunday night, while on his way home from work after concluding this transmission.
The first information report (FIR) against Mr Farooqui, was registered on Sunday under sections 499 (defamation), 500 (punishment for defamation), 501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory), and 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).

Moved to capital after judge grants transit remand; Farooqui claims he was stripped, tortured; KUJ condemns arrest

His whereabouts were briefly unknown, before various channels reported the news of his arrest on Monday morning.
Later, in a brief statement, a spokesperson for Islamabad police, without naming the accused, said that a man was arrested from Karachi and he was being brought to the capital for further legal proceedings.
However, it is unclear who arrested Mr Farooqui as local police distanced itself from the incident.
Talking to Dawn, Zaman Town police station SHO Zahid Lodhi — in whose jurisdiction the channel’s office was located — denied any role in the arrest.
Mr Farooqui’s channel head, Mr Leghari, told Dawn the anchor had not committed any crime and had only exercised his right of freedom of expression.
“He neither beat anyone, nor took the law into his own hands,” he said, while labelling his arrest a “tyranny” and an “attempt to silence the media”.
In a video posted on Twitter on Monday evening, Mr Farooqui alleged that he was stripped and tortured during the custody.
The video showed the journalist handcuffed and accompanied by an Islamabad police official, at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport.
“On orders of the home ministry […] just because I am speaking the truth […] they tortured me,” Mr Farooqui said while standing beside Bol Media Group President Faysal Aziz Khan. He also claimed that he was blindfolded and kept at an unknown location for 12 hours.
Three-day transitory remand granted
After his arrest, police produced Mr Farooqui before Judicial Magistrate (South) Ali Sher Chandio and requested a transitory remand be granted so he could be moved to Islamabad, where the case was registered.
Investigating Officer Inspector Mian Muhammad Shehbaz informed the magistrate that an FIR against Mr Farooqui had been lodged at Islamabad’s Ramna police station. After hearing the IO’s arguments, the judge asked Mr Farooqui if was subjected to torture during the custody. However, Mr Farooqui didn’t complain of any maltreatment.
Meanwhile, the Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) condemned the ‘arrest’ and subsequent ‘disappearance’ of Mr Farooqui.
The union urged the chief justice to take notice of what they claimed was a ‘human rights violation’ and ‘vindictive policy against media persons’.
In a statement, KUJ President Shahid Iqbal and General Secretary Fahim Siddiqi said that while Mr Farooqi’s vlogs were objectionable and contrary to journalistic and moral values, his detention was a violation of basic human rights.

• Shibli temporarily replaces Gill as Imran’s chief of staff
ISLAMABAD: Punjab Chief Minister Parvez Elahi on Monday called on his ally and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan and assured him that the provincial government will make all possible “arrangements for the security” of the former prime minister who was booked in an anti-terrorism case a day earlier.
The meeting came after a large contingent of the Islamabad police outside Banigala, the residence of Imran Khan, prompted nationwide demonstrations by the PTI supporters who remained camped outside Banigala on Monday. However, Mr Khan was granted bail by the high court and the police were also withdrawn by the government.
According to a statement issued by the PTI media cell after the meeting, CM Elahi expressed “serious concerns” over the measures taken by the federal government against Imran Khan and vowed that the “Punjab government was with PTI in all circumstances”.
The statement added both leaders discussed the current political situation and public welfare projects in the meeting, which was also attended by CM’s son Moonis Elahi.
Separately, the former prime minister also met members of the National Assembly and Senate. During the meeting, he condemned the piecemeal acceptance of the resignations of the PTI MNAs.
According to party sources, participants of the meeting agreed that there was a “nexus of the National Assembly speaker, the Election Commission of Pakistan, and the imported government”.
In a separate meeting, a delegation comprising women parliamentarians called on Mr Khan to express their support for the embattled party chief.
The PTI chief also thanked the party supporters who thronged Banigala in Islamabad and took out rallies across Pakistan after rumours regarding his imminent arrest started making rounds on Sunday night. As per the party sources, Mr Khan told his supporters that the struggle for “real freedom” had entered its decisive stage.
‘Gill’s torturers above the law’
The PTI chief also addressed a ‘Seminar on Freedom of Judiciary’ in the evening at a local hotel in the federal capital. He recalled that Pakistan ranked 130th on the rule of law index and added that it was impossible to achieve economic and political stability without the rule of law.
Speaking about the torture of his chief of staff, Shahbaz Gill, in custody, Mr Khan said the individuals who allegedly tortured his aide “considered themselves above the law”. Mr Gill was “kidnapped and subjected to torture”, the PTI chief claimed and added that the details about the arrest of the PTI leader were “revealed two or three days” after his detention.
In a comment on “seditious remarks” made by Shahbaz Gill during a TV show, Imran Khan claimed that the PTI leader did not say anything “extraordinary as the Supreme Court had also made similar remarks in the Asghar Khan case”.
The seminar was also addressed by Supreme Court lawyers Riasat Ali Gondal, Salman Akram Raja, Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan and Barrister Ali Zafar.
Shibli new chief of staff
Meanwhile, Senator Shibli Faraz was appointed as Imran Khan’s chief of staff until Shahbaz Gill, who was handed over to the Islamabad police for a physical remand, would be able to resume his duties.
“His [Shibli Faraz] appointment will be effective immediately until Dr Shahbaz Gill is able to resume his duties as Chief of Staff of Chairman,” the notification read.
On the other hand, a video featuring Shahbaz Gill started making rounds on social media wherein the medical staff was seen trying to feed Mr Gill. “I have had breakfast so don’t push me to eat more as I could eat only so much. You are insisting because you have received orders from above,” Mr Gill said as he went on to eat to register his “protest” against “force feeding”.
“I have free will and it is my choice whether or not to eat,” the PTI leader said in the video. Mr Gill also said no to the orange juice which was offered to him and added that he was “diabetic” and that should not have more juice.

5,Ishaq Dar urges SC to exempt him from in-person attendance,"Application says Dar's ""health does not allow him to undertake air travel"".","ISLAMABAD: Former finance minister Ishaq Dar pleaded with the Supreme Court on Monday to urgently take up his application against the order of an accountability court requiring him to be present in person during hearings in a corruption case against him.
In an application filed through his counsel, Mr Dar sought an order by the apex court to exempt him from flying back to Pakistan, and allow his counsel to represent him in the accountability court, since his “health does not allow him to undertake air travel”.
The senator-elect said the accountability court would resume hearings in the case on Thursday (Aug 25) and intended to put his assets on sale if he did not return in time.
“Therefore, there is an extreme urgency for an early hearing of my application,” Ishaq Dar said in a six-page application moved through his counsel, former attorney general Salman Aslam Butt.
The petitioner requested the Supreme Court to set aside the trial court’s order of declaring him a proclaimed offender.
The applicant pleaded with the apex court to accept the submissions made in the application for a “fair, just and appropriate decision”.
On Dec 21 last year, the apex court had rejected a petition moved against Ishaq Dar by Muhammad Nawazish Ali Pirzada and also vacated its May 9, 2018, stay against the issuance of any notification regarding the former finance minister by the Election Commission of Pakistan.
The petitioner had challenged a previous Lahore High Court verdict of allowing Dar to contest the 2018 Senate elections on grounds that on Dec 11, 2017, an accountability court had declared him an absconder in a corruption reference after he failed to join the hearing.
Now in the fresh application, Ishaq Dar stated that during the tenure of the PTI government, the Director General of Immigration and Passports had blacklisted him on July 24, 2018, ‘without any justification’.
This action virtually barred the passport authorities in Pakistan as well as the Pakistan High Commissions overseas from issuing him a passport, Mr Dar said.
Passport cancelled
His passport was later cancelled on the foreign ministry’s request through a Sept 6 letter.
The cancellation of the passport, Ishaq Dar said, “came to my knowledge through a media report on Sept 9, when I was undergoing medical treatment in the United Kingdom”.
These acts of the PTI-led government “left me [Dar] stranded in Britain between Sept 2018 and May 2022” and made it “impossible for me to travel to Pakistan even if my health condition had improved”.
The former minister stated that through the present application, he wanted to bring on the apex court’s record certain documents regarding the circumstances that forced the applicant to be out of the country. “The reasons were beyond my control. This explains my failure to appear before the accountability court.

8,Debate on bill against disappearances deferred,Objections raised over on bill's clauses.,"ISLAMABAD: A Senate committee on Monday deferred the consideration of a bill against enforced disappearances following objections over one of its clauses.
The Senate Standing Committee on Interior met with Senator Mohsin Aziz in the chair to deliberate over the bill titled “Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2022”.
State Minister for Law and Justice Senator Shahadat Awan told the committee that the bill was about enforced disappearances and according to one of the clauses, a complainant could be imprisoned for up to five year if their petition against enforced disappearance later turned out to be false. He noted that the clause would stop people from reporting such cases, therefore, it was vital to revise the bill. The committee advised the interior ministry to remove the ambiguity and deferred it till the next meeting.
The committee also took up a bill titled “Anti Rape (Amendment) Bill, 2022” introduced by Senator Aziz.
He told the committee that the bill was aimed at tracing and tracking the locations of offenders to restrain them from committing any future offence.
However, Mr Awan claimed that the bill was against Article 15 of the Constitution, which outlines freedom of movement of the citizens. The committee deferred the consideration of the bill till the next meeting as well.
During the proceedings, Senator Fawzia Arshad introduced a bill titled “Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2022,” to make the presence of women police constables mandatory during the arrest of women accused of any offence. However, the state minister said that this provision was already a part of police rules and the problem lied with its implementation.
The committee also took up the matter of ‘brutal’ use of force by law enforcement agencies against the participants of the PTI’s “Haqeeqi Azadi March” in April.
