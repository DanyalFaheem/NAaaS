0,Meeting with fertiliser makers tomorrow,Ministers of the opinion that fertiliser companies should be supplied gas at a unified rate.,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Industries has called a meeting of fertiliser manufacturing companies on Wednesday to decide on a unified price of feed gas to streamline fertiliser production.
As per the directives of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, three federal ministers co-chaired a meeting on Monday and decided to convene a meeting of the manufacturing companies on Wednesday to decide on the pricing of feed gas.
Federal ministers Tariq Bashir Cheema, Syed Murtaza Mahmud and Dr Musadik Malik co-chaired the meeting which was of the view that fertiliser companies should be supplied gas at a unified rate, and there should be a level playing field. Food Security Minister Mr Cheema highlighted the importance of the welfare of farmers and said “we aim to give direct subsidy to the farmers.
It was suggested that a track and trace system of fertiliser bags can help in this regard.
“Food security hinges on agricultural production, and to ensure food security, all of the relevant ministries and departments should sit together to work coherently”, Cheema said.
During the ECC meeting held on July 28, the industries and production ministry submitted a summary on issues faced by two SNGPL-based fertiliser plants operated by provisioning of RLNG on a cost-sharing basis. The gas rate for the operation of these plants is worked out based on the Variable Contribution Margin (VCM).
Due to increases in fuel prices and other factors, both plants have approached the industries ministry for revision of VCM and capping of GST at the price paid by the plants. The ECC had approved the proposal to ensure compliance with the earlier decision of the ECC and the federal cabinet of shifting both the plants to indigenous gas.

London’s FTSE 100 and the Paris CAC 40 were down slightly by 0.1 per cent respectively while the Frankfurt DAX was flat at the close.

The China data sent oil prices sharply lower, with the international benchmark, Brent, slipping just under $100 per barrel while the main US contract, WTI, fell by five percent to around $94.

4,Stocks close in red as record inflation triggers selling,"KSE-100 index settles at 40,075.96 points, down 74.4 points or 0.19pc","KARACHI: Stock trading on Monday started on a mixed note, with news reports about the disbursement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan tranche of $1.2 billion in the current week supporting market sentiments to some extent.
Topline Securities said the KSE-100 index opened on a positive note and made an intraday high of 230 points or 0.57 per cent. However, the inflation number for July exerted selling pressure on the stock market and drove down the index to the intraday low of 80 points or 0.2pc.
Prices of consumer items rose almost 25pc on a year-on-year basis in July — a pace of increase last witnessed 14 years ago in the midst of a global recession.
As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 40,075.96 points, down 74.4 points or 0.19pc from a day ago.
The trading volume decreased 35.1pc to 110.4 million shares while the traded value went down 41.1pc to $15.6m on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included TPL Properties Ltd (12.72m shares), TRG Pakistan Ltd (9.21m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (8.63m shares), Agritech Ltd (8.42m shares) and Telecard Ltd (5.78m shares).

Foreign investors were net sellers as they offloaded shares worth $0.1m.
JS Global said macroeconomic indicators point to a slowdown in economic activity, which warrants cherry-picking in the equity market. “Decline in demand is likely to continue in sectors such as cement, steel and auto over the reduced availability of imported raw material and a rise in product prices,” it added.

5,"Foreigners withdraw over $28m from T-bills, bonds in July",Lucrative returns of up to 16pc fail to attract foreign investments in domestic bonds.,"KARACHI: The lucrative returns of up to 16 per cent failed to attract foreign investments in domestic bonds as the net outflow stood at little over $28 million in the first month of the current fiscal year.  
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday reported that an inflow of just $3 million was recorded in treasury bills in July while the outflow was much higher at $31.085m. Both, the inflows and outflows were from the United Kingdom reflecting the poor performance of the domestic bonds.
Before the pandemic in 2020, foreigners were allowed to invest in domestic bonds which quickly attracted around $3.5 billion but most of the investments left the country as the country was hit by Covid-19 and since then no significant foreign investment returned to domestic bonds.
T-bills attracted an investment of $22m in June, the last month of FY22, while the outflow was $62.8m. However, the Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) witnessed zero response from foreign investors during the month.
The regime change in Islamabad also impacted investor confidence as uncertainty that emerged out of this political change further hit the investment climate.
During the two months, March and April, no foreign investment was received in T-bills and PIBs rather massive withdrawals were made due to the highly uncertain political situation.  On May 6, the country received $9.9m after a gap of almost two and half months.
The returns were attractive but the risks due to uncertain political instability barred foreigners to invest during the fiscal year FY22, instead, the outflows from the domestic bonds were over $1bn.
Foreign obligations met
The crisis of rupee depreciation and declining foreign exchange reserves have further fuelled the uncertainty as only investors from the UK were making and withdrawing money from these bonds. 
However, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail has assured markets that the country will fully meet the foreign payments due in FY23 while he also reiterated his confidence that the IMF tranche of $1.2bn would be released soon. 
At the same, he recently told the media that Pakistan would receive about $8bn from bilateral and multilateral creditors including IMF.
The cut-off yields on T-bills had been revised higher than the SBP policy rate of 15pc to make them more attractive. In July 27 auction,  the three-month T-bills offered 15.74pc, six-month 15.8pc and 12-month 15.94pc.
Bankers said the devaluation of local currency is a serious hurdle in attracting investment to T-bills as foreigner get their profits in rupee and they have to buy dollars from the market while the local currency has been losing against the greenback on a day-to-day basis. 
The rupee depreciated by over 13pc against the dollar only in July.
The government papers received a total $341.2m (T-bills: $236.9m and PIBs: $104.3m ) while the outflows were $1.055bn in the entire FY22.

6,Rupee recovers slightly,KARACHI: The volatile currency market remained calm for the second session on Monday as the US dollar lost another ...,"KARACHI: The volatile currency market remained calm for the second session on Monday as the US dollar lost another 53 paise in the interbank market to close at Rs238.84 compared to Rs239.37 in the previous session.
The greenback fell by 57 paise against the local currency on July 29. 
Though it looks very small depreciation of the greenback it was big enough to stop the free fall of the rupee, which has lost over 13 per cent in July alone.
The currency dealers explain this change in the context of a joint statement of the Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) issued on Sunday. The joint statement based on five points provided hopes for the improvement in the economy and promised inflows of dollars to strengthen the foreign exchange reserves.
“Important measures have been taken to contain the current account deficit. Measures are working: import bill fell significantly in July, as energy imports have declined and non-energy imports continue to moderate,” said a tweet from the State Bank on Monday.
“Rupee has overshot temporarily but is expected to appreciate in line with fundamentals over the next few months,” it added.
The current account deficit in FY22 was $17.4 billion which was enough to make the local currency weightless particularly due to the poor foreign exchange reserves of the SBP hovering around $8.6bn.

7,OneLoad raises $11m in funding,"EP Systems runs OneLoad, an online platform that enables micro-retailers to connect with suppliers.","KARACHI: Systems Ltd said on Monday its subsidiary EP Systems Ltd that operates in the fintech segment has secured $11 million in a funding round led by Sarmayacar and Shorooq Partners, a leading Abu Dhabi-based venture capital firm.
EP Systems runs OneLoad, an online platform that enables micro-retailers to connect with suppliers, leverage working capital options and accept digital payments. It’ll use the raised capital to launch multiple new products and expand services in the unbanked Pakistani market, the parent company said in a regulatory filing.
Speaking to Dawn, OneLoad CEO Muhammad Yar Hiraj said the startup has so far raised a total of roughly $18m in funding.
Last year, OneLoad secured capital from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In early 2020, International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank invested in the startup, which lets its users buy prepaid vouchers for all mobile companies and pay utility bills.
“Our seed funding came from Systems Ltd and IFC. The latest round falls somewhere between pre-Series A and Series A. It’s basically our first financing round after the sale of ordinary shares to IFC in 2020,” Mr Hiraj said in a phone interview on Monday.
The company reached breakeven in 2020, he said. But the startup is “marginally in cash burn” now as it’s investing heavily to strengthen itself as an electronic money institution or EMI, a non-banking entity that offers interoperable and secure digital payment products to end-users.
“The business model has been proven,” said Mr Hiraj.
The strategic collaboration with regulated financial partners and banks has led to daily disbursements worth Rs10 million-plus, which created horizons of accelerated growth for numerous micro-retailers across the country, according to the statement issued by Systems Ltd.
According to Bloomberg News, OneLoad’s android application, used mainly by small shopkeepers, is the largest non-banking digital transaction platform in Pakistan and serves several million customers each month. The platform operates through its 40,000 agents and did about $100m in transactions last year, the news service said. It wants to increase the number of daily transactions to 1m a day from the current level of up to 400,000, it added.
The World Bank estimates that about 110m Pakistani adults remain unbanked, which means the country has the third-largest concentration of unbanked population in the world.
Startups in Pakistan raised a total of $103.8m in 22 deals in the April-June quarter, down almost 40 per cent from the preceding quarter when the flows amounted to $173m.
The annual flow of funding into the country’s startup ecosystem clocked in at $350m in 2021.

8,Govt plans oil pricing on daily exchange rate,Assures OMCs of increasing margin on sale of petroleum products at par with dealers.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has decided in principle to change the pricing mechanism for petroleum products and narrow down its period to cater for the fast changing currency exchange rate and minimise losses of oil marketing companies (OMCs) and refineries. 
The government has also given a commitment to the OMCs to increase their margins on sale of petroleum products on a par with dealers who have secured 43 per cent increase in margin on petrol and 70pc on high speed diesel (HSD) to Rs7 per litre each with effect from August 1. 
The OMCs have now enhanced their demand for margins at Rs9 per litre to compensate for higher taxation impact. 
Top government officials said a recent meeting, presided over by former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and attended by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail, PM’s adviser Ahad Cheema, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) Chairman Masroor Khan, Petroleum Secretary Ali Reza Bhutta and the Pakistan State Oil (PSO) managing director, concluded that the existing pricing mechanism put in place in July 2020 had become ineffective after a steep depreciation of the rupee against the dollar in recent months. 

Assures OMCs of increasing margin on sale of petroleum products on a par with dealers

On the policy agenda is also the question of decreasing the price adjustments on a weekly or daily basis instead of the existing fortnightly basis or letting the industry set their own prices after fixing of various taxes by the government at the start of each month. The regulator would be asked to monitor the pricing mechanism in the market on the basis of set factors to avoid disorderly pricing by market players. 
In the previous fortnight alone, there had been “a very sharp decline in the exchange rate”. The rate used in the previous fortnightly price determination on July 14 was Rs209.725 against a dollar. The exchange rate used by Ogra for the prices for the first fortnight of August (1-15) 2022 is Rs236.0394 per dollar. 
While reviewing the implication of the steep exchange rate depreciation, it was suggested during the meeting that average interbank rate of the previous pricing period, rather than the rate of the last day as per July 2020 pricing mechanism, should be taken for the purpose of price calculation. The participants believed this would smooth the impact of rupee depreciation on petroleum products’ prices. 
It was noted in the meeting that the actualisation was included in the next pricing period on the basis of actual rate used for retirement of PSO’s letters of credit. There is, therefore, no impact in the revenue of OMCs and refineries. 
Subsequently, the matter was discussed with the representatives of OMCs and refineries who opposed the idea of making any change during the price review on the eve of price adjustment with effect from August 1 and wanted some time to get back with their feedback for improvement in the pricing mechanism.
