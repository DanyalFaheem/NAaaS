0,Pakistan’s path to 2026 World Cup looks treacherous again after AFC confirms format,"Pakistan, who have never won a World Cup qualifier in their history, last played in June 2019.","KARACHI: Unless Pakistan’s national football team — which hasn’t played an international match since the last three years — gets a good run of friendlies and gels quickly, its road to World Cup qualification will once again end at the first stage. 
Pakistan, who have never won a World Cup qualifier in their history, last played in June 2019 when they lost to Cambodia in the first round of qualifiers for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, which gets underway in November this year. 
Then, Pakistan were ranked among the bottom 12 among Asia’s 48 members, who had to enter in the first stage. 
And despite the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico being expanded to 48 teams from 32 — increasing Asia’s slots from 4.5 to 8.5, Pakistan are still likely to start their road to qualification in the first stage. 
That after the Asian Football Confederation confirmed the joint-qualification cycle for the World Cup as well the 2027 AFC Asian Cup on Monday, which sees the last 22-ranked Asian teams starting their campaign with a single home-and-away fixture in October next year. 
The road to the World Cup ends for the 11 countries that lose in the opening round. 
The 11 winners, meanwhile, will advance to the second round, joining the continent’s top 25 teams with the 36 then being divided into nine groups of four each which will compete in a round-robin home and away format. 
The top two in each of the nine groups advance to the third stage — the 18 teams also qualifying for the Asian Cup. For World Cup qualification, those teams will be divided into three groups of six each with the top two from each group securing a spot at the World Cup. 
Teams finishing third and fourth will then be divided into two groups of three with the group winners going through to the World Cup and the second-placed teams competing in a playoff, the winner of which will be Asia’s representative in the intercontinental playoff. 
The change this time around, unlike in the last two qualification cycles, for teams like Pakistan which went out in the first round of qualifying is that they get another crack at trying to qualify for the Asian Cup. 
While the top-ranked side in the 11 teams that fall in the first round advance to the final round of the Asian Cup qualifiers, the 10 others will compete in a playoff with the five winners also going through to the final round. 
There they will join the 18 teams that failed to make it to the third stage of World Cup qualifying with the 24 teams being divided into six groups of four each with the winners of each securing a spot at the Asian Cup. 
“The new qualification format has been established after several consultation and dialogue sessions with the AFC Member Associations (MAs), briefings with the AFC Competitions Committee, as well as the Confederation’s key stakeholders,” the AFC said in a news release. 
“The format above is based on the entry of all 47 Member Associations and is subject to change depending on the final number of entries.” 
Pakistan’s entry would’ve been missing if the FIFA suspension on the Pakistan Football Federation, which was lifted at the end of May, had prolonged till next year. 
The suspension, which was slapped in April last year after the FIFA-appointed PFF Normalisation Committee was pushed out of the headquarters of the country’s football governing body, along with the long-running crisis in the PFF has seen the national miss out on participating in international friendlies as well as tournaments, notably last year’s SAFF Championship. 
After FIFA lifted the suspension, the PFF Normalisation Committee has been keen on restoring football activity in the country but its toughest task perhaps will be to ensure that a strong national team enters the first round of World Cup qualification. 
Players have also missed out on domestic action due to the football crisis in the country and while the mandate of the NC is till June next year — by which it has to hold fresh elections of the PFF, the foundations it lays in the coming months to revive the team will be key if Pakistan are to end their dismal record in World Cup qualifiers.

1,Five-star Shamsi leads South Africa to T20 series triumph over England,SOUTHAMPTON: Tabraiz Shamsi’s maiden five-wicket Twenty20 International haul sealed South Africa’s 90-run...,"SOUTHAMPTON: Tabraiz Shamsi’s maiden five-wicket Twenty20 International haul sealed South Africa’s 90-run thrashing of England on Sunday as the Proteas completed a 2-1 series win.
The 32-year-old left-arm wrist-spinner took 5-24 as England, set 192 for victory, collapsed to 101 all out with 20 balls to spare at Southampton after losing their last eight wickets for 49 runs.
Earlier, in-form South Africa opener Reeza Hendricks hit 70 — his third fifty of the series — and Aiden Markram made an unbeaten 51 as the Proteas posted a competitive 191-5.
Recalled left-arm quick David Willey took 3-25.
Shamsi’s haul was all the more impressive given his expensive return of 0-49 in England’s series-opening win in Bristol.
But South Africa have been much improved in the field since that 41-run defeat and this win gave them a first T20 series success in England, as well as their first white-ball bilateral series victory in the country since 1998.
By contrast, defeat left England still searching for a first series win under new white-ball captain Jos Buttler following One-day International and T20 reverses against India and a drawn ODI campaign with the Proteas.
Jonny Bairstow (27) was the only England batsman to make more than 20, but Buttler and white-ball coach Matthew Mott do have at least seven matches at this level scheduled in Pakistan in September in which to turn things around before the T20 World Cup in Australia.
England’s chase suffered an early setback when Buttler was out for 14, caught at short third man off spinner Keshav Maharaj.
The out-of-form Jason Roy fell for 17, caught behind off Anrich Nortje — in after South Africa decided against risking fellow fast bowler Kagiso Rabada’s injured ankle ahead of next month’s three-Test series in England.
And when Moeen Ali was brilliantly caught one-handed by a leaping Tristan Stubbs off part-time spinner Markram, the hosts were 59-4.
Shamsi then cleaned up Liam Livingstone before taking two wickets in two balls, with Sam Curran caught in the deep before Willey was clean bowled.
Chris Jordan survived the hat-trick only to be lbw to Shamsi.
Adil Rashid holed out off Shamsi before Maharaj ended the match when he dismissed Bairstow with the aid of a catch by David Miller — a memorable way for the South Africa captain to finish his 100th T20 international.
England’s decision to recall Willey in place of Richard Gleeson reaped an early reward when he had potential dangerman Quinton de Kock chopping onto his stumps for a three-ball duck.
But South Africa recovered, with the Proteas 53-1 at the end of the powerplay.
Hendricks completed a 42-ball fifty and he then upped the tempo with three boundaries in a 16th over bowled by Curran.
He was eventually well caught by wicket-keeper Buttler off the expensive Jordan (1-52).
But Markram, back in South Africa’s T20 team for the first time since last year’s World Cup, having first provided solid support, went on to a 36-ball fifty before Miller chipped in with a quickfire 22.

The 31-year-old all-rounder, currently playing for Barbados at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, announced the decision on Twitter adding she looked forward to ”playing domestic cricket around the world.”  
“The current climate and team environment has been non-conducive to my ability to thrive and reignite my passion,” said Dottin, who made her West Indies debut in a 2008 ODI against Ireland. 
“With much sadness but without regret, I realize that I am no longer able to adhere to team culture and team environment as it has undermined my ability to perform excellently.”  
Dottin is the most-capped West Indies’ women cricketer having played 124 Twenty20 and 143 One-day Internationals for them.
She became the first woman to smash a century in T20 Internationals following her unbeaten 112 off 45 balls in a 2010 World Cup match against South Africa in St Kitts.
She has scored close to 6500 international runs and claimed 134 wickets with her medium pace.

3,Chapman ton powers NZ to seven-wicket win over Scotland,EDINBURGH: Mark Chapman completed a memorable few days in Edinburgh with an unbeaten hundred as New Zealand...,"EDINBURGH: Mark Chapman completed a memorable few days in Edinburgh with an unbeaten hundred as New Zealand comfortably defeated Scotland by seven wickets in a lone One-day international on Sunday.
Chapman followed his T20-best 83 in a 102-run thrashing of the Scots on Friday with 101 not out as New Zealand, beaten finalists in the last two 50-over World Cups, also proved too strong for their non-Test hosts in the longer white-ball format.
The 28-year-old Chapman shared an unbroken fourth-wicket partnership of 175 with Daryl Mitchell (74 not out) as the Black Caps won with 25 balls to spare as they finished on 307-3 in reply to Scotland’s 306 all out. 
“The platform which the boys up top left us was awesome, it really set up the innings,” said Mitchell. 
“It was nice to get out in the middle with ‘Chappy’ and get the job done. 
“His knock was awesome. It was nice to see him (Chapman) get an ODI hundred, I’m really stoked for him.” 
It was Chapman’s second century in seven career ODIs following his unbeaten 124 against the UAE back in 2015.
Martin Guptill (47) and opening partner Finn Allen, with exactly 50, got New Zealand’s chase off to a sound start before the fourth-wicket duo eased New Zealand home despite off-spinner Michael Leask’s 2-46.
Leask had a fine match overall, making 85 and sharing a stand of 92 with Matthew Cross (53) that kept Scotland in the game after they had slumped to 107-5.
All-rounder Leask faced 55 balls, including nine fours and four sixes.
New Zealand’s Michael Bracewell and Jacob Duffy took three wickets apiece.

In spite of losing in three sets on Sunday to Jannik Sinner on the clay final in Umag, where he was defending champion, 19-year-old Alcaraz leapfrogs the Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas who slips back to fifth.
Sinner remains 10th in the rankings which are still dominated by the Russian Daniil Medvedev.
Novak Djokovic moved up one place to sixth while Cameron Norrie also edged up one slot to 12th.
SWIATEK STAYS ON TOP
Meanwhile, French Open champion Iga Swiatek rema­ined firmly at the head of the latest WTA rankings, in spite of her shock exit in her home Poland Open last week.
Swiatek had not lost on clay in over a year before going down 6-1, 1-6, 6-4 to France’s Caroline Garcia in the quarter-finals in Warsaw.
The Pole, who has held the top spot since the surprise retirement of Australian Ashleigh Barty at the end of March, remains more than 4,000 points ahead of number two Anett Kontaveit.
With no changes at all in the top 20, the biggest jump was by Garcia whose victory over Ana Bogdan in the final in Warsaw took her from 45th to number 32.

Half-an-hour before the start of the first race it started drizzling which continued till the end of the fifth and last race of the day.
Paras Love, the four-year-old country-bred colt, took a flying start under apprentice Haroon Gulzar and kept on well finally warding off the challenge from the 25-100 favourite filly Fall In Line by three-fourth of  length at the finish line.
Bay colt Rana Gee came slithering away third, another seven lengths back in this second race of the day run over 900 metres. 
In the supporting event, the Kaghan Plate Class VII Division I (Class VI included) contested over 1,000 metres, chestnut horse Surkhab put up a scintillating display of speed to land a memorable victory to make it two wins on the trot.
The winner piloted by seasoned jockey Aamir Pervez beat the on-rushing bay Silent Assassin by half-a-length. Bay Drums Of War led the field for nearly four furlongs to eventually finish third, two lengths further away.
Trainer Rashid Latif was accredited with a fine double when he sent out  Surkhab in the fourth and Ammar Love in the fifth race to end the day in a blaze of glory.

After an underwhelming first season in French football, Messi struck 22 minutes into the traditional curtain-raiser, being played in Israel for the second year in a row.
Neymar, whose future at the club has been the source of much speculation this summer, doubled the lead just before the break with a magnificent free-kick.
Sergio Ramos added a third and Neymar bagged his second late on from the penalty spot as PSG, the reigning Ligue 1 champions, eased to victory over last season’s French Cup winners.
“It was a good match. There was a trophy on the line so we wanted to win it,” Neymar told Prime Video, drowning out rumours of his potential departure.
“If Kylian (Mbappe), Leo and myself are happy, PSG will do well,” he added.
“I hope this season all three of us will stay and it will go well.” It is the ninth time in 10 seasons PSG have lifted the Champions Trophy.
Galtier became PSG’s seventh different manager since the Qatari takeover of 2011 when he was appointed on a two-year deal in early July as the replacement for Mauricio Pochettino.
PSGs array of world class talent did not disappoint the Israeli crowd with Messi  opening the scoring in the 22nd minute, after a through ball from  Neymar that allowed him to round the goalkeeper and net from a tight  angle. 
Neymar added a second from a curling free kick on the stroke of  halftime before Sergio Ramos, who spent most of last season out injured  after his move from Real Madrid, added the third with an audacious  backheel from close range in the 57th minute.  The final goal came in the 82nd minute after Neymar was fouled by  Nantes defender Jean Claude Castelletto, who was sent off, and the  Brazilian converted the subsequent spotkick.

7,England rejoices at women’s historic Euro triumph,LONDON: England’s hungover  “Lionesses” held a victory party in central London on Monday in front of thousands...,"LONDON: England’s hungover  “Lionesses” held a victory party in central London on Monday in front of thousands of jubilant fans after they clinched the country’s first major football trophy since 1966.
A capacity crowd of 7,000 supporters packed into Trafalgar Square to give the women’s team a rapturous reception as they paraded the European championship trophy, following their 2-1 win over Germany on Sunday.
A tournament record crowd of 87,192 was at London’s Wembley Stadium to see the victory, and the BBC said more than 23 million viewers tuned in on television or online Sunday.
“We said we wanted to make our legacy about winning and that’s what we did,” England captain Leah Williamson told the flag-waving crowd in Trafalgar Square.
“The party’s not going to stop!” she added after her squad stayed up into the early hours celebrating.
“This team likes to work hard, but we definitely like to party harder.” Chloe Kelly, who scored the winner deep into extra-time, said she was  “a bit worse for wear”.
“I ain’t stopped dancing!” British royals, political leaders, and football legends have all hailed the players’ game-changing exploits.
The men’s team failed last year to conquer Europe, falling short in the final to extend a winless streak stretching back to the 1966 World Cup, the only previous major trophy won by a men’s or women’s England senior team. 
But above all, it highlighted the huge strides made in the women’s game in the country, where the Football Association (FA) banned women’s football for nearly 50 years in 1921. 
Having twice fallen at the final hurdle, it proved to be third time lucky for England as the class of 2022’s memorable run throughout the tournament lifted spirits all around the country. 
“The Championships and your performance in them have rightly won  praise,” Britain’s Queen Elizabeth said in a letter to the Lionesses.   “However, your success goes far beyond the trophy you have so deservedly  earned. 
“You have all set an example that will be an inspiration for girls and women  today, and for future generations.”  Sarina Wiegman’s team have been  unstoppable as they scored a record 22 times during the tournament,  including an impressive 4-0 thumping of second-ranked Sweden in the  semi-finals.
“I think we really made a change. I think this tournament has done so  much for the game but also for society and women in society in England  but I also think in Europe and across the world and I hope that will  make a (bigger) change too,” Wiegman told a news conference  shortly  after it had been interrupted by the team coming in, dancing and singing  around her with a rowdy rendition of the England anthem  “It’s coming  home!” — the 1990s football song officially called  “Three Lions”.
“These Lionesses have raised the bar. They have changed the way women’s football is viewed in this country,” former England International Alex Scott, who hosted the Trafalgar Square celebration, told BBC TV.
The previous day a similar number watching the final in Trafalgar Square had erupted with euphoria. Some people dived into its famous fountains, fittingly watched over by the square’s four lion statues.
David Baddiel, who recorded it with fellow comedian Frank Skinner and pop group Lightning Seeds for the men’s Euro 1996 tournament, said the Lionesses had helped redefine the sport.
“Football is not by default owned by men,” he told BBC radio.
“It’s the same game, played by women or played by men.
“And what’s totally brilliant in the last sort of few weeks is the sense that the country can get behind it in entirely the same way.”

It was a night of milestones at the Sandwell Aquatic Centre as moments earlier South African Chad Le Clos had joined shooters Michael Gault and Phil Adams as the most decorated Games athletes ever when he snatched his 18th medal by picking up a silver in the men’s 200 metres butterfly. 
Australia then ended the evening with a bang, powering to gold in the women’s 4x200m relay in a world record time of seven minutes, 39.29 seconds, smashing the old mark of 7:40.33 set by China at the Tokyo Olympics. 
Madison Wilson, Kiah Melverton Mollie O’Callaghan and Ariarne Titmus, with a brilliant anchor leg, came home a massive 12.69 seconds clear of Canada, who finished a distant second to take silver while England completed the podium. 
McKeon’s 50m freestyle win follows earlier victories in the mixed 4100 freestyle and womens 4100 freestyle relays to sit alone atop the gold medal table ahead of fellow Australian swimmers Susie ONeill, Ian Thorpe and Leisel Jones. 


LONDON: Gold medallist Laura Kenny (C) of England celebrates with silver medallist New Zealand’s Michaela Drummond (L) and bronze winner Maggie Coles-Lyster of Canada during the medal presentation ceremony for the women’s 10km scratch race of the Commonwealth Games at the Lee Valley VeloPark on Monday.—AFP

 
McKeon, winner of seven medals at last year’s Tokyo Olympics, was able to share the landmark moment with Meg Harris and Shayna Jack who joined her on the podium taking silver and bronze respectively. 
“It is special,” said McKeon.  “It makes me reflect on the last eight years since my first Commonwealth Games and I can see how far I’ve come as a person and an athlete.” 
Le Clos’ milestone comes 10 years to the day since he beat American great Michael Phelps in the same event at the 2012 London Olympics. Swimming out of lane five, the same lane he beat Phelps from, Le Clos was beaten to the wall by Lewis Clareburt with a winning time of one minute, 55.60 seconds. 
However, he could not be denied a place in the record books after finishing just 0.29 seconds back of the New Zealander to snatch silver ahead of England’s James Guy. 
“I’m gutted not to have won, I’ll be honest,” said Le Clos, adding he plans to be top the podium before the end of the Games.  “I would’ve cut my finger off to win tonight. It meant everything to me and my family everyone’s in the stands, my friends flew out for this race. 
“Fair play to Lewis, he had a great race. He said he watched me growing up and I said, ‘man, did you have to do it on my day?   “Could you not have given me one more time?” 
A three-time Commonwealth Games champion in the event, Le Clos looked like he might make it four leading with 50m to go but the 30-year-old would be overhauled down the stretch by Lewis, who adds the 200m butterfly title to the 400m individual medley gold he won earlier at the Sandwell Aquatic Centre. 
Le Clos’ medal haul from four Commonwealth Games includes seven gold, four silver and seven bronze. 
His trophy case also contains four Olympic (one gold, three silver) and seven world championship medals (four gold, one silver, two bronze). 
The rugby sevens came to a conclusion in Coventry with South Africa inflicting more Commonwealth Games woe on Olympic champions Fiji. 
The South Africans won 31-7 — Muller du Plessis scoring two tries — to regain the title they won in 2014, but for the Fijians it was their fourth silver medal. 
The distraught players sank to their knees at the final whistle. 
New Zealand men took the bronze, beating bitter rivals Australia 26-12. 
There was further disappointment for Fiji in the women’s final as they lost 22-12 to Australia. 
There was a second gold for England’s Alex Yee as the hosts won the triathlon mixed relay title.

9,"Haider Ali ends fifth in weightlifting, Jahanara Nabi breaks national record at CWG","England’s Christopher Murray set a new Games record en route to winning the gold medal, lifting an overall total of 325kg.","BIRMINGHAM: Haider Ali started off well. Lifting 135kg on his first attempt on the snatch during the men’s 81kg weightlifting final at the Commonwealth Games on Monday, he raised hopes of ending Pakistan’s wait for a medal at the Games by building on that.
It wasn’t to be.
Haider attempted 140kg on his next two tries but was unable to do so. Sitting joint-seventh, he needed to do better in the clean and jerk.
He lifted 161kg in the first attempt but as he went for 169kg in his second, he seemed to be relaxing his left arm.
A successful 170kg lift in the third attempt saw him finish with a total of 305kg but it was only good enough for fifth place.
England’s Christopher Murray set a new Games record en route to winning the gold medal, lifting an overall total of 325kg (snatch 144kg; clean & jerk 181kg).
Australian Kyle Bruce got silver with 323kg (143kg+180kg) while Canadian Nicolas Vachon picked bronze with 320kg (140kg+180kg), narrowly pipping India’s Ajay Singh who finished on 319kg (143kg+176kg).
In the pool, there was a Pakistan 1-2 in the second heat of the women’s 100m freestyle but both Jahanara Nabi and Bismah Khan failed to make it to the semi-finals.
Jahanara, however, broke her national record by 0.16 seconds after clocking a minute 1:01.51 to finish 40th among 55 competitors who started. Bismah finished 47th overall after a time of 1:02.59.
In the women’s 100m backstroke heats, Mishael Ayub clocked 1:22.12 and finished third-bottom among 28 competitors.

10,"Will pursue FIH if interference in PHF affairs continues, Khalid Sajjad Khokhar tells govt officials","PHF president, who currently stands de-notified from his post, said he was committed to following federation's constitution.","LAHORE: Pakistan Hockey Federation president Khalid Sajjad Khokhar will look up to the sport’s world governing body if the government continues to interfere in the federation’s affairs.
Khokhar apprised Pakistan Sports Board director general Asif Zaman and Minister for Inter-provincial Co-ordination Ehsan-ur-Rehman Mazari on Monday.
The PHF president, who currently stands de-notified by the PSB from his post, told the officials that he was committed towards following the federation’s constitution — which was in line with International Hockey Federation’s (FIH) statutes — to conduct its elections, which were due in May.
It was the PHF’s failure to meet the deadline for the polls in the first place that made the PSB de-notify Khokhar, along with secretary Asif Bajwa and the federation’s treasurer. Khokhar had rejected the step.   
“I have talked to both DG PSB Asif Zaman and the federal sports minister and have informed them that I am duty-bound to follow the PHF’s constitution, which is aligned with the FIH,” Khokhar told Dawn on Monday. 
“The talk was held in a very good atmosphere and we have reached at a consensus that all the issues including the release of the financial aid of the PHF will be solved after the ongoing Commonwealth Games. 
“Everyone knows that the international sports federations do not like the interference of the government in the affairs of the respective sports federations, so, in the national interest, all the matters will be discussed and will be resolved amicably after the games.” 
Khokhar is currently in Birmingham, where he travelled to with the Pakistan contingent for the Games.
Following Khokhar’s de-notification, the PSB last week had appointed a four-member committee to run the PHF’s affairs and conduct the elections in the next 30 days.
One of the members of the committee, Nasir Ali, had also announced the name of the election commissioner for the polls. However, according to the PHF constitution, only the federation’s president has the authority to make appointments.  
Khokhar, in a show of power and also to reject PSB’s move, named Haider Hussain as the PHF secretary after the committee was named.
The committee, interestingly, had made the announcement of the election commissioner’s appointment through the PHF’s media Whatsapp group, which implied that the PHF had surrendered to the PSB.
However, Khokhar’s talks with the government officials clearly indicate that he is adamant to uphold his constitutional right as the PHF president to hold the elections.
In the recent past, the PSB has interfered in the matters of the Pakistan Olympic Association and the Pakistan Football Federation, despite clear stance from the both the bodies’ respective parent organisations against government interference. 
While the world football governing body FIFA has slapped Pakistan with multiple bans in the last decade, the International Olympic Committee was not very far from suspending Pakistan’s membership.
Dawn tried to reach DG PSB Asif for a comment, but he did not respond to the approaches.

11,Mosaddek replaces Nurul as BD captain for Zimbabwe T20 decider,DHAKA: Bangladesh have named all-rounder Mosaddek Hossain to lead the side in the series-deciding third Twenty20...,"DHAKA: Bangladesh have named all-rounder Mosaddek Hossain to lead the side in the series-deciding third Twenty20 against Zimbabwe in Harare on Tuesday.
Mosaddek replaces Nurul Hasan as captain after the wicket-keeper/batsman was ruled out of the rest of the tour with a finger injury he sustained in Sunday’s seven-wicket win in the second match.
The three-match series in Harare is locked at 1-1 after Zimbabwe won the first by 17 runs.
Mosaddek led Bangladesh’s comeback with a career-best 5-20 in the second match.
A Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) statement on Monday also said that the experienced Mahmudullah Riyad will replace Nurul in the squad.
Mahmudullah, who led Bangladesh’s T20 side for 43 matches until this series, is already in Zimbabwe as part of the One-day International squad.
He was rested for the T20 series because Bangladesh were trying to rebuild following 11 defeats in 13 matches since October 2021.
Bangladesh will play three ODIs against Zimbabwe on August 5, 7 and 10, all of them at the Harare Sports Club.

12,Saudi Arabia among four countries interested in hosting Women’s Asian Cup,"KUALA LUMPUR: Saudi Arabia, Australia, Jordan and Uzbekistan have submitted Expressions of Interest to host the 2026...","KUALA LUMPUR: Saudi Arabia, Australia, Jordan and Uzbekistan have submitted Expressions of Interest to host the 2026 Women’s Asian Cup, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said on Monday. 
If selected, Saudi Arabia, whose women’s football team only played its first match in February this year, will host its first official international women’s tournament. 
Although recent reforms have given women in Saudi Arabia more freedoms, many of their rights remain restricted. Saudi women were banned from attending fixtures in stadiums until 2017. 
Australia last hosted the Women’s Asian Cup in 2006, while the 2018 edition was played in Jordan. Uzbekistan have not previously hosted the tournament. 
“The AFC will now work with all Bidding Member Associations on the delivery of the necessary bidding documentation in accordance with the bidding process with a decision to be finalised and communicated in 2023,” the AFC said. 
The winning bid will be announced next year and the AFC hailed the growing popularity of the tournament. 
China claimed a record-extending ninth Women’s Asian Cup title after beating South Korea in the final of the 2022 tournament, which was hosted by India and expanded from eight to 12 teams. 
The 2026 edition “is expected to build on the solid foundations of the tournament’s celebrated legacy”, the AFC said.

13,Barcelona sells 25 per cent stake in audiovisual studio to Socios.com,BARCELONA: Spanish football club Barcelona sold a 25% stake in its audiovisual studio to digital fan token firm...,"BARCELONA: Spanish football club Barcelona sold a 25% stake in its audiovisual studio to digital fan token firm Socios.com for 100 million euros ($102 million), club chief Joan Laporta said on Monday, as the La Liga giant steps up efforts to bring in revenue to register new players.
Socios.com will come on board as a technology partner accelerating Barca’s blockchain, non-fungible token and Web3 strategies. Socios.com owner and technology provider Chiliz will take a strategic stake in Barca Studios.
“Barca Studios includes (in its portfolio) metaverse, NFTs and Barca tokens. It’s the sale of a stake ... it’s in principle forever, we could recover it if something happens,” Laporta said at a news conference to unveil new signing Jules Kounde, who was bought from Sevilla.
Barca has been using several mechanisms to increase its revenue in order to offset losses, reduce debt and fulfil La Liga’s financial fair play rules.
Socios.com will support Barca in its efforts to build new digital connections with its global fan base of 400 million.
The deal comes after the club last month sold a further 15% stake in its La Liga TV rights to US private equity group Sixth Street, giving Sixth Street a 25% stake.
The club signed Brazil winger Raphinha from Leeds United and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich following a first investment from Sixth Street when it bought 10%.
Laporta, who presided over one of Barca’s most successful periods between 2003 and 2010, said in August 2021 that the club’s debts totalled 1.35 billion euros, with 673 million owed to banks.
In June, Barca approved the sale of a minority share of its licensing and merchandising division and the cession of up to 25 per cent of its income from its La Liga TV rights.
The club has also signed a shirt and stadium sponsorship deal with Spotify in an agreement worth 280 million euros and approved financial plans in December to renovate Camp Nou, including raising an additional 1.5 billion euros in debt.
