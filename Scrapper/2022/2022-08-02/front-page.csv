According to an official statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “A Pakistan army aviation helicopter which was on flood relief operations in Lasbela, Balochistan lost contact with ATC [air traffic control]”.

 





 
Six individuals were on board including the Commander XII Corps Lt Gen Sarfraz Ali, who was supervising the flood relief operations in Balochistan. Some reports also suggested that Pakistan Coast Guard Director General Brigadier Amjad Hanif Satti, was also on board the missing chopper.
According to the military’s media wing, a search operation was under way at the time of going to press, and more details would be released as information became available.

Commander XII corps among six persons on board; local volunteers enlisted to help as difficult terrain hampers search and rescue efforts

Talking about the search operation, Deputy Inspector General of Police Khuzdar Range Pervez Umrani told Dawn that police and Frontier Corps personnel were conducting a joint search operation for the last five hours.
Police sources told Dawn that area where the chopper went missing was mountainous terrain, without even jeep paths, making it extremely difficult for search and rescue parties.
“Either you go on foot or motorcycles or conduct aerial surveillance,” a senior official said.
Other difficulties include lack of cell phones coverage and no electricity. Police are said to have engaged the services of local volunteers to assist with the search operation.
Military personnel and equipment, including helicopters, have been engaged in relief operations in the flood-hit districts of Balochistan for weeks now.
On Monday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was also in Balochistan alongside National Disaster Management Authority head Lt Gen Akhtar Nawaz.
A distinguished officer
On Nov 25, 2020, Gen Sarfraz Ali, who was serving as a major general, was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General. Following his promotion, he was posted as the corps commander of XII Corps, which is also known as the Southern Command, in 2021.
Before his posting to the Quetta corps, he served as the inspector general of the Frontier Corps in South Balochistan, director general of Military Intelligence, and commander of the 111 Brigade in Rawalpindi. He had also served as defence attache at the Pakistani embassy in the United States.
Outpouring of concern
As the reports of the helicopter’s disappearance spread, several key figures expressed concern and prayed for the safety of all those on board.
While expressing “great concern” over the incident, President Arif Alvi prayed for the safety of the passengers, according to a tweet from the Presidency’s official account.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted: “The reports of missing helicopter of Army Aviation are very concerning. The whole nation bows in front of Allah for safety and return of personnel involved in flood relief operations.”

 





 
In a tweet, Punjab Chief Minister Parvez Elahi wrote, “I am praying for the passengers. May Allah protect all army officers on board.”

 





 
PTI chairman Imran Khan wrote: “Disturbing news of army aviation helicopter missing and praying for all those on board.”

 





 
PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz also prayed for the safety of the officers.

1,All eyes on ECP as PTI funding verdict due today,Imran calls for protest outside ECP offices to seek CEC’s resignation.,"ISLAMABAD: As the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is set to announce much-awaited verdict in the 2014 prohibited funding case against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday, the PTI that managed to get resolutions against Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) passed from two provincial assemblies announced protest outside the ECP office in Islamabad on Aug 4, seeking the CEC’s resignation.
A three-member bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja and comprising Nisar Ahmed and Shah Mohammad Jatoi, will announce the verdict that the ECP reserved on June 20 after hearing arguments from both sides.
The verdict is being announced amid a stepped up campaign against the CEC after the commission reserved the judgement and comes days after an investigative report published in the Financial Times revealed how 2.12 million dollars collected in the UK through a charity cricket match landed in PTI’s accounts, exposing the role played by business tycoon Arif Naqvi in the process.
The case, which was filed by PTI founding member Akbar S. Babar, has been pending since Nov 14, 2014. Mr Babar had alleged serious financial irregularities in the party’s funding from Pakistan and abroad. Mr Khan and his party leaders have denied any wrongdoing, and maintains the funding is not from prohibited sources.

Imran calls for protest outside ECP offices to seek CEC’s resignation

On January 4, the ECP’s scrutiny committee, formed in March 2018 to examine the PTI’s foreign funding within a month, finally submitted its report after nearly four years during which it conducted as many as 95 hearings. The report, based on eight volumes of record requisitioned through the State Bank of Pakistan, confirmed that the PTI leadership had committed gross violations of funding laws by allowing the collection of millions of dollars and billions of rupees without any source and details from foreigners, including Indian nationals and foreign companies.
The report confirmed that the PTI received funding from foreign nationals and companies, under-reported funds and concealed dozens of its bank accounts. It also mentioned a refusal by the party to divulge details of large transactions and the panel’s helplessness to get details of PTI’s foreign accounts and the funds collected abroad. It also calls into question the certificate, signed by PTI chairman Imran Khan, submitted along with the details of PTI’s audited accounts.
According to the report, the party under-reported an amount of Rs312 million over a four-year period, between FY2009-10 and FY2012-13. Year-wise details show that an amount of over Rs145m was under-reported in FY2012-13 alone.
The report also referred to the controversy over allowing four PTI employees to receive donations in their personal accounts, but said it was out of the scope of its work to probe their accounts.
However, the PTI had been insisting on clubbing foreign funding cases against all the parties and deciding them together, the ruling coalition had been demanding an early announcement of the verdict for many days.
Meanwhile, red zone security has been put on high alert ahead of the ECP s verdict in the PTI foreign funding case. It has been decided to deploy 1,000 police personnel. The anti-riot force will also remain in the red zone. Unrelated persons will not be able to enter the Red zone.
PTI to protest outside ECP on 4th
The PTI chairman on Monday called for protest outside the ECP, demanding CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja’s resignation. He said: “The assemblies of KP and Punjab have passed resolutions against the CEC showing that they have lost confidence in him. The commission should under no circumstances conduct the next general elections.”
Speaking at the party’s national council, Mr Khan said the PTI government tried its best to introduce Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) to ensure free and transparent elections but the CEC sabotaged all their efforts to secure the system of rigging for the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).
Earlier on July 30, Mr Khan had declared to move a reference against the CEC in the judicial commission, accusing him of meeting leaders of the ruling PML-N. The decision was criticised by ECP officials as well as the PPP that termed it an ‘attempt to blackmail’ the commission.
PPP leader Saleem Mandviwalla earlier said the PTI was trying to avoid decision of prohibited funding case. “Imran Khan himself used to praise the CEC and now [he] has been trying to threaten him. What has happened that has shattered the confidence of Mr Khan in the CEC. Though we have apprehensions, we will stand by the ECP,” he added.

2,Shujaat extends olive branch to Elahi,Asks him to put an end to differences;  says “false narratives” being spread regarding split in PML-Q.,"

ISLAMABAD: PML-Q Secretary General Tariq Bashir Cheema grimaces as party chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain addresses a press conference at his residence on Monday.—Tanveer Shahzad / White Star

 
ISLAMABAD: Amid a widening rift between the Chaudhrys of Gujrat, Pakis­tan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q) President Chaudhry Shujaat on Monday extended an olive branch to his cousin Chaudhry Parvez Elahi asking him to put an end to differences.
At a press conference in Islamabad, Mr Shujaat, who was flanked by PML-Q leader Tariq Bashir Cheema, told media persons that “false narratives” were being spread regarding the split within the party. He added that those close to Mr Elahi — who became Punjab chief minister with the support of PTI — issued “false” statements.
The PML-Q leader talked in detail about the reasons that led to discord between him and Mr Elahi. He, however, called for the reunion of the party that has split into two camps following the rift over the election of the Punjab CM.
The party also appeared in no hurry to take the matter to the Election Commi­ssion of Pakistan (ECP) for the disqualification of the MPAs who voted for Mr Elahi despite a letter by the president stating otherwise.
As Mr Shujaat is facing health problems and his speech was difficult to comprehend, most of the questions by the media were answered by Mr Cheema. Responding to a query regarding disqualification of the PML-Q MPAs of Punjab, Mr Cheema responded on behalf of the party president that the detailed judgment of the Supreme Court was being awaited and the legal team will take a decision after that.
During the press conference, the PML-Q president spoke about the economy of the country and said it was a “wrong precedent that the army chief had to interfere”. “We all have to understand why the army chief had to request the Americans to help Pakistan in these tough times,” he said, adding that if the situation was not controlled then managing the economy could become difficult.
Editorial: It is for Islamabad, and not Rawalpindi, to handle the delay in disbursement of IMF funds
He also added that the politicians must be careful in hurling accusations against each other as the politicians were a “soft target” and everybody will get out of the situation without a scratch but the politicians will find themselves in trouble.
During the presser, Mr Cheema said that the removal of Chaudhary Shujaat as the head of the PML-Q was “illegal” and it was not possible that the founder of the party could be removed by the Punjab chapter of the party.
“The central executive committee of the party has not even met; I am the secretary general, and the central office bearers, including the provincial presidents, are here present in this press conference,” Mr Cheema added.
He added, “But I want to tell one thing that any kind of blame game targeting Chaudhary Salik, me, or anybody is just akin to opening Pandora’s Box and that it was a sign of immaturity.”
“Power and position are transitory but I would request Chaudhry Parvez Elahi not to divide the family and not to break the party,” Mr Cheema implored the newly-elected Punjab CM.
Mr Cheema added that a message to Mr Elahi was relayed that he should be the candidate of Chaudhry Shujaat instead of Imran Khan. “This message was conveyed three hours ahead of the polling for the slot of the chief minister,” Mr Shujaat chipped in. He said they did not stand with “incompetent” Imran Khan and that the impression that PPP chief Asif Ali Zardari trapped the PML-Q was baseless. “Neither Ch Shujaat nor Ch Parvez Elahi was immature politicians who could be swayed by anybody,” he added.
Exchange of hot words
Mr Cheema also exchanged hot words with Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain, a brother of the PML-Q chief, during a show on ARY News in the evening. In a heated debate, Mr Hussain, who appeared on the show via telephone, accused MNA Cheema of creating a rift in the Chaudhry family – a charge the lawmaker vehemently denied. Mr Cheema said the deal had been finalised with the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) by Ch Shujaat but it was broken by Mr Elahi.
Mr Cheema, taking a jibe at Wajahat Hussain, said he was still standing with their brother Shujaat while they had abandoned him for the sake of power.

3,Inflation burden hits 14-year high in July,"Transport index sees biggest year-on-year rise of 64.7pc; perishable food items up by 32.9pc, non-perishable food items by 28.1pc.","

• Transport index sees biggest year-on-year rise of 64.73pc
• Perishable food items up by 32.93pc
• Non-perishable food items 28.12pc
ISLAMABAD: Rising food and energy prices saw inflation surge by 24.93 per cent — the highest jump in over 14 years — in the first month of the new fiscal year.
The month-on-month incre­ase in inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 4.35pc in July, compared to the previous month, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics on Monday.
The spike comes as fuel prices skyrocketed since the last week of May after the new coalition government scrapped costly fuel subsidies in an attempt to tame the surging fiscal deficit and revive the stalled International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme.
The last time prices accelerated so fast was in November 2008, when CPI was recorded at 24.3pc. The index has since mostly remained below 15pc with a few exceptions. It was a sharp increase in the headline inflation — May at 13.8pc and June at 21.3pc.
On a year-on-year basis, the transport index saw the biggest rise of 64.73pc in July, followed by perishable food items 32.93pc, non-perishable food items 28.12pc, restaurants and hotels 24.97pc, alcoholic beverages and tobacco 22.48pc, housing and utilities 21.78pc and furnishing and household equipment maintenance 19.69pc.
In other categories, education and communication saw inflation at 9.79pc and 4.09pc, respectively, recreation and culture 15.41pc, clothing and footwear 14.57pc and health 11.22pc.
The country has been struggling with high inflation for the last few months. Despite rising global oil prices, the then prime minister Imran Khan went ahead with fuel and power subsidies in March as he faced mounting discontent over his handling of economy and rising inflation.
Mr Khan was ousted in April through a vote of no confidence in parliament, and the new government began reversing the costly subsidy and brought it on a par with global price two months ago.
Apart from CPI, other inflationary indicators like Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) also saw substantial spikes in July. SPI rose to 28.2pc in July from 21.7pc a month earlier and 16.2pc in the same month last year. WPI stood at 38.5pc in July compared to 38.9pc in the previous month and 17.3pc a year ago.
Last week, the Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for July reported that the year-on-year inflation, which has remained in double digit since November 2021, would continue in July. The outlook said that not only international commodity prices, especially oil and food, but a depreciation in the exchange rate also influenced domestic inflation. It conceded that inflation, mostly in the last two months, was also coming from supply shocks, the impact of which has overshadowed government’s efforts to maintain prices.
The outlook warned that the prevailing political unrest was causing governance problems and intensifying market uncertainties already caused by low foreign exchange reserves and external pressures.
Official data showed that food inflation remained on the higher side in July, as it shot up to 27.4pc year-on-year and 4.3pc month-on-month in urban areas, whereas the respective growth in prices in rural areas was 29.6pc and 3.7pc — a reversal of the trend where urban areas usually experience higher food prices.
At the same time, prices of ghee, cooking oil, meat, fruit and vegetables also registered a persistent increase in major urban and rural centres and traders took undue advantage of an ineffective price regulatory system.
Food items whose prices rose in July compared to the previous month included vegetables (25.14pc), pulse gram (13.87pc), onions (13.65pc), potatoes (10.87pc), besan (10.01pc), wheat (9.76pc), pulse mash (9.73pc), pulse masoor (9.01pc), tea (8.98pc), eggs (8.09pc), cooking oil (7.66pc), wheat flour (6.34pc), gram whole (5.36pc), rice (5.16pc), vegetable ghee (5.11pc), milk (3.84pc) and pulse moong (2.67pc). In urban areas, however, the prices of tomatoes declined by 12.46pc, fruits by 7.11pc and chicken by 3.02pc.
A similar trend was noticed in the prices of essential food items in the rural areas.
Non-food inflation in urban centres increased to 21.3pc year-on-year and 4.6pc month-on-month, whereas in rural areas it rose to 24.5pc and 4.6pc, respectively. The increase in non-food inflation was mainly driven by unprecedented rising oil prices.
In the non-food category, the items whose prices saw an increase in July from the previous month included electricity charges (39.35pc), motor fuel (7.35pc), construction input items (3.18pc), washing soap/detergents/match box (2.45pc), cotton cloth (2.21pc), liquefied hydrocarbons (1.99pc), electrical appliances (1.48pc), plastic products (1.40pc) and furniture & furnishing (1.30pc).
The core inflation in urban areas was 12pc in July against 11.5pc the previous month. In rural areas, the increase was 14.6pc against 13.6pc. This shows that the increase in interest rates also could not stop the upward trend in core inflation.

4,Bill seeking to limit JCP powers lands in Senate,"Bill, moved by Farooq Naek, seeks to give parliamentary committee “meaningful” say in appointments of superior court judges.","ISLAMABAD: A landmark constitution amendment bill, seeking to limit the powers of Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) in the appointment of superior courts’ judges and giving the parliamentary committee a “meaningful” say in the process, landed in the Senate on Monday.
The private member’s bill, moved by former chairman of the upper house and ex-law minister Farooq Naek, was referred by the Senate chairman to the Standing Committee on Law and Jus­tice with the direction to submit its report within 15 days.
Explaining the salient features of the bill, Senator Naek told the house that the JCP for the purpose of appointment of Supreme Court judges presently comprises Chief Justice of Pakistan, four SC judges, a retired SC judge, the law minister, Attorney General and a senior advocate.
Noting that the balance was heavily tilted in judges’ favour, he said the amendment proposes to exclude one of the four sitting judges and the retired judge to make it a seven-member panel.
Likewise, the composition of the commission for appointment of high court judges has also been proposed to be changed to reduce its total strength from 13 to 11.
Mr Naek said he would not like to speak about allegations of favouritism in the appointment of judges, but pointed out that Constitution was silent on the criterion of advocates to be picked for judicial appointments.
Mr Naek said the bill proposes an initiation committee to propose names within 60 days after a vacancy occurs in a high court. The proposed committee should be headed by the chief justice of the respective high court and comprise next two senior most judges, the advocate general and a bar council member.
Editorial: Supreme discontent
The bill proposes to provide for the appointment of senior most judge of the high court as chief justice on the pattern of Supreme Court.
Regretting that the parliamentary committee on appointment of judges had become a mere rubber stamp in the absence of its defined powers, he said under the proposed amendment, the committee on receipt of a nomination from the commission shall examine the credentials, capability, moral and financial integrity of the nominee and may confirm the nominee by majority of its total membership within 30 working days, failing which the nomination shall be deemed to have been confirmed.
He said the eight-member parliamentary panel would be able to reject a nomination by three-fourth of its total membership.
Mr Naek said the parliamentary committee’s decision shall not be called into question in any court on any grounds whatsoever.
He asserted that it was for the parliament to make a law while it was the job of the judiciary to interpret it and bureaucracy to implement it.
“We want independent as well as efficient judges,” he remarked.
Mr Naek also proposed a committee of SC’s retired judges to monitor the performance of high court’s judges.
