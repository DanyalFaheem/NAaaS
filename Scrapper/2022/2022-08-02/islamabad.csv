0,Protesting teachers close offices of education authority  in Rawalpindi,Demand withdrawal of notification for appointment of District Education Authority chief executive officer.,"RAWALPINDI: Teachers and clerks associations on Monday continued their protest against the appointment of District Education Authority (DEA) chief executive officer and closed offices of the authority.
They threatened to close all government schools and offices on Tuesday.
Punjab Teachers Association, All Pakistan Clerks Association and other teachers associations joined hands against the appointment of Azam Kashif as the DEA chief executive officerby the Punjab Education Department.
The protesters led by Raja Aurangzeb, Raja Shahid Mubarrak, Raja Tahir and Shahzad Manzoor staged the protest on Murree Road in front of the DEA offices and locked the offices. 
The newly-appointed CEO did not take charge on Monday also.
The participants of the protest were carrying placards and chanting slogans in favour of their demand. 
They demanded that the provincial government and Chief Minister Pervaiz Ellahi should take notice of the issue and withdraw the notification.
The speakers said that the newly-appointed official was not competent enough and his behaviour with teachers and subordinate staff was condemnable in his last two tenures.
They said the government should respect the dignity of the teachers and other school staff and protect them from humiliation. They said it was beyond their understanding why the education department appointed the person third time in the district.
They said teachers and clerks had no political motives and they wanted that the government should give them respect and protect them. 
They said they did not want any specific person for the head of the department and the government should appoint any BPS-19 officer of the education department.
They warned that if the notification was not withdrawn, all government schools would be closed from Tuesday.

1,Non-implementation of IHC directions on stray dogs in Islamabad concerns ombudsman,Civic agencies told to come up with compliance reports on 22nd.,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Ombudsman Secretariat on Monday came down hard on civic agencies for failing to devise a policy on stray dogs and not setting up a shelter and vaccination centre as residential sectors, public parks and markets have seen growing number of stray dogs.
Secretary Federal Ombudsman Secretariat Ejaz Ahmed Khan chaired a meeting to discuss the issue related to stray dogs and proposed a shelter and vaccination project.
The meeting was attended by officers of the Capital Development Authority (CDA), Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI), Ministry of Climate Change, Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) and the health ministry.
The secretary showed concerns over the failure of stakeholders in devising a policy and setting up a shelter and vaccination centre in line with the orders of Islamabad High Court (IHC) issued in 2020.

Civic agencies told to come up with compliance reports on 22nd

He said last year, the IHC had directed that a policy to neutralise stray dogs and setting up a shelter and vaccination centre, adding that it was a matter of concern that so far all concerned departments had failed to comply with the court’s judgement.
The meeting was informed that approval of a summary for devising a policy about stray dogs was required from the cabinet. To this, the secretary said there was no need to get approval for such a policy from the cabinet rather the departments concerned should finalise the policy at the earliest.
When the secretary asked about the shelter and vaccination project, the CDA officials said they had not received any feasibility and proposal from the MCI in this regard. 
The secretary showed his displeasure over the MCI and directed it to move an application to the CDA. 
He also asked all stakeholders to come up with compliance reports in the next meeting on Aug 22.
In the past, the CDA/MCI used to kill stray dogs but the IHC stopped them from shooting and poisoning them with the direction to devise a policy to neutralise such dogs.
The IHC had passed the judgement on a petition filed by Faryal Nawaz, the co-founder of an Islamabad-based NGO — Help Welfare Organisation.
Before the IHC’s verdict, personnel from the sanitation directorate of the civic agency used to shoot down stray dogs in residential areas.
When contacted, an MCI official, who attended the meeting, said the corporation, the CDA and capital administration would soon hold a joint meeting to devise a mechanism. 
In the next meeting, a progress report would be submitted to the ombudsman office, he added.
When contacted spokesperson for the ombudsman office, Javed Chaudhry, said the office would get the IHC orders fully implemented.
“Today, the secretary expressed displeasure over the failure of stakeholders to implement the IHC orders and the subsequent directive of the ombudsman office,” he said.

3,PTI seeks de-notification of all its MNAs,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Monday filed a petition in Islamabad High Court (IHC) against ...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Monday filed a petition in Islamabad High Court (IHC) against acceptance of the resignation of its 11 members  of the National Assembly (MNAs) terming it “piecemeal” and requested the court to direct the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to de-notify all 123 MNAs.
The petition cited Speaker National Assembly, the ECP, the secretary Cabinet Division and former deputy speaker Qasim Khan Suri as respondents.
It said after the regime change, the PTI leadership decided to tender resignation from the National Assembly since it was seeking a fresh mandate from the people of Pakistan.
It said that in pursuant to the decision of a meeting of the parliamentary party held in Parliament House on April 11, 2022, as many as 123 MNAs tendered resignation before the deputy speaker which had been accepted.
However, the incumbent NA Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf withheld these resignations and did not forward it to the ECP on the pretext of “so-called verification of the resignation”.
It added: “Now after the lapse of around three and half months, the speaker NA approved the resignation of only 11 MNAs of the PTI” and forwarded these to the ECP which has de-notified them.
“The impugned act of the so called verification of resignation of PTI MNAs conducted by the present speaker of the National Assembly and his purported approval of the resignations and forwarding the same to the ECP in a piecemeal manner, despite the fact that all the 123 resignations of the PTI MNAs had already been accepted on April 11 by the then speaker, as well as the impugned act of the ECP to de-notify the PTI members in the piecemeal manner, are unsustainable,” the petition added.
It requested the court to direct the speaker NA to approve all the PTI MNAs’ resignation. The petition requested that the direction be given to the ECP to de-notify these members.

4,PMC claims PMDC did nothing for WFME accreditation,Defunct council’s official rejects claims,"ISLAMABAD: While Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) has alleged that the defunct Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) did nothing to get accreditation from the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME), the documentary evidence showed that the PMDC had initiated the process which could not be completed owing to the council’s suspension and subsequent dissolution.
The PMC, which has recently initiated the accreditation process, released a statement on Monday, saying that the PMC was working in close coordination with the US regulatory authorities to ensure that there would be no hindrance to the accreditation of Pakistani medical graduates in the US.
It claimed that the erstwhile PMDC did not apply for the accreditation as it warned against rumour mongering. However, as per an official bulletin published by the PMDC ad-hoc council in 2018, it was announced that “PMDC is a member of WFME through Association for Medical Education in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (AMEEMR) and is in the process of getting recognition of WFME”.
The bulletin further stated that the “matters regarding accreditation of the PMDC with WFME has been taken up by the ad-hoc council, which was earlier discontinued. Application for accreditation has been submitted to WFME”.

Defunct council’s official rejects claims

Former PMDC president Dr Shabbir Lehri told Dawn that he had started the process in 2017 and even submitted Rs7 million in fees for the planned inspection visit.
“In 2016, I went to the US and the authorities concerned expressed apprehensions about the standards and quality of education in the Pakistani medical colleges; however, I assured them that their concerns will be removed,” Dr Lehri said.
“Later a delegation headed by WFME President Prof Dr David Gordan visited Pakistan and we arranged their visit to CMH Rawalpindi, CMH Lahore and Aga Khan University in Karachi,” he said.
The delegation was impressed and it was decided that an inspection team will visit Pakistan for which an amount of Rs7 million was deposited as the inspection fee, he said, adding that the visit did not materialise because the PMDC was dissolved.
Dr Lehri suggested that stakeholders from the health sector should be involved to get the accreditation of WFME, otherwise Pakistan may miss the deadline.
It is worth mentioning here that the Lahore High Court through its order dated Dec 7, 2017, dissolved a 35-member council of the PMDC. An ad-hoc council was constituted with seven members headed by former Justice Mian Shakirullah Jan.
The PMDC was first dissolved through the Pakistan Medical Commission Ordinance 2019, and replaced later by Pakistan Medical Commission Act 2020.

7,Former PM to hold ‘all parties conference’ on Kashmir,MUZAFFARABAD: Former Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) central...,"MUZAFFARABAD: Former Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) central vice president Raja Farooq Haider has announced that an ‘all parties conference’ (APC) of Kashmiri leadership will be organised to hold threadbare discussion on a host of issues confronting the liberated and occupied territories of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The exact date and venue of the conference would be decided in consultation with the invitees in the next couple of days, he said in a statement, the other day.
Mr Haider, who led the PML-N government in AJK from 2016 to 2021, declared that the conference would discuss Kashmir issue in the aftermath of India’s unlawful and oppressive action of August 5, 2019 that deprived occupied Kashmir of its special status as well as the arbitrary conviction and sentencing of JKLF chief Yasin Malik.
Apart from that, the alleged plans to reverse the powers of the AJK government and Legislative Assembly through the proposed 15th amendment, law and order situation in AJK and establishment of a controversial ‘tourism authority’ in violation of Article 52(c) of Constitution would also be the key subjects of debate, he added.
Mr Haider, whose government had approved the widely appreciated 13th constitutional amendment in 2018 stripping the AJK council of its administrative, fiscal and executive powers, has ever since repeatedly declared that “any attempt to shift the acquired powers back to the infamous council would be thwarted with full force”.
“We got rid of the hegemony and corruption of this disreputable institution [AJK council] after a long and tiring struggle and eventually strengthened the elected government in Muzaffarabad constitutionally, administratively and financially,” he said.
He maintained that at present the council was a redundant institution and could not be revived in its previous “colonial form”.
In the changed scenario, the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan was enough for contacts between the Azad Kashmir and Pakistan, he said.
“A lot of water has flown beneath the bridges… It should be clear to all quarters that no Kashmiri will accept the undoing of 13th amendment in any form,” he added.
The former AJK prime minister said he had decided to convene a conference to provide a platform to Kashmiri leadership to take a collective firm and comprehensive stand on issues of common concern.
Mr Haider was the head of the AJK chapter of PML-N from December 2010 to December 2021. Earlier this month he was elevated as party’s central vice president.

Acting Country Public Affairs Officer at the embassy in Islamabad Aaron Tarver concluded the three-day conference. It was offered in a hybrid mode with 60 alumni participating in person in Islamabad while others joined virtually.
The conference offered 25 interactive sessions, led by English language specialist from the United States Dr Lynn Zimmerman and Pakistani English language teaching experts, enabling participants to learn different tools and techniques required to acquire intercultural knowledge, attitudes, skills and awareness in the English language.
Addressing conference attendees, Mr Tarver recognised the work of the Pakistani English teaching community and acknowledged their enthusiasm, motivation and perseverance towards their own professional growth, which has motivated the US to provide $24 million to fund English language programmes in the country.
“This event is another opportunity for the United States and Pakistan to celebrate 75 years of diplomatic relations, but more importantly to celebrate 75 years of friendship,” he said, adding that, “we are collaborating closely on many valuable projects across the spectrum – supporting Pakistan’s goals to be a more prosperous and healthier nation though trade and investment, entrepreneurship support, and long-standing support in public health, including providing over 60 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, and of course, education. You and your students are the exciting next chapter of that relationship”.
Meanwhile, the War on Welfare (WoW) Health, with the power of over 350,000 US specialist doctors, has brought Second Opinion Service in Pakistan. Specialists that cater to over 70 specialties will provide expert opinion on complex health conditions like spinal deformities, Parkinson’s disease, stroke and cancers.
Patients have to submit their medical reports to the WoW Health, and their team takes care of the rest. Second opinion can generate a whole new treatment plan, or just peace of mind.
According to a statement, dealing with health issues can be one of the most difficult and challenging situations to face. As soon as a patient is diagnosed with a medical condition and they have received treatment recommendations, important decisions have to be made.

The teachers have been directed to join the FDE within one month. The directorate, through a government-owned testing agency, hired 253 teachers. The top scores in tests were called for interviews and the week-long interview process was completed last week.
Last year, the FDE had hired 337 teachers through the said testing agency. The directorate, which is the regulator of 423 colleges and schools of Islamabad, had recruited teachers without involving the testing agency in 2009. This gave rise to controversy as allegations were made that teachers were appointed on pick and choose basis. Later, an inquiry was conducted and it was revealed that incompetent teachers were hired.
However, this time round, FDE’s spokesperson Abdul Waheed said all recruitments were made on merit.
“We hired service of National Testing Council (NTC) – a subsidiary of Higher Education Commission (HEC). The top scoring candidates were interviewed and selected,” he said, adding that all recruitments were made purely on merit.
He said in the past, the FDE used to hire majority of teachers of the arts group that resulted in shortage of subject specialist teachers.
The spokesperson said FDE Director General Dr Ikram Ali Malik had decided that only subject specialist teachers would be hired and that too through a government-owned testing service.
He said teachers were also being hired through the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC).
“We are hopeful that after joining of these teachers, our schools will have good strength of teachers as 337 teachers, who were hired last year, have already joined. Collectively, we have around 590 teachers while a number of teachers have joined us through the FPSC,” he added.
