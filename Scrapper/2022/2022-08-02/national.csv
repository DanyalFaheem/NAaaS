0,KP Assembly passes resolution for removal of ECP chief,"Resolution causes commotion in house as opposition parties strongly protest the move, calling it against parliamentary traditions.","PESHAWAR: The Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on Monday passed a resolution expressing “serious reservations” about the Election Commission of Pakistan and demanded the immediate resignation of the chief election commissioner and ECP members.
The resolution, which was moved by the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, caused a commotion in the house as the opposition parties strongly protested the move, calling it against parliamentary traditions.
“On the basis of undeniable evidence, this house expresses serious reservations against the Election Commission and demands that the sitting Chief Election Commissioner and all its members should resign forthwith so all political parties constitute non-controversial and acceptable commission, which is also a need of the hour,” said the resolution.
Finance Minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra requested Idrees Khan Khattak, who chaired the proceedings, to give him the floor to move an “important resolution”. The chair relaxed the rules and asked the mover to present the resolution. Mr Jhagra hurriedly read the resolution, which was passed with majority.

ANP assails govt, alleges TNSM ‘restored by PTI’

The opposition members were not allowed to speak on the merits or demerits of the resolution. This caused rumpus in the assembly.
The resolution also condemned ouster of the PTI government in the centre “as part of an international conspiracy” and said that the move caused political uncertainty and adversely affected the economy. It sought snap elections as a way out of the present crises.
After passing the resolution, the chair gave the floor to Awami National Party (ANP) parliamentary leader Sardar Hussain Babak. He said that passing the resolution in such a hurry was against the parliamentary norms and traditions.
“If PTI wants fresh elections in the country then it should dissolve KP and Punjab assemblies first where they have governments,” he said. He lamented that no one from treasury benches was talking about the economic crisis and a ban on trade with Afghanistan. He alleged that the PTI ministers were paying “ransom to Taliban” and termed PTI chief Imran Khan Taliban Khan. He claimed that the Tehreek-i-Nifaz-i-Shariat-i-Muham­madi (TNSM) had been “restored by the PTI government”.
Maulana Lutfur Rehman of the JUI-F said that passing the resolution in haste was against the democratic norms.
PML-N parliamentary leader Sardar Muhammad Yousaf also condemned the resolution. He said that only three lawmakers of the PTI had signed this resolution.
One bill was tabled in the assembly. The Commerce and Trade Statistic Bill, 2022, proposes collection of statistics relating to commercial and trade activities for promotion of trade in the province.
Minister for Finance Taimur Salim Jhagra tabled the bill. He said that the collection and use of statistics of trade and commerce were of immense importance in strategising commercial activities.
He said that the statistics on commercial and trade activities are very helpful and could be used in planning effective trade, commerce and investment policies for achieving boost in economic activities.
The house also passed the KP Medical Officers of Health Department (Regulari­sation of Services) Bill, 2022, the KP Lissa­ail-e-Wal Mahroom Foundation (Amend­ment) Bill, 2022 and tabled the KP Finance (Amendment) Bill 2022 in the House.
The house accepted an adjournment motion of Naeema Kishwar of JUI-F for holding a debate on the uncertainty and casualties due to heavy downpour in prevailing monsoon season.

2,IHC moved against yet another PAC decision,ISLAMABAD: Former chairman of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Javed Iqbal approached the Islamabad High...,"ISLAMABAD: Former chairman of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Javed Iqbal approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC), challenging the decision of the Public Accounts Com­mittee (PAC) that barred him to head the Com­mission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances.
Not only the PAC but also the IHC, in its recent order, termed the commission a “liability”.
The Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances was established in 2011 and Justice Iqbal has been heading it since then. It was formed to trace the missing persons and fix responsibility on individuals or organisations behind such cases.
As per a recent report of the commission, only one third of the missing persons have returned homes since the establishment of the commission.
In his petition, Justice Iqbal cited Secretaries Parliamentary Affairs, Interior, PAC and National Assembly as respondents. He stated: “All these directions are beyond the scope and ambit of the jurisdiction vested in the Public Accounts Committee as envisaged in Rule 198, 201(5), 202 and 203 of the Rules of the Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, framed under the provision of Article 67 of the Constitution.”
The petitioner argued the PAC direction “is evidently in contravention to the mandate of law and the prescribed Rules of Procedure. These violations are beyond jurisdiction and in complete oblivion to the due process of law.” He requested the IHC to declare the PAC’s direction as void.
Acting Chief Justice of the IHC Aamer Farooq will hear the petition on Tuesday (today).
Earlier on July 7, the PAC in its meeting observed since a serious allegation had been levelled against former NAB chairman, who was also heading the commission, he should not hold such office.
The PAC also decided to approach Prime Minister Office over this issue.
While hearing missing persons’ cases, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah on June 23 observed, “Retired Justice Javed Iqbal has become a liability and failed to justify its existence.”

3,Sindh CM seeks larger bench in disqualification case,Murad contends current bench ‘not properly formed’.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court was requested on Monday to constitute a larger bench in place of the current three-judge bench that is hearing a review petition against Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah.
The bench, consisting of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar, is slated to take up the review petition moved by Roshan Ali Baririo seeking Mr Shah’s disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution for possessing dual nationality and having an iqama or work permit. Mr Baririo is Mr Shah’s political rival.
On Jan 23, 2019, the apex court had rejected a petition while questioning the returning officer’s (RO) April 6, 2013 order which disqualified Mr Shah by stating that RO was not a court of law.
On Monday, an application was moved on behalf of the chief minister highlighting that one of the members in the bench was a member of the election tribunal who, instead of hearing the case, should have recused himself from the bench.

Murad contends current bench ‘not properly formed’

Mr Shah’s application highlights that Justice Yahya Afridi was a member of the bench which had rejected the original petition in Jan 23, 2019, now being considered by the court through the review petition.
It said Justice Afridi was not a member of the present bench and therefore it should be considered that the bench has not been constituted properly to hear the review petition. He contends that the review petition should not proceed in the absence of Justice Afridi.
According to the application, it was a requirement of Order 26, Rule 8, of the Supreme Court Rules that as far as practicable, the plea for the review should be fixed before the same bench which earlier delivered the judgement sought to be reviewed.
Since Justice Afridi continues to be a judge of the Supreme Court and thus available to be a member of the bench, he should be included in the bench, Mr Shah pleaded.
The application also cited the 2021 Justice Qazi Faez Isa judgement in which the apex court had held that in the constitution of a review bench, the CJP should ensure substantial compliance with Order 26 Rule 8 by including the author judge, if available in the review bench, but where it was not practicable to do so then there was no obligation to have exactly the same judges in the bench.
The applicant also reminded the court that a separate application by him for the formation of a larger bench was already pending before it. He said it is clear in view of the circumstances and importance of the matter that a larger bench ought to be constituted.
In the original petition, Mr Baririo had pleaded that Mr Shah was allegedly neither righteous nor sagacious and therefore should be disqualified for life on the grounds that he was earlier disqualified for having dual nationality.
The petition had pleaded that Mr Shah was a Canadian national and his nomination papers were rejected by the RO for possessing dual nationality. The RO also held that Mr Shah was neither honest nor ameen.
However, the apex court had raised question over the RO acting as a court of law, adding that Mr Shah had applied for renouncing his citizenship on Sept 29, 2012 and got certificate from the Canadian authorities about the cancellation of his citizenship on July 18, 2013.

4,NA bill suggests capital punishment for officials over deaths in custody,Bill about prevention of drug addiction and smuggling of drugs also passed; MNA of ruling coalition slams govt over petrol prices.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assem­bly on Monday passed a bill suggesting severe punishment for public office holders found responsible for death of suspects in custody.
Another bill about prevention of drug addiction and smuggling of drugs was also passed.
During the question hour, Noor Alam, a PTI dissident who recently joined the ruling coalition, lashed out at the government for unbridled petrol prices in the country, saying despite a decline in its rate in the international market, the government was increasing the prices here.
The bill called “Custodial Death Prevention and Punishment Bill-2022” was presented by Minister of State for Interior Abdul Rehman Kanju. The bill is aimed at protecting a person during custody from all acts of torture perpetrated by public officials. The bill, which has been sent to the standing committee concerned, suggests death penalty under Section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) for those public office-holders who are found guilty of custodial death.

MNA of ruling coalition slams govt over petrol prices

The house was apprised that the law will be enforced across the country.
“Any statement, information, and confession to be obtained by public official as result of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment would not be acceptable as evidence in the court of law and no action could be initiated against the victim,” the bill said. According to it, the guilty public office holder would face one-year imprisonment, or a fine of Rs100,000, or both. In case a person dies in custody, the officials responsible for it will be given the same punishment as prescribed under Section 302 of the PPC.
According to the bill, the offence will be non-bailable and there will be no provision of reconciliation. The convicted official will have to file an appeal in a high court in 30 days and investigation against him will be conducted in a month’s time.
Another bill moved by Minister for Narcotics Control Shahzain Bugti to amend the Control of Narcotics Substances Act, 1997 {The Control of Narcotics Substances (Second Amendment) Bill,2022l, was passed by the assembly.
Minister for Federal Education, Professional Training, National Heritage and Culture also moved a bill to establish Iqbal Academy for promotion of the thought of Allama Iqbal.
Noor Alam said the prices of petroleum products were declining the world over while they had been increased in Pakistan, adding that the industrial sector had been badly affected.
The MNA complained that Finance Minister Miftah Ismail did not attend the NA sessions. “Let him (finance minister) sell candies as he has failed to run the country.”
Mr Alam demanded waiver of fuel adjustment charges for people in the areas where electricity was generated through dams.
Leader of the Opposition Raja Riaz demanded provision of compensation, medicines and relief goods to the people badly affected by flash floods in the country.
During the question hour, minister Riaz Pirzada condemned the restrictions on taking out Azadari (mourning) processions during Muharram.
Maulana Akbar Chitrali condemned a statement of PTI chairman Imran Khan that all those sitting in the National Assembly were Mushrik (non-believers). “Shirk (non-believing) is only related to Allah Almighty, meaning no political party can be called Mushrik ,” he added.
Minister Ayaz Sadiq called for formation of a parliamentary committee to ascertain a Financial Times report that “exposed foreign funding” of the PTI. “I will request the Election Commission to immediately announce (verdict) in the (prohibited funding) case as the party has received funding from India and Israel,” he claimed.

7,Imran’s Instagram account ‘briefly hacked’,PTI chief says govt has lost credibility at national and international levels,"ISLAMABAD: The Instagram account of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan was briefly hacked on Monday with the hackers using it to share a cryptocurrency link on his profile.
Mr Khan, who served as the prime minister of Pakistan before his ouster in April this year, has 7.4 million followers on the social media platform. A screenshot of Tesla chief Elon Musk’s tweet was also shared through his account.
PTI social media head Dr Arslan Khalid said the account was hacked at about 4pm and due to two-factor authentication the party managed to recover it within 15 to 20 minutes. “According to my understanding, initially Mr Khan’s email was hacked, and then it was used to hack his Instagram account,” he told Dawn.
Earlier, speaking at the party’s national council, Imran Khan said that intra-party elections would be held in the PTI after the general elections. The party will use technology to ens­ure transparency and meritocracy since the PTI has become the largest political party in the country, he added.

PTI chief says govt has lost credibility at national and international levels

He also stressed the need for working on the party’s ideology as “some of the party members do not know about its ideology”.
He stated that the PTI chose its leaders through the Insaf Students Federation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by holding elections within the student body. “We are going to follow the same process…” he added.
Comparing his party with the PML-N and PPP, Imran Khan said that there was no concept of merit within these parties. He alleged that the ruling parties were not interested in fixing the economy as they were only interested in ending corruption cases against themselves.
Imran Khan said that the government imposed through an alleged foreign conspiracy had lost its credibility both nationally and internationally to an extent that Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had to request the IMF for the loan.
He demanded that an emergency should be imposed in the country at this time so that no one should be able to send money abroad. He added that those who could have “stopped the conspiracy are also responsible for what is happening in the country”.
Comparing his party government’s performance with the coalition government, he said that his government collected record tax revenue during its tenure and claimed that the external deficit was $500 million in March and now it had touched $2.6 billion.
“Inflation in our government was 17 per cent and today it has reached 38 per cent. My government provided the most jobs during the Covid-19 crisis,” he added.

A concept paper in this regard has been published on the SECP website for public consultation.
DAMCs have the potential to increase the investor base by reducing paperwork, providing services remotely, and leveraging customer data.
In Pakistan, there are currently 21 AMCs with a total of Rs1.2 trillion assets under management.
The mutual fund industry in Pakistan has only approximately 320,000 investors (0.14 per cent of the total population) which means this segment of capital markets is under-penetrated in comparison to other international jurisdictions.

11,Omani firm to assist PR in laying tracks,Pakis­tan Railways will sign an agreement with the company this week under which firm will provide an initial financing of $500m.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakis­tan Railways will sign an agreement with an Omani investment company this week under which the firm will provide an initial financing of $500 million for the construction of rail tracks between Gwadar and Jacobabad, Sindh.
The total cost of the project has been estimated at Rs1.2 trillion.
Dr Anvwar Al Balushi, chairman of the Anvwar Asian Investments, is currently in Islamabad to finalise the agreement.
Anvwar Asia Investment Company, which is recognised as a leading global facilitator in project financing, had signed a memorandum of understanding earlier this year with Pakistan Railways. It was facilitated by Railcop, which prepared feasibility report of the project.
The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor aims to connect Gwadar port to China’s Xinjiang province through railways, highways and pipelines to pump oil and gas.
According to the feasibility report, prepared by Railcop, the country’s existing railway infrastructure is not equipped to sustain the massive load likely to arise upon completion of CPEC projects.
The existing network is composed of ML-1, which begins at Karachi and ends at Peshawar; ML-2, between Kotri and Attock; and ML-3, from Rohri to Taftan.
Dr Balushi held a meeting with Najm Saeed, the chief executive of Railcop, in Islamabad on Monday and discussed with him prospects for investment in more infrastructure projects.
The Omani company has also shown interest in other railway projects.
The Railcop CEO drew attention of the Omani investor to Balochistan’s rail network, saying the outdated system impeded trade between Pakistan and neighbouring countries.
