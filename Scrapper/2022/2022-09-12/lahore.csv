0,PPP raps govt for purchase of vehicles for Punjab cabinet members,PPP's Hassan Murtaza says CM Parvez Elahi has not yet visited any flood-hit areas.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan People’s Party has criticised the Parvez Elahi’s Punjab government for allocating millions of rupees for purchase of new vehicles for members of cabinet at a time when people of the province are drowning in floods.
PPP Punjab Secretary general Hassan Murtaza said here on Sunday the people were drowning in floods in south Punjab, while the provincial government was buying vehicles worth millions for the protocol of the cabinet members.
“I just want to ask if the protocol of the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues is more important than the rehabilitation of the flood victims.”
He regretted that the chief minister had not yet visited any flood-affected area and was instead either paying visits to Bani Gala residence of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman or arranging public meetings for Imran Khan.
The national treasury should be spent on the welfare of the people and not the luxury of the rulers, the PPP leader said, warning that the rulers’ indifference would cost them dearly in the elections.
Mr Murtaza said the chief minister should consider the public interest while making decisions as the people were crying because of inflation and the provincial government was sleeping.
Information secretary Shehzad Saeed Cheema, meanwhile, cautioned that some court decisions could lead to political instability in the country. In the absence of a uniform standard of justice, the country might face chaos, he warned.
Apparently, in a reference to the “soft treatment” given to Imran Khan by the Islamabad High Court in the case of hurling threats at a woman judge of the lower judiciary, he said “giving concessions” to one and “humiliating” the other would not resolve the matters, cautioning that verdicts given on the basis of popularity of a political figure and his ability to mobilise people would set a negative trend in the judicial history.
“Despite all the insults being hurled by the Ladla (favourite), the relief being given to him is a question mark on the justice system.”
Meanwhile, PPP Lahore chapter Information Secretary Faiza Malik told a press conference here that the party has set up flood relief camps all over the city, being joined by a large number of people.
She said while the world was calling for extending help to the flood-hit people of Pakistan, the PTI was engaged in “petty politics”, arranging one public meeting after the other and thus diverting public attention from the plight of the people displaced by the calamity. “Except in federation and Sindh, the PTI has governments all over Pakistan. But, instead of working for the people affected by the floods, it is collecting donations for the by-polls in nine constituencies,” Ms Malik regretted. 
She demanded the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) should order audit of the Rs5 billion funds reportedly collected by Imran Khan in a telethon in the name of flood-hit people.
PML-N: The PML-N observed death anniversaries of Father of the Nation Muhammad Ali Jinnah and of Kulsoom Nawaz Sharif here on Sunday.
Quran Khwani was held at the City office of the party which was attended by MNA Kiran Dar, MPAs Kanwal Liaquat, Rabia Nusrat, Farzana Butt, and Tayyaba Zameer, Irm Chaudhry, Farzana Muneer, Nargis Mateen, Tahira Aziz, Sana Farhan, Dr Nusrat, Shehzadi Kabeer and others.
Paying homage to the efforts of the founder of Pakistan, various speakers said that the people were breathing as independent citizens of Pakistan only because of the efforts of Mr Jinnah.
They also paid tributes to the former first lady late Begum Kulsoom and said that she was a proud mother and wife. The way she stood up against General Musharraf’s dictatorship during the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD) and led the party was praiseworthy.

2,Health organisation rudderless after resignations,One of the major reasons of the crisis is said to be undue interference in the administrative matters of the Board of Directors.,"LAHORE: The Punjab Health Facilities Management Company (PHFMC) is heading towards a ‘crisis’ due to the internal rifts putting at stake the healthcare services to a large number of patients at the primary health facilities. 
It is evident from the fact that after the resignation of three directors of the high-powered board of the company, more officials are thinking of quitting it. 
One of the major reasons of the crisis is said to be undue interference in the administrative matters of the Board of Directors which is unable to enjoy autonomy for the last many months. Set up under section 42 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, the Company is running 13,96 primary level health facilities in 14 districts of Punjab, including district headquarters hospitals, rural health centres, basic health units and dispensaries. 
The districts include Lahore, Faisalabad, DG Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, Lodhran, Sahiwal and Kasur. Thousands of patients from peripheries and other towns visit these state-run health facilities to get primary level healthcare. 
An official told Dawn on Sunday that for the first time the company was functioning without the Board of Directors for the last two months or so. He said that under the Companies Act 2017, the Board of Directors was given ‘powers’ to maintain its autonomy and independent position in order to discourage the bureaucratic interference. 
For this, four independent members were appointed from the private sector and they were assigned key roles to discharge its core functions. They were vested powers to draft and circulate policies, approve and dispense annual budget to the tune of Rs5.5 billion, employment of thousands of doctors, nurses and other staff and create posts. 
Most importantly, he said, the Board was authorised to appointment four key and top officers -- the chief executive officer of the company, chief internal auditor, chief financial officer and company secretary. These are high-profile statutory posts and the officers appointed against these top slots played a decisive role to run the PHFMC, the official said. 
He added that it was quite unfortunate that out of four directors of the company, three have resigned from their post “in protest’ against the undue interference of the bureaucracy.” 
Some of them left the organisation when CEO Naseem Sadiq resigned from his office reportedly to protest against interference by some elements.
The directors who resigned were Dr Sohail Ahmad, Huma Maqsood and Dr Javeria Manan, leaving Dr Arshad Usmani as independent director.
The official said these officials had experience to run the government and private sector institutions in the past. Like, he said, Dr Sohail had served as health secretary Punjab in 2004-5 and was key person behind the establishment of Rescue 1122 and a mega programme to convert single-ward emergency departments of the government hospitals of Punjab into multi-storey buildings under Strengthening Emergency Medical Services.
Similarly, government sector Multan and Faisalabad Institutes of Cardiology and Children’s Hospital, Multan were also established during his period as secretary health Punjab. 
Being president of Thalassemia Society of Pakistan, Dr Javeria Manan also played a key role to run the the programme for the minor children in Punjab while Huma Maqsood was providing services for an international organization to produce trained human resource in corporate sector in the country. 
In the resignation letters, the officials alleged that the behaviour of ex-officio directors of the company had forced them to tender resignation. They were unable to perform duties/services because of the undue interference of the ex-officio directors of the Board, they said.

3,Harking Back: City of learning slowly ‘unlearns’ … to our peril,"In these testing times have you ever been to a library, or an archives collection, of even a museum? Attendance is a...","In these testing times have you ever been to a library, or an archives collection, of even a museum? Attendance is a measure of a nation’s mental health. Lahore, the city of learning, it seems has unlearnt itself.  
Of recent a few well-known persons of the sciences and arts have been writing about learning in the media, and how we as a people have stopped reading and questioning. The media stands invisibly gagged, and if one tells the truth they can ‘disappear’ in the name of patriotism, which anyway has been described by sages as “the pastime of scoundrels”. But let us stick to concrete examples.  
When was the last time you visited a library? Have you ever heard of the Punjab Public Library in Lahore? Established in November 1884 in the ‘baradari’ of Wazir Khan, it was built in the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jehan, just behind the present Lahore Museum on The Mall. It is the place where Maharajah Ranjit Singh collected his forces to attack and conquer Lahore in 1799.  
Later, when the East India Company took over in 1849 in its surroundings was set up Lahore’s first cantonment. In its lawns was built what came to be called Tollinton Market, the first Exhibition Hall of Lahore. My suggestion to our readers is that they visit this library and see for themselves its condition. Precious books lie scattered all over the place. It is the house of the finest Sanskrit collection donated by Prof Alfred Woolner (1878-1936) whose statue stands opposite the Lahore Museum, and the only one spared by our ‘single-subject’ zealots.  
But as far as rare books and serious research goes, this is the place to visit. Its administration consists of 14 persons, ten of them serving bureaucrats, two retired bureaucrats, a lawyer and one ‘official’ educationist. A tour of the massive library showed most sections empty. On three different visits each time one managed to dust old rare books. It is, if anything, a reflection of the state of our ‘least interested’ bureaucracy. Officially, so the handout claims, almost 250 books, mostly official notifications, are issued every working day.  
In the Mughal-era structure of Wazir Khan’s ‘baradari’ are placed newspapers, where a few interested persons, mostly aged, go through a few newspapers. To my utter amazement there were three youngsters, all reading ‘something’ on their mobile phones. It is a reflection of the times in which we live.  
Let us walk over to the nearby Punjab Archives building inside the Punjab Secretariat. It is located in the tomb of Anarkali. So one seat of learning in a tomb and the other in a Mughal ‘baradari’. The massive archives date back to the 17th century from the times of the Mughal emperor Akbar. The oldest file is dated 1629. This absolutely world class archives collection has well over seven million files of events from Mughal times to the present, covering an area from Multan to Kashmir and from Kabul to Delhi.  
What more can Lahore wish for? It is the world’s second largest collection of the area and era after the British Museum Archives. But then this is out of bounds for the people of Lahore and elsewhere. You will need special ‘high official’ permission to visit it. On one occasion the ‘clerk’ asked me what would I do with the rare document sought. “I will stuff it” was my angry youthful response.  
This amazing rare archives collection is divided into two sections. One inside the tomb, all neat and clean and impressive for visitors, and the massive overwhelming remaining thrown in the old horse stable of the Sikh era. In an earlier column I had described its condition, but very briefly it needs repeating.  
‘As I entered the locked horse stable the stench of urine flowing from a nearby washroom could be seen, let alone smelt. Paper, all looking ancient, lay falling from makeshift open wooden cupboards. I picked up a paper, partially wet. It was a letter from the legendary poet Mirza Ghalib to the East India Company wishing that his pension be restored’. Need more be said?  
This was bureaucracy at its best. Lest one forgets to inform that the Archives, or a very small part of it, are allegedly being ‘digitalised’. Offers to help from leading foreign universities have been refused. The best thing is that the technology being used is well out of date. But then such technology changes every ten years, or now even lesser. Who is bothered about such detail!  
Much later one learnt that the then chief secretary wished for a larger rest room and had the gardeners throw these papers in the horse stable. Education does strange things to those in power. My view is that with time the learning acquired by rote has been unlearnt. Reason and history have no longer a role in current governance, exceptions apart one must say for safety sake.  
Let us skip over to the old walled city of Lahore. There was a time when every street with shops had an ‘Anna Library’. Here the people of the area, mostly women one can say with happiness, borrowed books to read in their spare time. It was that learning that produced the finest brains of the city. But then even these have shrunk, with a handful left. The ‘unlearning’ has started at the grassroots.  
Let us move from the common person to the posh areas. We see the old Lawrence Hall in the old Lawrence Gardens. This was initially known as Company Bagh, and after 1947 as Jinnah Gardens. It housed the Old Lahore Gymkhana Club. In the 1980s Gen Ziaul Haq ordered that the club be shifted and a library be set up. Officially it has 125,000 books, magazines, newspapers in three different languages. This library attracts a small stream of students in search of textbooks.  
There are other libraries that suffer the same fate, that being a lack of attendance. The ones I have visited include the Dyal Singh College library, the LUMS library, the Model Town library, and, naturally being an old Ravian, the Government College library. All of them are well endowed but the attendances is unimpressive, except for LUMS and GC. The reason for the last two being that active are the students wishing to find a workplace.  
Let me share a funny story about libraries. There is a small library in the Punjab Assembly in Lahore, which when I was a political reporter in my youth I would visit. Most of the times I was alone. The librarian always welcomed me with the remark: “Thank the Lord someone has come”. As one ages and comments more than reports, one can understand the reasons.  
So the process of ‘unlearning’ the little that we pick up because of our rote method of school examinations is before us. Becoming a principal is now more a question of seniority than competence. The outcome is a conspiracy-minded set of ‘literates’ … or should we even call them that.

He gave a cheque of Rs15m to Lahore Press Club President Azam Chaudhry and announced to increase the annual grant of the Photo Journalists Association to Rs1m. He administered oath to the members of the LPC Governing Body. 
Addressing a ceremony organised in honour of the Lahore Press Club office-bearers and members at the CM’s Secretariat, Mr Elahi said he would ensure the system of donations for flood relief and their usage mechanism to be transparent. He wondered why Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was trying to convince the UN secretary general by holding his hand regarding the transparent usage of the funds.
“Shehbaz Sharif knows how to ask for money and the nice manner in which he can ask for money, no one else can do so,” Parvez Elahi said and added that nothing else could be expected from Shehbaz Sharif and Miftah Ismail (the federal finance minister). 
The chief minister said the Punjab government was providing solar tube wells to the flood-affected farmers and Pakistani citizen and American Businessman Tahir Javed would also provide assistance for providing solar pumps to the flood-hit. 
He announced a police patrol post would be set up in the Journalists Housing Society to control the land grabbers. 
“A message has been conveyed to the inspector general of police that land grabbing on the plots of the members of the Lahore Press Club would not be tolerated,” he added. 
Parvez Elahi announced that on getting appropriate land, Phase-II of Journalists Housing Society would be launched. He also announced a free surgery facility would be provided to the LPC members. 
If there was a vacant place, he said, the allottees of the B-Block Press Club would be provided an alternate place. He said the grant amounting to Rs20m would be made a part of the budget for the club. He said the assistance would also be provided to pay the life insurance premium of the members of the club.

10,"Government plans to tame 13 hill torrents of Sulaiman Range, says minister",DERA GHAZI KHAN: Provincial Finance Minister Mohsin Leghari has sought the project concept one (PC-I) of a...,"DERA GHAZI KHAN: Provincial Finance Minister Mohsin Leghari has sought the project concept one (PC-I) of a comprehensive plan for the channelisation of hill torrents of the Sulaiman Range from the irrigation department to include the project in the next budget to avoid further disaster and meet the challenges of climate changes. 
Mr Leghari told Dawn the provincial government wanted to initiate work on a comprehensive plan to tame the waters of hill torrents and had asked the secretary of irrigation to prepare the PC 1 of the comprehensive plan so that the provincial government could allocate funds for the yet-to-be conceived projects. There are 13 hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur districts. 
Once these mountain drains or hill torrents were the main sources of traditional irrigation systems based on the collective volunteer labour of the farmers of the arid zone of trans-Indus districts. With the passage of time, the farmers abandoned the traditional irrigation mode of ‘pachad’ or arid zone. They started to install water turbines and encroached on most of the natural paths leading toward the River Indus. 
Mr Leghari said the foremost priority of any intervention would be to revive and improve the mountain drainage network in trans Indus districts. 
In the foothills and ‘pachad’ area, there used to be traditional ‘wahs (water channels excavated by farmers)’ and ‘wakras (small dykes separating the fields)’ which were maintained by the local community work known as ‘kamara (collective community work)’. 
There used to be a system overseen by the ‘darogha rodkohi (vigilance done by local elders)’, which imposed ‘tawaan (plenty)’ on the violators for not doing community service of their share. 
Now, a modern drainage network by the irrigation department exists in the plains area, which consists of Old Manka, New Manka and Qutab Drain. There is a dire need to construct new drains, rehabilitate the existing drains, enhance their capacity and link them to the Indus River with a proper outfall structure. 
Mr Leghari added at present there was no better safe passage to carry hill torrents of water towards the River Indus. The provincial finance minister, who is also a farmer of the ‘pachad’ zone, said that it was imperative to remove the hindrances to flow both in the “patched” as was done earlier by the community, and proper channelization to carry the waters to the Indus River. He suggested the revival of the traditional and natural paths for clear drainage passage to the Indus river and added dispersion structures to mitigate the momentum of gushing waters are also necessary. 
He suggested small ponds wherever feasible to lessen the water that comes down with a destructive force. Regarding long-term solutions, he said, there is a need for mid-level dams, in the long run, to store water and develop a proper command area.
Talking to Dawn, progressive farmers, residents of the ‘pachad’ Akhtar Hassan Gorchani and Umer Waqas Ahmedani were of the opinion that management of natural resources has unfortunately been poor in Pakistan. Some institutions, including government agencies, have already developed such plans, particularly, after the 2010 floods, which could not be implemented even after the passage of 12 years. 
“Now we have been knocked again in 2022 and this might be a final warning this time,” said Mr Gorchani, the former Intelligence Bureau chief. 
“Our poor development approach and ill-planned infrastructure remained offensive intrusion and confrontation against historical water channels in the Sulaiman Range. Flood plan management is the immediate thing to start in Pakistan. This plan, if we succeed to do it, can turn water into the power that our country has already been short of. Another critical thing to do is to strengthen institutions (NDMA and PDMA) that has a responsibility to address such situation. They must adopt modern techniques and concepts of DRR: Disaster Risk Reduction.”
Mr Ahmedani calls the belt along and in between the Sulaiman Range and Indus River the “belt of Gold” in addition to being a “lifeline” for Pakistan. 
He is right as the area that grows cash and staple food crops like cotton, wheat, rice and tobacco can be called the ‘lifeline of Pakistan’.

According to Pilac officials, the step is being taken because of a number of reasons, including running round-the-clock transmission of Punjabi FM radio channel, FM 95 Punjab Rung and access to the Punjabi Complex from the Ferozepur Road during closure of the premises during matches in the stadium. 
The other objectives included upgrade of the security mechanism at the Punjabi Complex. 
Pilac Director General Dr Sughra Sadaf says the institute is situated in the Nishtar Complex. Its building is called Punjabi Complex, which consists of a library, museum, art gallery, auditorium and FM-95 Punjab Rung while the institute is also going to launch a satellite TV channel soon. 

Rs25m project is aimed at smooth functioning of institute during matches

The Nishtar Complex houses sports facilities like Qaddafi Stadium, National Hockey Stadium, Punjab Stadium, Punjab International Swimming Complex and sports headquarters of the sports bodies like the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), FIFA and the Punjab Sports Board. During the sports events, the Nishtar Complex is closed for security. 
Ms Sadaf says that besides stoppage of cultural activities, Pilac has to limit the FM radio transmission while the new satellite TV will also need non-stop transmission, which is not possible if the entire premises is closed. The Punjabi Complex has sufficient space touching the Ferozepur Road for constructing a gate as per the need of the building, she says and adds that Pilac needs secure entry and exit gates towards Ferozepur Road, along a security room/reception, walk-through gates, a CCTV system, intercom facility, parking and washrooms. 
Under the subject scheme, a boundary wall with a barbed wire will be constructed along the Ferozepur Road while a parking area will be developed as per needs. 
The civil work of the project will be carried out by the Communication and Works (C&W) Department that includes construction of the boundary wall, gates, construction of security room/reception with air-conditioner and development of the parking area. 
The department has submitted the cost estimates as a part of the PC-I. Revenue components of the project will be procured by adopting tender procedure as per provisions of the Punjab Procurement Rules 2014 and subsequent amendments, if any. 
The scheme is included in the ADP 2022-23 with an allocation of Rs25m.

The Gujranwala district administration had submitted a proposal in this regard to the Board of Revenue (BoR) last month.  
However, well-placed sources in the divisional administration say the chances of bifurcation of  Wazirabad tehsil by carving out a new sub-division of Ali Pur Chatha  were bright.  They say the government may create some new tehsils in the  region as the plan to create some new districts has reportedly been  deferred due to some administrative and political hitches.  
The  administrations of Gujranwala and Gujrat had proposed the creation of  new tehsils, such as Ali Pur Chatha and two towns of Gujrat -- Jalalpur  Jattan and Kunjah.  
As per the proposal, Gakhar Mandi should  remain the part of Wazirabad tehsil, whereas the proposed Ali Pur Chatha  tehsil may comprise more area as compared to Wazirabad tehsil.  
The sources says the chances of upgrade of Wazirabad as a new district prior to the next general elections are bleak.  
A BoR official told Dawn that Chief Minister Parvez Elahi’s coalition government in Punjab had  initially desired to create some new districts and tehsils on  administrative grounds according to which Lahore had to be divided into  four districts and Wazirabad too had to be given status of a district.  
On  the BoR’s direction the Gujranwala divisional and district  administrations had in August submitted a detailed proposal as per which  Daska tehsil of Sialkot could be made a part of proposed Wazirabad  district by creating Ali Pur Chatha tehsil. The new district was to  comprise Wazirabad, Daska and Ali Pur Chatha tehsils as per the  proposals.  
However, the official sources in Gujranwala say that  there is a silence in the BoR on the matter, indicating a change of  heart within the concerned authorities, and the idea of inclusion of  Daska into the proposed Wazirabad district may also not be entertained.   
It is learnt that after a stiff resistance was offered by the  Sialkot’s political figures, as well as the civil society, the  provincial government has reportedly deferred the proposal to separate  Daska tehsil from Sialkot.  
A senior administrative official says  on condition of anonymity that creating a new district at the time when  general elections were not far away, may become difficult as doing so  may disturb the existing limits of the electoral constituencies of the  provincial and national assemblies.  
He says changing the limits  of a tehsil within the same district could not disturb the  constituencies limits, however creation of a new district requires  hectic work for the new delimitation and change in the number of national and provincial assemblies seats which may not be allowed by the Election Commission of Pakistan at this stage. 
Meanwhile,  Adviser to Prime Minister on Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan Affairs Qamar  Zaman Kaira has written a letter to Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez  Elahi and Governor Baleeghur Rehman, seeking tehsil status for Dinga  town of Kharian, instead of Kunjah, keeping in view the regional situation and the location if the town.Ahmed Chatha, a local PTI leader and former PTI ticket holder from the Wazirabad National Assembly seat, met party chairman Imran Khan recently and supported the idea of making Wazirabad a district. However, sources said that at the same time he opposed the proposal of including his district into the Gujrat division and emphasized on retaining it in Gujranwala division.An administrative official said that Mr Chatha’s opposition could the reason for a go-slow on Wazirabad’s inclusion into Gujrat division.

15,Ban on new gas connections hikes backlog,A delay in the finalization of the new gas tariffs for domestic consumers is also causing the ban.,"LAHORE: Continuous ban on the provision of new gas connections is not only irking the consumers but also increasing the backlog of the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL). The situation may worsen as there is no hope of lifting the ban by the government keeping in view the depleting indigenous gas reserves, increasing dependency on the import of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and other technical and administrative issues.
“While there is no gas, how can we give new connections? But despite all this, we gave new connections in last fiscal year in a bid to reduce the backlog,” SNGPL’s managing director Ali J Hamdani told Dawn. A delay in the finalization of the new gas tariffs for domestic consumers is also causing the ban. 
According to him, the company used to provide imported LNG after regasification, which costs too much, to consumers at cheaper rates besides providing the system gas (indigenous gas). This forced the authorities to work out a new price formula for domestic consumers. “The work on this issue has almost been done by the quarters concerned,” he added. 
Presently, the existing backlog has reached 2.8 million applications for new gas connections. These include those seeking gas connections in the urgent category through deposition of Rs25,000 urgent connection fee. Keeping in view this, the company, which couldn’t achieve its target of providing 300,000 new connections during the last fiscal year from July 2021 to June 2022, may not be able to achieve its target of providing 300,000 connections — most of them domestic — to the consumers during the ongoing financial year (July 22 to June 2023) due to moratorium, which was imposed in December 2021 till March 2022 in a bid to maintaining gas supplies to domestic consumers in the winter.
The SNGPL earlier asked the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) last year to allow it to spend Rs46.5bn on the execution of several development schemes, including 300,000 new gas connections to domestic consumers during the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2022. In its earlier estimated revenue requirement (ERR), the company planned to provide 1.2m new connections during financial 22. However, later, through the review of the estimated revenue requirement (RERR 2021-22) submitted to the regulator in November, it decided to provide new connections to, at least, the consumers who have already paid requisite fees (including urgent cases). Those who already paid fees are approximately 300,000. The estimated cost of providing 300,000 connections is Rs5.2bn. In August last, the SNGPL in a briefing told the participants that its regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) consumption has reached 55pc of the total supplies due to a massive decline in the indigenous supplies, resulting in more dependence on the RLNG. It also referred to the government’s plan of introducing the weighted average cost of gas, which, the company claimed, would mitigate and reduce the high price of the RLNG for the public. 
In a briefing on Aug 26, 2022, the company management disclosed that due to depleting indigenous gas resources, the RLNG now has a share in gas supplies continuing to rise. It also told the participants that it is aware of RLNG’s short supply owing to various global and regional dynamics and hence it is exploring alternative options to mitigate energy shortfall. On the other hand, the non-provision of gas connections for a long time has irked the applicants seeking new connections either under the urgent or normal fee category. 
“I gave application many months ago. I also tried hard to go for the urgent category, but to no avail,” deplored an applicant. 
“Like me, there are many who have applied. But it seems we will not have new connections.”

17,JI flays ‘lopsided’ price control mechanism,LAHORE: The Jamaat-i-Islami has expressed its concerns at what it says lack of an effective price control mechanism...,"LAHORE: The Jamaat-i-Islami has expressed its concerns at what it says lack of an effective price control mechanism which is leading to unchecked fleecing of consumers by the profiteers.
Punjab JI emir Javed Kasuri said here on Sunday that due to an unannounced increase in the prices of flour, 15-kg bags of flour are being sold up to Rs1,420 per unit, while the price of roti has also been increased by Rs2.
“There is no effective system to control inflation in the country. Whoever wants to increase the prices of food items does so without any let or hindrance.”
He said that one-third of the country has been affected by floods, while the rest has been mired in inflation.
He regretted that on one hand, the nation was facing a difficult time, while on the other Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan was spending millions of rupees on electoral rallies and processions. “It would have been good if the political leadership had thought of the country and the nation beyond personal interest at such a critical time.”
He said the federal finance minister had admitted that the Pakistan is facing the highest deficit in its history and alleged that the incumbent coalition government is also a slave to the IMF and a continuation of the champions of so-called change and no good can be expected of them. 
Mr Kasuri said the national textile sector needs 1.5 million cotton bales to fulfill the orders it received from the world market, while the recent floods have put all estimates about the cotton crop to rest. “It is important that the government takes measures on an urgent basis to fill the gap between demand and supply of cotton, otherwise our textile industry will suffer a severe crisis putting at stake jobs of millions of people associated with the sector.”
