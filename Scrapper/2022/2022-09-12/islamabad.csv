1,PM Ilyas takes notice of differently-abled family,Orders construction of road leading to its house; fixes monthly stipend...,"MUZAFFARABAD: Taking notice of the plight of an impoverished family with three differently-abled members, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas has fixed a monthly stipend for them apart from directing the officials concerned to initiate process within three days for construction of an artery to their abode, an official said on Sunday.
On Saturday, Shahnaz Khan, a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader, had uploaded a post on her Facebook account to draw attention towards the ordeal of one Mohammad Shahzad Abbasi, the father of three differently-abled children, in the absence of a link road between his house and the main highway.
Mr Abbasi, a resident of union council Sahliyan in Dhirkot subdivision of Bagh district, had been facing great deal of difficulty in transporting his wheelchair-bound children – 20 years old Hammad, 17 years old Maria and 14 years old Hashir –to the health facilities as and when required, Ms Khan had written while urging the affluent people in general and government in particular to come in aid of them without further ado.
It was learnt that the eldest child of Mr Abbasi, a former trucker who was out of work due to renal ailment, had himself raised his family’s plight through social media posts in the past as well, but to no avail.

Orders construction of road leading to its house; fixes monthly stipend

Yasir Arif, a member of the PM’s media team, told reporters that incidentally Ms Khan and her spouse were already scheduled to meet PM Ilyas on Saturday during which they briefed him on the agony of the ill-fated family among other things.
Immediately after the meeting, the prime minister issued a direction in black and white to the deputy commissioner of Bagh to visit the residence of Mr Abbasi along with retired Maj Latif Khalique, PTI’s candidate from the area in last general elections, and officers of administration and highways department for competition of a survey of a link road to his place within three days, he said.
In the next stage, the deputy commissioner would ensure construction of the link road after obtaining special approval for this purpose on a priority basis, he added.
Mr Arif said the prime minister had also announced provision of Rs500,000 as a one-time donation from the budget of the PM secretariat as well as a monthly stipend of Rs20,000 from Zakat profit fund to the family.
The stipend would be delivered to them at their doorstep by some government official every month, he said.
The prime minister, who has returned from a constituency of Bagh district, had directed the deputy commissioner to keep his secretariat in the loop about the implementation of his directions with regard to this family, Mr Arif said.
Additionally, he said, the deputy commissioner was also asked by the prime minister to collect data of differently-abled persons in the entire district and give directions and recommendations to the departments concerned to address the problems being faced by them.

4,78pc households have no access to natural gas in Pakistan: report,Says govt’s poor policy formulation creating inefficiencies in supply chain...,"ISLAMABAD: While 78pc of households have no access to natural gas in Pakistan, exploration and production have declined in the country.
“OGDCL predicts that Pakistan’s indigenous oil reserves will be exhausted by 2025, the circular debt in the gas sector has crossed Rs1.5 trillion, politically influenced allocations and monopolistic business operations are all bottlenecks.”
These observations were made by Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in its latest research brief on “Gas crises in Pakistan”.
It stated that gas is the third largest energy source consumed around the world. However, Pakistan has less than a one per cent share in world gas consumption. It meets its energy demand through imported and indigenous resources in the ratio of 44:56. Natural gas and imported LNG contribute more than 40pc to the country’s current energy mix, including gas resources used in electricity generation. In recent years, the demand for gas has increased rapidly in Pakistan. However, gas exploration and production have declined, and the LNG operational and regulatory framework is weak, leading to a nationwide shortage and increased supply costs.

Says govt’s poor policy formulation creating inefficiencies in supply chain

According to a press release issued by PIDE, 15 gas explorations and production companies worked in 55 ­fields spread throughout the country. The gas distribution and transmission are mainly owned and operated by two state-owned companies - Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGCL). The gas exploration/production industry and gas distribution/transmission industry lack competition in Pakistan.
“OGDCL predicts that Pakistan’s indigenous oil reserves will be exhausted by 2025. However, current reserves will last a maximum of 15 years if demand is capped at present day gas levels by 2030.”
PIDE research showed that 78pc of households had no access to natural gas in Pakistan. Natural gas consumption in the domestic sector has grown by about 11pc over the years. Supplying gas to households requires significant investments. The cost of gas supply to households is much higher than the cost of supply to the industry or power sector. Gas allocation policy has remained based on political priorities rather than on the objective of maximising value addition. Low gas prices and inefficient gas allocations have encouraged higher demands.
With 30.6 billion cubic metres of natural gas, Pakistan shares 0.8pc of global production. There is a sharp increase in gas demand in Pakistan, but due to the inefficient distribution the country has been facing a colossal gas shortfall.
The brief described that large areas in the country remain unexplored due to security concerns and law and order situation. For instance, Balochistan’s Pishin basin is considered a valuable block. However, there has been no exploration activity in this basin because of the law and order issue.
According to the PIDE, all activities in the gas sector in Pakistan, directly or indirectly, are under the government control. An independent regulator was established in 2002 to regulate mid and downstream activities. Still it remains hostage to government decisions because of the extensive state presence in all activities in the supply chain. Ogra law allows too much mandatory government involvement in the current oil and gas regulatory system. This has made the regulator powerless. Government interference in service providers’ affairs has led to cross-subsidy and an overall deficit in the gas sector. The circular debt in the gas sector has crossed Rs1.5 trillion, contributed by both the SNGPL and SSGPL. Government irregularities in regulatory frameworks and poor policy formulation are hindering sectoral growth and creating inefficiencies in the supply chain.
The brief suggested prioritizing exploration activities to rely on LNG imports, correct well head prices, and minimise government interference. A progressive and market-based exploration policy is needed. Pakistan should deregulate the natural gas sector and liberalise the pricing structure. Market-based pricing systems will also curtail the misuse of gas. For LNG imports, incentivise third-party access increased involvement of the private sector in the LNG supply chain happening in mature LNG markets like Japan, South Korea and even India.

5,Artists capture their impression of northern areas on canvas,"ISLAMABAD: Works showcasing picturesque peaks, snow-covered sierras and green valleys from the north of Pakistan,...","ISLAMABAD: Works showcasing picturesque peaks, snow-covered sierras and green valleys from the north of Pakistan, created by four artists from the Florence Academy of Arts, Italy went on display at the Dastaangoi gallery in the capital.
The artists spent 10 days in the north as they created the paintings and made memories. Saara Knapp, Brandon Schaefer, Phoebe Carter and Louis Szapary responded to an art residency programme offered by the gallery and were overjoyed after being accepted.
The programme was more intense than the artists had expected as they found themselves painting six to seven hours a day, between travelling and sleeping.
“This was different from stopping, taking pictures and getting back into an air-conditioned car. We stood at each spot for two to three hours in sand and mud. The winds knocked over our canvases as these elements left their marks on our impressions. It was a sensory experience with the light and temperature changes, a more thorough way of experiencing all those places,” said Phoebe Stewart Carter, who is an independent artist.
Born in England, Carter began drawing and painting at a young age. In 2017, she was introduced to academic drawing techniques that were taught through the 19th century. She travelled to Italy in 2018 to begin intensive training at the Florence Academy of Art.
Saara Knapp, who is a Finnish-American artist based in Florence, Italy and the Hudson Valley of New York, United States, explained that she represented what she saw realistically, whether it was painting landscapes, portraits and still life.
“Painting in the north was not like copying one single moment like in a photograph but a conglomeration of many moments while we were in those spaces. We were putting together images of all those many moments of being there especially the changes in light,” said the artist who completed a BS in Biological Anthropology and Evolutionary Studies from Binghamton University in 2016.
She now uses her scientific and analytical background to help herself navigate, transcribe and translate the world around her with her artistic works. She graduated from the Florence Academy of Art’s full-time painting programme in 2021 and now works out of her Florence-based studio.
Brandon Schaefer is from Roseville, California whose work revolves around drawing, air painting and water colours. He shares his knowledge to turn this passion into a full-time career. Appreciation for mother nature is what drives him to create his work and videos.
Schaefer captured the elements of truth in his landscape images, painting what his surroundings feel like rather than what they look like. In his work, he created a sort of nostalgic place for himself, documenting things that meant something to him, which he wanted to take back to remember this trip.
Austrian Louis Szapary studied from 2018-2012 at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna, where he received a master’s degree in Fine Arts with a specialisation in printmaking. He went on to study painting and teach drawing and painting at the Florence Academy of Arts.
Szapary loved painting on top of Kho, Nagar (13,500 feet above sea level) which he described as an amazing location with breathtaking views of Rakaposhi and Diran peak.
“The elevation we were at was higher than anything than I know at home,” he said.
The co-founder of the gallery, Amad Miaan, explained to his guests that this residency was particularly special.
“We took the artists through Batakundi, Karimabad, Nagar and Chilas to get them to experience these places as this is their first time in Pakistan. The idea was to show Pakistan in a different light and not through videos and photos but showcase it through their impressions,” he said.

6,"Tankers main source of water supply for I-14, I-16 residents","ISLAMABAD: Ameer Ali got his house constructed in I-14 some five years ago, but till now he has not shifted. The...","ISLAMABAD: Ameer Ali got his house constructed in I-14 some five years ago, but till now he has not shifted. The reason: no water supply.
I-14 was developed by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) around two decades ago but there is still no water supply in the sector, much to the inconvenience of the residents. People who live in this sector are dependent on water tankers and underground borings, but the groundwater too has been rapidly depleting.
“A family living adjacent to my house drilled a bore to meet their needs, but now they are facing issues as groundwater has depleted. Therefore, the residents are left with no choice but to rely on water tankers,” Ameer said, adding that the civic body was responsible for the provision of water. The situation for residents of I-16 is no different.
Meanwhile, development work of another sector, I-15, is near completion and soon houses will be built there, but again there are no arrangements for the supply of water to this sector as well. These three sectors are owned by the CDA and are located across the Grand Trunk Road.
An official of the engineering wing told Dawn that these sectors were to be provided water from Khanpur Dam through Shah Allah Ditta reservoir. He said underground water was very low and to provide relief to residents the CDA started tanker service a few months ago, providing water to every house once a week. However, Ameer Ali said the CDA’s tanker supply was inadequate to meet water requirements of the residents.
People have no choice but to rely on private tankers which charge around Rs3,500 to 4,000 per trip, he added.
“The CDA and its engineering wing has been focusing on mega road projects but paying no heed towards improving water supply. Water is the basic need, therefore, the prime minister should direct the CDA to improve water supply and explore new sources of water,” he said.
The city, which requires over 220 million gallons daily (mgd), is being supplied only 60 to 70 mgd by the CDA. The civic agency has three main sources – Simly Dam from where 24 mgd is being supplied nowadays, Khanpur Dam (9 mgd) while 28 mgd is being obtained through 195 tubewells.
During the last two decades or so, the CDA has failed to look into new options.
In the past, the CDA made announcements that it would start a mega project – Ghazi Barotha project – to bring 100 mgd each for Rawalpindi and Islamabad, but the project could not move beyond file works. Initially, its estimated cost was Rs37 billion in 2007-8, however, later in 2017, it was calculated at Rs77 billion. Now, sources said, keeping in view the rise in the cost of construction material, over Rs150 billion would be required.
This project is a long-term solution while officials said that for a short-term solution, the CDA should focus on small dams and rainwater harvesting and all house owners should be made bound to store rainwater.
They said a lot of rainwater, particularly during monsoon, goes to waste through Leh Nullah.
Similarly, they said a few years ago, the CDA board decided to construct two small dams – Chinot and Shahdara dams – but no practical step was taken in this regard, whereas, Chirrah Dam, a joint venture of CDA and Punjab government that was conceived many years ago, could not be started.
When contacted, director general of water supply Sardar Khan Zimri claimed that the civic agency had been taking steps to improve water supply.
When asked about the failure of the civic agency in laying the main water supply line in these sectors, he said: “We are planning to complete work of laying down the conduction line. A major portion of the line has already been laid but there is the issue of only a few kilometres, which will be addressed soon,” he said.
In April this year, the CDA had started supplying water through tankers in these sectors, he added.
On the other hand, an official said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should look into the issue of water shortage and direct the CDA, the way he issued directions for road projects, to construct small dams on war footing and ensure storage and use of rainwater through proper implementation of building bylaws under which owner of each house should have a proper storage system of rainwater.

8,150-year-old bridge in Rawalpindi falls victim to red tape,"The bridge in its current condition poses a danger to the main railway track connecting Rawalpindi with Peshawar, official says.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Railways has decided to shut down a 150-year-old bridge near Transit Camp after a monthly survey conducted by the officials concerned declared the bridge “dangerous” for all types of traffic owing to years of negligence.
The decision taken by the railways authorities came after a portion of a protective wall on the bridge was found damaged. The authorities accused the district administration and the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) of negligence and said they failed to repair the road despite repeated requests.
The bridge connecting the city and cantonment areas of Rawalpindi is used by commuters coming from I.J. Principal Road, Peshawar Road and other routes and its closure has resulted in tailbacks on Ganjmandi Road, City Saddar Road and Gawalmandi. 
The railways officials claimed that letters were written to Deputy Commissioner Tahir Farooq and RCB President Brigadier Salman Nazar to repair the road but no positive response was received.

Official claims civic bodies repeatedly ignored railways’ requests for repair

“The Pakistan Railways decided to close the bridge permanently for light and heavy traffic as the district administration and the cantonment board had failed to take responsibility for the repair and maintenance of the road,” said Pakistan Railways Rawalpindi Divisional Superintendent Inamullah while talking to Dawn. 
The bridge in its current condition posed a danger to the main railway track connecting Rawalpindi with Peshawar, he said, adding that, “vibrations were observed in the bridge as it has not been repaired in over a decade.” 
He said the railways contacted the civic bodies to repair the bridge as it was being used by the general traffic but in the absence of a response, the authorities decided to approach the federal government for help. 
He said the railways was not responsible for the maintenance of the bridge and added letters seeking the repair of the bridge over the past two years remained unanswered. 
Mr Inamullah claimed the bridge was meant for light traffic only but heavy traffic had also been plying on it, adding that trucks pay toll tax at Bakery Chowk before using the bridge to enter the city areas.
On the other hand, Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) refused to repair the bridge, saying that it was the responsibility of the Pakistan Railways to maintain the bridge. Similarly, a senior official of the district administration told Dawn that the Rawalpindi Metropolitan Corporation (RMC) chalked out a plan to repair over 40 roads in the city but it did not include the repair of this bridge.

“My brother-in-law Talha Asad is a 31-year-old married person and has been doing business of automobiles. He was kidnapped in front of his three children in F-11/2 just after he offered Isha prayers at a mosque at 8:30pm on Saturday,” Senator Khan told Dawn.
“He was put in a Hiace vehicle, having black tinted glasses, and taken away. The last location of his cell phone was of Golra Sharif. We have managed to get the CCTV footage but the front number plate of the vehicle is not visible. Although there is a number plate on the rear side of vehicle, I am sure it is fake,” he said. 
Replying to a question, he said his brother-in-law had no enmity with anyone.
“However, no one has contacted the family for ransom or any other demand, so I believe that the motive is not ransom,” he said.
When asked if his brother-in-law was a very religious person and had contact with any religious group, Senator Khan said: “Although he is religious but not as much that he would be required to intelligence agencies.”
He said Mr Asad is a resident of F-11/2. He expressed the hope that he would be recovered soon.
Meanwhile, Inspector General of Police Nasir Khan Durrani has taken notice of the incident and ordered the DIG operations to ensure recovery of Mr Asad at the earliest. A case has been registered on the complaint of Mr Asad’s brother.

12,PMA advises doctors against suggesting costly dengue tests,"""A dengue patient can be confirmed by conducting a platelets test which costs Rs300,"" PMA's Dr Qaisar Sajjad says.","ISLAMABAD: The representative body of health professionals has advised doctors not to suggest costly tests as dengue virus can be confirmed with tests that are four times cheaper.
On the other hand, there was no let-up in the number of dengue cases as during the last 24 hours, Islamabad reported 55 new patients and Rawalpindi 73.
Talking to Dawn, Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) Secretary General Dr Qaisar Sajjad said dengue virus could be detected by spending just Rs300 to Rs700 whereas doctors were suggesting tests that cost Rs2,100 to Rs2,500.
“I have been working on dengue since 2005 when over 50 people died across the country. A dengue patient can be confirmed by conducting a platelets test which costs Rs300. In case of further confirmation, complete blood count (CBC) can be carried out,” he said.
“However, I have observed that majority of doctors suggest dengue tests for which Rs2,100 to Rs2,500 are charged by labs,” he said.

128 more dengue cases reported in Islamabad, Rawalpindi

Out of the total 55 dengue patients in Islamabad, 36 came from the rural areas and 19 from the urban localities of the city. In Rawalpindi district, the tally of the season rose to 871 after emergence of 73 new patients.
Meanwhile, the PMA, in a statement, expressed its concern over the rising number of dengue patients across the country.
According to the Sindh Health Department, 2,825 cases were reported throughout the province this year out of which 2,462 were in Karachi only.
The PMA suggested that the government should immediately start an anti-mosquito spray campaign in flood-affected areas to eliminate mosquitoes because there is no vaccine or specific treatment for dengue.
“Elimination of the mosquito will also end other mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, chikungunya and Zika virus. The PMA once again reminds the slogan of ‘prevention is better than cure’ and advises all government departments to work jointly against dengue fever for positive result,” the statement said, adding that “anti-mosquito spray with regular interval particularly on stagnant water with actual concentration should be used”. It said spray should also be done inside and outside hospitals, schools, offices, plant nurseries and gardens and tyre repair shops.
Provide whole blood, platelets and plasma free of cost to the ailing people through registered healthy donors. Private hospitals should reduce the significant price on platelets and laboratory charges. Manufacturers of anti-mosquito products should reduce prices to help people,” it further suggested.
The general public has been advised to cover water tanks and clean any stagnant water in or around their houses and apartments etc.
In case of high grade fever, never take antibiotics, anti-malarial or aspirin and do not go for self-medication or unscientific treatment. Always take advice from a qualified doctor. Plenty of waters, homemade fresh food, good sleep will increase body immunity, the PMA added.
Rawalpindi
As many as 73 dengue patients were reported in the garrison city on Sunday, taking the tally of the season to 871. A total of 99 patients landed in three government hospitals and 73 of them were form Rawalpindi and the remaining from other districts.
At present, 169 confirmed dengue patients are admitted in the three government hospitals - 54 in Holy Family Hospital (HFH), 58 in Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH) and 57 in the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital.
