0,Waterborne diseases on decline in KP's flood-hit areas,Health dept focusing on prevention of epidemics.,"PESHAWAR: The health department is focusing on prevention of epidemics like malaria, dengue fever, acute respiratory infections and typhoid in the flood-stricken areas as water-borne diseases are decreasing due to return of the affected people from the camps to their homes.
A health department report indicates that on Sunday a total of 47 cases of bloody diarrhoea were registered in the flood-hit districts as compared to 168 patients recorded a day before. Most of the cases have been reported in Nowshera, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Dir Lower, Charsadda and Malakand.
The number of acute watery diarrhoea cases continues to dip in the affected areas as most of the people have returned to their homes and the resolution of the problems of unhygienic condition and contaminated water has resulted in reduction of cases.
The report said that only 71 cases were registered during the last 24 hours as compared to 338 cases reported a day earlier.

Health dept focusing on prevention of epidemics

Officials said that health department was supplying water-purification tablets to the flood-affected people that were saving them from waterborne ailments. However, they said that Swabi, Malakand and Dera Ismail Khan were still reporting cases.
Acute diarrhoea is also on the decline as the province reported 2,347 patients on Sunday as compared to 2,746 cases registered on Saturday.
However, the upward trend in the acute respiratory cases continues due to the onset of winter season, which aggravates respiratory diseases. 
During the past 24 hours, the health department recorded 2,840 cases, up from 2,651 patients registered on Saturday.
Nowshera, Dera Ismail Khan, Dir Lower, Lakki Marwat, Charsadda, Swabi and Swat are the highly affected districts with regard to rise in respiratory infection cases, according to the report.
It says that cases of acute viral hepatitis have also shown an upsurge in the aftermath of floods as the number of patients has surged to 49 from nine. Dir Lower, Nowshera and Dera Ismail khan are reporting bulk of the cases, it adds.
According to the report, the number of suspected typhoid cases is 157, dengue haemorrhagic fever nine, malaria 511, measles three, skin infections 1,994 and eye diseases 590. The province didn’t report any snakebite case during the last 24 hours. So far, 71 snakebite cases have been reported in the flood-hit districts.
The report says that the number of flood-related injuries has also declined. The health department repowered 169 cases of injuries on Sunday as compared 198 cases reported a day before.
Officials said that the next challenge before the health department was prevention of epidemics in the flood-impacted areas where people were prone to malaria, typhoid, dengue and respiratory infections. They said that those ailments were likely to witness upward trend due to the change of weather. 
The health department has started efforts in collaboration with other line departments to cope with the situation.
“In addition to WHO and Unicef, the health department is collaborating with the tehsil municipal authorities, public health engineering and district administration to put brakes on epidemics in the flood-stricken districts. The government has already released emergency funds for dengue control and procurement and supplies are being made to the district offices,” said officials.
They said that a total of 256 health facilities were damaged due to the incessant rains that would be reconstructed as many donor organisations pledged to assist the health department in that regard.
“A World Bank-sponsored human capital investment project, launched in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa two years ago, is one of the donors to help the department in reconstruction efforts,” they said.

“We had taken gastroenteritis medicines with us fearing the outbreak of the waterborne disease, but the situation on the ground is more alarming as pregnant women couldn’t develop labour pain as they are passing through post-devastation trauma and are without healthcare services,” Dr Abdul Hadi told mediapersons. 
Dr Hadi, who has returned to Pattan after spending a week in Dubair valley, said children were malnourished and suffering from skin diseases. 
“Skin diseases are common and infants have boils on their skin, but it is unfortunate that medical teams couldn’t reach there as yet and the lone basic health unit in the area was washed away by floodwater,” he said. 

Medic says area still cut off from rest of district

Dr Hadi said the elderly women, locally given the status of midwives, couldn’t handle the complicated delivery cases as owing to trauma the pregnant women couldn’t develop labour pain and the former didn’t know how to stimulate the phenomenon (labour) through tablets,” he said. 
Dr Hadi said four to five families had been living jointly after their houses were washed away and this had contributed to the spread of skin diseases and gastroenteritis. 
“The government should send medical teams to save the lives of the people in the valley,” he said. 
In Swat, the Matta, Khwazakhela and Bahrain areas have been badly hit where people suffer from skin and stomach diseases. 
To cater to the medical needs of flood-stricken people in Matta tehsil a 25-member medical team of Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC), Peshawar, with the support of medical society of Khyber Girls Medical College arranged a free medical camp in the rural health centre of Darmai village. 
The camp was held under the supervision of HMC Peshawar administrator Dr Sher Zaman where doctors of about six specialties, including general medicine, general surgery, paeds, dermatology, ophthalmology and gynaecology, treated the patients. 
The flood-hit people belonging to Darmai, Sakhra, Gabin Jabba and suburbs were provided treatment along with medicines and non-food items. 
Dr Zaman said the floods had caused several waterborne diseases which must be addressed immediately. 
“We have provided medical help to about 3,000 patients in two days,” he said.

14,The ‘Arzan Chacha’ of Islamia College,Famous bookseller likes to help poor students.,"PESHAWAR: An elderly storekeeper on Islamia College University campus, who has been selling books, stationery and uniforms for the last more than four decades despite high inflation, wants shopkeepers to provide books at subsidised rate to poor students.
Syed Badshah, a resident of Lakki Marwat, not literate himself had determined to set up a book and stationery store some 40 years ago at Islamia College Peshawar (ICP) to help students hailing from lower middle class.
After retirement from army in a lower rank, he took up the job to look after hostels of students at ICP. Soon he observed that book dealers on the campus would charge students exorbitantly for the books, notebooks and uniforms. He walked up to then high officials to allow him to set up a store on the campus where things would be available to poor students at subsidised rates.
Students from in and around the campus swarmed his bookshop to get textbooks, guides and stationery items at such a low price that they tagged Syed Badshah as ‘Arzaan Chacha’ (subsidised uncle). The students passed out three decades ago send out their children to his store where the grey-beard and humble man not only sells out things at low prices but also gifts a pencil or two free of cost to them.

Famous bookseller likes to help poor students

“I have been selling books and student uniforms for the last 40 years. I earn only 10 to 15 per cent profit while other book dealers use fake tag price and charge buyers from 50 to 70 per cent and at times 100 to 150 per cent. It is an utter injustice but nobody seems taking notice of it, surprisingly, students in large number walk up to this store,” said Mr Badshah.
He requested book dealers to reduce prices of at least books and stationery items to enable poor students to get education. “Even 10 to 15 per cent profit is enough to live a humble life with. My rivals have posted my death news on the social media for three times to discourage my poor customers but I don’t care,” he added.
Mr Badshah said that keeping in view his style, sometimes miracles happened as old Islamian publishers dropped books and stationery for selling it out free of cost. He added that last year a few old students from the US and UK donated money to him, asking to use it for poor students.
“Books and stationery at low price could lessen burden on parents by 100 per cent. The relevant officials should take notice of it. Poor parents cannot afford such exorbitant prices. I appeal to buyers not to blindly believe the fake tag prices on the books,” he said.

He said the university would be established on 826 kanals which were acquired a long time ago when he served as chair of the Social Action Board.
Mr Raja said quality education was vital for local and national development and the establishment of the university was the longstanding demand of residents. 
He said Gujar Khan was one of the largest tehsils of Punjab and had a population of more than a million.
The speaker said students from different areas of Gujar Khan had to leave for major cities including Islamabad and Lahore for higher education and many could not afford the heavy university fees. 
He said now students from Gujar Khan, Kahuta, Kallar Syedan, Rawat and Sohawa would be able to get quality education at their doorsteps.
Mr Ashraf said development of his constituency, Gujar 
Khan and Kallar Syedan, was his top priority and he was taking steps to solve the issues of his people.
