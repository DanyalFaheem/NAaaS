0,"When it comes to loan apps, do the regulator’s priorities lie with its licensees or the public?",SBP and SECP need to realise customers also deserve at least some of the benevolence they bestow upon their subject entities.," 


Remember all the brouhaha (on Twitter) over how many loan shark apps had permeated Play Store in Pakistan and ripped off ordinary folks with misleading claims and exorbitant interest rates? It was enough for Google to take notice and remove some of the names.
Well, that lasted less than two months as two of the apps removed from Play Store are not only back again but currently trending in the top five of the finance category. Meanwhile, some unlicensed players took a page out of Islamic militant books and came back with a new name, all dry-cleaned. The entire episode seems to have made absolutely no difference to their modus operandi: annual percentage rates are still grossly understated and misleading marketing campaigns are in full force.
Meanwhile, the regulator continues to look the other way lest it may have to actually do something regarding the problem instead of asking the very offenders to self-regulate themselves. This is what it did last time when the issue was raised, calling a meeting with digital non-banking finance companies and issuing a press release that unlicensed players are bringing bad repute to the sector.
It makes you wonder where the regulator’s priorities lie: with its licensees or the public it has been entrusted to protect? Unfortunately, all evidence screams the former. Take the case of bancassurance, which has allowed insurance companies to book new business by leveraging banks’ branches who in turn make easy commission income. All at the expense of the customer, as the product is sold and designed in such a way that policy buyers — often widows and retirees — are misled into it and fail to get a return of capital, forget return on capital.

The SBP and SECP need to realise that customers also deserve at least some of the benevolence they so generously bestow upon their subject entities

Over the past few years, it has been the highest growing revenue stream for insurance players, Islamic or conventional, while earning banks commission incomes in excess of Rs1 billion usually. Swindling one of the most vulnerable groups, while morally deplorable, it is still quite expected of bankers and insurance executives to be a leech. But the regulators’ continuous negligence of the situation is concerning.
Both the State Bank (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) are involved as the former oversees banks while the latter has been entrusted with the mandate for insurance companies. But instead of regulating them, the two entities have become more of their champions. Don’t get me wrong, they certainly should be doing everything in their capacity to promote the respective sectors, but not at the expense of the customer.
Perhaps proximity to industry professionals over prolonged periods has made regulators more sympathetic to their cause. At least more so than they are to customers, who do not enjoy the same access to those decision-makers and make themselves heard.

Perhaps proximity to industry professionals over prolonged periods has made the authorities more sympathetic to their cause

Or maybe, this looking the other way is just regulators trying to overcompensate. After all, they too need to show progress. The two examples above actually neatly fit into this: both insurance and lending penetration have remained dismal in Pakistan for the longest time. And when a certain category finally seemed to work, regardless of the tactics used, they were willing to ignore the shortcomings.
Of course, both the SBP and SECP have been entrusted with the task of developing their respective industries too. And there is absolutely no denying the many great initiatives they have undertaken, be it Raast, Roshan Digital Accounts or the regulatory sandbox. But they are still regulators first, with a responsibility towards the public — which is compromised every time a person pays upwards of 30 per cent in charges for a 30-day loan or a senior citizen spends their hard earned money only for a banker to chip away most of it in the near term.
There is no shortage of examples, but the magnitude of these two warrants special attention. For instance, the licensed digital lenders alone disbursed 839,281 loans worth Rs6.14 billion to 365,239 borrowers in 2021. The numbers reported by SECP for 9MFY22 were at RS11bn, mostly dominated by the two instant lending players.
Similarly, new bancassurance customers for each bank can run into tens of thousands. At what point exactly will the regulator realise that customers also deserve at least some of the benevolence it so generously bestows upon its subject entities?

Pakistan’s top five export destinations account for nearly half (49pc) of the country’s overall exports. Most of the exports are concentrated towards the West with China as the exception.
On the other hand, Pakistan’s exports are barely a rounding error when tallying the imports of the global bigwigs. The unequal relationship in trade is symbolic of the unequal political relationship, with the country heavily relying on the generosity of the developed nations.
Unlike other more savvy countries, Pakistan has never been able to be strategic in its policies. Take the example of India and China — both countries are rivals in terms of global might and enemies in terms of border disputes. However, that has not prevented them from being trading partners — their bilateral trade stood at $126bn last year. Their withdrawal from disputed areas will enhance bilateral trade, while Kashmir will continue to be the perpetual bone of contention.

2,Hopeless dreams,"While the finance minister’s aim to break out of the boom-and-bust cycle is laudable, the barriers appear insurmountable","While fully engaged in firefighting, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail says he wants to break the boom-and-bust cycle that has played out for decades and help the nation finally learn to live within its means.
Achieving even a stable, moderate growth rate is the most challenging, complex job — the over-arching issues facing the policymakers due to persisting imbalances in the development of various sectors of the economy, the enormous disparity in household incomes and social backwardness in less developed regions further complicate a tough task. All of this is the result of policy failures and bad governance.
In a debt-driven economy with the livelihood of millions supported by doles such as the Benazir Income Support Programme, national self-reliance involves a cultural change in every facet of our economic, political and social life. Through an evolutionary process, such a transformational change can be achieved only by the active participation of all citizens, with the movers and shakers of the economy serving as initial catalysts. Self-reliance, a laudable objective, has to be a decades-long process.
The finance minister has also sought national support to end the widening gap between soaring import payments and the combined dollar earnings from exports and the inflow of workers’ remittances. Professionals find it more lucrative to seek jobs abroad and the export of manpower is officially encouraged to earn workers’ remittances to finance the trade deficit. However, low productivity can also be explained by brain drain.

While the finance minister’s aim to break out of the boom-and-bust cycle is laudable, the barriers appear insurmountable

Without increasing productivity significantly in a diversified field of economic activities by mobilising local resources and talents, required export trade surpluses and earnings cannot be achieved, nor can effective import substitution.
On its part, Mr Ismail adds, the government aims to spur economic growth by avoiding unchecked imports of everything from home appliances to cosmetics. At the same time, the finance minister has scaled down his estimate for GDP growth for this year from a targeted 5 per cent to just over 3.5pc, which is close to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast.
The initial official estimate does not rule out the growth rate falling to 2pc as the losses from the ongoing deluge, which is not yet over, have yet to be fully assessed. As a result, unemployment may rise by an additional 3m by June 2023.
In fact there is no space in the long-pursued policy framework for the economy to take the road of self-reliance. Even initial moves are not visible. With macroeconomic imbalances worsening and owing to earlier Pakistan’s deviations from Fund’s programme, the IMF conditions have stiffened despite the global inflation’s adverse impact on the economy and the immense devastations caused by the torrential rains and flash floods.
It would be in the fitness of things that the government should set up an example of financial discipline for the nation to follow. According to the IMF, the total foreign and domestic debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise from 77.9pc at the end of 2020-21 to 78.9pc at the end of FY2022. The interest payments have been rising as a percentage of the total budget.
In FY2021-22, interest payable amounted to 36pc of the total budgeted amount and 40pc of the current expenditure. This year’s interest payments will rise to 41.5pc of the total budget and 45pc of the current expenditure.
Pakistan has just avoided foreign debt default. The bulk of the fresh dollar borrowings goes for debt serving, balance of payments support and comparatively very insignificant foreign credit is earmarked for economic development that is also not fully utilised owing to bad governance and poor service delivery.
While the rupee continues to depreciate against the greenback despite the IMF tranche of over $1 billion, about $3bn of multilateral assistance for development remains unutilised. A monitoring report has highlighted 31 problematic areas for foreign-funded projects. It noted that a lot of money was wasted because of commitment charges and cost overruns.
We have steadily stepped up foreign and domestic borrowings for decades in a futile bid to achieve the elusive long-lasting stability. The top priority should have been economic reforms that could help raise domestic savings, investment, production, exports and encourage import substitution. Unfortunately, foreign loans have not been directed to priority areas. And rent-seeks have benefited the most from public debts.
Thus some analysts also see donor fatigue while the unprecedented rains and floods sharply added to the economy’s owes. Meanwhile, foreign direct investment inflows are very low due to continuing external sector pressures. So far, the government has not initiated any programme, policy or action plan to effectively reduce foreign dependence by utilising local resources and talents.
In the above backdrop, Pakistan has assured the IMF that it is ready to cut the size of the public sector development programme (PSDP) of both the federal and provincial governments. As part of the strategy, the finance division will slow down the financial releases to the ministries to make sure that the PSDP spending is reduced by at least Rs150bn to Rs577bn.
A reduction of $534bn is stipulated in the development spending of federal and provincial governments as part of contingency measures agreed with the IMF. In addition, the government has assured the Fund that further savings of Rs384bn will be ensured from lower priority projects in provincial PSDP budgets. The provinces have also committed to a cash budget surplus of Rs750bn for this fiscal year to help the federation meet the year’s consolidated fiscal target.
In 2021-22, federal PSDP utilisation was just 62pc of the amount budgeted. Provincial PSDP for 2022-23 shows a year-on-year decline of 16pc of the budgeted amount. Analysts say 90pc of all taxes collected by the Federal Board of Revenue go towards debt servicing, defence and grants.
However, in sharp contrast, there was strong growth in the combined development spending of Rs1.21 trillion in the provinces in 2021-22. The spending on upliftment was substantially increased compared to the previous fiscal year and its ratio to current expenditure was maintained or increased. With the general elections so close and shocks suffered by the farm and industrial economy by floods, it is unlikely that this trend will be significantly reversed.
Another positive trend to note is that civil society activists and organisations, concerned citizens and philanthropists are directly providing relief to flood victims in various ways.

Polarisation of the United States
Two states, two very different states of mind. On August 25, California banned the sale of petrol-powered cars from 2035, a move that will reshape the car industry, reduce carbon emissions and strain the state’s electricity grid. On the same day in Texas, a “trigger” law banned abortion from the moment of conception, without exceptions for rape or incest. These two events may seem unrelated, but they are symptoms of an important trend. Washington, DC, may be largely gridlocked, but the states are making policies at a furious pace. With 50 states, America has 50 laboratories to test which policies work and which do not. But this constructive form of federalism is not what state politicians are pursuing today. Instead, they are fighting a national culture war, stoking outrage among partisan voters on everything from guns to abortion and transgender issues. Moderates might prefer them to concentrate on fixing roads and refining tax policy. But in many states, politicians can safely ignore them because their seats are ultra-safe, and they fear only primary voters.

Give good career advice
Let’s be honest: Great advice is hard to come by. Even though we’re living in the age of knowledge, most of us still make poor career choices. This isn’t because there is a shortage of advice — we often receive bad advice and follow it.
So, how can we get better at giving each other guidance? 1) Consider the context. While recounting your own experience can be helpful, your advice will be much more impactful if you adapt it to the advice-seekers situation.
2) Help the advice-seeker align their wants with their needs. If someone is good at getting what they want, but what they want is not what they need, they are just running faster in the wrong direction. Knowing this, ask the advice-seeker questions that clarify their long-term goals. 3) Be resourceful. You should see your advice as a part of the overall equation. If you’re not well-positioned to provide them with advice, make introductions to people who can help guide the person better.

Not on the CEO track
A decade ago, we were poised to make serious progress. Employers started showing considerable interest in both measuring and improving gender diversity. They dug into the analytics and kicked off initiatives with hopes of turning the numbers around — only to shelve a lot of those efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic when many companies struggled to stay afloat. As those that have survived begin some kind of restart, they face an exceedingly tight labour market where employees have no shortage of career options. So now is a good time to assess where we are in the advancement of women — particularly in the most visible leadership roles in our biggest businesses, where inequities can be clearly seen. The drop in the proportion of women in general manager roles in 2011 might have kept their numbers from growing in the top tier in 2021. Although their percentages had increased in functional roles, those jobs rarely put leaders on track to becoming CEO.

Less magical than before
Over the past two years, as Florida’s Walt Disney World Resort and Southern California’s Disneyland Resort have emerged from the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic, the company has made a host of changes that have sent the cost of a visit to a Disney resort skyward. The outcome is a bonanza for Disney even as the company limits the number of visitors and keeps attendance at its US theme parks below pre-pandemic levels, they are generating record sales and profits. The results reflect a major strategic shift on Disney’s part, where the company is focused less on maximising the number of visitors and more on increasing how much money each visitor spends, an approach the company refers to as yield management. Improving the visitor experience, the thinking goes, will prompt guests to spend more hours — and therefore more money — at the parks because they are having such a good time.

4,There is no such thing as a free lunch,Tax breaks and subsidies are a win-win situation for those who care more for next quarter’s income statement than country’s long-term growth.,"


 
The myth that governments possess infinite money to spend is quite prevalent in contemporary society. The public sentiment hinges on the fact that the economy runs on altruism and that the state should spend prodigiously to orchestrate a better life for its citizens. Everybody wants a discount on their livelihood irrespective of their social standing.
The farmers want a subsidy on their agricultural produce, the industrialists want tax breaks and the consumers want subsidies on petrol and energy prices. Even though the idea of a generous state draw parallels to the extent of romantic idealism, the cost is eventually paid by the recipients of governmental benevolence in the form of economic turmoil.
There is no such thing as a free lunch. The courtesy of affording the luxury of subsidies may be coming out of the pocket of a wealthy businessman in the form of corporate taxes, or it could be that the wage earners are taking the hits in the shape of direct income taxes.
The elusive nature of government spending also hints toward the lower income groups being caught in the line of fire. It is fairly plausible that a poor man paying indirect taxes (sales tax) on daily products could be contributing to the grants or subsidies given to key industrial players.

Government tax breaks and subsidies are a win-win situation for those who care more for the next quarter’s income statement than the country’s long-term growth

Pakistan continues to be the prisoner of excessive government spending and it is unlikely that this fiscal extravagance will come to a halt anytime soon.
Since the tumultuous affair of the Great Depression 1929, governments worldwide have taken a proactive approach towards adopting Keynesian economics and accruing the dividends of government spending. However, the true essence of government intervention was lost in translation.
The policymakers in Pakistan have misinterpreted the ideological definition of government spending to achieve political ends. Pakistan’s susceptibility to fiscal extravagance is clearly recognisable in the statistics pertaining to the accumulation of public debt.
According to the recent data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), total debt and liabilities have ballooned to a staggering sum of Rs59.6 trillion, noticeably a red flag for the prospects of financial stability. This vicious cycle of debt and the inability to enforce tighter monetary controls has paralysed our strides to achieve sustainable growth.
Pakistan is amid spiralling inflation, but still the reluctance of the government to pursue contractional fiscal policy is hard to fathom. The adrenaline rush to stimulate short-term growth has befogged their decisiveness to apply pressure breaks when the economy overheats.
Tax breaks and subsidies have been gratuitously distributed when instead, the approach should have been the contrary. The consequence is a prolonged bust characterised by high inflation and high unemployment. Certainly, a win-win situation for those spoiled brats who care more for the next quarter’s income statements than long-term growth.
It is difficult to educate the masses struggling to put food on the table about the intricacies of economics. However, it is in their best interest that the government abstain from indulging in expansionary policies. These policies advertently erase the purchasing power of hard-earned money or take away the value of the savings upon which their financial health is contingent.
More harm than good is done to alleviate the suffering of the downtrodden. With such inflationary policies, life could seemingly appear a bed of roses for a few months but jeopardise families’ subsistence in the next few years.
Gen Dwight Eisenhower, the president of the United States from 1953 till 1961, was one such individual who championed the concept of fiscal restraint, notwithstanding the cacophony arising from the critics as a consequence of his unpopular manoeuvres. Eisenhower despised deficit spending when it was in vogue, and his far-sightedness paved the way for inclusive economic growth in the United States for years to come.
Although legitimising contractional fiscal policy as the foremost priority on the economic front is a bitter pill to swallow for the incumbent government politically, it may prove to be instrumental in warding off the threats of an economic meltdown.
Deficit spending captures the eye, but it isn’t so pleasant once the inadequacies of reality set in, as in the case of Sri Lanka. The root cause behind the intransigence of successive governments to reduce government expenditure lies in the consolidation of power.
Power politics always precedes economic vulnerabilities, while the latter is subject to merely political point-scoring. Institutional interference is another impediment that endangers the legitimacy of an elected government and forces its hand to abandon long-term strategies in favour of measures popular among the vote banks.
The habit of excessive government spending must be curtailed. Old habits die hard, but it is a sacrifice that the policymakers should be willing to undertake for the sake of larger national interests.

5,How to conserve energy in your home,Common sense actions can bring your bill down.,"It is interesting to note that in the 1970s and 80s, and even today, power and gas were often provided in sub-urban or rural localities to gain political mileage.
I remember watching TV clips of the same. Somehow a basic right is shown as a favour. Contrastingly, today the public acknowledges power as their basic right but pays the bills as a favour.
In the initial period, Pakistan relied heavily on hydel to fulfil the country’s power needs. In the 1990s, during the tenure of PPP, independent power producers were added to the energy mix, which increased the country’s reliance on fossil fuels.
It is disturbing to note that when shifting to alternate energy was more viable, people at the helm opted to increase the use of fossil fuels and natural gas to produce electricity. As Pakistan’s natural gas reserves depleted, Pakistan had to opt for the use of regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG), another imported fuel, to meet the country’s energy needs.

Common sense actions such as constructing large windows to let in sunlight and switching the lights when you exit the room can bring your bill down

Pakistan has huge reserves of coal, but unfortunately, coal exploration and increasing coal’s share in the country’s energy mix will take a lot of time. Also, while Pakistan intends to increase the use of coal, globally the reliance on coal is being discouraged because of its strong carbon footprint.
Pakistan has revived the existing International Monetary Fund programme, with the government announcing the removal of subsidies from the power sector and increasing the base tariff.
Also, due to reliance on imported fuel, a component of Fuel Cost Adjustment (FCA) is included in consumers’ bills. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, the power sector regulator, conducts a monthly public hearing, after which it allows distribution companies (Discos) to charge FCA from its consumers.
Due to the increase in energy prices globally coupled with the devaluation of Pakistan’s rupee, the cost of power production increased. Consumers paying the cost per unit of electricity have to pay FCA on the number of electricity units produced as well. A consumer’s electricity bill also has multiple government taxes in it. Another important aspect is that bills also depend on the slab system. The rate for the consumer using 200 units is different from that of a consumer consuming using 300 units and so on.
Along with the rising cost of power, Pakistan is also facing a demand and supply gap. According to the power division, the total electricity production in the country is 18,461MWs, while the total demand stands at 24,900MWs. This means that country’s total shortfall is 6,439 megawatts, and Discos resort to the regulator’s solution: load management to manage the shortage.
Considering the realities of the power sector and rising inflation, it is high time we start behaving responsibly. Conservation is the answer. Mindful electricity consumption will benefit us, reduce the country’s import bill and offer a cleaner environment. For this we need to:
Act responsibly
If we want to conserve energy, we have to bring a genuine change in our behaviour. It is a common sight that people move from one room to another in their houses or workplace but do not bother to switch off electrical appliances.
Also, with the increased usage of laptops and cell phones, battery chargers have become an integral part of our lives. Most chargers continue to consume power even when not charging the device. Switch off appliances when not in use. Unplug the charger and switch off lights and fans when exiting the room.
Make use of daylight
Pakistan has good daylight available. On average, it receives approximately 1kW of solar energy per square meter of its landmass for 6- 7 hours per day. The number of sunshine hours the country receives is 3,000-3,300 per year.
We are unable to take full advantage of this natural resource and resort to using artificial resources to overcome this failure. Markets open after noon and stay open till late at night. This mismanagement of the schedule causes additional use of electricity.
Air conditioners
ACs, once considered a luxury, have now become a necessity. Manage them efficiently. Keep the temperature at 26C to avoid heavy consumption. Use air conditioning in the family lounge or commonly used rooms to discourage more individual ACs from being switched on.
Ventilation
When constructing houses, residential or commercial buildings, special attention should be given to big windows so that maximum sunlight is used during the daytime. Also, premises should have ventilation so fresh air can enter and create a comfortable environment.
Energy-efficient appliances
It is high time that we start using energy-efficient appliances. While considering the impact of inflation, it is not easy to replace big appliances like ACs or refrigerators. However, people can conveniently replace regular bulbs and opt for LED bulbs which consume less energy. Fans can be replaced as well. Using solar lights for gardens and car porches is another viable option.
Energy conservation is the need of the hour. It is high time that people at the personal and commercial levels take this issue seriously and take appropriate steps to start a conservation drive. This will go a long way in helping Pakistan be more energy efficient.

Osman Khalid Waheed has been president/CEO of Ferozsons Laboratories since 1999. Under him, the company has expanded its portfolio of medical solutions for critical diseases by forging alliances with a number of leading international partners, including the US’s Boston Scientific, Argentina’s Bagó Group and Gilead Sciences. His partnership with Gilead has helped him bring its treatment for Hepatitis C, Sovaldi, to millions of patients in Pakistan at a fraction of its international price.
In a joint venture with Bagó, he has set up BF Biosciences Ltd, the country’s first biotech pharmaceutical manufacturing company. Currently, his company is establishing an export-oriented vaccination manufacturing plant at the cost of $25 million. It will complete by November and can produce 750mn doses of Covid vaccination annually, three times more than the country’s needs. Besides Covid vaccination, it can also manufacture insulin and flu shots.
Recently, he sat with Dawn for an interview on a wide range of issues from drug quality assurance to pricing to undersized markets to export, which have long affected the growth of Pakistan’s pharmaceutical industry and forced many foreign companies to exit this market. Following are the excerpts of the interview:

A: Currently, Pakistan is facing many existential challenges. The perpetual liquidity crisis or dollar shortages are the most critical because, as a nation, we do not export enough and whatever we sell to the world are low value-added products.
Our exports are less than 10 per cent of our GDP; hence, we always end up with a large trade deficit, putting pressure on our reserves and current account. For India, this ratio is more than double. Even Bangladesh exports far more than ours.
Many studies have shown that the pharmaceutical sector is one of the industries that can help boost Pakistan’s value-added exports and narrow the trade gap. But we need a supportive environment for that.
Our industry is in a crisis due to unprecedented high raw material prices and the massive devaluation of the rupee over the last several months. The industry’s earnings are squeezing, as is evident from the shrinking balance sheets of listed pharma firms. Eventually, it’s becoming impossible for most manufacturers to import expensive raw materials and sell medicines at their current prices, far below the producers’ cost of production. This crisis often shows up in periodic shortages of medicines.
Going forward, I can say that the shortages may worsen once the raw material inventories are exhausted unless the prices of medicines are increased to reflect the higher production costs. The industry needs strong political support for deregulating the drug pricing mechanism.

A ‘managed’ deregulation process with a 2pc levy on turnover to set up a medicine fund for the poor may be a solution to appease all parties

Q: But drug price deregulation will put most, especially life-saving, medicines out of reach of the vast majority of people, no?
A: The poor should get free medicines. It is the state’s responsibility to take care of its poor. If the government fears that drug price deregulation will hurt them or the low-income people, it can start with ‘managed’ deregulation but enough for the companies to recover their cost and earn decent margins to sustain and re-invest in technological upgradation and quality improvement.
If the government deregulates prices of certain salts and imposes a 2pc levy on the industry’s turnover to finance a fund to supply free medicines for the poor through public-sector hospitals, this will double the federal health budget and help the industry survive, grow and export. That would be a ‘win-win’ situation for all, with the poor getting free medicines rather than subsidised purchases. It’s high time to take an innovative approach.
Q: How has India become a major player in the global supply chain?
A: It’s a source of shame for us as an industry. But ultimately, there is a difference in how this sector was approached in India and Pakistan. They adopted and pursued the right policies; we didn’t.
The problem here is that policymakers assume that we’re all thieves who want to maximise their profit. No investor — foreign or local — thinks on such lines. They don’t invest to make a quick buck and run away with the loot.
In the early 1990s, the government deregulated drug prices but reversed the decision after a couple of months, owing to political noise. India deregulated this industry much later. Yet, today it alone can meet nearly 70pc of the world’s vaccine demand and is a major supplier of the raw materials for the industry worldwide. On the other hand, we totally depend on imported vaccines and active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Drug prices in India are by and large regulated through market competition except in a few cases. Their drug control authority works to improve quality as drug pricing is left to the ministry of chemicals.
India has, thus, strengthened its quality controls, and its pharmaceutical industry has grown as a big exporter along with China.
This strategy gives clarity to investors that they can recover their costs in case of an abnormal price increase due to any factor like rising global commodity rates, currency devaluation and so on.
Unfortunately, it never happened in Pakistan as pricing and quality assurance come under the same ministry. That’s a challenge. This means drug pricing is being over-regulated, quality is under-regulated and hence, we lag far behind India.
Q: Why is the separation of these two functions necessary?
A: It is important because we cannot enter the international markets unless we can ensure quality. Adherence to quality standards helps exports.
Our regulator, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan, is completely occupied with price-fixing. It has lost focus on quality. Our regulations are limited to controlling drug pricing instead of ensuring the medicines’ quality or encouraging competition.
Pakistan is not even a member of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme, which basically carries out a standard inspection for quality assurance. Pakistan needs to become its member to thrive.
A company can make quality standards but cannot enforce them. This is where the regulators must step in. It should set minimum quality standards for any manufacturer that wants to operate here, standardise drug laws according to the WHO guidelines, and diligently enforce those standards.
Even Bangladesh has much more flexible pricing when it comes to medication. They don’t compromise on quality. Their manufacturers are US Food and Drug Administration and World Health organisation approved, which Pakistan still doesn’t have. For this to happen, you need a health system that recognises quality first and comes up with severe consequences for non-compliance.
Q: If prices are unsustainable, how has this industry steadily grown and prospered over the years?
A: If you take a closer look at any listed company, it will become clear that there are suffering huge losses or are on the verge of collapse. It’s all documented. The industry’s depressed and undersized because of low healthcare spending.
Pakistan is the world’s fifth most populous country, but its healthcare market is a mere $3 billion. How can 600 plus firms survive in this market? Even though this industry isn’t falling apart yet, if you look at its current revenues, you would know it is barely surviving and not prospering.
We can grow and make inroads into export markets by taking advantage of our expertise in the finished goods industry. But that first requires a stable pricing environment for the industry within the country.
Providing a stable and predictable price regime for the industry will trigger new investment and growth and position the industry for improved exports.

13,Prioritise small businesses,The resource-starved government must reach out to international financial institutions and NGOs to seek exclusive funding.,"


 
It is difficult to estimate the losses that small and medium enterprises (SME) suffered during the recent floods. But when we consider the 2022 floods affected more districts than the 2010 super floods, it becomes evident that the cumulative losses of the SMEs are colossal.
The federal and provincial governments, the national and provincial disaster management authorities (NDMA and PDMAs), Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA) and commercial banks must develop an integrated plan to help revive SMEs. Enabling the flood-hit SMEs to restart business as soon as possible must be prioritised. In collaboration with the government, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) needs to roll out concessional financing schemes for flood-hit SMEs.
If all this begins right now, the SME sector can be expected to restart contributing to overall economic recovery from the beginning of 2023 — or even earlier. The resource-starved government must reach out to international financial institutions and non-governmental organisations (NGO) to seek exclusive funding for the revival of flood-hit SMEs, part of which can be utilised for refinancing SMEs’ concessional loan schemes. Meanwhile, the government also needs to develop a more straightforward documentation process for SMEs so that they may qualify for bank loans.
The floods of 2022 affected 118 out of 160 districts of Pakistan, whereas the 2010 floods affected 78 out of the then 143 districts. (Authorities have declared “calamity-hit” 81 districts where flash floods caused the most losses of human lives, infrastructure and livestock). According to the government’s initial findings, the number of severely/moderately affected districts also include those with high economic activity level. The number of people affected by the monsoon floods has exceeded 33 million.

The resource-starved government must reach out to international financial institutions and NGOs to seek exclusive funding for the revival of flood-hit SMEs, part of which can be utilised for refinancing concessional loan schemes

There are more than 5m SMEs spread across Pakistan. They can be broadly categorised as manufacturing SMEs, trading SMEs and services SMEs (including IT and IT-enabled businesses). The SME sector contributes 40 per cent to GDP and is responsible for generating 25pc of exports.
The monsoon 2022 floods have affected all SMEs. But losses of manufacturing SMEs are huge, particularly those in textiles, leather, foods and agriculture sub-sectors. The floods have damaged their physical infrastructure and stocks of products and disrupted their access to power and gas supplies, affecting labour availability.
More than two dozen SMEs are located across Punjab. The floods have already affected many SMEs established in southern Punjab’s calamity-hit districts. Many are manufacturing SMEs and are important parts of the supply chain of export-oriented industries like textiles and food and fruit processing.
In Sindh and Baluchistan, the situation is worse. The provincial government has declared 23 districts as calamity-hit, and SMEs in all these districts and some parts of two districts of Karachi have suffered losses of infrastructure and business stocks.
In Karachi, the access of these SMEs to the supply of labour, electricity, and gas was restored within a few days. But in 23 districts of interior Sindh, this has not been the case, and the SMEs located there or operating from there are waiting not only for the compensation of losses but are also unable to get utilities’s supply. Moreover, their workers living in adjoining areas, marooned by the floods, also cannot return to work.
The calamity-hit districts of Sindh include areas of high economic activity such as Hyderabad, Thatta, Mirpurkhas, Sukkur and Ghotki, which are home to hundreds of thousands of agricultural, manufacturing and trading and services SMEs.
The situation of SMEs in 17 districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is similar. Furthermore, SMEs in the tourism industry, most notably hotels and restaurants, have lost almost all business and it might take them some time to get their clients back. Many calamity-hit districts like Charsadda, Chitral, Dera Ismail Khan and Swat are known for their agricultural, tourism, manufacturing and trading SMEs. The merciless floods have brought the businesses of these SMEs to their knees.
Although in Balochistan the normal level of economic activity is far less than the other provinces, it has suffered far more than the rest of Pakistan during these floods. The damages done to the road and market networks and bridges are so extreme that the rest of Pakistan lost land route access to this backward province for more than a week. This fact alone is enough to understand how the SMEs there (although much lower in number than in other provinces) may have suffered.
According to media reports, the most pressing problem of many SMEs, particularly those in Sindh, is the non-availability of workers and access to electricity and gas. Physical infrastructure and business stocks of them have been damaged completely or partially. Since the monsoon rains are predicted to continue in September, aggravating the flood situation, there is little hope for immediate relief for these and other SMEs.
With great help from local NGOs and the international community, the federal and provincial governments are currently focusing mainly on humanitarian relief and rehabilitation.

14,No end in sight,"Aware of the trust deficit, the Sindh government encourages NGOs’ rehabilitation efforts while it targets Rabi season’s crop.","

—RA

 
The pace of recovery in Sindh, beyond relief and rehabilitation efforts, will depend on the province’s ability to manage the plantation of the Rabi crops (cotton, rice, sugarcane, chillies, etc.) that have to be sown latest by early December.
“Rabi crop must be cultivated to rebuild lives and kickstart recovery in Sindh even if it has to be delayed to early December from October-November. We are targetting the revival of the irrigation network on priority, supporting and facilitating farmers with timely provision of seeds, tools/machinery and fertiliser and developing systems to lend a helping hand to inspire confidence to restart farming activities as soon as possible,” stated the chief minister of Sindh.
He was talking to a select group of journalists at the Chief Minister House early last week. Will the help of a PowerPoint presentation, he tried to fill in the information gaps. Slides highlighted inundated areas and those in danger of flooding, estimated losses, relief delivered thus far by the government, armed forces, etc, and the projected supply requirement necessary to sustain the displaced population.
Visibly distressed over the danger of flooding in multiple second-tier cities of Sindh and overwhelmed by the scale of devastation Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah did not even pretend to be in control. On the contrary, he expected the situation to actually get worse before it started to improve in the province.

“Eight hundred per cent higher than average rain in the provinces was a bolt from the blue. In mid-July, we took stock of the expected rain situation in the presence of all relevant functionaries, including the provincial disaster management authority. We assumed we had sufficient supplies to cope with the above-normal rain that Pakistan Metrological Department had warned us about.
“No one even remotely suggested what was to be. It was beyond our wildest imagination. Sadly, the situation turned out to be much worse for Sindh. Compared to 241pc higher than normal rain in Pakistan, Sindh received 784pc higher downpours in the first 25 days of August (435.6 millimetres against an average of 49.3mm). Therefore, it is unfair to blame the Sindh government for the misery and devastation in the province. Our systems might not be the best, but no government anywhere in the world can be prepared to cope with such a huge deviation,” the chief minister said.

Sharing his insights from his visits across Sindh, he said, “Floods washed away all mud houses in the affected districts and much of the infrastructure including roads, bridges and canal dykes in the province inflicting damages of whooping Rs1.5 trillion.
“Loss of lives, cattle stock and standing crops have broken our people. We are doing all in our power with the help of the federal government, armed forces, civil society organisations, global bodies and friendly countries to rescue and provide relief, but the challenge is too huge to be managed with the capacity and resource limitations. Sadly, I don’t foresee a semblance of normalcy restored before early December in the province”.
He did not contest the perception of the lack of trust in the Sindh government to channelise donations for flood victims. “Yes, we are aware of the trust deficit and encourage and support all non-government outfits disbursing relief goods and cash support for the uprooted people. It is pertinent, however, to remember that civil society organisations can never substitute government efforts.
“Today collectively, all private bodies might at best be catering to 5pc of the displaced people; the rest is taken care of by the government with the help of federal, local and global supporting structures”. He gave a rundown of relief material disbursed so far amongst the needy in a slide.
He said the dewatering of area is the biggest challenge in Sindh. “With Indus already high, draining of water is the biggest challenge right now. Where can I divert the water? It’s going to take its own sweet time to drain. I hope and pray that there are no further rains. The topography of Sindh doesn’t help. It is relatively flatter and will take longer for water to flow down through Indus to the ocean that is also experiencing high tide.”
He disclosed that a one-year recovery plan is in the works in Sindh. “We intend to focus on rebuilding roads, rehabilitating bridges, restoring the irrigation network and upgrading the drainage system keeping challenges of climate change in sight.
Responding to a question on their stance towards the opposition, he said it’s time to rise above politics, save people and help rebuild their lives and livelihood. “Honestly, I have no time for political bickering. As a chief executive of the province my focus is on dealing with the natural calamity which is my first and foremost responsibility.”

17,The destructive power of Balochistan’s rivers,It is not only climate change that is causing devastation — it is also the mismanagement and negligence of the authorities.,"The Porali river is situated in Bela town, the most populated town in Lasbela, on the Regional Corporation for Development (RCD) highway that connects Quetta and Karachi at a distance of over 700km. Officials and locals who spoke to Dawn in Bela and elsewhere in the district believe that flood waters spilled over Porali’s banks, inundating the town of Bela.
In Uthal, the headquarters of district Lasbela, a senior officer from the deputy commissioner’s office drew a map of the floods that inundated the Lasbela district. The Porali river, he said, caused most of the damage in Lasbela.
Under the World Bank-financed Balochistan Integrated Water Resource Management and Development Project (BIWRMDP), the total cost of Porali (Bela) and Nari river (Sibi) basins was $110 million. Documents available with Dawn suggest that during the monsoon season, the Porali River received very high-intensity floods of about 218,600 cusecs on the midnight of 24th-25th July 2022, with another high-intensity flood on 19th-20th August 2022.
The document further states that the Tharra Bund constructed in the past that was meant to protect the Bela town was also damaged and washed away by the flood.

It is not only climate change that is causing devastation — it is also the mismanagement and negligence of the authorities in executing developments

In 2016, Sikander Brohi, a researcher and civil society professional, discussed the Porali River in his article “Balochistan’s irrigation dilemma”. According to him, the project seems to be a case of misplaced priorities, developed without proper participation from relevant local communities. Like others who have said the same, no one paid any heed to them. Thus, those who were aware knew Porali would cause destruction during torrential rains and floods — but who was there to listen?
When this scribe reached Bela in August, most of its urban centres were still submerged under water. One such place in the heart of Bela is Sheikh Goth, Sandeman Park Bela, where I met Zubair Baloch, a driver’s son, playing around Sandeman park.
Like Sandeman park today, Zubair’s place is also submerged along with other houses and schools in their Goth. As most of the homes in Sheikh Goth are pakka (concrete), they were cracked or still stood among the flood waters pouring out of the Porali river. Zubair and others had shifted to a safer embankment in the vicinity.
“Our house is partially damaged,” says Tanver Lasi, a student of BS English at a university in Lasbela, standing in front of his house in sports clothes. “Our family moved to this place for better education from rural Lasbela.”
Similar to Mr Lasi’s family, most of the over 100 families had moved to the heart of Bela, in Sheik Goth, for the same purpose. But unfortunately, they are at the mouth of floods, pouring out of the Porali river at any time. “We have to pay the price due to the mismanagement of the river,” they complain.
In Lasbela, other than Porali, rivers have broken the road between the towns of Bela and Utha at four points. Big and small trucks were parked on the road, causing traffic jams. Only small vehicles were allowed to pass between the said towns, when this scribe visited.
Similarly, the torrential rains and floods in other parts of Balochistan have blocked the highways, railway tracks and other communications services with the rest of the country.
In Uthal, the deputy commissioner’s office bearers say they are trying to reach out to flood-hit people to provide rations and tents, particularly in Lakra, a town where most people are stuck and inundated. “We also moved equipment to the Pirali river basin to stop further damage,” says an officer. Due to torrential rains and floods, it is one of the most flood-affected districts in Balochistan.
In many places, floods have been caused by rivers overflowing.
Like the Porali river, Sibi, situated southeast of Quetta at a distance of 110km, also has a story of river destruction: the Nari river. Nari river was also financed along with the Porali river by the World Bank. The residents of Sibi live in constant fear of the Nari river’s rising waters.
“The situation was quite bad,” says Mansoor Qazi, the young and bespectacled Deputy Commissioner of Sibi, adding that the discharge capacity of Nari Gaj is 150,000 cusecs water while the water had come around 230,000 cusecs. “It has overflown in many places, submerging villages in Sibi, including the city. So, we have used breaches in some places to save the populated areas.”
Evidently, it is not only climate change that is causing destruction, it is also the mismanagement and negligence of the authorities in executing developments in Balochistan.
