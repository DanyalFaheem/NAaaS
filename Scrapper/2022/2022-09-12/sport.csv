0,Rangers vs Napoli CL game rescheduled,NYON: Scottish side Rangers’ home Champions League game against Napoli on Tuesday has been postponed by a day due...,"NYON: Scottish side Rangers’ home Champions League game against Napoli on Tuesday has been postponed by a day due to a lack of adequate security personnel following the death of Queen Elizabeth, UEFA said on Sunday.
The Queen died aged 96 on Thursday, which led to a raft of postponements across different sports in Britain over the weekend, including Premier League and English Football League (EFL) games.
“(The game) has been rescheduled for Wednesday 14 Sept. This is due to the severe limitations on police resou­r­ces and organisational issues related to the ongoing events,” European football’s governing body said in a statement. “Away fans will not be authorised at the games, and as a matter of sporting fairness, Rangers’ fans will not be authorised for the return leg in Naples.” Britain’s Nati­onal Police Chiefs’ Council said it was a unique situation.
“Following the decisions of the Premier League and EFL to cancel this weekend’s matches, we will work with football clubs to try and ensure that... fixtures can take place safely when balanced against the requirement to support national events and deliver day to day policing,” said a NPCC spokesperson.

1,Neymar strikes again as PSG extend unbeaten run,PARIS: Paris St Germain forward Neymar scored his eighth Ligue 1 goal of the campaign as the champions overcame ...,"PARIS: Paris St Germain forward Neymar scored his eighth Ligue 1 goal of the campaign as the champions overcame Brest 1-0 in a tough game at Parc des Princes on Saturday to extend their unbeaten start and reclaim top spot in the standings.
PSG are top on goal difference from Marseille, who also remain unbeaten  in the league after beating Lille 2-1 in Saturday’s other game The result, secured after Gianluigi Donnarumma saved a late Islam Slimani penalty, means Christophe Galtier’s side have 19 points from seven matches, two more than second-placed RC Lens.
Brest came into the contest having conceded a club record 16 goals in their first six games and were carved open after half an hour despite a bright start as Neymar fired in from a tight angle after being played through by Lionel Messi.
The visitors were lucky not to be reduced to 10 men as Christophe Herelle was shown a red card for scything down Neymar but a review prompted the referee to reverse his decision as the PSG forward was offside before the tackle.
The hosts turned the screw on their opponents and both Messi and Kylian Mbappe squandered clear opportunities either side of halftime before 17th-placed Brest were awarded a spot kick but Slimani’s tame 70th minute effort was kept out by Donnarumma.
“It was very difficult. It was important to win after the Champions League and we did that,” Donnarumma said, referring to last week’s 2-1 win over Juventus.
“We’re also happy for our fans who are always there for us and we wanted to win for them. It’s really important to be able to suffer together and we saw that today.”  Presnel Kim­pembe, whose challenge on Noah Fadiga led to the penalty, went off injured to leave PSG with 10 men after they had used up their substitutes but experienced defenders Sergio Ramos and Marquinhos helped them see out the match.
Donnarumma was instrumental in ensuring the home side got the win as he was called into action again with a diving save after the ball appeared to be going in at the near post off Slimani’s shoulder following a cross from the left.
The victory extended PSG’s winning run against Brest to 12 games but it was far from comfortable and they will aim to iron out issues in attack before Wednesday’s Champions League game at Maccabi Haifa and next Sunday’s trip to Olympique Lyonnais.
Marseille bounced back from a 2-0 defeat away to Tottenham Hotspur in  the Champions League in midweek as they welcomed Lille to the Velodrome. A much-changed Marseille fell behind early on when Brazilian  full-back Ismaily tucked in the rebound for Lille after an Adam Ounas  shot came back off the post. 
Igor Tudor’s side drew level in the 26th minute as Alexis Sanchez —  who missed the Tottenham defeat through suspension — turned in a  Cengiz Under centre for his fourth goal in his last four Ligue 1  appearances. 
The winner came just after the hour when Sead Kolasinac helped on Under’s free-kick delivery for Samuel Gigot to score. Marseille host Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League on Tuesday.

2,Stokes leads from the front as England eye series win over SA,LONDON: England’s seamers exploited the exaggerated swing and seam at The Oval to reduce South Africa to 146 for...,"LONDON: England’s seamers exploited the exaggerated swing and seam at The Oval to reduce South Africa to 146 for seven in their second innings at tea on day four of the third and final Test, a lead of 106 following an extraordinary five sessions in the game.
Twenty-seven wickets have fallen since Saturday morning after day one of the Test was washed out by rain and the second cancelled as a mark of respect following the death of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth.
Kyle Verreynne was on eight not out and Keshav Maharaj yet to face a ball as South Africa desperately seek a lead they can defend, with anything over 180 to challenge England in these bowling conditions.
Jansen earlier took a career best 5-35 as the visitors bowled England out for 158, picking up their last three wickets inside the first 13 minutes of play for the addition of four runs.
They made a good start to their second innings as well, reaching 58 without loss and a lead of 18 before England struck. After that the wickets fell at regular intervals.
Sarel Erwee (26) edged home captain Ben Stokes to Joe Root at first slip before England claimed the big wicket of Dean Elgar (36) in somewhat bizarre circumstances.
He missed a booming inswinger from Stuart Broad (2-40) and walked almost before umpire Nitin Menon raised the finger, only for replays to show the ball was missing leg stump by around five centimetres.
It was an error of judgement from the captain but not that Broad cared. By dismissing Elgar, he surpassed retired  Australia great Glenn McGrath’s career tally of 563 Test wickets, with  only longstanding team-mate and fellow England star James Anderson (666) having taken more among pace bowlers.
But as Broad had pointed out after equalling McGrath’s mark on  Saturday, he was appearing in his 159th Test compared to the 124 played  by a  “hero of mine”.
Keegan Petersen (23) was picked up by Ollie Pope at third slip off James Anderson, before Ryan Rickelton (8) was trapped plumb lbw by Broad.
Ollie Robinson (2-40) came into the attack and got the ball to move both ways, forcing Wiaan Mulder (14) to play onto his stumps and claiming an lbw to remove Khaya Zondo (16).
Stokes (2-29) picked up the wicket of in-form Jansen (4) with the last ball before tea.
The final session on Sunday will likely decide the course of the match, with England looking to mop up the South Africa tail, and the visitors hoping to put pressure back on their hosts with the bat.
On Saturday, Robinson returned his best England figures before South Africa hit back. An extraordinary third day finished with England 154-7, a lead of just 36 runs.
Towering Jansen removed the opening pair of struggling Alex Lees (13), bowled between bat and pad, and Zak Crawley (five), lbw to an inswinger. Jansen got all four England’s top order wickets and finished with the figures of 4-34 in 11 overs.
The hosts’ 84-2 at tea soon became 84-3 when Root, chasing a wide Jansen delivery, was brilliantly caught by Keegan Petersen at third slip for 23 — the star batsman’s first double-figure score of the series. 
Brook, a team-mate of Root at Yorkshire, got off the mark in style by cover-driving Jansen for four before rain stopped play for 30 minutes. The 23-year-old had not added to his score of 12 when he carelessly hoisted Jansen to Rabada at long leg. 
Stokes, having nearly holed out on five, fell for six when he edged  an extravagant drive off fast bowler Anrich Nortje to first slip.

MONZA: Red Bull’s Max Verstappen crosses the finish line to win the Formula One Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza on Sunday.—Reuters

 
MONZA: Red Bull’s Max Verstappen dashed Ferrari’s home hopes and won the Italian Grand Prix behind the safety car on Sunday to move potentially a race away from his second Formula One world championship.
The Dutch 24-year-old’s victory at the  “Temple of Speed”, in a race that ended disappointingly and to jeers from the crowd, was Verstappen’s fifth in a row and 11th from 16 races this season.
Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, Verstappen’s closest rival and now 116 points adrift with six races remaining, took second after starting on pole position.
George Russell finished third for Mercedes.
If Verstappen scores 22 points more than Leclerc in the next race under floodlights in Singapore on Oct. 2, the title battle will be over. Otherwise, it goes on to Japan a week later. 
“You deserve that victory. It’s a shame it didn’t get going at the end there but you were the fastest car all weekend,” Red Bull boss Christian Horner told Verstappen over the radio after the chequered flag. 
“Great job guys, we had a great race car,” he replied.
The win was the 31st of Verstappen’s career, lifting him level with Britain’s 1992 champion Nigel Mansell in the all-time lists.
Verstappen started seventh on the grid but was third by the end of the opening lap and 19.5 seconds clear of Leclerc with 20 laps remaining, after the Monegasque had pitted for a second time to switch from medium tyres to softs.
The safety car, deployed six laps from the end when last year’s winner Daniel Ricciardo stopped his McLaren on track with an engine failure, raised the home fans’ hopes but time ran out.
The race, at a super-fast circuit celebrating its 100th anniversary, finished with the safety car peeling off into the pits at the finish and no opportunity for the order to change in the short run to the flag. 
“The end was frustrating, I wish we could have had a bit of a race,” said Leclerc. 
“It’s a shame, but I gave it all today. I wish I could have won in front of the amazing Tifosi (fans) but I just couldn’t today.”  
Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz was fourth, after starting 18th and seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton went from the back row of the grid to fifth for Mercedes.
Red Bull’s Sergio Perez was sixth, and took a bonus point for fastest lap, ahead of McLaren’s Lando Norris and AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly.
Dutch debutant Nyck de Vries took ninth place for Williams, a stellar achievement that earned him the Driver of the Day accolade, and China’s Guanyu Zhou was 10th for Alfa Romeo in their home race. 
“My shoulders are dead,” said De Vries, who was standing in for regular driver Alex Albon after the Thai suffered an appendicitis on Saturday morning.
A minute’s silence was observed before the start for Queen Elizabeth, Britain’s longest reigning monarch who died aged 96 on Thursday.

4,Swiatek defeats Jabeur to clinch US Open crown,She is unbeaten in finals since suffering a lone reverse in her first WTA final in Lugano three years ago.,"NEW YORK: Iga Swiatek surged to the third Grand Slam title of her career with a maiden victory at the US Open on Saturday, defeating Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur in straight sets to extend her remarkable finals winning streak.
The 21-year-old world number one from Poland saw off a second set fightback from history-chasing Jabeur to prevail 6-2, 7-6 (7-5) in 1hr 52min at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
The win was Swiatek’s second Grand Slam title of 2022 to set alongside her French Open victory in June, which followed her maiden Grand Slam win at Roland Garros in 2020.
Swiatek’s victory was her 10th straight win in a final. She is unbeaten in finals since suffering a lone reverse in her first WTA final in Lugano three years ago.
Swiatek collapsed on court in relief after a win that saw her pocket a hefty $2.6 million in prize money. 
“I’m really glad it’s not in cash,” she quipped as she was presented with her winner’s cheque for a tournament she entered with low expectations when the season began. 
“I wasn’t sure if I was on the level yet to win actually a Grand Slam, especially at the US Open where the surface is so fast,” she said. 
“It’s something that I wasn’t expecting for sure. It’s also like a confirmation for me that the sky is the limit. 
“I’m proud, also surprised a little bit, just happy that I was able to do that.” But the loss was another agonising near-miss for Jabeur, who had been bidding to become the first woman from Africa to win a Grand Slam title.
The 28-year-old from Tunis had also been beaten in the final of Wimbledon in July. 
“I have nothing to regret because I did everything possible,” said Jabeur. 
“I’m not someone that’s going to give up. I am sure I’m going to be in the final again and I will try my best to win it.” 
JABEUR FIGHTBACK
Jabeur impressed en route to the final, dropping only a single set and stitching together a string of assured performances.
But she was in trouble almost from the get-go against the clinical Swiatek, who was into her stride quickly with her serve and signature forehand functioning smoothly.
Jabeur by contrast looked jittery and was broken to love in her first service game.
Swiatek held easily to go 3-0 up with only eight minutes gone in the first set.
Jabeur did threaten a revival when she held and then broke to close the gap to 3-2.
But the fifth seed was let down again by her shaky service game, a problem throughout Saturday’s final, and Swiatek broke back for a 4-2 lead.
Jabeur was broken again as she served to stay in the set and Swiatek took the first set.
Swiatek threatened to run away with the second set after breaking Jabeur and holding to go 3-0 up.
Yet Jabeur showed great determination to break Swiatek to cut the deficit to 3-2.
Once again however Jabeur was unable to make the service break count and Swiatek broke again for a 4-2 lead.
This time, though, Jabeur dug deep to claw her way back into the contest, assisted by a slice of luck when a Swiatek return clipped a net cord to clinch a service break.
Jabeur held to level the score at 4-4 and suddenly the momentum had shifted.
The next three games went with serve and Jabeur was left serving to stay in the match. She fought off a match point at 5-6 and 30-40 down before holding for 6-6.
Jabeur recovered from 4-2 down to lead 5-4 in the tie break, but it was Swiatek who showed greater composure, converting her second match point when Jabeur smacked a return long.

5,Australia’s Finch ends ODI career with win on back of Smith century,"""Been a fun ride, I’ve loved every bit of it,"" he says.","CAIRNS: A Steve Smith century helped give retiring Australia skipper Aaron Finch a winning send-off Sunday with a 25-run victory in the final One-day international against New Zealand at Cairns.
Chasing the home team’s 267-5, built on the back of Smith’s masterful 105, the Blacks Caps were all out for 242 in the last over with Mitchell Starc taking 3-60.
It capped a disappointing Chappell-Hadlee series for the visitors.
Australia won the opening game by two wickets before a 113-run thrashing of the Black Caps in the second. 
“For us to get to 260 after probably our slowest start ever was just amazing,” said Finch, who was out for five in his 146th and last ODI.  
“Our bowling has been good, everyone has contributed. 
“Been a fun ride, I’ve loved every bit of it,” he added of his ODI career.
New Zealand started the chase confidently, racing to 49 before Sean Abbott tem­ped Devon Conway (21) into a drive that Smith caught.
Cameron Green accou­nted for opener Finn Allen after a breezy 35, caught low by Josh Hazlewood to leave them 57-2 in the 12th over.
Some unplayable bowling starved New Zealand of runs with Alex Carey stumping Tom Latham for 10 off Adam Zampa’s spin and Smith taking a comfortable catch to remove Daryl Mitchell (16) off Hazlewood.
When skipper Kane Williamson was run out for 27 after a comical mix up with Glenn Phillips they were in trouble at 112-5.
But a 61-run partnership between Phillips and Jimmy Neesham (36) then a 51-run stand with Mitchell Santner left them needing 46 from the last five overs and in the hunt.
Phillip’s departure for 47 then Santner for 30 in the space of six balls, both caught near the boundary, ended any chance they had. 
“Slightly improved performance but Australia really showed their quality again,” said Williamson. 
“We need to learn to adjust to conditions quicker and try to put the teams under pressure when we can.”
STANDING OVATION
Williamson won the toss and sent Australia in and, after a moment’s silence to mark the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Finch was given a guard of honour as he strode to the crease.
He survived a big shout for lbw on one but didn’t last long, bowled by Tim Southee as he attempted a drive from the 13th ball he faced, walking off to a standing ovation.
It ended a career in which he made 5,406 runs at 38.89, hitting 17 centuries to leave him behind only Ricky Pon­ting (29), David Warner and Mark Waugh (both 18) in the Australian pecking order.
Finch will remain in charge of the Twenty20 side for the World Cup at home next month.
His long-time opening partner Warner was rested with Josh Inglis handed an opportunity that he failed to grab, caught behind off Trent Boult for 10.
It left Australia on 16-2 with a nervy Smith and Marnus Labuschagne facing 22 dot balls as they struggled to settle.
But they persevered and built a crucial 118-run partnership before Labuschagne mis-hit a pull shot and was out for 52, caught by Neesham off Boult.
Undeterred, Smith powered to his 12th ODI century off 127 balls, hitting 10 fours and a six before being bowled by Santner. Alex Carey added a composed unbeaten 42.

6,Khyber Pakhtunkhwa taste first defeat at National T20 Cup,Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s run chase derailed after promising start with the dismissal of Mohammad Haris.,"MULTAN: Khyber Pakhtun­khwa went down to their first loss in the ongoing National T20 Cup when Central Punjab beat them by 25 runs here at the Multan Cricket Stadium on Sunday.  
Central Punjab had posted a mammoth 194-run target for the defending champions after being put in to bat first, thanks to a brilliant second wicket 98-run partnership between opener Mohammad Faizan and one-drop Tayyab Tahir.
Central Punjab were dealt a blow early with the dismissal of Muhammad Akhlaq on the fourth ball, but Faizan and Tayyab, who scored his fourth fifty of the tournament, put a strong counterattack, pushing Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s bowlers on the backfoot.
Faizan scored at a swashbuckling rate of 200 — his 72 off 36 included seven sixes and four fours. Tayyab smashed 75 in 48 (eight fours and four sixes) before he was run out.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bowlers Maaz Khan and Mohammad Imran came into play in the second part of the innings and shared seven wickets between them. Maaz returned 4-46 and Imran returned 3-30.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s run chase derailed after a promising start with the dismissal of Mohammad Haris (14 off 15). His fellow opener top-scored with 31-ball 47 and was removed in the 11th over with the scorecard reading 77-3. 
Mohammad Sarwar Afridi and captain Khalid Usman put a fight in the middle order scoring 28 off 14 and 24 off 16 respectively, but that did not prove to be enough for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Hunain Shah accounted for Sarwar and Maaz, returning 2-28 in his T20 debut. Aamer Yamin and Ali Asfand also took two wickets as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were restricted to 168-9.
This was Central Punjab’s only second win of the tournament.
Earlier, Southern Punjab began the Multan leg of the tournament with a win as they defeated Balochistan by 20 runs (DLS method) as a dust storm at the completion of the sixth over of the run chase ended the match.
Balochistan were bowled out for 144, albeit on the last ball of the innings. Ali Majid took three wickets for 27, Mohammad Ilyas returned 2-19, captain Salman Ali Agha took two wickets for 26 runs and Mohammad Imran picked up his two wickets for 23 runs.
With 27 each, Asad Shafiq and Kashif Bhatti top-scored for Balochistan, while other batters struggled.
Southern Punjab’s run chase was off to a perfect start with Umar Siddiq (32 not out off 20) and Zain Abbas (21 not out off 16) adding 54 runs at the completion of powerplay. 
When the dust storm set in, Southern Punjab were 20 runs ahead of Balochistan and were declared winners.
Scores in brief: 
CENTRAL PUNJAB 193 in 20 overs (Tayyab Tahir 75, Mohammad Faizan 72; Maaz Khan 4-46, Mohammad Imran 3-30); KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA 168-9 in 20 overs (Sahibzada Farhan 47, Mohammad Sarwar Afridi 28; Ali Asfand 2-14, Hunain Shah 2-28.
BALOCHISTAN 144 in 20 overs (Kashif Bhatti 27 not out, Asad Shafiq 27, Abdul Wahid Bangalzai 25; Ali Majid 3-27, Mohammad Ilyas 2-19, Muhammad Imran 2-23); SOUTHERN PUNJAB 54 in six overs (Umar Siddiq 32 not out, Zain Abbas 21 not out).

7,Giroud penalty earns 10-man Milan victory at Sampdoria,GENOA: A penalty by French striker Olivier Giroud gave 10-man AC Milan a deserved 2-1 win at Sampdoria in Serie A on...,"GENOA: A penalty by French striker Olivier Giroud gave 10-man AC Milan a deserved 2-1 win at Sampdoria in Serie A on Saturday, sealing their first away victory of the season.
In Naples, Italy forward Raspadori struck the decisive goal in the final  minute of a stodgy encounter at the Stadio Maradona, putting Luciano  Spalletti’s side one point ahead of Atalanta. The 22-year-old swept home Hirving Lozano’s cross to net his first  goal for Napoli on his second start after arriving on loan from Sassuolo  last month. 
Milan moved up to second place level on 14 points from six games behind Napoli, who are also unbeaten after edging Spezia 1-0 with Giacomo Raspadori scoring his first goal for the club.
Stefano Pioli’s Milan side ended their wait for an away win this season after drawing at Atalanta and Sassuolo.
His side opened the scoring in the sixth minute when Rafael Leao brilliantly set up forward Junior Messias in the box and the Brazilian put the champions in front with a low shot.
With his third assist of the season, Leao has contributed to 20 Serie A goals this year (10 goals, 10 assists).
Five minutes after the hosts went behind midfielder Filip Djuricic almost levelled but his fierce strike hit the bar.
Milan could have had a two-goal advantage when Charles De Ketelaere found the net with his back in the 21st but it was ruled out after a VAR review for offside in the build-up.
Sampdoria goalkeeper Emil Audero then kept out a great first-time shot by Giroud just before halftime.
Milan played a solid first half but things got complicated after the break when they were left with 10 men after losing Leao to a second yellow card for a scissor-kick which connected with the head of defender Alex Ferrari.
Sampdoria took advantage in the 57th minute when their Serbia midfielder Filip Djuricic deftly headed home a neat lofted pass from defender Tommaso Augello.
But 10 minutes later Milan regained the lead with Giroud’s spot kick after midfielder Gonzalo Villar had handled.
“It’s a moment that will stay in my head and heart,” Raspadori told DAZN. 
Simone Inzaghi’s side were staring at another poor result at the San  Siro after derby defeat to AC Milan last weekend and a midweek lesson  from Bayern Munich until Brozovic delicately dinked home the winner. 
“I missed two chances which I should have scored but thankfully the  team put me in the position to score and I kept my head.” Raspadori was  one of three signings made in quick succession by Napoli just after the  season started alongside Giovanni Simeone and Tanguy Ndombele.
Another late strike from Marcel Brozovic gave Inter Milan a hard-fought  1-0 win over Torino to offer some relief from recent blues. 
The Croatia midfielder met Nicolo Barella’s inswinging cross by  lifting a superb finish over Vanja Mili­nkovic-Savic which moved Inter  temporarily third. 
“We were in difficulty, this win is very important. It’s a win for  all of us, everyone who supports Inter,” said Brozovic to DAZN. Defeat was harsh on seventh-placed Torino who played well and forced  Samir Handanovic into a couple of good saves when the scores were still  level.

MUNICH: Bayern Munich conceded a stoppage-time penalty equaliser by VfB Stuttgart striker Serhou Guirassy that saw the match end 2-2 on Saturday, the champions’ third consecutive Bundesliga draw.
The champions go top on goal difference with 12 points.
Bayern, who host Barcelona in the Champions League group stage next week, had only themselves to blame for not killing off Stuttgart earlier, leaving coach Julian Nagelsmann to rue their missed opportunities.
“We played good for a 15-minute spell and also initially in the second half and deserved to go in front,” he told a news conference.  “But then we were too slow in our game and played on possession.
“We had enough chances to finish off the game. We had enough space to create those chances. But there was not a third goal and then the opponents think maybe they can still get something out of this. They got a deserved penalty and then it was 2-2.”  Yet it all had started so well for Bayern, with forward Mathys Tel scoring their opener in the 36th minute.
France youth International Tel, who at the age of 17 years and 136 days became the youngest player to start a league game for Bayern, had already scored in the German Cup first round.
He made sure of his first Bundesliga goal by drilling in a low drive from a Alphonso Davies’ cut-back.
Nagelsmann rotated heavily from Bayern’s 2-0 Champions League win at Inter Milan in midweek, and his team dropped the pace in the second half, giving Stuttgart room to push forward.
The visitors were rewarded when Chris Fuehrich netted the equaliser form close range in the 57th but three minutes later Bayern were back in front through another teenager.
Jamal Musiala, the 19-year-old former youngest league scorer for Bayern, shook off his marker with a quick change of direction and floated a superb ball into the net.
Stuttgart however were not done yet and came agonisingly close in the 74th when Guirassy’s shot from 18 metres bounced off the crossbar with goalkeeper Manuel Neuer beaten.
The Guinea International would get his chance in stoppage time, earning a penalty for a foul by Matthijs de Ligt. He kept his composure to beat Neuer and earn a point for the visitors.
In Leipzig, one-time Dortmund coach Marco Rose secured a win against his  former side in just his first match in charge, with a 3-0 victory. 
Rose, who coached Dortmund to second in the 2021-22 season before  being let go in favour of current boss Edin Terzic, was only appointed  Leipzig coach on Thursday after the sacking of Domenico Tedesco. 
While Dortmund started brightly, Willi Orban gave a jubilant Leipzig the lead after just six minutes with a towering header. 
Leipzig’s Hungarian midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai made it 2-0 just  before halftime with a swerving strike from outside the box, before  former Chelsea striker Timo Werner set up Amadou Haidara in the dying  stages of the match to give the home side a dominant victory. 
Hoffenheim  ran out dominant victors at home against a ten-man Mainz, with a 4-1 win  to go to second on the ladder. 
In Frankfurt, Wolfsburg recorded their first win of the season — and their debut Bundesliga victory under former Bayern coach Niko Kovac - with a narrow 1-0 victory over Eintracht. 
Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen’s woes continued, held to a 2-2 draw away at lowly Hertha Berlin. 
Tipped as an outside chance for the title at the start of the  season, Leverkusen could end the round as low as 17th depending on other  results.
