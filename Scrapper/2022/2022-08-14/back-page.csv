0,Parties urged not to drag army into politics,Defence Minister Khawaja Asif says there is no need for anyone to refer to the army in speeches during public meetings.,"ISLAMABAD: Lawmakers on Saturday again expressed their concern over the ongoing campaign against the country’s armed forces and urged political parties not to drag the state institutions into politics.
Speaking on the floor of the National Assembly, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif without naming Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan said if the army did not want to play any political role, then there was no need for anyone to give its reference in speeches during the public meetings.
The statement came at a time when Mr Khan was addressing PTI’s power show in Lahore.
“Do not drag the army into politics if it wanted to stay away from politics. Please let the army, bureaucrats and judiciary function within their constitution limits,” said the minister when given the floor by Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf to open a debate on the diamond jubilee celebrations of the country’s first constituent assembly.

Need for national dialogue among all parties highlighted during NA special session

Without naming Shahbaz Gill, the defence minister alleged that the arrested PTI member had “incited” the army, which was ‘unacceptable’, adding that the PPP and the PML-N had suffered in the past at the hands of the establishment, but even then they did not use the kind of language used by “that person”.

Later, PTI dissident Ahmed Hussain Deharr also lashed out at Mr Khan for allegedly maligning the national institutions. He said those who were running a campaign against the national institutions were “traitors” and deserved to be tried under Article 6.
Federal minister and PPP leader Syed Khursheed Shah urged politicians to review past mistakes and identify those who were responsible for bringing the country to present chaotic situation.
Earlier, Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf along with all the parliamentary leaders inaugurated a huge portrait of the Quaid-i-Azam installed at the National Assembly Hall. Some 35 years ago, he said, renowned artist Saeed Akhtar was entrusted with the task of creating a portrait of the Quaid-i-Azam for the first directly elected legislative house. He said in the shadow of Mr Akhtar’s artwork, the first directly elected assembly not only took oath but also made the constitution. The 90-year old artist had earlier in the day attended the convention that had been arranged for the ex-parliamentarians.
Lone Jamaat-i-Islami member Maulana Abdul Akbar Chitrali protested against the speaker for not inviting him for the inauguration of the portrait.
The speaker then adjourned the sitting 15 minutes before the midnight, after inviting the members to witness fireworks outside the Parliament House, announcing that they would meet again after midnight with a new agenda that would include “passing of a resolution on the diamond jubilee celebration of the first constituent assembly of Pakistan”.
However, the speaker abruptly adjourned the ceremonial midnight sitting, after extending felicitation to the nation, so that they could pass the resolution in a convention of the present and ex-parliamentarians, instead of getting it approved from the National Assembly. The resolution was presented by former MNA Kashmala Tariq.
Earlier in the day, speaking at the convention, ex-legislators presented a bleak picture of the prevailing political and economic situation in the country and called for holding a “national dialogue” to bring Pakistan out of multiple crises. They held the establishment’s interventions as the main cause for the poor state of democracy in the country and warned that Pakistan could face disintegration if this practice was not stopped.
Veteran politician Makhdoom Javed Hashmi,  former Punjab CM Manzoor Wattoo, and former lawmaker from Balochistan Rauf Mengal also spoke.

2,"As Punjab flexes muscles, ‘N’ leaders flee to Islamabad",Lahore police team raid residences of PML-N's Atta Tarar and Rana Mashhood.,"LAHORE: As the PML-Q-PTI coalition government in Punjab tightens the noose around close aides of the Sharif family in the province in various cases, the PML-N leaders have flown off to the ‘safer confines’ of Islamabad, where their party is in power, to evade arrest.
The Lahore police on Saturday initiated action against the prime minister’s special assistant Atta Tarar, a ‘blue-eyed’ associate of Hamza Shehbaz, as well as former PML-N minister Rana Mashhood in the Punjab Assembly attack case (registered by Chief Minister Parvez Elahi over hooliganism during the chief minister’s previous election on April 16).
A police team raided both PML-N leaders’ residences here, but returned empty handed as the suspects had managed to escape to Islamabad. Another PM’s assistant, Malik Ahmad Khan, who is also wanted in this case, is already in the federal capital.
In the current scenario, it appears the PML-N’s main Punjab leaders may not dare enter the province for fear of arrest, as are some leaders of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf exercising caution against visiting Islamabad after Shahbaz Gill’s arrest in Banigala. In this Punjab vs the Centre fiasco, neither side — PTI or PML-N — is ready to lower the political temperature.
The PTI leadership has already declared unlawful, the police action against its party leaders and protesters during the May 25 ‘peaceful’ long march on Islamabad, allegedly unleashed by Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and PM Shehbaz Sharif’s son Hamza, who was the chief minister then.
Hamza is said to be the ‘main character’ in the alleged torture episode of the PTI leadership in Punjab, and sensing danger had already managed to leave the country for the UK. 
Sanaullah was alleged by the PTI to have employed ‘fascist’ means to stop party supporters from reaching Islamabad on May 25. The PTI stresses Sanaullah will have to pay for this. The interior minister has warned the Punjab government that any action against him will aggravate tensions between the Centre and Punjab, and lead to imposition of the governor’s rule on the province.
Sanaullah is currently in Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah, and may not be able to enter Punjab in the wake of his impending arrest as threatened by the Parvez Elahi administration that is acting on direct orders from ousted premier Imran Khan.
On the other hand, on the directions of the Sharifs, the interior minister has ordered the FIA to go hard against Mr Khan and other PTI leaders for their alleged involvement in the prohibited funding case. Ex-minister Fawad Chaudhry of the PTI also warned that if the Banigala residence of Mr Khan is raided, Jati Umra — the Sharif’s palatial abode — in Lahore will bear the brunt.
In a tweet, Atta Tarar said police raided his residence in Lahore where he lived 15 years ago. Addressing the Punjab home minister, Tarar said: “Mr Hashim Dogar, I thought you were a minister, but you turned out to be a very frivolous character. What are you trying to prove by sending police to the house I lived in 15 years ago? You will run the ministry in this situation? Do not go that far to defend anti-national statements.”

 





 
Mr Dogar responded to Tarar on Twitter, saying the PML-N leader had absconded to Islamabad. “If the politician (Tarar) understands the law, he should follow the police’s order,” he said.

 





 
Lahore police chief Ghulam Mahmood Dogar told Dawn.com that notices were sent to Tarar and Rana Mashhood to appear in an investigation into the Punjab Assembly attack case.
However, PTI leaders Fawad Chaudhry and focal person Azhar Mashwani claimed action against Tarar had been initiated in connection with the torture of party workers on May 25. “Tarar should come out of hiding to clarify his position,” Chaudhry remarked.
