2,"Patriotism that catches the eye, touches the heart",Karachiites celebrate country’s 75th Independence Day anniversary today.,"KARACHI: “The greenery, the trees, bushes, shrubbery and grass gain their brilliance after the rains. And it’s so great that our Independence Day also coincides with the monsoon season,” smiled an elderly gentleman, who had only stopped to admire the Independence Day memorabilia on sale at one of the many stalls at a commercial area in Defence Housing Authority. 
“I’m not here to buy anything. My grandchildren decorated our balcony with bunting but most of the little flags fell off their strings in the rain. The children said that the rain has dampened their spirits and then I pointed the greenery out to them. The nature is on their side. And the natural green is looking so pretty thanks to the rain, which thanks to nature,” he added. 
This year most houses are missing the big flags and the bunting mostly due to the heavy rains and subsequent flooding. There are also not that many cars on the roads sporting the Pakistan flags. 
“But you should know that despite the lack of decorations, the real celebration goes on in our hearts,” said Nasreen, a young mother selecting green T-shirts for her children at a stall in the famous Paper Market on Hassan Ali Effendi Road. 

Karachiites celebrate country’s 75th Independence Day anniversary today

“I was only three years old when I lost my father. He had bought the Pakistan flag buntings for me a couple of days before he met with his accident in which he lost his life unfortunately.
“The day of his funeral, he was supposed to put up the bunting with me. I was too young to understand what had happened and was crying because he had not kept his promise. That’s when my chacha lifted me in his arms, wiped away my tears and took me to our terrace to decorate the house with me,” said the young mother. 
“My uncle also spoke to the frowning relatives. He said that ‘we shouldn’t steal the child’s happiness. She is too little to understand death anyway.’ And then no one argued,” she added. “So whatever the circumstances, we still celebrate Pakistan. Just choose to think positive.”
“The 75th Independence Day of Pakistan is extra special because of the 75 years of freedom and also the success of our sportspersons in the Commonwealth Games,” a sports teacher of a private school told Dawn. 
“It means a lot to have won so many medals, gold, silver and bronze at these games because it is a competition of all the countries that were under British rule once,” he added.
And silencing those criticising people to have not decorated their vehicles like they used to before, two Green Line Buses have been especially decorated for Independence Day. These buses were seen spreading cheer all over their route from Abdullah Chowk in Surjani Town to Numaish Chowrangi on Saturday. 
All the Green Line stations were also decorated with flag bunting and the public address systems there played national songs. A big electronic screen also celebrated Pakistan by displayed pictures of Pakistan’s freedom fighters, historic monuments and landmarks.
The buses could be spotted from afar as they had been painted the proper shade of dark green with the white stripe and start and crescent.
“We wanted to highlighting the fact that this year is no usual Independence Day, since we are celebrating 75 years of freedom. So we prepared special programmes to be played on our big screens and put together a a selection of national songs to be played on our public address systems along with decorating the buses,” said Abdul Aziz, the senior manager (bus operation and intelligence transport system) of the Sindh Infrastructure Development Company Ltd. 
Wondering aloud about the lack of decorations on homes and vehicles, one was then asked to look again more carefully. And then one also saw. The cakes and sweetmeats decorated like Pakistan’s flag, the tandoor decorated with green and white balloons even though the heat generated by the oven could burst all those balloons, the traffic police sergeant proudly sporting the flag on his white motorcycle, the decorated roundabouts, the buildings in lights ... one couldn’t miss the patriotism.

Met office says depression along coast weakens; rains to continue till tomorrow

City weatherman Dr Sardar Sarfaraz told Dawn the depression over the Arabian Sea was gradually losing its intensity. “Since it’s weakening along the coast, it’s likely to induce rain-thunderstorms,” he explained.
He said that the low pressure area over Rajasthan, India had also weakened.
Rainfall intensity is also to increase in northeastern and southern districts of Balochistan, which may trigger flash flooding in Dadu, Jamshoro, Qambar Shahdadkot districts and downstream.
Sea conditions are likely to remain very rough for the next two days and fishermen are advised not to venture in open sea till tomorrow night.
Three die from electrocution
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that 22-year-old Naeem Abbas was brought dead from Gulshan-i-Iqbal to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. He suffered an electric shock at his office.

Thado Dam overflows
Various low-lying areas and main roads in the city had been submerged by rainwater causing hardship to motorists and commuters. 
However, in the second half of the day, civic authorities managed to drain out accumulated rainwater from almost every main road. 
The continued rain on the city’s outskirts caused the Thado dam in Gadap Town to overflow. This triggered fear and panic among the residents, who thought floodwater might inundate their areas as well as the M-9 motorway.
Edhi volunteers rescued dozens of people trapped in their vehicle near Baloch Colony because of flooding in the Malir river.
A traffic police spokesperson said that the Korangi causeway was closed for vehicular traffic after it was submerged by rainwater.

4,"ATC rejects bail of Uzair Baloch in six murder, police encounter cases","Applicant does not qualify to avail legal concession of post-arrest bail at the present stage of the trial, judge observes.","KARACHI: An antiterrorism court has dismissed bail application of chief of the outlawed Peoples Amn Committee Uzair Baloch in six cases pertaining to murder, police encounter and possession of illicit weapons and explosives.
He has been facing dozens of cases pertaining to murder, attempted murder, armed attacks on law-enforcers and running extortion and criminal rackets under the alleged patronage of the Pakistan Peoples Party leadership and Sindh police high-ups.
He moved an application seeking grant of post-arrest bail in six cases registered against him and his accomplices at the Kalakot police station in 2012.
The judge of the ATC-XII, who conducted the trial in the judicial complex inside the central prison, pronounced his order on bail pleas reserved earlier after hearing arguments from both sides.
The judge dismissed the application observing that the applicant did not qualify to avail the legal concession of post-arrest bail at the present stage of the trial in the cases.
Defence counsel Abid Zaman confirmed to Dawn that the court had dismissed bail of his client in the abovementioned six cases.
However, the court had granted bail to co-accused Ameen Buledi and Abdul Ghaffar in the six cases and directed prison authorities to release them forthwith, if their custody was not required in any other case.
Defence counsel Mushtaq Ahmed confirmed to Dawn that both Buledi and Ghaffar had been released from prison on bail.
According to the prosecution, Uzair Baloch, Muhammad Ramzan, Zakir Dada, Zubair Baloch, Muhammad Shahid alias MCB, Abdul Ghaffar and Ameen Buledi have been charged with engaging in encounter with law-enforcers and attacking them with firearms and explosives.
The six cases were registered against the accused under Sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 302 (premeditated murder), 324 (attempted murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 395 (dacoity), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage to amount of one hundred rupees), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) read with Sections 3 and 4 of the Explosives Act read with Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 at the Kalakot police station on behalf of the state.
Advocate Zaman had said that Uzair Baloch had been acquitted in around 20 criminal cases. 
However, he said he could not be released from prison since he has been facing trial in around 15 identical criminal cases.

5,SHC dismisses petition against child marriages law,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has dismissed a petition assailing the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act 2013...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has dismissed a petition assailing the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act 2013.
A two-judge bench comprising Chief Justice Ahmed Ali M. Shaikh and Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed observed that the issue had already been addressed by the SHC through a judgement.
Samira Mahamadi, a regular litigant, invoked the jurisdiction of SHC under Article 199 of the Constitution to challenge the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act 2013.
The petitioner contended that the law be declared null and void and ultra vires of the constitution as being grossly repugnant to Islamic ideology and tantamount to state terrorism. 
The bench said: “The subject has already been addressed through a judgment of this very Bench in the case reported as Ali Azhar versus Arzoo Fatima (PLD 2022 Sindh 01). That being so, the petition accordingly stands dismissed in limine.”
The law in question prohibits the marriage of any child under the age of 18 years in Sindh and provides penalties for a male contracting party and the person who solemnises the marriage as well as the parent or guardian concerned.
Plea against Nacta Act rejected
The same bench has also turned down a petition impugning the vires of the National Counter Terrorism Authority Act, 2013.
Ms Mahamadi again petitioned the SHC and contended that Nacta law was infringing Article 19, 19-A, 22 and 28 of the Constitution with it broadly being alleged that it impeded the Islamic way of life as it sought to address the mainstreaming of madressahs as well as the subject of population control.
The petitioner further argued that Nacta was abusing its authority to undertake social/religious/culture engineering under the garb of national security. 
“Be that as it may, the Petitioner has been unable to advance any cogent argument to substantiate her challenge and a perusal of the memo of petition reflects that the same does not disclose any valid ground justiciable within the scope of Article 199. The petition, being misconceived, accordingly stands dismissed in limine,” the bench in its order said.

Fortunately, she added, she had a mobile phone and the DIG’s number so she sent him a distress call.
SSP Javed Baloch said Rajib Solangi had already escaped from the house when it was raided.

10,Flooding triggered by dyke breaches destroys paddy crop in two districts,SUKKUR: A vast area on the outskirts of Jacobabad district was flooded and standing paddy crop washed away on...,"SUKKUR: A vast area on the outskirts of Jacobabad district was flooded and standing paddy crop washed away on Saturday when a breach developed in the dyke of Taju tributary and widened by over 50 feet by gushing water.
Affected growers and farmers said that the breach occurred in the dyke due to rise in the Begari canal water level. The resultant flooding hit farmlands near Ghari Khero and destroyed standing paddy crop, they added.
They told local reporters that the local irrigation officials were alerted immediately after the breach started damaging the dyke but nobody from the department visited the site for plugging work.
“We started the plugging work on our own using the insufficient stone-pitching material available with us,” they said, and pointed out that flooding had already caused considerable losses to them.
Meanwhile, the Jacob­abad deputy commissioner is reported to have directed senior irrigation officials to send requisite machinery and labourers along with supervisory staff to the site to mend the dyke.
A similar breach developed in the dyke of Heerul Deen tributary at Mureed Jafari village near Tang­wani town of Kandhkot-Kashmore district on Saturday.
Farmers and other residents of the nearby villages said that strong currents swept away their standing paddy crop and a number of their thatched houses, besides other structures.
The villagers led by Mujtaba Khoso, Noor Khan Khoso, Yaar Ali and Kher Jaan held a protest demonstration and told local reporters that they had repeatedly approached the local irrigation and district officials for relief and rescue work but without any practical response.
They said they also requested the officials to close the water channel in order to prevent flooding from causing further damage but this was also not heeded.
“We had to plug the breach and save ourselves on a self-help basis,” they added.
Over 200 villages hit by flooding

The idea was discussed at a meeting of STP central committee held under the chairmanship of Dr Qadir Magsi. It was attended by Jam Abdul Fatah Samejo, Hyder Shahani, Hyder Mallah, Dr Soomar Mangrio, Ashiq Solangi, Qadir Channa, Imtiaz Samoo, Nisar Keerio, Dr Hameed Memon, Hoat Khan Gadhi, Dr Ahmed Noonari, Khuda Bux Dars, Jam Shaukat Abro and others.
The meeting also discussed the overall political situation in the country and observed that Pakistan was facing an economic crisis. It noted with concern that price-hike had made lives of the masses miserable. 
The committee held the ruling coalition responsible for the crisis. It also noted that corruption had destroyed everything and rulers were busy filling their own coffers.
The meeting expressed its concern over settlement of outsiders and immigrants in Sindh. This, it said, had not only increased economic burden on Sindh, but also led to the occupation of all provincial resources, jobs and businesses by these people. “All this is exploitation of indigenous people of Sindh,” the participants said.
The meeting claimed that illegal immigrants had destroyed peace in Sindh while increasing lawlessness, narcotics and arms trade were being attributable to the residents of these settlements of illegal immigrants.
It said that despite court’s orders, illegal immigrants and refugees were not repatriated from Sindh to their home countries. It appreciated a call by Sindhi people for a social boycott of illegal immigrants, and said its pace should be accelerated. 
The STP central committee also decided to participate in the Sindh Action Committee’s Aug 21 public meeting in Hyderabad against settlement of outsiders in the province.
