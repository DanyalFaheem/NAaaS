Officials have said that seven people, including a child, were swept away in Mach’s Gaptani area. However, they were rescued by security forces and shifted to a hospital. 
Quetta-Sukkur National Highway in Bolan district was closed due to landslides triggered by heavy rains and floods.
Lasbela district also received heavy rainfall, triggering flash floods which once again suspended traffic between Quetta and Karachi as a big portion of the alternate road constructed by the National Highway Authority was washed away.
The Hub Dam which was already filled to its maximum capacity began receiving more water as its catchment areas continued to receive torrential rains.
“We have opened the spillways of the dam to release extra water in the Hub river,”Hub Dam Executive Engineer Jabbar Zehri told Dawn.

1,PM questions ‘real freedom’ sans economic sovereignty,Shehbaz renews the Charter of Economy offer to opposition...,"ISLAMABAD: Observing that economic sovereignty is a sine qua non for real freedom, Prime Minister Mohammad Shehbaz Sharif has once again offered Charter of Economy to the opposition.
In a televised address to the nation on the eve of 76th Indep­endence Day on Saturday, the prime minister said he had made the offer to the previous PTI government as opposition leader, adding that he wanted to make a renewed offer to the PTI now in opposition.
He said the country was faced with the challenges that can be addressed only with national consensus, continuity of policies and political and economic stability. “It is need of the hour to continue journey in the right direction,” he said.
While advising the opposition not to sacrifice national interest for the sake of ‘ego and stubbornness’, the premier said the real political leadership kept an eye on future of posterity rather than elections.

Shehbaz renews the Charter of Economy offer to opposition

PM Sharif first listed achie­vements made by Pakistan despite all the odds in 75 years before he started criticising PTI, holding it responsible for economic mess and attempts to create anarchy in the country. “Today the nation is facing a crisis of despondency. Seeds of hatred and anarchy are being sown and attempts are underway to divide the nation. Sinister efforts are being made to shatter national solidarity,” he remarked.
He said the economic crisis created by the imprudent economic policies of the previous government had made the things all the more difficult. He, however, noted that every crisis offers opportunities hidden in it. “We need to have eyes to see and determination to achieve them,” he added.
Mr Sharif said the government had already initiated efforts to steer the country out of economic quagmire, which were still going on. As a result of these efforts the country had been saved from going into Dadaist, he said, adding that the previous government left a record trade deficit of 48 billion dollars and the present government had to obtain loans from friendly countries and international financial institutions to curtail it. 
“Is it the real independence?” he asked.
He said the PTI government also set a record of external debts by lending Rs 20 thousand billion in less than four years.
He said the PML-N had left the country self-sufficient in wheat in 2018 but regretted that as a result of criminal negligence of the previous government, the country was compelled to spend millions of dollars on import of the commodity. He said the PTI government also failed to sign a long-term contract for import of LNG, when it was available at very low price. He said this was the primary reason for load-shedding and high power tariff.
“May I ask on whose dictates the PTI stopped work on CPEC projects, causing irreparable loss to Pakistan?” he said, reiterating the question of ‘real independence’.
He said the coalition government had decided to install solar projects to generate thousands of megawatts of electricity, which would not only cut the bill on import of fuel but would also provide cheap electricity to the people. He said a complete ban had been imposed on import of non-essential items and as a result the rupee value against dollar was strengthening.

2,"Imran wants ‘friendly ties’ with US, not slavery",PTI chief announces countrywide mass mobilisation drive; first rally in Pindi in coming days.,"LAHORE: A day after the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) hired a public relations firm to mend fences with the United States, PTI chief Imran Khan on Saturday said he was not “anti-American” and wanted a “friendly relationship” with the US, instead of becoming their “slave”.
The former prime minister was speaking at a jam-packed venue at Lahore’s Hockey Stadium on the eve of Independence Day, wherein he shared his party’s “roadmap for Haqeeqi Azadi” to counter the federal government and push it towards early elections.
He said he had enjoyed “good ties” with former US president Donald Trump as he was “respectable” during his visit to the US. “Ask anyone from the Pakistan-American community they will testify that no one before me had gotten the protocol that Trump gave to me,” he claimed.

In his speech, Mr Khan said there was no reason to make an enemy out of Washington as Pakistan’s exports to the US were substantial and the Pakistani-American community was one of the influential communities in that country.

The PTI chief also chided the government, especially Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, for their remarks on the economy and blamed them for the economic meltdown of Pakistan.
‘Conspiracy to bring back Nawaz’
During the address, Mr Khan claimed that “several conspiracies” were being hatched to disqualify him and to reach a deal to pave way for PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, who is in a self-imposed exile in London, to return home and enter active politics once again. “Imran Khan will never strike any deal,” he said and quipped that he would `welcome’ Nawaz when he would return to Pakistan.
He added the “conspirators” wanted to pit his party against the Pakistan Army which, as per Mr Khan, would eventually hurt the country.
As part of his plan to rattle the government, the PTI chief announced that he would go to the public to muster up support for his struggle to achieve “Haqeeqi Azadi” that had entered its “decisive stage”.
Mr Khan disclosed that he would begin his mass public drive from Rawalpindi next week followed by rallies in Karachi, Sukkur, Hyderabad, Islamabad, Peshawar, Mardan, Attock, Abbottabad, Multan, Bahawalpur, Sargodha, Jhelum, Gujrat, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Quetta.
The PTI chief said Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah helped the nation to “get liberation from the British and Hindus”. Now, Mr Khan said, he wanted to liberate Pakistanis from “mental slavery”. By the next August 14, the nation would have won its ‘actual freedom’, Mr Khan said while sharing his plans for mass mobilisation. 
After midnight, the participants recited the national anthem along with the PTI chief, which was followed by fireworks. The gathering was broadcast live across Pakistan, including Islamabad and Karachi, where PTI supporters remained glued to big screens to listen to their leader.
Earlier, Punjab Chief Minister Parvez Elahi also spoke at the gathering. During the address, Mr Elahi said that Rana Sanaullah would be will be put behind bars for his role in the May 25 crackdown on PTI workers. He also boasted about ending restrictions on market hours imposed by the PML-N government to overcome the power shortage in the country.
Speaking to reporters before the gathering at the ground, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said the theme of the public gathering was “Haqeeqi Azadi”. He added that ‘real freedom’ meant not bowing before anyone but Allah and that was the belief of Imran Khan as well. Mr Chaudhry said the PTI had entered the “final stages” of its movement.
Last week, the PTI announced to hold a “historic power show” in Hockey Ground on the eve of Pakistan’s 76th independence day, which will be celebrated today.

3,"Army keeping eye on ‘armed men’ in Swat, says ISPR","ISPR says presence of a ""small number of armed men on few mountain-tops between Swat and Dir has been observed"".","ISLAMABAD / SWAT: Even as locals saw security personnel advancing towards the mountains to take action against “armed men” recently spotted there, the military on Saturday night rejected as baseless the reports about TTP running amok in Swat.
However, lending credence to reports circulating in the mainstream media for the past few days, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that presence of “small number of armed men on few mountain-tops between Swat and Dir has been observed”, located far away from population.
“Apparently, these individuals sneaked in from Afghanistan to resettle in their native areas. A close watch is being maintained on their limited presence and movement in mountains,” it said. 
The ISPR further said that during the past few days, a “misperception about alleged presence of large number of proscribed organisation TTP’s armed members in Swat Valley has been created on social media. After confirmation on ground, these reports have been found as grossly exaggerated and misleading”.

According to the ISPR statement, “required measures are in place by all LEAs for the safety and security of people of adjoining areas. Presence of militants anywhere will not be tolerated and they will be dealt with full use of force if required”.
According to residents of different parts of Matta tehsil, they saw a large number of security personnel advancing towards the mountains of Shawar, Balasoor, Kanala and other areas after the recent shooting allegedly by the militants that left DSP Pir Syed wounded. Some residents claimed they also saw gunship helicopters patrolling the upper gorges of Matta tehsil.
Meanwhile, the Swat Qaumi Jirga has convened a Loya Jirga of all walks of life from Swat on August 17 to address recent developments in the area.

4,Police apathy over woman’s ‘sale’ draws LHC ire,Court perturbed by police response in case seeking recovery of mother and daughter ‘sold’ by ex-husband...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has observed that while laws for women’s protection have been gradually put in place in the country, these had not helped attain the level of deterrence or prevention of the offence.
“The Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan through its Article 11 vows to eradicate all forms of slavery and trafficking, yet in practice, women continue to suffer and are subject to trade by their close family members and this goes on despite the evolution and introduction of laws aimed at ensuring protection of women against such abominable practices. South Punjab being no exception,” Justice Mohammad Shan Gul writes in a judgement passed on a habeas corpus petition on Saturday.
Kalsoom Mai filed the petition seeking recovery of her daughter Sajida Mai and granddaughter Sadia from the illegal custody of certain individuals in Rajanpur. The petitioner had alleged that the detainee’s ex-husband had sold her to one Anwar Khalid, who was at large.
Justice Gul said the nonchalance with which the Saddar police SHO informed the court the  “detainee perhaps may have been sold off for immoral illicit purposes” was what prompted them to summon the district police officer of Rajanpur.

Court perturbed by police response in case seeking recovery of mother and daughter ‘sold’ by ex-husband

“This was, to say the least, shocking and equally appalling,” the judge added.
The DPO appeared before the court and stated that an FIR had been registered against the former husband of the detainee for having allegedly sold her, while a case was also filed against the supposed ‘buyer’ Khalid. The officer further apprised the court that her ex-husband had been granted bail in the case.
The judge observed that it was not understandable how her former spouse managed to get bail, even though the detainee had not been recovered.
Justice Gul noted that the police indeed took measures that might or might not result in the production of the detainee, but it was a stark fact that the concept of a woman “being treated as a commodity or as a product who can be sold” indeed caused anguish to the court and needed to be addressed.
He said the apathy and indifference of the law enforcement agencies in curbing and arresting the deplorable menace of treating women as an object was what needed to be addressed.
Issuing an incessant direction, the judge asked the Rajanpur DPO to recover the daughter and granddaughter of the petitioner and ensure they are set at liberty and allowed to live and reside wherever they desire.
Before concluding his judgement, Justice Gul observed that in Pakistan the state of women and inhuman treatment meted out to women mostly by men whom such women were more likely to turn to for their protection prompted the legislature to enact various safety valves in the form of penal provisions to curb women’s trafficking. But he regretted that despite the laws being in place, the deterrence or prevention aimed at through such provisions had not been attained.
He lamented that the current state of women in Pakistan, especially in far-flung areas, marked by harrowing cases such as the present one displaying a society worse than the one that formed basis for feminist movements in 18th century, revealed that we have become a nation where weak were exploited and the exploiters were condemned on paper only.
The judge said the claim of being a civilized society with dictates of pro-women laws and even decrees of Sharia should have eliminated all such evils and there should have remained no single custom or usage degrading/lowering the women or depriving them from their guaranteed rights, but facts of the present case painted a sorry and a different picture.
He regretted that holding jirgas and passing illegal decrees trading women, trafficking in women, awarding women as Badl-i-Sulah etc were still a matter of routine practices in many remote areas.
Justice Gul directed the provincial law secretary, prosecutor general, as also the inspector general of police to ensure that the laws put in place by the legislature are effectively implemented.
He directed the law secretary to consider if the present legislative framework for arresting and preventing the menace of women’s trafficking was satisfactory or the laws needed to be reinforced by introduction of any additional safety valves. He also ordered the inspector general of police to strive to ensure recovery of the detainee at any cost.
