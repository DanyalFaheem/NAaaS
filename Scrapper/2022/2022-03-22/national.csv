0,No respite for railway pensioners,The government has already turned down a proposal for the establishment of a pension fund.,"ISLAMABAD: The plight of pensioners belonging to Pakistan Railways, the largest state-owned enterprise, continues and it is feared that not all the pensioners will be able to get their already-delayed monthly pension this month since the finance ministry has not released the full amount for payment of pension. 
Sources privy to the railways ministry told Dawn that the finance ministry had been requested to allocate Rs48 billion for annual expenditure against pensions, but Rs42bn was released, out of which Rs36bn had already been given to the pensioners. 
The sources feared that Pakistan Railways (PR) would face financial difficulties in the coming months for paying pensions to retired employees and widows unless the finance ministry released the remaining amount. 

Government has already turned down a proposal for establishment of pension fund

According to the sources, the railways ministry has been in parleys with the finance ministry to take over the payment of pension to railway employees like other government departments and civil servants. However, no decision has so far been taken in this regard.
The railways secretary had written a letter to the finance ministry on March 1, requesting for transfer of PR pension payments to the Controller General Accounts and Auditor General of Pakistan Revenue. The letter further stated that the pension payment roll was ready for transfer of pension on March 1. However, the pertinent account of pension has insufficient credit balance, and the finance ministry remains unresponsive. 
The letter to finance secretary stated that the matter related to around 125,000 PR pensioners and warned that the situation might lead to unrest amongst the pensioners which could be embarrassing for the government. A delay in pension payment will also be in violation of the Supreme Court orders. 
“The Ministry of Railways had submitted a request of Rs4.500 billion to the Finance Division for release of funds which has not been conceded by the Finance Division in lieu of the release strategy,” the letter said. 
While the ministries of railways and finance are yet to reach to a decision, the pensioners, particularly low-paid and widows, continue to face difficulties in getting pension on time. It is learnt that two commercial banks authorised for the payment of pensions have not yet received scrolls for payment. 
According to Prime Minister’s Assistance Package for Employees of Pakistan Railways, funds have been released and pensioners will be able to get pension, but due to official holidays all banks are closed, hence payment will only be possible when the banks reopen. 
The railways ministry had proposed to the finance ministry to make arrangements for payment to pensioners directly like other civil servants, but the latter has yet to take a decision on the proposal. 
The government has already turned down a proposal for the establishment of Pakistan Railways Pension Fund. In this regard, an international firm hired by Pakistan Railways had submitted its proposals, designing the implementation mode for the establishment of the pension fund. 
The purpose of establishing the fund was to shoulder future expenditure on pension of employees. Much delay has occurred in the establishment of the pension fund due to which no pension reserve has been created until now. The absence of any credible estimate of pension liabilities has also hindered possible reforms to rationalise increasing impact of pension expenditure on PR’s annual budget. 
Pakistan Railways runs its Defined Benefit (DB) Pension Scheme on a ‘Pay-As-You-Go’ (PAYGO) basis. In the absence of any pension reserve, the federal government is currently shouldering pension expenditure of Pakistan Railways.

1,Media bodies demand PM Imran prove ‘anti-govt drive is funded’,Joint Action Committee of the media says it reserves the right to approach the judiciary for relief if allegations not proved.,"ISLAMABAD: The Joint Action Committee (JAC) of the media has challenged the prime minister to prove his “scandalous allegations” that media houses have been bought by political parties and some are being funded by foreign sources. 
Prime Minister Imran Khan made these allegations in his public address in Malakand on Sunday. 
In a statement issued on Monday, the JAC said the PM’s statements amount to accusing the media of corruption. If these allegations cannot be proved “within a reasonable time”, the committee reserves the right to approach the judiciary for relief, it warned. 
It requested PM Khan not to make such statements for “political point scoring”.
The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) sought an apology from PM Khan over the allegation that media houses were receiving funds for “anti-government campaigns”.
In a statement, PFUJ president Shahzada Zulfiqar and secretary general Nasir Zaidi expressed outrage over the “baseless remarks”, saying “it is surprising the head of the government is using a public forum for spreading unfoun­ded allegations agai­nst the media and the journalist fraternity instead of ordering an investigation”.
They urged the prime minister to order an inquiry through the FIA or a judicial commission ins­tead of spreading “fake news”.

2,PM Imran’s statement on India’s foreign policy ‘most bizarre’: Shehbaz,"""India, particularly under Modi, has accused Pakistan of terrorism, opposed CPEC & hurt our interests globally,"" says Shehbaz.","LAHORE: Leader of the Opposi­tion in the National Assembly Sheh­baz Sharif has termed Prime Minister Imran Khan’s statement on India’s foreign policy the ‘most bizarre’.
“Imran Khan’s praise for the so-called ‘independent’ Indian foreign policy is the most bizarre statement to date. India, particularly under [Narendra] Modi, has accused Pakistan of terrorism, opposed CPEC & hurt our interests globally. It has robbed Kashmiris of their statehood,” the PML-N president said in a tweet on Monday.

 





 
Prime Minister Khan had in his public address in Dargai area of Malakand on Sunday lauded India for having an ‘independent foreign policy’ that was favourable to people of India. 
Mr Khan also recalled that he had said ‘no’ to the European Union envoys who had sought Pakistan’s support against Russia in the Ukraine conflict because they had broken protocol by making the joint statement public. Pakistan could not make progress if it remained slave to the world superpowers, PM Khan said.

4,Wasteland foretold,Unchecked sand mining and excessive extraction of groundwater in Malir and Jamshoro districts will have devastating...,"JAMSHORO: Qadir Baloch went into hiding on the night of Dec 3, 2021. That, he alleges, was after the henchmen of a powerful feudal lord tried to break into his home in a village in Jamshoro district, adjoining Karachi’s Malir district. He only just managed to flee under the cover of darkness. Knowing what the men had come for, he took his land ownership papers with him. 
“First the sardar’s men tried to offer me Rs70,000 per acre, but I refused outright,” he says. “The land is like my mother and I won’t sell it.” It is now over two years since he has been resisting the pressure to sell. First, he says he was paid a visit by people from Bahria Town, the real estate giant whose sprawling project, Bahria Town Karachi (BTK), is coming up nearby. “They wanted to build a road through my land. I told them to get lost and they went away. But now the wadera’s own people are attacking me.” 
This, say locals, is the modus operandi now being employed by the land mafia to acquire real estate for building housing projects in an area that falls within what is colloquially known as Kohistan, comprising Jamshoro and Hyderabad districts along with portions of Karachi’s Malir and West districts. Qadir Baloch is one of the few that have dared to speak up so openly; defiance of the waderas is rare in these parts. As chief of the Burfat tribe, the biggest of the four tribes in Kohistan with around 100 sub-tribes, Malik Asad Sikander is known as the ‘king of Kohistan'. But this ‘sardar of sardars’ — and PPP MPA from Jamshoro — rules over a diminishing kingdom. Indigenous communities are being forced to give up land where they have lived for generations and engaged in barani (rain-fed) agriculture or poultry/livestock farming, to make way for the housing aspirations of the middle and upper classes. 

Unchecked sand mining and excessive extraction of groundwater in Malir and Jamshoro districts will have devastating long-term consequences

But there is another disaster with long-term consequences brewing in these suburbs of Karachi. Given that today is World Water Day, whose theme is ‘Groundwater: making the invisible visible’, it is an apt occasion to highlight the issue. The devastation is on two levels. Firstly, unchecked mining of sand, or reti bajri, is taking place here to meet the insatiable demands of the construction industry. This is hampering the recharging of groundwater (water stores under the land surface replenished mainly by rain water and snow melt), degrading the land and wreaking havoc on the area’s ecology and environment. Secondly, over-exploitation of groundwater is depleting the aquifer to dangerous levels. Both phenomena together are a ‘perfect storm’ that will hasten the impact of climate change and increase desertification in what is known as Karachi’s green belt, and imperil the quality of life for millions.
Not a blade of grass
A visit by Dawn to an area north of BTK revealed a scene of utter destruction: one could see massive sand mining sites, known as dhakkas, where excavator machines had removed the top layer of soil, tossed it to the side where it lay in huge mounds and gouged out tons of earth from beneath. Swathes of Malir have already been ravaged; now Jamshoro is being similarly plundered. Crossing into deh Mole in Jamshoro district, excavators could be seen busy at work in the river bed, removing the earth and depositing it into dumper trucks, which would then carry it away. Within the span of an hour, at least six dumpers on average would drive off bearing their load.  
Using GPS and satellite mapping, Dawn has determined that at least 4,000 acres falling in parts of both Malir and Jamshoro districts in the vicinity of BTK have been mined or are currently being mined for sand. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. Sand mining is taking place on a huge scale further afield in Jamshoro, including in Lonikot and Nooriabad, as well as deeper inside Sindh. 
According to Section 3 of the Sindh (Prohibition of Taking Minerals Including Reti (Sand) and Bajri From Any Land) Act 2003: “Except with the prior sanctions of Government, no person shall take minerals including reti (sand) and bajri from any land by excavation or otherwise. 
Provided that no sanction shall be accorded if it adversely affects the topography, archaeology, ecology and environment of that area.” 
The Mines & Mineral Development Department (MMDD), Sindh, is the regulatory authority for all mining in the province. The office of the DG MMDD Umar Farooq refused to share with Dawn copies of the sand mining grants that are currently in effect, claiming that the identities of those granted the mining concessions were confidential. Nor did they share the survey maps based on which the grants had ostensibly been given, and which could help determine whether the mining is being carried out as per terms of the lease. 
The fact is, the public is entitled to the information sought by Dawn. According to Section 6 (k) of the Sindh Transparency and Right to Information Act 2016: “A public body shall proactively disclose and publish …Full particulars of the recipients of concessions, permits or authorisations granted by it.” So why is the MMDD so cagey about the details of mining being done on public land? 
Multiple sources claimed that much of the sand mining in Jamshoro is done in a completely unregulated manner. According to one of them, “There aren’t really proper contracts for sand mining in Jamshoro because the entire area is controlled by powerful feudals, and they manage it. You can’t mine anywhere in Kohistan without their permission.”
Illicit profits
The illicit profits are said to be divided up as follows: the contents of each dumper sell for Rs27,000 inside BTK, for Rs30,000 at Sohrab Goth and more if sold further afield, depending on the distance. The owner of the loader (‘shawal’) that fills the dumper pockets Rs6,000; local waderas, known as kumdar, in the goth closest to the boundary between deh Mole in Jamshoro district and deh Bolari in Malir district charge Rs1,300 as ‘zilla bandi tax’ to allow vehicles to cross over while Bahria charges a ‘road tax’ of Rs500-700 per dumper going through BTK. The rest — minus fuel and maintenance expenses — goes to influential stakeholders up the hierarchy, including the police and allegedly the tribal chiefs. A dumper driver told Dawn that some 65 dumpers make three round trips every day, 24 hours a day.
Even the PPP-led government’s own legislators find no traction when they speak up against the plunder caused by reckless mining. In a letter dated July 23, 2019 and addressed to Minister Mines and Minerals Mir Shabbir Bijarani, MNA Nafisa Shah pointed to the “indiscriminate, excessive, illegal mining in the area of Kot Diji which has magnificent ancient and scenic geological hills … . More than 200 sites have been leased out by the MMDD for more than 99 years… . I have written letters earlier to the Chief Minister, and to the Secretary Wildlife and Forests to declare this area as a national park. However so far, no action has been taken to preserve the natural and biological heritage of the area. …” While the letter refers to limestone quarrying, which is outside the scope of this investigation, it indicates the apathy of the government and the prioritising of profit over long-term benefits.   
In Malir and Jamshoro, average yearly precipitation has varied wildly during the years between 2000 and 2021. But ruthless sand mining has exacerbated the impact. Sand acts like a sponge, soaking up precious rainwater and helping it percolate towards the aquifer. When it rains over the Kirthar range, which runs along the boundary between Sindh and Balochistan, hill torrents fill the Mole and Malir rivers. However, when sand is removed from the river bed, the porosity needed to absorb the water is diminished. 
Excessive mining in the river bed disrupts the water’s natural flow and increases its velocity to such a destructive extent that it erodes any structures it encounters, including foundation piles of highway bridges as well as rain water check dams. “The degradation of the natural pathways along which rainfall passes causes the flow pattern to be disturbed,” says Dr Fahad Irfan Siddiqui, associate professor at Mehran University’s mining engineering department. “Land degradation plays a big role in the kind of flooding we’re seeing in areas like Gulshan-e-Maymar and Saadi Town.” 
Kirthar National Park’s buffer zone
Shockingly enough, sand mining is even taking place close to the officially notified boundary of the Kirthar National Park, with the closest site less than five kilometres away. Kirthar is the third largest national park in the country, and qualifies for the strict criteria fixed by IUCN for a Category II protected area, designated mainly for ecosystem preservation. “This is the park’s buffer zone which is as important as the park itself and there should not be any activity here,” says environmentalist Nasir Panhwar. 
There are at least 14 small dams and check dams in the area. The oldest of them is Thaddo dam, constructed in 2004 across the seasonal Thaddo river. Eight are comparatively recent, having been built from 2014 onwards when construction on BTK first began. One came up as late as 2021. Given that the indigenous communities in the area were up in arms since at least 2015 over being made to surrender their land for BTK, one wonders whom the check dams — installed by the Sindh government whose functionaries were complicit in the land grab — were intended to benefit. 
26m gallons of water in 24 hrs
As a result of the excessive sand mining, one would expect the green cover to have reduced over the years, and the area becoming more arid. On the contrary, maps based on remote sensing technology show a surprising trend. While most types of vegetation cover declined between 2013 and 2017, moderate, dense and highly dense vegetation increased between 2017 and 2021. But this is not evidence of any encouraging news. Experts say this can be explained by the fact that groundwater is being overexploited. 
Tofiq Pasha Mooraj has had a farm in Malir since 1974 and understands the area’s water dynamics like the back of his hand. “Initially they were pulling out water with buckets, then with diesel engines and then with electric motors. The quantity of water we could extract per well expanded and we started extracting more and more water.”
Another expert partly credits retired army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf for the ‘greening’ of Malir. In the mid-2000s, he gifted senior bureaucrats with large plots of land in Malir’s Memon Goth. “They put in lots of tube wells and that gave a fillip to agriculture. You can see the difference in the greenery on satellite images after 2010,” he says. 
Gul Hassan Kalmati, central committee member of the Indigenous Rights Alliance Sindh and a well-known historian, anthropologist and writer, says there are over 200 submersible pumps in Malir, capable of  drawing 26,000,000 gallons of water in 24 hours. Hydrant owners sell the water to various housing schemes in the area. 
The massive extraction of groundwater inevitably gives rise to another insidious development: seawater intrusion. Seawater is 2.5 per cent heavier than groundwater, so groundwater depletion will allow seawater to intrude into the empty space that used to store groundwater, rendering millions of acres in Karachi and the deltaic area barren. 
Nature is stealthy. It is a process, whereby it gives people many opportunities to set things right. But it seems we are unwilling to see what lies ahead, choosing short-term pecuniary gains instead of a viable future. Dispossessed farmers like Qadir Baloch are not the only ones facing impending doom.

5,PTI shifts venue of power show to Parade Ground,Joint opposition will announce its decision about the location of its protest after some brainstorming and in-house consultation.,"ISLAMABAD: The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf on Monday shifted the venue of its supposed power show, scheduled for March 27, from D-Chowk to Parade Ground after local authorities expressed concerns over the security of sensitive state installations in the area. 
On the other hand, the joint opposition, which had also announced its plan to hold a rally at D-Chowk the same day as the government, said it would announce its decision about location of the protest after some brainstorming and in-house consultation.
In a letter submitted to Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat on Monday, PTI Central Secretariat Chief Administrator Zahid Hussain Kazmi mentioned the change of venue and sought security and other facilities. 
“In reference to the letter dated March 16, submitted to your good office, kindly do the needful in terms of provision of security, venue and other related facilitation/services at the new venue.” 
After receiving the letter, the DC sought comments from the police over the matter. 
Sources in the capital administration told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the venue was changed after the administration and police had expressed concern over the security of sensitive installations in the area, including the Diplomatic Enclave comprising embassies and foreign missions, keeping in view the prevailing political tensions. 
The capital administration has already banned gatherings of five or more people in the high security Red Zone for two months, they added. 
Earlier, when both the government and opposition had announced their respective public meetings the same day at the same venue, the Islamabad police had asked the capital administration to offer different locations to each side, the sources said, in response to which Parade Ground was offered to the ruling party and Sector H-9 to the opposition. 
However, Pakistan Peoples Party secretary general Farhatullah Babar told Dawn the joint opposition would announce its venue after in-house consultations. He said they had found out through media reports that the government had been offered a location in Sector G, but there had been no formal offer. 
Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the opposition had not submitted any application to the capital administration for a public meeting, and the authorities would consider granting permission once a formal request would be made. He, however, suggested the opposition to hold its rally at F-9 Park, which is 12 kilometres from the Parade Ground, where the PTI would hold its power show.

6,Democratic Pakistan critical to America’s interests: US official,"""We respect and support Pakistan’s constitutional process and the rule of law,” says a US State Department spokesperson.","WASHINGTON: The US State Department said on Monday that a prosperous and democratic Pakistan was critical to US interests.
Responding to queries about the current political situation in the country, a spokesperson for the State Department also underlined America’s support for the constitutional process in Pakistan.
“We are closely following developments in Pakistan. We respect and support Pakistan’s constitutional process and the rule of law,” the spokesperson told Dawn.
“The United States values our long-standing cooperation with Pakistan and has always viewed a strong, prosperous, and democratic Pakistan as critical to US interests.”
Some circles in Pakistan blame the United States for stirring up troubles in the country for supporting the elements that want to unseat the current government.
Official and diplomatic circles in Washington, however, reject all such speculations as incorrect, pointing out that there were internal causes for the ongoing political crisis.
At a Friday afternoon news briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki underlined the Biden administration’s desire to continue a careful engagement with Pakistan without committing to either improving or degrading ties with a country that was once a close ally.
“We have a long relationship with Pakistan, and that is a relationship we’ll continue through diplomatic channels,” she said.

7,"ECP imposes fine on PM Imran, five others","District monitoring officer imposes fine of Rs50,000 each after the individuals spoke at a public gathering in Swat on March 16.","ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has imposed a fine of Rs50,000 each on Prime Minister Imran Khan and five others for addressing a public meeting in violation of the election code of conduct.
According to Haroon Shinwari, a spokesman for the ECP,   the district monitoring officer of Swat imposed the penalty after the prime minister, as well as some federal and provincial ministers, spoke at a public gathering in Swat valley on March 16 despite warnings by the commission. 
The others who have been fined are Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mehmood Khan, Murad Saeed, the Federal Minister for Communications and the area’s MNA, and provincial ministers Dr Amjad Ali and Mohibullah. 
The prime minister had addressed the rally despite the ECP’s notice not to do so.
The government had removed the bar on holders of public office and elected representatives from running an election campaign and visiting the constituency through a controversial presidential ordinance last month by amending the Elections Act of 2017. 
The government had already challenged the ECP notice before the Supreme Court. 
Meanwhile, the district monitoring officer of the ECP in Mansehra issued a notice to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday asking him not to address a public meeting in Mansehra on March 25. 
Besides Swat, the prime minister had addressed a public meeting in Malakand in violation of the code of conduct.

LAHORE: Author and academic Sara Suleri Goodyear died on Monday, according to media reports. She was 69.
Although there was no official word from her family, many in the literary community shared the news and paid rich tribute to her.
Born in 1953 in Karachi to renowned journalist Z.A. Sulehri and Welsh English professor Mair Jones, she was best known for her memoir, Meatless Days, which describe her years in Lahore. 
Educated at the Kinnaird College and Punjab University, Sara went on to complete her PhD and started her teaching career from Yale University. 
Her most famous work, Meatless Days, was published in 1989 and perhaps was never out of print, at least in Pakistan. Critic Muneeza Shamsie writes that the book encapsulated the memories of her Lahore childhood and, at the heart of the book were the tragic incidents that led to the death of Sara’s mother and sister. However, it also describes the political and social conditions of the country and the city of Lahore. 
Sara went on to publish The Rhetoric of English India in 1992, followed by Boys Will Be Boys: A Daughter’s Elegy in 2003. She married Austin Goodyear, an electronics and retail company executive, in 1993 and adopted the surname of Goodyear.
