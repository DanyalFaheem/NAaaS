0,PTI calls for Sindh IGP’s resignation after arrest of workers in Karachi,PTI MPAs gathered outside the Central Police Office and staged a sit-in to protest against the registration of cases.,"KARACHI: The arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf workers and registration of a case against its lawmakers for lodging a protest outside the house of disgruntled MNA Dr Ramesh Kumar a day before triggered a serious reaction from the opposition party that staged a sit-in outside the Central Police Office (CPO) on Monday.
The PTI demanded that the inspector general of police (IGP) tender his resignation over his open support of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government.
It all began in the early hours of the day when police arrested three local leaders of the PTI after breaking up the protest outside the MNA’s residence last night and took them to the Clifton police station.
The PTI leaders said they reached the police station soon after the three workers were reported missing and were assured by police that they would release them after having recorded their initial statement.
“But late in the night the police authorities, mainly the Sindh IGP, intervened in the case on the directives of the PPP leadership and ordered registration of an FIR not only against them but also against two of the party MPAs,” said Khurram Sher Zama, the PTI’s parliamentary party leader in the Sindh Assembly.
“This is complete vandalism and abuse of powers by the Sindh government. Above all, what makes it more unfortunate is the fact that the entire illegal exercise is being carried out by the IGP, who has reduced himself to a PPP activist,” he said.
A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said that the two MPAs — Shahnawaz Jadoon and Saeedullah Afridi — and over 50 unidentified party workers were nominated in the FIR as they hurled threats and used abusive language against MNA Kumar during the protest on Sunday evening.
He said that the FIR was lodged registered under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 457 (lurking, house-trespass or house-breaking by night in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment), 506-B (criminal intimidation), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person) and 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or for shorter terms) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
On Monday afternoon, the PTI MPAs gathered outside the CPO and staged a sit-in to protest against registration of the case against the party legislators and workers.
Chanting slogans and carrying placards, they said the IGP had lost credibility for toeing the line of the PPP leadership.
The sit-in led to a traffic mess on main I.I. Chundrigar Road, Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road and Club Road. 
M.R. Kyani Road, Sarwar Shaheed Road and Abdullah Haroon Road also became clogged after vehicles were diverted to these routes.

“Lights towers have also been installed for lighting in the park. Soon, Kidney Hill Park will be the best place for the citizens of Karachi,” he said while speaking to the media after laying the foundation stone of the Benazir Bhutto Waterfall.
He also inaugurated the Fauzia Wahab Garden at Kidney Hill Park.
The administrator, who is also the provincial government’s spokesman and chief minister’s adviser on law, said that special design of the Benazir Bhutto Waterfall had been prepared. It would be 200 feet long and 25ft high, he said.
Speaking about the garden named after his mother, he said: “More than 200 fruit trees have been planted in the Fauzia Wahab Garden in Kidney Hill Park. I will personally pay for the garden.”
“The beauty and greenery of the trees gives a pleasant feeling to the visitors. Kidney Hill Park will be an excellent oxygen tank for Karachi due to the abundance of trees. Away from environmental pollution, people can come here and enjoy.”
He said that four modern light towers had been installed in different parts of the park with 24 lights in one tower.
The administrator said that more such light towers would be installed so that visitors to the park could move around easily even at night.
He said that the park had walking trails and each one would be named after various mountains, rivers, lakes, trees, fruits, forests, national parks and deserts of Pakistan.
“KMC’s parks department deserves congratulations for completing all these tasks in the best possible way and in the shortest possible time,” he added.
He said that a tank had also been constructed in the park to store water and plants and trees would be watered by treating sewage.

2,"Milk, meat sales fall as lumpy skin disease spreads to 22 districts in Sindh",Official says govt can’t compensate farmers but will provide free vaccines for animals.,"KARACHI: As the lumpy skin disease penetrates further into Sindh districts causing greater animal mortality, a top livestock official on Monday claimed that the government was unable to compensate cattle farmers’ losses.
Speaking to Dawn, cattle farmers and veterinary experts blamed the government for the worsening disease situation, particularly in the interior parts of Sindh, and said that the disease outbreak could have been effectively controlled and farmers’ losses could have been minimised only if the government had taken timely measures.
The viral disease was officially notified this month followed by a provincial government notification on emergency on the disease despite the fact that it had started affecting cattle in the province in November last year. 
The vaccines are yet to arrive.

Official says govt can’t compensate farmers, but will provide free vaccines for animals

According to the official data, the disease has affected 22 districts. A total of 28,048 cases so far have been reported in Sindh with Karachi topping the list with 16,501 cases followed by Thatta 4,512 and Hyderabad 684.
More than 12,000 animals have recovered while 15,215 are under recovery. A total of 233 animals have died of the disease till to date.
“The government can’t compensate dairy farmers, but will provide free vaccines for animals that will arrive this week,” said director general-livestock Dr Nazeer Kalhoro.
He claimed that the cases had reduced in Karachi due to the steps taken by the government. “A viral disease spreads and its cases peak before dropping down. This explains why lumpy skin disease is spreading.”
The government, he said, had been tracing cases since the disease outbreak and taking containment measures.
Significant drop in milk, meat sales
“Cattle farmers have been badly affected by the propaganda about the disease, and milk and meat sales in Karachi have gone 60 per cent to 70pc down despite veterinary experts’ repeated explanation that the disease cannot be transmitted to humans from meat or milk,” said a dairy farmer operating in Cattle Colony.
He said the disease had affected a large number of exotic cows, mainly housed in farms along the Superhighway.
“They were all finally slaughtered. The situation is not that bad in Cattle Colony since it largely houses buffaloes, which are not affected by the disease.”
Representing the Dairy and Cattle Farmers Association, Dr Zaid Khan described the situation in the interior parts of Sindh as “extremely worrisome”.
“Small-scale cattle farmers who earn a living by selling off a few litres of milk a day are hard hit. The government must provide them compensation for their losses that could have been minimised through timely intervention,” he said, adding that the middle-men were making money even in this crisis.
Most of the small-scale farmers in Sindh, he said, were illiterate and too poor to get the right treatment for their infected animals. “The situation has worsened also because genuine vets are not practicing here, and farmers are forced to consult quacks.”
Dr Khan, based in Khairpur, also called for government attention towards open dumping of remains of affected animals, posing a threat to public health.
Dr Mushtaq Bhanbro, a private vet in Thatta district, said the entire coastal belt of Sindh had been affected by the disease and it had now reached Tharparkar.
“Few cases have been reported there. But, if the government fails to take preventive measures, the disease could devastate the whole community as they depend on their animals for survival,” he said.

5,First satellite campus of Virtual University opens in Karachi,Minister Amin-ul-Haque says varsity will offer five programmes to students,"KARACHI: In a first move of its kind, the federal government on Monday established a satellite campus of a Lahore-based public sector university in the city’s Orangi Town localities.
Virtual University works under the ministry of information technology and telecom and its campus would help a large number of students living in Orangi Town to acquire “world-class education” and become graduates of the educational facility in five different fields.
Federal Information Technology and Telecom Minister Syed Amin-ul-Haque of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan unveiled the plaque of the project here. The ceremony was also attended by Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab of the Pakistan Peoples Party.
As the MQM-P and PPP are getting closer in the wake of the no-confidence motion against prime minister, both Mr Haque and Administrator Wahab appreciated each other’s efforts to make the project a reality within shortest possible time of one month.

Minister Amin-ul-Haque says varsity will offer five programmes to students 

Speaking on the occasion, Mr Haque, who is an MNA from the same Orangi Town constituency, congratulated Karachiites over the first VU campus in the city.
“This campus will bring revolutionary changes in the life of residents of Orangi Town through world-class teaching facilities,” he said. “The university will offer degrees in five different fields at its Orangi Town Campus.”
Appreciating the cooperation and efforts of Administrator Wahab, he said he left no stone unturned after he was requested to provide a building in Orangi Town for setting up the VU campus. “He met all our requests and demands on an emergency basis.”
He said that the MQM-P had promised the residents of Orangi Town that they would be offered best possible education and health facilities in their neighbourhood. 
The dream, he said, had come true and the party believed that it had owed people of Orangi Town and other parts of Karachi who had voted for its members and made them members of the parliament.
Speaking about the VU, he said that the varsity had more than 130,000 enrolled students and over the years it had produced 2.4 million freelance IT professionals through its DigiSkills training programme, which had enabled Pakistan in earning massive foreign exchange and enhanced its international ranking in the freelance industry.
He asked the city administrator to hand over the “ruined schools of Orangi Town to MQM-P and it will turn them into state-of-the-art schools”.
He said his ministry had launched and completed many projects in Sindh. “I assure you a revolution is coming from the Sindh digital project.”
On the occasion, Administrator Wahab praised the efforts of the IT minister in fulfilling his commitment with the people of his constituency by bringing the VU campus to Karachi.
“I think it’s a gift for the people of Karachi and Orangi Town. The KMC [Karachi Metropolitan Corporation] was inspired seeing the efforts of Amin Bhai and we decided that we have to meet every requirement without any delay. I firmly believe if we work together, we can give a strong system to the youth of Karachi,” he added.
Virtual University Rector Prof Dr Arshad Saleem Bhatti said that VU graduates were preferred in IT industry due to hands-on training as a self-learner while its graduates were working in dynamic fields across Pakistan at key positions including the army. 
He said that several students had won many international and local competitions. 
The Orangi Town campus was built in just one month with all necessary facilities like campus manager office, faculty room, visitors’ room, waiting area, computer lab, female common room, scientific store, video conference room, lab and all the required facilities, he added.
IT & Telecom secretary Dr Sohail Rajput and MQM-P MPA Ali Khurshidi also spoke.
Virtual University, which is Pakistan’s first university based completely on modern information and communication technologies, was set up in 2002 to promote distance education as its primary objectives.

6,Drive to demolish illegally constructed wedding halls on Korangi Road begins,Official says over 40 wedding halls are to be demolished and operation will continue till task's completion.,"KARACHI: On the directive of the Supreme Court, the city administration on Monday launched a drive to demolish scores of wedding halls constructed illegally on Korangi Road.
The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), Karachi Development Authority (KDA), Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) and district municipal corporation-Korangi jointly carried out the operation.
An official said that over 40 wedding halls were to be demolished as per the apex court’s order and the operation would continue till the completion of the task.
In January, the Supreme Court had ordered the demolition of these wedding halls as it ruled that these were built on the land meant for residential purposes only.
The apex court issued the directive while dismissing applications moved by the owners of marriage halls and directed that the land was liable to be reverted back to its original residential use.
Earlier, the administrative committee of the apex court, headed by the then chief justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed, in its meeting held on Oct 17, 2020 had directed the Karachi commissioner to demolish the illegal wedding halls.

The health sector alone could face the worst effects of this move. 
He demanded that the federal government at least exempt welfare bodies from the sales tax, as they share the state burden by offering different relief services to millions of Pakistanis across the country without any financial benefit. 
“If the situation persists, and the federal government doesn’t withdraw the sales tax, it would be very difficult to carry on our projects which we execute from our welfare platform Al-Khidmat,” he said while addressing a signing ceremony between the party’s welfare wing and Foodpanda, to provide medicines on discounted rates to patients’ doorsteps within 30 minutes.

9,‘Verified’ letter nearly gets forger charge  of 116 UCs’ administrator,HYDERABAD: A BS-16 official was suspended for attempting to hoodwink the local government department and Hyderabad...,"HYDERABAD: A BS-16 official was suspended for attempting to hoodwink the local government department and Hyderabad deputy commissioner through a fake letter to become administrator of 116 union committees and councils and operate their accounts. 
The official, Mushtaq Ahmed Soomro, was suspended after Sindh Local Government Board (SLGB) found the letter appointing him as the administrator and another letter verifying his posting to be fake, according to the board’s secretary, Rashid Brohi.
Mr Brohi said that the letters were intercepted by the board in response to Hyderabad deputy commissioner’s communication regarding the official’s ‘posting’. An inquiry against Soomro was being ordered, he said.
The DC was given the charge of administrator for union committees and councils of Hyderabad by the LG department vide a letter dated Feb 3 and he assumed the charge on Feb 9. In the meantime, another letter dated Feb 28, purportedly issued by the LG secretary, surfaced and showed posting of Mushtaq Ahmed Soomro as the administrator for all these 116 UCs.
Soomro did not approach the DC to take the charge. Instead, he went directly to some banks for his biometric verification that could enable him to operate the UCs’ accounts. His act alerted the DC who, on March 14, sought verification of the February 28 letter from the SLGB secretary. 
Interestingly, the February 28 letter was also purportedly verified on March 16 by the SLGB secretary in response to the DC’s letter.
In his March 14 letter, the DC citing relevant records revealed that UCs’ funds had been withdrawn between Feb 2 and 28 by successive administrators in haste and the amount withdrawn was not spent on cleanliness or any other development work in the respective UCs. He also noted that in UC-46, an amount of Rs5m was withdrawn in a single day.
The DC informed the SLGB secretary about his direction to the UC-46 secretary to produce documents of fund utilisation but he failed to do so. Such blatant misuse of public money warranted an in-depth investigation on the part of the LG secretary and anticorruption department, the DC suggested.
Eventually, UC-46 secretary Riaz Hussain Rahujo was suspended by the SLGB. 
He was holding the additional charge of UC-22 and 30 of the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC) and UC-25 Dad Jarwar, district Tando Allahyar.
The DC, in his letter, had also complained that the new administrator had started working without intimation to him which was against the official protocols.
He said that frequent transfers and postings of administrators for UCs had paved the way for malpractices and irregularities and dealt a severe blow to development works that could, otherwise, have been carried out with UCs’ funds. He had proposed that development works carried out by administrators should be monitored and counter-checked through a joint mechanism.
According to sources, Mushtaq Soomro got the posting order by using a political connection. Rahujo also got posting through a similar political connection, they said. 
Rahujo, was suspended for alleged embezzlement or misappropriation of funds through fake bills or flying vouchers after DC’s letter, the SLGB secretary’s letter stated.

In a statement, he accused federal government of depriving Sindh of its rightful share in water by giving false reasons and justifications regarding ongoing work on Tarbela Dam and artificially creating a crisis in Sindh. 
Condemning the attitude, he demanded immediate release of Sindh’s due share in water. He said Irsa’s decision visa-a-vis distribution of water would create a crisis in Sindh and destroy the crops being grown on thousands of acres.
Mr Shoro said that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s government was punishing farmers and growers of Sindh by depriving them of water and not acting as per the Water Apportionment Accord of 1991 which, he said, “is highly condemnable”. He urged the federal government and Irsa authorities to release Sindh’s due share in water from Mangla Dam if there was no water available in Tarbela Dam.
He said that Sindh was getting 40pc lesser water than its share.

This year, there are no coronavirus-related restrictions for the people visiting the Qalandar shrine. Stringent security measures have been taken to keep a close eye on terrorists, subversive elements and miscreants. 
The full scale attendance and celebrations have been allowed this time after a gap of two years. In 2019 and 2020, a limited number of devotees and officials concerned were allowed to get together inside and outside the shrine with strict Covid-19 restrictions to ensure social distance and wearing of face mask by each one. The traditional and religious rituals were also scaled down to only Dhamal and mystic dance, rendition and recitals by small groups of devotees. 
Adviser to the Chief Minister on Religious Affairs Fayyaz Ali Butt will inaugurate the urs celebrations, according to an official statement. A local holiday for Tuesday, March 22, has been announced.  
The provincial government and district authorities expect that more than 2.5 million people will attend the three-day celebrations. 
Among the thousands of people present in Sehwan are mostly regular visitors coming from across the country. 
A caravan of 40 such male and female devotees and another one of 15 travelled to the Qalandar’s shrine from Bahawalpur and Multan, respectively, on foot.  
The local administration has imposed Section 144 of PPC disallowing entry of any type of vehicles within the city’s limits and barring bathing in the Aral Wah (irrigation channel). 
A spacious area on the outskirts of Sehwan has been designated for parking of vehicles. Bathing has been banned keeping in view a number of drowning cases in the past. Pakistan Navy divers and other personnel have been posted along Aral Wah to stop people from bathing in the channel and rescue anyone resorting to breaching the ban. Local divers would also volunteer to rescue people.   
Hyderabad DIG Syed Pir Mohammad Shah has established his camp in Sehwan to supervise the security plan for the urs. Under the plan, 4,500 officers and personnel drawn from Dadu, Jamshoro and Hyderabad districts have been deployed in the city and a control room has established at the shrine to monitor the security situation through 200 CCTV cameras. Rangers personnel have also been deployed at sensitive points.  
A total of 190 traffic police officers and personnel have been deployed to ensure a smoot flow of vehicular traffic along the roads leading to Sehwan. 
Security across Sehwan used to be beefed up during urs celebrations since the Feb 16, 2017 bomb blast in the shrine that had left 90 people dead and 300 others wounded. 
Each person entering the city from any point is frisked and the luggage offloaded from vehicles is checked by police. People entering the shrine from any gate also undergo security check and frisking.
