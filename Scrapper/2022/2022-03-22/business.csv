0,Monthly fuel cost drops 27pc,Imported gas–based cost of generation declined 14pc to Rs14.32 a unit owing to a 2pc monthly dip in the price of imported gas.,"KARACHI: The cost of fuel for electricity generation in February went down 27 per cent to Rs8.94 per unit on a month-on-month basis, according to data recently released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority.
The sharp month-on-month decline in the fuel cost was partly because hydel-based generation surged 2.9 times in February, according to Arif Habib Ltd.
However, the fuel cost, which is one of the three components of the final rate that power producers charge their government-backed buyer, went up 89.6 per cent on an annual basis from Rs4.71 per Gigawatt hour in February 2021.
The share of hydel-based electricity production was 18.2pc in February, markedly higher than 5.8pc share in January. In contrast, coal-based cost of generation went down 7pc on a monthly basis to Rs13.09 per kilowatt hour in February.
Imported gas–based cost of generation declined 14pc to Rs14.32 a unit owing to a 2pc monthly dip in the price of imported gas.
Similarly, furnace oil–based cost of generation went down 6pc to Rs21.46 a unit while high-speed diesel, which is the most expensive source of power generation, wasn’t used at all to produce electricity in February. The month-on-month increase in solar-based generation was 25pc, it said.
The largest contributor to the power mix in February was coal with a share of 32pc, followed by hydel (18.2pc), imported gas (15.2pc), nuclear (12.5pc), gas (11pc), furnace oil (7pc), wind (2pc) and wind and bagasse with a share of 1pc each.

1,Oil prices rise $6 as EU plans Russian ban,Prices moved higher ahead of talks this week between EU govts and US that aims to harden the West’s response to Moscow.,"HOUSTON: Oil prices jumped by more than $6 on Monday, with Brent crude climbing above $114 a barrel, as European Union nations considered joining the United States in a Russian oil embargo and after a weekend attack on Saudi oil facilities.
Brent crude futures were up $6.52, or 6pc, at $114.45 a barrel by 1442 GMT, adding to a 1.2pc rise on Friday.
US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $5.90, or 5.6pc, to $110.60.
Prices moved higher ahead of talks this week between European Union governments and US President Joe Biden in a series of summits that aims to harden the West’s response to Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
EU governments will consider whether to impose an oil embargo on Russia.With little sign of the conflict easing, the focus returned to whether the market would be able to replace Russian barrels hit by sanctions.
“With the possibility that more than a million barrels of Russian oil a day will be snubbed, given that the Netherlands and Germany combined received around a quarter of Russia’s crude and light oil exports, demand would shoot up for crude supplies from Opec+ nations.” 
Over the weekend, attacks by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group caused a temporary drop in output at a Saudi Aramco refinery joint venture in Yanbu, feeding concern in a jittery oil products market, where Russia is a major supplier and global inventories are at multi-year lows.
The latest report from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, together known as Opec+, showed some producers are still falling short of their agreed supply quotas. Oil prices were also sensitive to talk of Hong Kong lifting Covid-19 restrictions, which could increase demand.

3,"Govt plans coal conversion to gas, liquid fuels",A policy draft has been shared with all the stakeholders so that it could be finalised and included in the coming budget: official,"ISLAMABAD: Amid declining domestic gas production and expensive fuel imports, a new policy for conversion of Coal-to-Gas (LTG) and Coal-to-Liquid (CTL) with lucrative tax holidays and duty exemptions is being finalised to be made part of the upcoming federal budget 2022-23.
Informed sources said the draft Policy on Coal-to-Liquid and Coal-to-Gas was prepared by Oracle Power and China National Coal Development Co (CNCDC). 
The policy, according to the Special Assistant to Prime Minister on CPEC Khalid Mansoor, is aimed initially at scaling up Thar coal production for CTG and CTL (diesel) conversion and setting up a petrochemical complex for a chain of industrial products and eventually move on to other areas for fertiliser, fuel and agriculture security.
“We have already constituted a consortium of mining and power companies – already working at Thar Coal including Shanghai Electric, Oracle Power, CNCDC — and fertiliser producers like Fauji, Fatima and Engro,” he told Dawn. 

Govt change could affect momentum, says SAPM on CPEC

A policy draft had been shared with all the stakeholders so that the policy could be finalised and included in the coming budget, he added. 
Shanghai Electric has majority stakes in Thar Block-I and 1,320 megawatt power while Oracle and CNCDC are partners in Block-IV and another 1,320MW plant.
He said he had been successful in including the CTG and CTL initiative in the recent meeting of the Joint Cooperation Council (JCC) on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Financing could only be secured with the support of JCC, he added. 
“There is no doubt about the technical viability,” he said when asked about the CTG and CTL, adding that he had himself seen a number of petrochemical complexes up and running in China.
He, however, said the main challenge would be to conclude policy and secure financing now to move towards execution phase and have plants in place by 2028. He said if CTG was successful, a large fertiliser plant could be set at the mine-mouth of Thar coal. 
The coal at the later stage would be moved through Thar coal rail – both North to South and South to North. Lucky Power Station of 660MW which has just started trial power production would ultimately be converted to Thar coal as required under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).
Mr Mansoor, however, agreed that a regime change could affect momentum but hoped the process would continue as it was in the long-term interest of the country to have food and energy security. “Only 1,000-2,000 tonnes of urea shortage created a crisis-like situation this year, so this is an issue of food security as well,” he said. 
“Due to gas shortages, all existing fertiliser plants — currently producing about six million tonnes of the farming input —would have to shift to coal and ensure sustainable production. They would only need to change their front end,” he added.
The objective of the policy is to provide alternate uses of coal reserves in Pakistan, especially Thar coal fields, on a commercially viable and environmentally sustainable basis but its applicability will not be restricted to Thar coal field only. Institutional sale of synthetic diesel on a Business to Business (B2B) basis shall be on mutually agreed commercial terms but shall be sold with full disclosure that it is synthetic diesel, with the relevant specifications.
Due to late start, Pakistan has only less than 15pc of power generation capacity based on coal fired plants.
“However, if Pakistan does not exploit its indigenous coal reserves, it will remain heavily dependent on imported thermal fuels. Thar coal fields being one of the largest lignite reserves in the world needs to be commercially exploited, albeit in the new reality of clean fuels,” the draft policy argues.
It explains the regulatory framework in which coal can be converted into synthetic gas and synthetic diesel, to displace oil and gas imports to some extent.
Fiscal & Commercial Package
To encourage deployment of such new technologies, the fiscal incentives would include waiver of customs duty on all plant and equipment, not manufactured locally, for CTL and CTG technologies. Items manufactured locally will be charged a duty of 5pc for which certification of local manufacturing be done by Engineering Development Board (EDB).
There would be complete waiver of withholding tax and sales tax on all imported equipment used in these plants on top of a lucrative 10-year complete income tax waiver with effect from commercial operations for which prior timelines would have to be committed and met. 
For a company to be eligible for such concessions would have to file an application with Board of Investment (BoI) that it intends to put up a CTL or CTG plant, identifying the local coal reserves that it intends to utilise, and the offtake plan for the gas or liquids proposed to be produced.

4,Lucky completes commissioning of 660MW power plant,"KARACHI: Lucky Cement Ltd said on Monday its wholly owned subsidiary, Lucky Electric Power Company, has successfully...","KARACHI: Lucky Cement Ltd said on Monday its wholly owned subsidiary, Lucky Electric Power Company, has successfully completed the commissioning of a 660-megawatt power plant at Bin Qasim.
A regulatory filing said the lignite coal-based supercritical power plant was synchronised with the national grid towards the end of 2021. Its extensive testing and relevant inspections since then led to its commercial operations date or COD on Monday.
The power plant has been designed to operate on Thar lignite coal. However, it’s going to run on imported lignite coal until the completion of the third and final phase of mining within Block 2 under Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC).
So far, SECMC is the only company that’s mining coal from the Thar coalfield. It’s been mining 3.8 million tonnes of coal every year since 2019. It sells its entire output to Engro Powergen Thar Ltd, which is so far the country’s only indigenous coal-based 660-megawatt power plant located next to the mine.
Under the ongoing second phase, coal mining by SECMC will double to 7.6m tonnes per year by June. It’ll coincide with the commissioning of a 330-megawatt power plant by Thar Energy Ltd, whose majority ownership is with The Hub Power Company (Hubco). Another Hubco-sponsored power plant of 330MW, ThalNova Power Ltd, will be commissioned immediately afterwards and will ensure the 100pc consumption of the enhanced output of SECMC’s mine in Block 2.
With its third-phase expansion by June 2023, the mine’s output will increase to 12.2m tonnes per year. The increased mining will supply fuel to the 660MW power plant that Lucky Electric Power Company has just commissioned at Port Qasim.
Coal has become the biggest source of power generation in Pakistan. The country produced almost one-third of its total electricity using the dirtiest fuel last month. In terms of the number of units produced, coal-based electricity production increased almost 35pc on a year-on-year basis in February.
In total, five coal-based electricity plants are currently operating in the country. Four of them — Sahiwal Power Plant, Port Qasim Power Plant, China Power Hub Generation and Lucky Electric Power — burn imported coal.

5,IsDB approves $180m for Mohmand Dam,Jeddah-based IsDB signs framework agreements to extend $180m loans to Pakistan to finance Mohmand Dam Hydropower Project.,"ISLAMABAD: The Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) on Monday signed framework agreements to extend $180 million loans to Pakistan to finance Mohmand Dam Hydropower Project (MDHP).
The financing agreements were signed by Secretary Economic Affairs Mian Asad Hayaud Din and Special Adviser to the President IsDB Mohammad Jamal Al-Satti.
The signing ceremony was also witnessed by IsDB President Dr Muhammad Al Jasser, who is in Islamabad on a three-day visit to attend the 48th session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers. Dr Al Jasser also had a meeting with Minister for Economic Affairs Omar Ayub Khan and discussed the matters of mutual interest, an official statement said.
Both sides discussed the ongoing and future economic cooperation between Pakistan and the IsDB and agreed to continue with the technical and financial assistance to Pakistan.
The two sides signed a total of three framework agreements for a cumulative amount of $180m to provide financing for Rs310bn worth MDHP. The contract for the project construction was awarded to a consortium of China Gezhouba Group Company (CGGC) and Descon Engineering of Prime Minister’s Adviser on Commerce Abdul Razak Dawood in 2019 and construction commenced in September 2019 with a completion deadline of December 2025.
MDHP is a multi-purpose concrete-faced rockfill dam being constructed on Swat River located at a distance of about 48km from Peshawar and 5km upstream of Munda Head Works in Mohmand District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The project is to generate 1,300MW electricity and enhance Pakistan’s water storage capacity by 1,293-million acre-feet (MAF), provide food security buffer, 13.32 cubic of clean drinking water to the residents of Peshawar city and create more than 6,000 direct new employment opportunities for the local people.
Referring to the agreements, Dr Muhammad Al Jasser said the bank took pride in working alongside its partners to support Pakistan in a strategic project of national importance. “We are working with other partners from the Arab Coordination Group along with one of the most experienced authorities in Pakistan, Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) to develop a multi-purpose dam that will not only enhance energy and water supply but also the livelihoods of the local communities and better protect them against floods”.
The signing of the framework agreements for Mohmand Dam and Hydropower Plant project is testimony to the continuity of the strong partnership between Pakistan and IsDB Group, in alignment with the country’s priorities and our commitments to allocate more financing to climate-friendly projects, the ISDB chief said adding he looked forward to ensuring the smooth implementation of the project and hoped to witness its operation in due time.
