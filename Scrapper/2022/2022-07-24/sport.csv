0,Pakistan hockey squad set to depart for Birmingham today,The squad will participate in the Commonwealth Games being held in Birmingham from July 28 to Aug 8.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan hockey squad on Saturday left for Islamabad from where it will fly out to the UK on Sunday to participate in the Commonwealth Games being held in Birmingham from July 28 to Aug 8.
The Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), which is currently going through a crunch time due to its conflict with the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) over the elections of the federation, held a reception in the honour of the Umar Bhutta-led national squad, comprising 18 players, on Friday night.
The function was attended by former Olympians Akhtar Rasool, Manzoor Junior, Khalid Hammed, Rana Mujahid, team’s head coach Siegfried Aikman, manager Sameer Hussain, PHF president retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar, secretary Asif Bajwa and Tahir Zaman.
Earlier this month., the PSB had de-notified Khokhar as PHF president for failing to hold elections due on May 14 this year. However, Khokhar is part of a four-member PHF ad-hoc committee announced by the PSB which has to hold the elections within the next month.

1,Mathews says Anderson his inspiration ahead of 100th Test,GALLE: Sri Lanka’s Angelo Mathews on Saturday said he takes inspiration from veteran England fast bowler James...,"GALLE: Sri Lanka’s Angelo Mathews on Saturday said he takes inspiration from veteran England fast bowler James Anderson for longevity in the sport as the former captain awaits his 100th Test.
Mathews will achieve the career milestone in the second Test against Pakistan starting on Sunday in Galle with the hosts looking to bounce back from their opening loss.
England star Ben Stokes this week sparked a debate on cricket’s packed calendar and player exhaustion after he quit one-day internationals on Tuesday.
But when asked about Stokes’ decision, the 35-year-old Mathews said he still had a lot of cricket left in him in all three formats.
“My inspiration is Jimmy Anderson. At 40 being a fast bowler he still wants to play a couple of more years,” Mathews told reporters — although the England star only turns 40 next week.
“See it’s the drive that you have towards the game. It’s not going to stop here. I still have a few more years.”
While Mathews acknowledged that cricket had  “taken a toll on my body” in recent years, he said he would work on his fitness and form.
“Age is just a number and I am still willing to give it my best in all three formats.” Anderson, who gave up the white-ball formats to concentrate on Tests, has claimed 657 wickets in 172 five-day matches since making his debut in 2003.
Mathews, a middle-order batsman and a medium-pace bowler -- although he now seldom bowls due to injuries -- has scored 6,876 runs in 99 Tests since his 2009 debut against Pakistan in Galle.
“I haven’t given up bowling in T20s and ODIs. But when you play Test cricket in the subcontinent, my type of bowling will not suit the team that much,” he said.
The second Pakistan Test will be Sri Lanka’s last this season before the team travels to New Zealand in March next year for two five-day games.
Mathews urged Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) to include more red-ball matches in the team’s itinerary.
“I prefer Test cricket. We like if there are many more Test matches because most of the leading players want to play more Test cricket,” said Mathews, who called the Test win under his captaincy at Headingley in 2014 one of his career highlights.
“But, unfortunately, I think we have about seven Test matches for next 18 months or so. We hope SLC would make arrangements to include few more Test matches.” Captain Dimuth Karunaratne, who played cricket with Mathews at the same school, said a win in Galle to level the series would be an ideal gift for the veteran.
“Like for Angelo, even for us it’s a great occasion. It’s not an easy thing to play 100 Test matches,” said Karunaratne.
“So trying to make it memorable. When we win there is lot of joy and that’s what we want to do in this game.”

2,Pakistan look to seal series win in Sri Lanka despite missing injured Shaheen,"The pitch at Galle has changed character in all three matches played in the past few weeks, including two Tests against Australia.","GALLE: Pakistan coach Saqlain Mushtaq admitted his side will miss injury-hit pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi in the second and final Test against Sri Lanka starting from Sunday but hoped other bowlers will step up as his side look to seal a series victory following a morale-boosting win in the opening game. 
Shaheen’s absence due to a knee injury will hurt Pakistan, who rely on their quicks to get early wickets even on turning subcontinent pitches. He claimed four wickets in the first innings of the first Test at the Galle International Stadium, which will also hold the second Test, and Pakistan on Saturday added left-arm spinner Nauman Ali to the team in his place. 
“He is inspirational, leads the bowling unit from the front, and we will miss his aggression and his presence,” Saqlain said on Saturday. “The way he comes and gives us the breakthrough at the start... hopefully the other bowlers will step up.” 
The visitors rode on opener Abdullah Shafique’s unbeaten 160 to chase down a record 342 at the venue on a tense fifth day to take a 1-0 series lead. 
The pitch at Galle has changed character in all three matches played in the past few weeks, including two Tests against Australia. 
Sri Lankan players believed the pitch went flat on the final two days when Pakistan batted, but Saqlain said his batsmen were up to the task. 
“I believe the pitch turned from day one and it kept spinning, but I think our boys showed some really good character in the match,” said the former off-spinner. “It was a show of determination, patience and temperament by our players.” 
Sri Lanka skipper Dimuth Karunaratne, meanwhile, said on Saturday that teenage spinner Dunith Wellalage had been included in the final 12 for the second Test. 
The 19-year-old Wellalage, a left-arm orthodox who awaits his Test debut, seems a likely replacement for injured spinner Maheesh Theekshana as the hosts look to bounce back after their opening loss. 
“Dunith Wellalage is back in the squad” after being released from the Test squad for a domestic match, Karunaratne told reporters. 
“Asitha Fernando is back in the 12. Those are the only changes,” he added on the eve of Angelo Mathews’ landmark 100th Test. 
Wellalage, also handy with the bat, played a key role with his nine wickets in Sri Lanka’s 3-2 one-day series win over Australia last month, and could partner with Prabath Jayasuriya in the final Test. 
Jayasuriya waged a lone battle with his left-arm spin to claim a match haul of nine wickets in the first Test, but found little help from the other end. 
“We did pretty well in the first Test but the conditions were not to our assistance,” said Karunaratne. “Another area that we need to work on is first innings batting.” 
The venue for the second Test was shifted from Colombo to Galle due to the political unrest in Sri Lanka, and it is the hosts’ final Test of the season, with their next red-ball series a tour to New Zealand in March. 
Crucial World Test Championship points will be up for grabs for both teams, with Pakistan third and Sri Lanka sixth in the current standings. 
Teams: 
SRI LANKA 12: Oshada Fernando, Dimuth Karunaratne (capt), Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Dhananjaya de Silva, Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Ramesh Mendis, Dinuth Wellalage, Prabath Jayasuriya, Kasun Rajitha, Asitha Fernando.

FERRARI’S Charles Leclerc celebrates after qualifying on pole for the French F1 Grand Prix at Circuit Paul Ricard on Saturday.—Reuters

 
LE CASTELLET: Charles Leclerc will start the French Grand Prix from pole position after edging out his world title rival Max Verstappen in qualifying on Saturday.
Ferrari’s Leclerc, who trails championship leader Verstappen by 38 points in the drivers’ standings, posted a time of one minute and 30.872 seconds.
Verstappen’s Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez qualified third-fastest, with Lewis Hamilton completing the second row.
The pole was Leclerc’s seventh in 12 races, 16th of the Monegasque’s career, and he had Spanish team-mate Carlos Sainz to thank for giving him a strategic aerodynamic tow that made a big difference.
Sainz will start at the back of the grid, on what is likely to be a hot and possibly windy Sunday afternoon at Le Castellet’s Circuit Paul Ricard, due to engine penalties.

Team Jumbo’s Vingegaard tops the overall standings 3min 34sec ahead of two-time defending champion Tadej Pogacar, while Geraint Thomas of Ineos Grenadiers, the 2018 winner, stands third at 8min 13sec. 
Frenchman David Gaudu of FDJ and and Aleksandr Vlasov of Bora rouud out the virtual top five ahead of Sunday’s stage, a largely processional ride from La Defense to the Champs Elysees in Paris. 
Saturday’s time-trial was won by Wout van Aert ahead of Danish team-mate Vingegaard, meaning the team have six wins, the yellow jersey, the green sprint jersey and the polka dot climb jersey. 
Van Aert clocked a best time of 47 minutes 59 seconds. Vingegaard finished 19 seconds behind Van Aert with Pogacar taking third place, 27 seconds off the pace. 
Two years ago, Pogacar famously overturned a 57-second deficit on the penultimate day time-trial on La Planche des Belles Filles to snatch victory from Primoz Roglic. 
But on Saturday, Vingegaard flew down the ramp last of the 139 surviving riders and set a relentlessly high pace through the baking country roads meaning a battle of nerves with Pogacar never really emerged. 
He did, however, suffer a late wobble, losing his back wheel which slid over gravel into a gutter, but just managed to right himself.

Mushfiqur opted out of the recent series against West Indies to perform hajj pilgrimage and will remain absent for the three-match T20 International series against Zimbabwe which will precede the ODIs.
Pace bowler Hasan Mahmud, who last played an international match 16 months ago, was included in both the T20 and ODI squads after regaining full fitness from injury.
Bangladeshi selectors add­ed a few greenhorns to the T20 squad, among them uncapped opener Pervez Hossain.
Wicket-keeper Nurul Hasan will lead the side in the T20 series in the absence of regular captain Mahm­udullah Riyad, who has been rested.
The T20s will be held on July 30, July 31 and Aug 2, and will be followed by the ODIs on Aug 5, 7 and 10.
All the matches will be held at the Harare Sports Club ground.

6,Topley strikes as England thrash SA to level Twenty20 series,MANCHESTER: The ret­u­­r­ning Reece Topley sparked a dramatic collapse as Eng­land hammered South Africa by 118...,"MANCHESTER: The ret­u­­r­ning Reece Topley sparked a dramatic collapse as Eng­land hammered South Africa by 118 runs in the second One-day International here at Old Trafford on Friday to level the three-match series at 1-1.
South Africa, chasing 202 for victory in a match redu­ced by rain to 29 overs per side, were bowled out for just 83.
Topley, whose career has been stalled by several stre­ss fractures, sparked a top-order slump to 27-5 during a spell of 2-17 in four overs.
Spinners Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali shared five wickets between them as South Africa were dismissed with nearly nine overs remaining for their equal second-lowest completed ODI total, behind a 69 all out against Australia at Sydney in 1993 and level with an 83 against England at Nottingham in 2008.
“It feels great, it’s great for us to get the win,” said England captain Jos Buttler.
“The guys are bowling brilliantly. Topley coming back in and getting early wickets, Dave (Willey) doing the same.”
The in-form Topley, rested from England’s 62-run defeat in the first ODI at Durham on Tuesday, remo­ved Janneman Malan and Rassie van der Dussen for ducks just three days after they had scored a fifty and a hundred, respectively.
Malan chipped to mid-on attempting to flick one off his pads and Van der Dussen feathered a thin edge thro­ugh to wicketkeeper and England captain Jos Buttler.
Willey, like Topley a left-arm quick, had the dangerous Quinton de Kock chipping to cover. And South Africa were 6-4 when Aiden Markram was run out without facing a ball by Buttler.
Sam Curran, another left-arm seamer, then bowled David Miller for 12 to leave the Proteas 27-5 inside nine overs.
And there was no way back from there for the Proteas against 50-over wor­ld champions England, for all that Heinrich Klassen made 33 — one of just three double-figure scores in the innings — against a disciplined England attack.
Earlier, Dwaine Pretorius marked his return to South Africa duty by taking four wickets as England were dismissed for 201.
Pretorius finished with career-best figures of 4-36, including removing star batsmen Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow in the space of three balls.
Left-arm wrist-spinner Tab­­raiz Shamsi (2-39) and fast bowler Anrich Nortje (2-53) took two wickets apiece.
Only all-rounders Liam Livingstone (38) and Sam Curran (35) managed more than 30 for England, with Willey adding a useful run-a-ball 21 late on before he became Pretorius’s fourth wicket.
But, as it turned out, England had more than enough runs to play with as they levelled the series ahead of Sunday’s decider in Leeds.
“I thought that it was a score that could be chased on that wicket,” said South Africa captain Keshav Maharaj.
“We just didn’t adapt well enough with the bat, there were a lot of soft wickets and when you lose four wickets in the powerplay it’s hard to adapt.”
England, sent into bat by Maharaj, slumped to 62-4 inside nine overs.
Pretorius, in for the concussed Andile Phehlukwayo in the only change to the side that won on Tuesday, then struck twice in his second over to remove Root and Bairstow.
Star batsman Root, who had made just one, charged down the pitch only to top-edge the ball high into the air, with wicket-keeper De Kock making holding the catch before Pretorius fooled Bairstow (28) with a slower ball.

In a consummate display of front-foot running, McLaughlin left a loaded field for dead from the gun, haring through the tape in an astonishing 50.68 seconds. It sliced more than half a second off her previous world mark of 51.41sec set last month. 
“We took the 400m hurdles and made it something you want to watch,” said McLaughlin, adding that she was proud to have once again delivered at a “big-stage race”. 
“I knew the pressure was going to be there tonight. The time is absolutely amazing and the sport is getting faster and faster. Just figuring out what barriers can be broken. I only get faster from here.” 
Femke Bol of the Netherlands took silver in 52.27sec while defending champion Dalilah Muhammad of the United States took bronze in 53.13. 
To put McLaughlin’s staggering performance in perspective, her time after negotiating 10 hurdles over 400m would have seen her beat two runners in the women’s flat 400m final, raced just minutes beforehand. 
That race was won by two-time Olympic champion Miller-Uibo. 
Miller-Uibo, who was deprived of gold in Doha in 2019 by Salwa Eid Nasr of Bahrain — since banned from the Tokyo Games and these championships after three missed doping tests — timed a world lead of 49.11sec at Hayward Field. 
Marileidy Paulino of the Dominican Republic claimed silver in 49.60sec, with Sada Williams of Barbados taking bronze in a national record of 48.75. 
In the men’s event, Norman made up for a disappointing fifth-placed finish in Tokyo by winning gold in Eugene, charging to victory in 44.29 seconds for his first world crown. 
Former Olympic and world champion Kirani James of Grenada was runner-up while Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith held off Champion Allison to take the final podium place. 
“Last year was not a good year for me so I had to do a lot of hard work just to get back to where I was,” Norman said. “This moment is going to be remembered forever.” 
World record holder Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa, who set the record of 43.04sec when winning gold at the Rio Olympics, finished fifth in 44.97sec. 
Tokyo bronze medallist Kelsey-Lee Barber joined 400m runner Cathy Freeman as the only Australians to retain a world athletics title after defending her javelin crown with a world-leading throw of 66.91m. 
American Kara Winger (64.05) and Japan’s Haruka Kitaguchi (63.27) snatched silver and bronze with their last-round throws. 
Peru’s Kimberly Garcia Leon won the inaugural 35km women’s race walk in 2:39:16, a week after claiming her first world gold over 20km. 
Katarzyna Zdzieblo of Poland and China’s Qieyang Shijie also mirrored their results from the 20km race walk by finishing second and third.

Stand-in captain Shikhar Dhawan’s 97 was the foundation of his side’s total of 308 for seven which appeared to be more than enough at the halfway stage given that the hosts were just coming off a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of Bangladesh in Guyana a week earlier.
However, opener Kyle Mayers set the tone for the Caribbean side’s cha­se with a top-score of 75 and with the rest of the batting order making important contributions the West Indies reached the final over needing 15 runs for victory.
Romario Shepherd, playing only because former captain Jason Hol­der was ruled out with Covid 19 in the morning, and Akeal Hosein managed to scramble 11 against the bowling of seamer Mohammed Siraj as they finished agonisingly short at 305 for six.
Dhawan’s innings off 99 balls with three sixes and ten fours earned him the man-of-the-match award although the left-handed opener was not too pleased with his team’s effort in the field.
“We had a few nerves obviously towards the end of the match and maybe we didn’t stick to our plans as well as we should have because if we had done so, especially with a few runs given aw­ay on the leg-side, the game would have been ov­er as a contest earlier,” Dhawan said after the match.
Put in on a sweltering morning, he saw opening partner Shubman Gill (64) play most of the shots early on in a stand of 119 off 18 overs. Shreyas Iyer stroked his way to 54 before becoming the second wicket for Gudakesh Motie.
Motie had earlier dismissed Dhawan via an excellent diving catch by Shamarh Brooks at backward-point as India lost momentum when ominously poised at 213 for one in the 34th over.
Motie and fellow left-arm spinner Hosein were the most economical of the West Indies bowlers although pacer Alzarri Joseph bolstered the home side’s rearguard in the field with two important wickets.
“It’s a bittersweet feeling,” was West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran’s summary of the match.  “We’ve been talking about batting 50 overs and we did it this time but came up short. Still, we really competed well against one of the best teams in the world and we need to keep on improving against this type of opposition.”

Daryl Mitchell weighed in with a useful 32-ball 48 before James Neesham struck 23 off just six deliveries. Phillips was 56 not out as New Zealand chased down a target of 175 with an over to spare.
When Mitchell was caught and bowled by Josh Little, the Blackcaps were faltering at 147-4 with little more than three overs remaining.
But Phillips, who also made a match-winning fifty in the series opener, proved a thorn in Ireland’s side again before the big-hitting Neesham made sure of victory.
Ireland’s 174-6 featured veteran opener Paul Stirling’s 40, with the hosts’ total bolstered by Mark Adair’s smashed 37 off 15 balls and Curtis Campher’s 19 off eight.
Adair and Campher’s unbeaten stand of 58 from 23 deliveries gave Ireland, who have suffered agonising white-ball defeats by both India and New Zealand this season, hope of victory. But instead they suffered yet another loss to New Zealand, following a 3-0 reverse in the preceding ODI series.

Trott will take over for the tour of Ireland in August where the team will play five T20 Internationals ahead of the World Cup in Australia later this year.
“I’m honoured and excited to have the opportunity to take one of international cricket’s most exciting teams through what is a huge year for their development as a team,” Trott said.
The 41-year-old Trott, who played over 200 international matches for England, worked as a batting coach for the England team on their tour of India in 2021.
Former England batsman and assistant coach Thorpe fell seriously ill in May. 
He had accepted the job of Afghanistan head coach following his departure from the England set-up after a 4-0 defeat in the Ashes.
