A spokesman for the Sindh transport department said that the service was made active a couple of days ago through a new route initiated for Clifton and DHA areas. 
Initially, he said, the particular route was notified from the Defence Housing Authority and Clifton to Metropole Hotel on the intersection of Sharea Faisal. 
“However, keeping in view the public demand and need, it has been expanded to Numaish where it would connect with the Green Line terminal. The passengers can now travel from Numaish station to Seaview (McDonald) via Zaib un Nisa Street, Metropole, Teen Talwaar, Bilawal Chowrangi and Dolmen Mall,” he said.

1,Green bus ferries over 5.8m Karachiites in six months,Public response raises hopes that more such facilities can bring to an end the decades-old miseries of citizens of the beleaguered city.,"KARACHI: The people of Karachi, who have been yearning for a better transport service for nearly three decades, gave a ‘positive’ response to the Green Line bus service during its first six months of running as close to six million citizens have travelled through its dedicated corridor on 80 buses in the given period.  
The public response raised the hopes that more such facilities could multiply the number of travellers and bring to an end the decades-old miseries of citizens of this beleaguered city.  
The Green Line of the Bus Rapid Transit System is the first-ever public transport operation launched in the metropolis by the federal government after years.  
According to the official data, from the formal launch on January 10 till July 7 evening, a total of 5,811,570 passengers travelled on Green Line without any break.  
This shows on an average 968,595 people moved on 80 buses of the project every month as the officials say that the starting month of the project recorded 50,000 people travelling everyday which gradually came to 35,000 passengers daily.
“Since its launch, the service is on without any break and adding value to people’s comfort with each passing day,” said Abdul Aziz, general manager operations of the Sindh Infrastructure Development Company Ltd (SIDCL) — a public limited company to carry on the business of infrastructure development which is the builder and operator of the project.  
He also referred to a plan in the pipeline to add technology-based value to the service which would further help the commuters. It would be available soon within a month, he said.  
“Through this tech-based value addition, an app would be available for the passengers to pay their fare online and top up their prepaid cards from anywhere,” he added.  
Escalators, lifts ‘out of order’ 
The federal government funded public transport project despite off and on complaints about maintenance of its related services has been seen as a ‘blessing’ for the people mainly in district Central, who believe that the much-awaited scheme has finally started yielding results.  
However many commuters have complained that several escalators and lifts installed at the Green Line stations are out of order or not being run for various unknown reasons. “When the Green Line staff is asked why the escalator is off, they simply reply that it is out of order,” said one of the several commuters while speaking to Dawn.
“I get on the bus from Nagan Chowrangi and get off at Gurumandi [intersection],” said Sabeen Asif, a schoolteacher from North Karachi. “Before the Green Line, I along with other working women of my [residential] area had hired a private van for pick and drop. Most of us have now quit the van and availing the [Green Line] service. It’s good both, economically and for its comfort.”  
Around a million passengers every month are paying Rs15 to Rs55 for their respective destinations and enjoying the ride in an 18-metre-long bus that passes through 22 stations over 22-kilometre route from Surjani Town to Numaish.  
Envisaged and executed in February 2016 by then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the Green Line project was originally scheduled to complete in a year with an estimated cost of around Rs16.85 billion. However, it took almost six years to complete and the cost reached Rs35bn to finish the project. Almost after six years of its ground-breaking and after suffered many hiccups over the period incurring almost double the cost, the project formally began operation on Jan 10.  
With the launch of Green Line, however, a question remains about the effectiveness of the project, which is originally designed to be connected with the Sindh government-funded Orange Line Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) — the shortest route in all the five BRTS. With the arrival of 20 buses for the Orange Line from China, the authorities this time are hopeful that the service would be launched within next few weeks.  
“The infrastructure development work on the Orange Line is almost done and buses are already here. The test drive of these buses is going on over the track. The service will be launched anytime soon,” said a Sindh government official.

3,Murad asks people to stay home during rains to protect families,"Terms drowning of woman, infant son in Shadman Nullah ""unfortunate"".","KARACHI: Keeping in view the forecast of heavy rains in the metropolis from Sunday (today), Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Saturday visited different areas of the metropolis to inspect the repair works and cleanliness of major storm water drains.
He visited the KPT Nullah, Machhar Colony Nullah, Mahmoodabad Nullah, Picher Nullah as well as Urdu Bazaar, Burnes Road and other low-lying areas and gave necessary instructions to municipal officials.
Talking to media in Gulistan-i-Jauhar, he termed the drowning of a woman and her two-month-old son in Shadman Nullah ‘unfortunate’. 
“You know we are faced with natural calamity and in such a situation, people should avoid going out,” he said and added he was not defending the incident, but it was time to protect the children and other family members by preferring to stay home.”

Terms drowning of woman, infant son in Shadman Nullah ‘unfortunate’

“We, being the heads of our families, must protect our families in natural calamities like situation,” he said and expressed sympathy with the bereaved families.
Mr Shah brushed aside the impression that the local government department had failed to drain out rainwater. 
He said the rainwater was cleared when it had stopped raining and people of the city appreciated the government efforts. 
He said that the local governments of the city had made necessary arrangements and measures to meet any eventuality due to downpour.
The chief minister said that the Sindh government was keen to hold the local government elections, but the Election Commission of Pakistan had postponed them without their consent.
“This is a baseless and unfounded allegation that the PPP and its government in Sindh had got the local government elections postponed,” he said.
He claimed that the next mayor of the city would be from PPP. The party leadership would decide as to who would be made the city mayor, he added.
Regarding the election of Punjab chief minister, he said that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf was so scared of Asif Ali Zardari that they started crying foul when they see him meeting with political leaders.
“Had he [Zardari] indulged in horse-trading in Punjab, the PTI nominated candidate would not have bagged 186 votes. Therefore, the PTI leadership should apologise to Mr Zaradri.”

5,Japanese diplomat demonstrates culinary skills to friends,"KARACHI: There were two little frying pans and some chicken for the two delicacies, Chicken Tasuta Age and Chicken...","KARACHI: There were two little frying pans and some chicken for the two delicacies, Chicken Tasuta Age and Chicken Teriyaki, being cooked by none other than Katsunori Ashida, the Deputy Consul General of Japan, at the Japan Information and Culture Centre here on Saturday.  
The Deputy Consul General of Japan was demonstrating his culinary skills during the live Japanese cuisine cooking demonstration as part of the ‘Hamara Dostana’ celebrations to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Japan and the 20th anniversary of the establishment of Pakistan Japan Cultural Association (PJCA), Sindh.  
The diplomat started by cutting one portion of a couple of chicken thighs that he had de-boned already into bite-size pieces before marinating them in soy sauce and ginger garlic paste for the Chicken Tasuta Age. That done, he turned his attention to the other portion for making Chicken Teriyaki. He prepared the sauce by mixing soy sauce, sugar and honey before grilling the chicken on either side. And doing so, he apologetically announced that he was also supposed to coat the chicken with cornflour, which he forgot. Still he was careful not to repeat that mistake with the Chicken Tasuta Age.  
But what seemed more worrisome at that point was his packed audience and the two little frying pans and the small chicken portions. But reading everyone’s minds, Deputy Consul General Ashida smiled. “I was in the kitchen at 9am today to prepare 12 kilograms of chicken for you all,” he announced. And in preparing that chicken, he had not even forgotten the cornflour. Everyone was treated to a nice little feast then.  
Speaking to Dawn later, Deputy Consul General Ashida said that he had a spicy palate and liked several Pakistani delicacies such as siri paye and gol gappay but he hadn’t tried preparing these himself as yet.  
Earlier, while welcoming everyone to the demonstration, president of the PJCA Sadia Rashid spoke about the steadfast friendship enjoyed by Pakistan and Japan through these years. Speaking about the other hidden talents of the Deputy Consul General of Japan, she said that he is fluent in Urdu and Punjabi and loves to play several musical instruments as well as sing many Pakistani songs including the devotional ‘Dama Dam Mastt Qalandar’. “He loves and respects our culture and is here to spread the love by exchanging cultures,” she said.

7,PTI candidate moves SHC against postponement of LG polls,Petitioner says ECP is delaying the polls in connivance with MQM-P.,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf on Saturday filed a petition in the Sindh High Court challenging a notification of the Election Commission of Pakistan to postpone the second phase of local government elections earlier scheduled for July 24 in Sindh.
Senior PTI leader Ashraf Jabbar Qureshi, through his lawyer, moved the SHC stating that the ECP in connivance with the Pakistan Peoples Party and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan was delaying the LG elections with mala fide intentions as they were afraid of the PTI’s popularity.
The petitioner submitted that he was a candidate of the PTI for the post a union committee chairman in district Central and a few days before the polling day, provincial election commissioner had sent a letter to the ECP secretary to postpone the July 24 LG polls on account of forecasted thunderstorm and torrential rains in Karachi and Hyderabad.
Thereafter, he stated that the ECP issued a notification on July 20, postponing the second phase of the LG elections and fixed Aug 28 as the new date for polling.
He contended that ECP’s move to delay polls was also made in violation of the June 24 judgement of the SHC.
He maintained that a division bench of SHC had dismissed the petitions of the PTI and MQM-P seeking postponement of the LG election on June 24 and ruled that no case for staying the elections was made out by the petitioners.
He argued that during hearing the ECP had submitted that around 27,000 candidates were contesting and 30 million ballot papers had been printed and around Rs500 million spent and thus, polls could not be stayed.
Citing the ECP and Sindh chief secretary as respondents, the petitioner stated that if the upcoming elections were postponed due to weather forecast, the same should have been postponed for a week instead of more than a month, which will not only cause potential loss to the ECP for millions it had already spent but candidates are also facing huge losses as they invested their hard-earned money in contesting elections.
He submitted that the LG elections were already being held after an inordinate delay as the ECP was bound to hold elections within 120 days while the four-year tenure of the last elected local governments in Sindh had expired on Aug 30, 2020 and the delay in holding LG elections would prejudice the whole process.
The petitioner alleged that postponement was made to rig the LG elections and commit electoral fraud as there was no information where and under whose supervision printed ballot papers were being kept.
He pleaded to declare the impugned notification of the ECP illegal and sought directive for respondents to announce schedule of the LG elections by the end of this month or first week of August.
The petitioner also sought order for respondents to hand over the ballot papers to the court nazir or any person authorised by the court.

Speaking at a press conference here at the Karachi Press Club, they said the megacity generated more tax than any other city of Pakistan. 
They said that despite this Karachi was deprived of even basic civic facilities and was not getting funds proportionate to its bulging population.
Its parks, playgrounds, open spaces and plots for schools and colleges were an easy prey for the land mafia backed by local politicians. Its electricity supply system was given to an inexperienced private company plunging the megacity into darkness. Forty per cent of Karachi cannot get piped water and they had to get water through costly tankers, they added.
They said that the recent rains exposed the fragile drainage system of Karachi whose natural waterways and nullahs were either occupied by land-grabbers or filled with garbage.
They said that an efficient public transport entity, the Karachi Transport Corporation (KTC), was disbanded and the surface railway commuting system KCR was left in limbo. “Karachi is perhaps the only megacity of the world that is running without a proper public transport system for the last 50 years.”
They said more than 25 million citizens of Karachi are left at the mercy of private transporters. Health and education facilities are in shambles and the civic administration system almost non-functional. They said if a democratic and empowered local government system was given to the megacity it would need no other aid or package. 
They demanded that with consultation of the people an empowered democratic system is given to the people of the megacity to directly elect their mayor.

10,"PTI, PPP activists come to blows during protest in Hyderabad",HYDERABAD: Jubilant Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) activists and protesting workers of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI)...,"HYDERABAD: Jubilant Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) activists and protesting workers of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) came to blows at Hyder Chowk late on Friday night following controversial election of Hamza Shahbaz as Punjab chief minister.
PTI activists had gathered at Hyder Chowk in response to their party chairman Imran Khan’s directives to protest against ruling of Punjab Assembly’s deputy speaker. In the meantime, PPP activists also came there to celebrate victory of Hamza Shahbaz in which their party co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari had played a crucial role. 
On seeing each other, the charged workers started raising slogans against each other and soon came to blows. A contingent of baton-wielding plain clothed policemen who had already arrived there to avert such a situation tried to separate the two sides.
The workers of the two parties had started assembling there at around 11pm and their numbers increased and sloganeering intensified as time passed. They traded hot words and in the meantime PTI activists surrounded Asfand Mari, a candidate of UC-28 and divisional general secretary of Peoples Students Federation, which turned up the heat. As the situation began to take ugly turn, more policemen arrived at the roundabout to disperse and keep activists of the two sides at a safe distance from each other.
Police closed all the roads leading to Hyder Chowk to stop more people from coming to the area. Luckily no one was seriously hurt in the clash. DSP Shakil Solangi suffered a minor injury to his forehead when he was trying to avert a scuffle. Some angry activists attempted to torch a motorcycle but failed.
Police finally dispersed the activists in different directions. PTI activists were forced to move towards Society Chowk and PPP activists were pushed towards Old Campus area to stop the clash. 
PTI activists also gathered outside local press club to lodge their protest against the deputy speaker’s ruling.
PPP Sindh information secretary Aajiz Dhamrah, district information secretary Ehsan Abro, MPA Abdul Jabbar Khan and Fayyaz Shah also rushed to Hyder Chowk after hearing news about the clash.
Dhamrah told journalists that PTI leadership must understand that ‘ek Zardari sub pe bhari’ slogan would haunt it forever. He had sympathy with PTI youths who were being misguided, he said. PPP activists were peaceful and they faced aggression from PTI cadre, he said.
Meanwhile, Asfand Mari lodged a case (45/22) at City police station under Sections 147, 148, 149, 506, 427 and 324 against PTI divisional president and candidate for UC-97 Dr Mustansir Billah, UC-110 Latifabad vice chairman’s candidate Jamshed Ali Shaikh, Kaleem Jafri, Shahid Khan Sherry, Kashif and Shahid.
PPP district president Saghir Qureshi, general secretary Ali Mohammad Sahito and information secretary Ehsan Abro condemned attack on Asfand Mari in their joint statement and said that PPP activists would stop PTI at all cost whenever it tried to cause provocation.
They said that FIR had been lodged against suspects but police had not made any arrest.

The chamber’s president Altaf Memon said in a statement issued here on Saturday that political instability had weakened foundations of the country’s economy and exacerbated economic unrest.
He said that dollar’s exchange rate increased by Rs8 within a day due to involvement of bookies but there was no clear policy in sight to control this situation. 
He said that according to Asian Development Bank (ADB) report on January-June outlook, price hike in the country had increased by 12pc to 21pc within six months. It was the highest in Asia after Sri Lanka, which was witnessing 45pc of price hike and rendered Sri Lanka’s state bank bankrupt. India had 7pc, Bangladesh 7.4pc and China had 2.5pc price hike, he said, adding the situation indicated Pakistan was heading for a default.
He demanded that economic emergency should be declared to rid the country of price hike. The federal government should appoint governor to the State Bank of Pakistan so that he could impose economic emergency and take measures in time.
He said the government should not link economy’s revival with political instability that was currently witnessed. If the government did not take timely decisions then Pakistan would face Sri Lanka like conditions and might face default, he warned.
