3,AJK PM criticises proposed tourism body critics,Says the tourism authority would help AJK get worldwide recognition.,"MUZAFFARABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas on Saturday came down hard upon the critics of a proposed tourism promotion body, terming them antagonists of development and prosperity of the state.
Early this week, reports emerged that the government was contemplating establishing a “tourism authority” and “special tourism zone(s)” through an amended piece of legislation that would override some other laws or their provisions, including the decades-old forest protection regulations and the law governing mineral extraction.
Though the bill was not tabled in the recently prorogued Legislative Assembly session but it drew scathing criticism from opposition leaders Shah Ghulam Qadir, Raja Farooq Haider and Chaudhry Tariq Farooq from Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Chaudhry Latif Akbar from Pakistan Peoples Party, apart from civil society activists.
However, in a categorical contradiction of the concerns and apprehensions in a statement, PM Ilyas maintained that only those could oppose the [establishment of] tourism authority “who were inimical to the progress and prosperity of the state”.
“The real development and prosperity of the liberated territory hingeson proper exploitation of our rich potential in tourism, hydropower generation and information technology (IT) sectors. The more these sectors are strengthened, the more their benefits will pass on to a common man,” he said.
“This requires a non-traditional approach and modern steps butironically some professional [politicians] do not want to see the people of the state prosperous. Rather they want the people to remain dependent on them and their personal fortunes swelled through the prevailing practice of dubious development schemes,” PM Ilyas said, adding that, “however times have changed and the successors [followers] of Imran Khan have assumed office [in AJK] to serve the people of the state”.
“We are neither here to practice traditional politics nor disappoint people. In fact we have been returned for the service of people and we will never let them down,” he said.
Asserting that the tourism authority would help AJK get worldwide introduction and recognition as the most fascinating tourism site, Mr Ilyas said the sector would offer equal opportunities and facilities to local people and investors from any other part of the country.
“Those who are raisinghue and cry over the [formation of]tourism authority should come forward and not only make investment in this sector themselves but also persuade others to do so,” he said, warning that “the development of the state could not be impeded by pedaling negative propaganda”. He said apart from tourism, the laws governing the hydropower generation and IT sectors would also see some drastic improvement in the near future.
“We have appreciated whatever good job was done by our predecessors. And we want them to reciprocate whatever good we are doing and intend to do, rather than mudslinging to gain political mileage,” the AJK premier said.

6,Federal govt seeks foreign investment for Ring Road project,"Punjab still hasn’t appointed consultant to conduct third-party validation of optimal route, official says.","RAWALPINDI: The federal government is seeking foreign investors for the Rawalpindi Ring Road and Economic Corridor project while Punjab government has failed to appoint a consultant to conduct a third-party validation for determination of an optimal route for the corridor.
A senior official of the Punjab Planning and Development Department told Dawn that after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to UAE, the federal government had enlisted five main projects to fetch foreign investment.
These projects are: Parco coastal refinery Phase-I oil import terminal, Kharian-Rawalpindi Motorway, Rawalpindi Ring Road, Karachi Circular Railway and Rail Connectivity of Thar Block-II with railway network.
He said the government wanted to involve foreign investment instead of executing the mega Ring Road project under the annual development programme (ADP) or through local investors.

Punjab still hasn’t appointed consultant to conduct third-party validation of optimal route, says official

“As it is a key project, foreign investment is necessary so that they (foreigners) could build, operate and transfer it like the Lahore-Islamabad Motorway project,” he said.
The official said on the directives of the federal government, the Punjab government had asked the RDA to appoint a focal person so he would contact the federal government and Foreign Office for the project.
Upon this, he said, Commissioner Noorul Amin Mengal appointed RDA Chief Engineer Dr Habibul Haq Randhawa as the focal person.
On the other hand, after a new inquiry report on the Ring Road scandal, which came to light during the tenure of PTI government, the provincial government has not yet decided to restore any of the alignments made in 2020 and 2021.
As per the alignment of 2021, the Rs64 billion road was 66.3 kilometres long from Radio Pakistan Rawat to Thalian and from Thalian to Sangjani.
However, the previous PTI government canceled the alignment and formed a new alignment from Rawat to the motorway measuring 38 km. 
In March 19, the then prime minister Imran Khan inaugurated the project and awarded the contract to Frontier Works Organisation (FWO).
In the new alignment, the Ring Road would be a 38.3-km-long controlled access road which would originate at National Highway (N-5) at Baanth, cross through Chakbeli Road, Adiala Road, Chakri Road and terminate at M-2 at Thallian Interchange.
The total cost of the project was Rs33.7 billion - Rs27 billion for construction and Rs6.7 billion for the acquisition of land.
After quashing the alleged corruption charges against former commissioner Mohammad Mehmood, the Establishment Division last weekdirected the Punjab government to conduct a third-party validation for determination of the optimal route for the project.
A senior official of RDA told Dawn that there were two issues: “One is which alignment will be functional and second the previous government of PTI had awarded the contract to FWO and it has not been canceled.”
He said though the federal government had asked the provincial authority to revive the old alignment canceled in April 2021, no decision was made yet in this regard.
On the other hand, sources said foreign investors would not accept the route of the Ring Road and would choose their own plan after conducting a survey of the area.
When contacted, a spokesman for the RDA said work on Ring Road and Leh Expressway was under progress and the government would make necessary decisions in this regard soon.

7,"CDA to acquire 20 more buses for Blue, Green metro lines","Around 5,800 and 6,000 passengers are commuting on 8 buses each plying on the Blue and Green lines, respectively, daily.","ISLAMABAD: Two weeks after the inauguration, 5,800 and 6,000 passengers were commuting on eight buses each plying on the Blue and Green lines, respectively, on a daily basis.
Due to the high passenger load on both the lines, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has decided to acquire 20 more buses within a week.
The decision was taken during a visit of CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed to various routes and stops of the metro bus services.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif inaugurated the Green and Blue line metro bus services on July 7.
Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister had said the metro bus service would be a gift for the residents of the twin cities and would serve the common man, students and workers.
He had also directed expansion of both the bus services in the coming years.
The Green Line starts from Bhara Kahu and culminates at Pims stop. The passengers disembark outside the hospital to catch the Red Line (Rawalpindi-Islamabad metro) for travelling to other parts of the city.
The Blue Line operates from Koral to Pims. Initially, these two metros are being run as non-stop services until the bus stations on the routes are constructed.
According to the CDA, work on the construction of the bus stations for both lines is underway and will be completed by Aug 14. Both the Green and Blue lines are being run in mix traffic on existing roads and in future the CDA will construct designated corridors for them.
During the visit, Mr Ahmed was informed that currently eight buses with 5,800 passengers were plying daily on the Blue Line and 6,000 passengers on the Green Line.
Keeping in view the high passenger load, it was decided that 20 additional buses would be acquired within one week. According to a statement, this will facilitate residents of Bhara Kahu and Koral.
Later, the CDA chairman and officers boarded an Orange Line bus from N5 station to the G-13 station. During the visit, the chairman appreciated the work carried out by the horticulture department along the metro track. Special directions were issued to the concerned formations to ensure facilitation to differently-able passengers at the bus stops.
Prime Minister Sharif in April this year inaugurated the Orange Line from Peshawar Mor to the Islamabad International Airport.
According to a survey conducted by the CDA in May, around 11,464 passengers traveled daily on the Orange Line. Moreover, Faiz Ahmed Faiz junction in H-9, which was included later to facilitate students, has been observed as the busiest one.

8,Rains damage G.T. Road’s Taxila-Wah section,TAXILA: The recent rains have turned the Taxila-Wah section of G.T. Road into shambles as major cracks and potholes...,"


 
TAXILA: The recent rains have turned the Taxila-Wah section of G.T. Road into shambles as major cracks and potholes have appeared on it due to accumulation of rainwater.
The dilapidated road from Margalla Hills to Wah Garden bridge has become a nightmare for motorists as well as residents.
The Taxila section of the road is of great geo-strategic significance as its one end touches the federal capital and the the other is the gateway to northern areas.
“The shaky movement of long and heavily loaded vehicles carrying sand and stone crush as well as cement and factory goods on the bumpy road poses great threat to commuters,” said Syed Zaheer Shah Zaildar, a local social and public figure.
He criticised the NHA over poor maintenance of the road despite collecting large sums of toll tax.
“With so many potholes on the G.T. Road, travelling is not only problematic but dangerous too,” said a local transporter, Waheed Shah. He said motorists and transporters had demanded the re-surfacing of G.T. Road from Margalla Hills to Wah Garden bridge as the present condition of the road was costing them heavily in terms of wear and tear.
He said hundreds of light and heavy vehicles used G.T. Road in the region but it wasn’t maintained by the NHA, so it had developed potholes and cracks at several points.
According to Malik Nisar Khan, chairman Dumpers’ Association, said the poor condition of road was one of the major causes of accidents on the Taxila-Wah section. 
There are potholes on the road. He said the government earned a huge sum in the shape of toll collection and money collected through weigh stations and traffic challan by the motorway police but the commuters were not being extended any relief, especially in the shape of better road structure.
Malik Saeed Siddiqui, a social and public figure, said that near Sarai Kala bridge, there was no proper drainage system and hence the drains got clogged and the rainwater accumulated on the road aggravated its condition.
He said that due to the poor road engineering and paucity of proper maintenance, many fatal accidents had occurred on the road.
When contacted, an official of the directorate of maintenance, National Highway Authority (NHA) Rawalpindi, said funds for the maintenance of the road had been allocated in the current fiscal year and work would begin after floating tenders and awarding the contract soon.
