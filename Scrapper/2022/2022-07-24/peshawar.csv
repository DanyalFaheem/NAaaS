6,Man acquitted in policeman murder case,PESHAWAR: A local court has acquitted a man charged with killing a police constable in Sarband area here around four...,"PESHAWAR: A local court has acquitted a man charged with killing a police constable in Sarband area here around four years ago.
Additional district and sessions judge Aurangzeb Khan ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove the charge against the accused, Tahir, a resident of Sarband, while the evidence available on record didn’t connect him with the commission of the offence.
The accused was arrested for killing policemen Ahmad Ali, who also lived in his village, on June 7, 2018.
A brother of the deceased had lodged an FIR with the police under sections 302, 324 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Shabbir Hussain Gigyani, lawyer for the accused, said the complainant had claimed that his brother, Ahmad Ali, was driving a car and he was sitting with him in the back seat, when an altercation took place between him and the accused.
He said the complainant alleged that his client had fired at his brother killing him immediately.
The counsel said the complainant claimed to be a witness to the murder, but in fact he was not present there.
He argued that first it was beyond comprehension why would be the complainant sitting in the back seat of the vehicle along with his brother when the front seat was vacant.
The lawyer contended that the hospital record also showed that the complainant had not taken there rather some other relatives of the deceased were in the hospital.
He added that if the complainant was a witness, he would have taken his brother to the hospital and not by others.
The counsel argued that his client had faced trial for over three years during which the prosecution failed to prove that its version of the occurrence was correct.
He added that the statements of the prosecution witnesses were in conflict with each other as well as with the medical evidence.

Addressing a meeting of the party’s central and provincial office-bearers here, he said calling general elections was not the solution to the prevailing crisis, adding the government should complete its tenure to stabilise the economy.
However, he said besides reviving the economy the government should give relief to the people as they were facing rising inflation and joblessness.
Criticising former prime minister Imran Khan, he said the country would have gone bankrupt had he been in power.
He held Imran Khan responsible for plunging the country into political and economic turmoil, saying he violated the agreement reached with the International Monetary Fund.
“Imran Khan lowered the prices of petroleum products and electricity tariff after realising that he was going to be ousted from power through the no-trust motion,” he recalled.
Aftab Sherpao said though the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf won 15 seats in the Punjab by-election, Imran Khan did not relent in his criticism of the Election Commission of Pakistan and kept putting pressure on the election watchdog.
“The ECP has reserved its verdict in the foreign funding case of the PTI, so Imran Khan is exerting pressure on the chief election commissioner in a bid to make him controversial,” he said.
The QWP leader said Imran Khan used the resources of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to promote his political interests. 
He also expressed concern over the worsening law and order in former Fata.
Talking about the party affairs, he asked the participants of the meeting to reorganise the party at the grassroots level by mobilising the workers.
A resolution was passed asking the Sindh government to protect the life and property of Pakhtuns living in the province. It condemned the ransacking of hotels of Pakhtuns in Hyderabad.

10,Typhoid vaccine to be part of routine immunisation,Medics say children will be given TVC shots during Oct in 22 districts...,"PESHAWAR: The health department has planned to make typhoid conjugate vaccine (TVC) part of the routine immunisation to prevent the outbreak of the bacterial infection in the province.
The plan was discussed during the maiden meeting of the ‘steering committee for TVC immunisation’ here on Saturday amid the Pakistan Paediatric Association’s claims that more children are infected with and killed by typhoid fever than adults every year.
Health secretary Amir Sultan Tareen chaired the meeting, where director-general (health services) Dr Shaheen Afridi, director of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation Dr Mohammad Arif Khan, director (public health) Dr Nekdad Afridi, Prof Sabir Khan of the Pakistan Paediatric Association’s provincial chapter and representatives of the World Health Organisation and United Nations Children’s Fund were also in attendance.
It decided that the children aged from nine month to 15 years would be given TVC jabs in the province during a special campaign from Oct 3 to Oct 15.

Medics say children will be given TVC shots during Oct in 22 districts

The drive will be carried out in 22 districts after which the TVC will be included in the routine immunisation programme of the health department.
“The decision has been taken in view of the reports from the hospitals that an outbreak of extensively drug-resistant typhoid was in progress throughout the province. The disease doesn’t respond to most antibiotics,” an official told Dawn.
According to them, unsanitary conditions, lack of proper waste disposal, contamination of water by sewage, shortage of clean drinking water and public awareness were the main causes of rise in cases of typhoid fever.
Besides vaccination, health department has also asked concerned departments to ensure that sewerage and drinking water lines must not be close to each other and shall be away to prevent mixing of both. Moreover, safety measures in hotels and restaurants were also important as the infected waiters and cooks who are chronic carriers, are one of the cause of spreading the disease.
Last month, the health department wrote a letter to the Peshawar Development Authority and Public Health Engineering Department to ensure clean during water after outbreak of typhoid in Phase 3 Hayatabad and Tajabad locality.
The letter sent by health department cited the detection of cases due to possible contamination of drinking water or food. It said that an outbreak of XDR typhoid had also occurred in the same locality In March 2021 with numerous cases reported to the former.
To prevent potential epidemic of water-borne diseases including typhoid fever, acute watery diarrhea and hepatitis A and B, the department recommended that prompt actions be initiated by starting from collection of water samples to assess the quality of drinking water and if required, an extensive sanitary survey may be initiated followed by mass chlorination campaign of the relevant public water supply systems and household water storage facilities to save the community from the ailments.
Additionally, the source of water for washing vegetables, fruits and ice shops may also be checked for water quality in the localities, the letter said.
Officials said they had also issued letter to all district officers and medical superintendents to send samples for diagnosis of typhoid fever to the public health reference labs.
The PPA’s focal person for immunisation, Prof Sabir Khan, toldDawnthat typhoid spread through fecal–oral route and therefore, drinking water and safe disposal of excreta were prerequisite for its control and prevention.
“In 2017, 63 per cent of typhoid cases and 70 per cent of deaths in Pakistan were registered among children under 15 years of age. TCV can be given to children as young as six months of age and gives long-term protection against typhoid,” he said.
Prof Sabir said TCV had already been introduced into routine immunisation in Sindh and Punjab provinces.
“We [PPA] have been collaborating with the health department to promote immunisation for all ailments in the province,” he said.

11,Alarm as groundwater depletes in Mingora,"Experts complain of climate change, tree felling, drilling of borewells...","SWAT: Groundwater depletion in Mingora and its suburbs has set alarm bells ringing for around 0.6 million residents of the major financial hub of Swat district.
Though home to the Swat River and hundreds of streams and springs, the lowland has been facing water crisis for a few years.
The experts blame the problem on climate change, rising population, deforestation and drilling of borewells as well as the drying of springs and streams.
According to chief executive officer of the Water and Sanitation Services Company Mingora, Swat, Shaida Mohammad, Mingora requires around 12 million gallons of water but the WSSC’s tubewells produce around 8.5 million gallons of water.

Experts complain of climate change, tree felling, drilling of borewells

“Alarmingly, groundwater in Mingora has depleted by more than 40 feet during the last five years causing serious shortages,” he told Dawn. He said the company had detected the issue after beginning operations four years ago.
Mr Mohammad said the issue might have been there for years but the relevant data was unavailable as the WSSC Swat was established in 2018.
He said the provincial government had approved the drought emergency response project under which a pipeline would be laid to address water shortages in Rang Mohallah, Gumbat Maira, Khwajabad, Shahabnagar and other areas.
Experts say the Swat River water gravity scheme promises smooth water supply to Mingora.
“In 2007, the MMA government had approved a water gravity scheme for Mingora but unfortunately it could not be implemented and the water shortage issue increased every year due to rapid increase of population,” said civil society member Fayaz Zafar.
He said Mingora was a major financial hub, where people come from other parts of Swat as well as Shangla, Dir, Bajaur, Buner and adjoining areas for work.
Resident Amjad Ali said climate change had also contributed to the decrease in underground levels.
“Two large streams run through Mingora, one from Marghuzar and the other from Jambil valley. Besides, there are also hundreds of springs around this area, which used to fulfil local water needs. However, the streams and springs have dried up, so the people depend on groundwater for use,” said civil society activist Amjad Ali.
Resident Zahir Ali insisted that the growing drilling of boreholes was causing groundwater depletion.
The people demanded an early execution of the water gravity project to resolve water issues in Mingora and surrounding areas.
