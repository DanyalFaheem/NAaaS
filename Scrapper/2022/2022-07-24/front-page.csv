• Bench says AG, Mazari’s counsel unable to defend impugned ruling
LAHORE: The Supreme Court on Saturday provisionally allowed Hamza Shehbaz to continue as a “trustee” chief minister of Punjab with limited powers, as it observed that the ruling of the Punjab Assembly’s deputy speaker regarding rejection of votes of all Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) lawmakers in the run-off election for the CM was prima facie in violation of the court’s judgement and Article 63-A of the Constitution.
A three-judge bench of the SC, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, assembled at the court’s Lahore registry at 11am to take up a petition hurriedly filed on Friday midnight by Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, a candidate for the CM’s office against Hamza, against the ruling of Deputy Speaker Dost Muhammad Mazari. Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar were the other members of the bench.
At the outset of the hearing, PTI senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, on behalf of Mr Elahi, explained to the bench the CM’s election held in light of the Supreme Court’s judgement passed on July 1 interpreting Article 63A of the Constitution on a presidential reference. The counsel also read out the ruling of the deputy speaker to the bench.
CJP Bandial observed that the views expressed by Mr Mazari, while giving the impugned ruling, did not pinpoint to the exact observation made by the SC in its judgement. He further observed that the issue more likely seemed to be a controversy regarding the proper understanding or comprehension of the statement of law in the judgement rather than an interpretation of a constitutional provision.
Before rising for a break, the bench sought personal appearance of the deputy speaker along with the record of the election proceedings. The bench also issued notices to the chief minister, Punjab advocate general and an additional attorney general, as it was told that Attorney General for Pakistan Ashtar Asuaf Ali was out of the country.
However, when the bench resumed its hearing at 2:30pm, senior advocate Irfan Qadir appeared on behalf of the deputy speaker. The counsel argued that Mazari might have understood that the leader of a political party was considered its parliamentary leader as well.
Mr Qadir said he had been engaged only two hours ago and needed time to seek further instructions from his client to prepare his brief.
The bench, however, observed that the deputy speaker was apparently mistaken in his understanding.
Justice Ahsan noted that according to democratic traditions, a parliamentary leader of a party decided as to who should be supported in an election in the assembly. The party’s head could only initiate a disqualification process against its members for deviating from the instructions of the parliamentary leader of the party, he added.
In its written order of the hearing, the bench observed: “To our mind the constitutional provisions and our interpretation thereof in paragraph-3 of the short judgement, are clear in treating the direction of the parliamentary party to be binding on members of the parliamentary party in the case where vote is to be cast, inter alia, for election to the office of chief minister.”
However, it said, the deputy speaker treated the direction by the party head to be binding on the legislators in the case of an election of the CM in terms of Article 63A.
Punjab Advocate General (AG) Shahzad Shaukat argued that the matter should be clubbed with the already pending appeals of the MPAs de-seated for defecting in the previous election for the chief minister held on April 16.
The bench said the AG and the deputy speaker’s counsel were not able to defend the impugned ruling, while the counsel for the chief minister did not come forward to answer the queries either.
The bench observed that the respondents’ counsel were unable to justify the impugned ruling of the deputy speaker, therefore, the status of the chief minister was under a cloud. In such a situation, Hamza Shehbaz could not be deemed a duly elected chief minister under the Constitution, it added.
However, the bench allowed Hamza to perform his duties as a “trustee” holding the office of the CM till a decision in the matter, and his cabinet would exercise the powers and functions strictly in fiduciary capacity as envisaged in the Constitution.
The bench granted time to the lawyers of the respondents to file written replies to the petition by July 25 along with a record of the election process. It also summoned the letter of PML-Q president Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain on the basis of which the deputy speaker passed the impugned ruling. The next hearing will be held in Islamabad on Monday.
The bench heard the arguments of the lawyers through a video link as courtroom No 1 was packed to capacity by leaders of the PML-Q and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in addition to the lawyers who had come to observe the proceedings.
‘Enough is enough’
Reacting to the court order, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz, in a strongly worded series of tweets, questioned the composition of the bench. She said particular decisions had been issued repeatedly by benches composed of the same judges under pressure from a particular political party. She wondered if the benches negated their own previously issued decisions apparently to benefit one side.
“Do not expect that we will bow down before such biased decisions. Enough is enough,” Ms Nawaz tweeted.
She further said the current political turmoil in the country was a result of a Supreme Court judgement wherein it was interpreted that votes cast of free will would not be counted.
“Now a new interpretation is being made only to benefit the blue-eyed who has already been benefited with the previous interpretation,” she said without naming former prime minister Imran Khan.
Moreover, PML-N secretary general and federal minister Ahsan Iqbal tweeted: “The way things are going, some people are asking whether the judiciary should be asked to take full responsibility for managing the economy & economic consequences of its decisions. The damage started with Panama Saga.”
In another tweet, he condemned the PTI for taking a U-turn by challenging the ruling of the deputy speaker before the court.
In the recent past, the PTI had taken a plea that a speaker’s ruling could not be challenged before courts, he said, referring to the ruling of the former deputy speaker of the National Assembly rejecting a vote of no-confidence against then prime minister Imran Khan.
Punjab minister Attaullah Tarar also said in a tweet that people were questioning the inclusion of Justice Ijazul Ahsan in every bench hearing cases related to the PML-N. “How can I answer this question?” he added.

1,Coalition seeks ‘full court wisdom’ on CM poll plea,"Joint statement says Imran ‘creating chaos’ to avoid accountability, hide corruption, and regain power through covert means.","ISLAMABAD: Following in the footsteps of its main rival, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the ruling coalition has also started exerting pressure on state institutions, and vowed to fight the “darkness of fascism”.
On the other hand, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Vice President Maryam Nawaz claimed the “Constitution was being interpreted to benefit PTI Chairman Imran Khan”.
The ruling alliance, on Saturday, issued a declaration, demanding the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) constitute a full court of the Supreme Court to hear the petition against the Punjab chief minister’s election, calling it “an important national, political and constitutional matter”.
Editorial: Dost Mazari's ruling may buy Hamza more time but it has only worsened political instability
The declaration stated that the Constitution had drawn a clear line of authority between the legislature, judiciary, and the administration, which an “arrogant, anti-constitution and fascist” person was trying to erase.

Joint statement says Imran ‘creating chaos’ to avoid accountability, hide corruption, and regain power through covert means

The component parties of the ruling coalition, including the PML-N, PPP, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), Muttahida Qaumi Movement and Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) among others, said in the declaration that they would not compromise on the Constitution, democracy, and the right of the people to rule.
“All the coalition parties will move forward together on every platform and in every field to eradicate the darkness of fascism,” the document said.
The joint statement said former premier Imran Khan was repeatedly creating chaos in politics to avoid accountability, conceal his corruption and regain power through covert means. “He (Imran) wants the system as well as the economy to go bankrupt,” it alleged.
The ruling parties said Mr Khan’s mentality and behaviour were proving detrimental to the affairs of the state.
Moreover, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah in a statement said “courts’ decisions are like open books” for the people. He said the current political crisis had emerged after 25 votes polled in favour of the ruling coalition were rejected in the last election for the Punjab chief minister in April.
Also, Punjab Home Minister Ataullah Tarar said the formation of a full court had now become all the more necessary in view of the constitutional crisis prevailing in the country’s most populous province for the last several months.
PPP leader and federal Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman remarked that Friday’s chief minister’s election was in line with the Supreme Court’s decision.
“Imran Khan is challenging the elections, but on what basis? Why is PTI forgetting that it was them that had gone to the Supreme Court with a presidential reference filed by President Arif Alvi in May to seek the interpretation of Article 63A, after which the SC decided that votes of dissident members of parliament would not be counted,” she added.
She said Imran Khan, ever-popular for his U-turns, was now at the SC’s doorstep asking it to reinterpret Article 63A. “This isn’t some back-and-forth game Imran Khan should be allowed to play. There is hope that a full bench of the Supreme Court will interpret this constitutional issue. It is hypocritical of the PTI now when the votes of 10 members of PML-Q have been rejected, to create uproar for the same decision taken during May this year. Imran Khan’s job, it seems, is to protect his power and serve his unbridled narcissism,” she lashed out, adding that in April, as the party chairman, he had directed Punjab MPAs to vote for Parvez Elahi. 
Now, they could not suddenly say the head of the parliamentary party got to decide who the members voted for, she added.

2,‘Criticism of institutions’ was final straw for Shujaat,"PML-Q chief insists Elahi remains ""his man"" for Punjab CM slot, just not as a PTI-backed candidate.","LAHORE: Pakistan Muslim League (PML-Q) President Chau­dhry Shujaat Hussain, the man whose letter supposedly turned the tide of the Punjab chief minister’s election, went on record with his reason for opposing the PTI-backed candidature of his cousin, Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, saying he could not support “anyone who criticised state institutions”.
He clarified that while Elahi “was, is and would remain” his candidate for the office of chief minister, he (Shujaat) could not allow him to become “the nominee of PTI”.
Chaudhry Shujaat cited this reason for his opposition to PTI backing for Elahi in a series of tweets that were shared from Mr Shujaat’s official Twitter account.
Parvez Elahi’s son, Moonis, confirmed that the account does indeed belong to the PML-Q chief and is operated by his  son, Chaudhry Salik Hussain.

PML-Q chief insists Elahi remains ‘his man’ for CM slot, just not as a PTI-backed candidate

In his tweets, Chaudhry Shujaat wrote: “I cannot support anyone criticising state institutions because he [Shujaat] has cordial relations with the institutions for the past three decades. The state institutions guarantee stability in Pakistan.”
Moonis Elahi, however, claimed that Chaudhry Shujaat was under “immense pressure” and he politely refused to support Parvez Elahi as a candidate of Imran Khan.
Speaking to media persons after his bail hearing on Saturday, when asked to elaborate as to what kind of pressure was being exerted on Chaudhry Shujaat, Moonis said the reporters should put this question to Chaudhry Shujaat.
Moonis said he had gone to see Shujaat Hussain and asked whether he had written the letter on which he replied that he did.
“I have instructed the PML-Q MPAs not to vote anyone in the chief minister’s election being held in Punjab Assembly,” he quoted Chaudhry Shujaat as saying.

As Moonis contested that he [Chaudhry Shujaat] wanted Parvez Elahi not to win, the latter stated that Elahi should become the chief minister, but not as a candidate of Imran Khan. “But when I told him that in such a situation Parvez Elahi will lose the election, the PML-Q president kept mum,” Moonis stated.
It may be mentioned that Chaudhry Shujaat’s letter addressed to Punjab Assembly’s deputy speaker / presiding officer on the election day states that PML-Q president had instructed all 10 MPAs of the party, including CM candidate Parvez Elahi, “to poll their votes in favour of Muhammad Hamza Shehbaz Sharif”.
The letter also carried copies of PML-Q president’s directions to party’s 10 MPAs issued on the election day. However, none of these letters have been shared with the media thus far.
In his tweets, Shujaat Hussain suggested that all political leaders should subordinate their personal interests to the national interests so that the country could come out of the quagmire of crises. Otherwise, he said, the country would further be “divided into ideologies” and become “prey in the hands of people working for their vested interests”. He said the country was already facing a critical situation.
Referring to confrontation within the house of Chaudhrys of Gujrat, Shujaat Hussain said political conflict should not be confused with personal disagreement and stressed that all should stop politics of confrontation and work for the betterment of country and its security and well-being.
“Anyone who gets a chance to rule, should contact political opponents and jointly work for the security and stability of the country,” the PML-Q president concluded.
In a related development, Chaudhry Shujaat had a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday to discuss the political situation after the chief minister’s election.
Sources say this late-night meeting had decided that Hamza Shehbaz should not take oath as CM late in the night and do so in the morning. Sources claimed the meeting was of the view that the case against the deputy speaker’s ruling might be stretched to several dates.

3,Imran opposes ‘sale’ of national assets,"A day earlier, the cabinet approved an ordinance pertaining to the sale of national assets in a bid to overcome economic crisis.","ISLAMABAD: A day after the federal cabinet approved an ordinance pertaining to the sale of national assets in a bid to overcome the economic crisis faced by the country, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan opposed the legislation and said the “thieves” should not be allowed to sell the assets.
On his Twitter account, the former prime minister said: “How can imported government brought to power through US conspiracy, led by ‘crime minister’, whose family along with Zardari have volumes written on their corruption, be trusted with the sale of national assets and that too through bypassing all procedural and legal checks.”
“These people have been plundering Pakistan for the last 30 years and are now responsible for the present economic meltdown. These thieves should never be allowed to sell our national assets in the devious manner they are attempting. The nation will never trust them with our national assets,” the PTI chief further said.

 





 
The remarks by the former premier came a day after the federal cabinet gave its nod to a law proposed by the Cabinet Committee on the Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions to sell stakes of oil and gas companies and government-owned power plants to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other countries. 
As per the ordinance, courts will not be able to entertain petitions against the sale of assets and shares of state-owned companies to foreign countries.
A source in the government said that the proposed law will be tabled in parliament for approval as it rejected the claim made by Mr Khan that the proposed law will allow the government to sell any asset of the country without following the laid down procedure. The source said, “No asset will be sold without the approval of the cabinet.”
Defending the proposed legislation, the source said except for one deal, not a single agreement inked by Pakistan with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar materialised during the past five years as foreign states were not ready to invest through the Privatisation Commission.
Under the proposed law, foreign states will be able to invest directly in state-owned entities. “This would improve management of these entities, as the said states would bring efficient management to run these enterprises,” the source added.
Ordinance for sale of assets
The proposed law will provide for a mechanism to carry out a commercial transaction under an inter-governmental framework agreement to promote, attract and encourage foreign states to have economic and business relations with Pakistan, according to the documents.
The scope of the law will be expanded to all “commercial transactions” including sale, purchase, investment, divestment, procurement, licensing, lease, joint ventures, assignments, concessions, services contracts, management contracts or other deals arising out of a G2G (government-to-government) or commercial agreement, the documents added.

4,Situationer: Cosying up to establishment proved ‘kiss of death’ for PML-N,"Nawaz seeks to ""return party to former glory""; Maryam may be given key leadership role in upcoming reshuffle.","Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) chastening defeat in the Punjab by-polls has forced the party to rethink its strategy and narrative for reviving its political fortunes, and a major leadership reshuffle is expected in the coming days.
PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif has, over the past few days, held extensive consultations with senior party leaders on the reasons behind the Punjab debacle and is said to have concluded that it was the result of the absence of effective leadership and the abandonment of his trademark ‘anti-establishment narrative’.
“The elder Sharif believes that the pro-establishment stance adopted by the party was the kiss of death,” a party leader who had spoken to Nawaz recently, told Dawn.

While the leadership reshuffle is expected to take place in coming weeks, there are already hints that the party is shifting gears and trying to reclaim the anti-establishment narrative, which its leaders strongly feel has been successfully taken over by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).

Nawaz seeks to ‘return party to former glory’; Maryam may be given key leadership role in upcoming reshuffle

Statements by Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who was once seen as Nawaz Sharif’s heir apparent, are already pointing to PML-N readying to re-embrace their anti-establishment approach. It is worth noting that Ms Sharif is reportedly poised to get an even more key role in the upcoming reshuffle
In a conversation with Dawn, PML-N leader Muhammad Zubair confirmed that the party would see a return of ‘resistance character’ in its politics.
“We have been at the receiving end for long. This cannot happen anymore,” he said.
Though Nawaz Sharif, after his 2017 ouster from power, kept the party in contention through his strong ‘Mujhe Kyon Nikala’ rhetoric, PML-N remained split between hawks and moderates.
The latter, led by current prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, were of the opinion that the route to return to power corridors lay in reconciling with the security establishment after dropping the confrontational posture.
Observers contend that Punjab has always respected defiance and had empathy for the underdog. However, the province donned pro-establishment colours because of status-quo politicians, who emerged from the non-party elections of 1985, under former dictator Ziaul Haq. 
PML-N’s own demons with anti-establishment narratives are due to the fact that its ranks are also made up of a number of politicians who have “benefitted from patronage”.
The Nawaz-League had, by the middle of last year, significantly toned down its anti-establishment rhetoric after moderates prevailed within the party with the stance that prospects of success in 2023 polls depended on mending fences with the military.
Their rationale was based on the widespread perception that Punjab was an overtly pro-establishment province. 
The approach apparently paid off much earlier than expected, when PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif succeeded Mr Imran Khan, who was ousted through a vote of no-confidence in National Assembly.
But many now question that logic, especially after Mr Khan, who is said to have risen to power with establishment’s help, made a comeback by bashing US and the establishment.
Where PML-N had used innuendo such as ‘khalai makhlooq’ to refer to the powers that be, Mr Khan invented the phrase “neutrals” to attack the military leadership for its role in politics and used characters like ‘Mr X’ and ‘Mr Y’ to point to the hands involved in meddling. 
PML-N leaders say that the battle of narratives not only undermined the party in its Punjab stronghold, but damaged its prospects badly in Khyber-Pakhtunkhawa as well.
Party leaders from KP have complained to Mr Nawaz Sharif that PM Shehbaz has “outsourced” the party in the province to JUI-F chief Fazlur Rehman.
A party leader, while emphasising the gravity of the situation, said it was probably the worst crisis for the PML-N since the Musharraf coup. “There is lot of demoralisation,” he added.
He said that the crisis was two-fold; on one hand they were losing their base to PTI, while on the other hand its supporters were confused about what their party stood for. Moreover, the party fears that it would not have anything to sell to the constituents after the latest economic meltdown.
A party source said that Mr Nawaz Sharif was “deeply worried” and “little convinced” by the various explanations given by the senior leaders for the poor showing in the recent Punjab by-polls.
According to his calculations, the source said, PTI bagged over a million votes against PML-N’s 850,000 in elections in 20 Punjab constituencies. 
Nawaz has, therefore, decided to go for leadership reshuffle, which may see Maryam Nawaz being elevated to a more powerful position.
Sitting in London, he still believes Maryam is the next best option to take the “bull by the horns” as long as he is away. 
However, Mr Zubair said the party was seeking a “level playing field” ahead of the next elections and a key part of that strategy was to get Nawaz back to Pakistan.
