0,Pakistan’s financing needs of $33.5bn fully met for 2022-23: SBP chief,Says Islamabad unfairly grouped with more vulnerable countries...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s $33.5 billion external financing needs are  fully met for 2022-23, the central bank chief said on Saturday, adding  that  “unwarranted” market concerns about its financial position will  dissipate in weeks.
Fears have risen about Pakistan’s stuttering  economy as its currency fell nearly 8 per cent against the US dollar in the  last trading week, while the country’s forex reserves stand below $10  billion with inflation at the highest in more than a decade.
“Our  external financing needs over the next 12 months are fully met,  underpinned by our ongoing IMF programme,” State Bank of Pakistan  Acting Governor Murtaza Syed said in an emailed reply to  questions.
Pakistan last week reached a staff-level agreement  with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the disbursement of  $1.17bn in critical funding under resumed payments of a bailout  package.

Says Islamabad unfairly grouped with more vulnerable countries

“The recently secured staff-level agreement on the next  IMF review is a very important anchor that clearly separates Pakistan  from vulnerable countries, most of whom do not have any IMF backing,” he  said.
However, the lender’s board needs to approve the agreement  before the disbursement, which is expected in August, before which there  remain prior policy actions to be fulfilled, according to sources  familiar with the matter.
But some question Pakistan’s ability to meet external financing needs, including debt obligations, despite the IMF funding.
Syed  played down those concerns saying Pakistan’s public debt profile, one  of the  “main flashpoints” for markets these days, is a lot better than  in vulnerable countries with high public debt.
The country’s public debt-to-GDP ratio is 71pc.
“Pakistan’s  external debt is low, of relatively long maturity, and on easier terms  since it is heavily skewed towards concessional multilateral and official  bilateral financing rather than expensive commercial borrowing,” he  said.
In a recent presentation to international investors reviewed  by Reuters, Syed said $33.5bn in gross external financing needs  would be met  “comfortably” with $35.9bn in available financing.
Most  of the financing was shown from multilaterals, oil payment facilities,  and rollovers of bilateral financing, and the heaviest financing needs  were in the second quarter (October-December) of FY23.
The presentation also compared the situation in Pakistan to Sri Lanka, which recently defaulted, and said: “Pakistan tigh­tened monetary policy and allowed the exchange rate to  depreciate as soon as external pressures began.” 
It added that Sri  Lanka’s fiscal position had been much worse than Pakistan’s, with primary  deficits three to four times larger since the pandemic.
Syed said  Pakistan is being unfairly grouped with more vulnerable countries amid  panic in global markets due to a commodity supercycle, tightening by the  US Federal Reserve and geopolitical tensions.
“Markets are  responding to these shocks in an unfairly broad-brush way, without  paying enough attention to Pakistan’s relative stren­gths,” he said.
“We expect this reality to dawn in the coming weeks and the unwarranted fears around Pakistan to dissipate.”

1,How a strong dollar affects the economy — and your wallet,The import bill outstrips export earnings by a wide margin every year and results in a shortage of dollars in the local market.,"KARACHI: “My first salary was Rs12,000 in 1996 when one dollar was equal to Rs34. The first salary in the same brokerage industry today is about Rs50,000, even though the dollar rate is over Rs228,” said Asif Qureshi, executive chairman of stock brokerage Optimus Capital Management.
It means the first salary of a fresh finance graduate in the brokerage industry has gone down from over $350 a month to less than $220 in the intervening period.
The takeaway is that the dollar wages in Pakistan have gone down significantly, thanks to the consistent devaluation of the rupee against the dollar over the years. People employed in the services sector are more exposed to the fluctuation in the dollar rate than their counterparts in the manufacturing sector, says Mr Qureshi.
“I can’t charge a higher brokerage commission in the name of depreciation. But a large chemical maker will pass on the impact of the depreciation and keep his dollar-based profit margin intact,” he says.

Experts say industry, with its ability to pass on rising costs to consumers, is more insulated against exchange rate fluctuations than services sector

A rising dollar rate is a key contributor to inflation. From petrol and medicines to pulses and books, the economy depends heavily on unavoidable imports. The import bill outstrips export earnings by a wide margin every year and results in a shortage of dollars in the local market. The exchange rate goes further north, fuelling import-led inflation.
Prices of commonly used consumer items increased 21.3 per cent in June from a year ago mainly because of costly fuel and food items.
So are there any home-brew hacks that ordinary folk can use to minimise the impact of the sharp exchange rate movement?
The most obvious resort is work-from-home, car-pooling and the use of energy-efficient equipment at home to lessen the impact of exchange rate–induced inflation, says Mr Qureshi.
He advised people against keeping their savings in dollars or even gold as a hedge against inflation. There’ve been many years in which inflation outpaced the increase in dollar and gold rates. For example, the dollar rate barely moved during Gen Musharraf’s years in the 2000s for a variety of reasons. In the same vein, stock investors have made no gains in the last six years or so.
The stock market needs a major influx of liquidity as shares are undervalued, he said. Fixed income funds are offering about 15pc returns, which can be a good hedge against inflation, he added.
Speaking to Dawn, Federal Board of Revenue’s former chairman Syed Shabbar Zaidi said there’s not much that people can do to escape the fallout of a dollar rate increase other than slashing their petrol and electricity consumption.
“But I must say our overall approach is flawed. We’re too focused on getting consumption reduced at the individual’s level. There should be a single-minded focus on reducing fuel and electricity consumption at the national level instead. Early closure of commercial centres is a must,” he said.
But what’s the way out in the long run?
Putting on his advisory hat, Mr Zaidi said the overall economy will be better off if big conglomerates focus on generating an exportable surplus while expanding into segments that don’t depend on imported raw material. That’ll slow down the pace of dollar outflows and arrest the runaway depreciation that’s wreaking havoc on the lives of ordinary people.
“We should also discourage foreign investment in banking and water-selling businesses,” he said while referring to foreign direct investment (FDI), which leads to dollar-based repatriation of profits and dividends every year.
Many economists believe that FDI — even though it creates no debt obligation — has been mostly harmful for Pakistan. FDI flows have traditionally been concentrated in consumption-based sectors like telecommunication, banking, packaged food and milk, soft drinks and toiletries.
In other words, one-time dollar inflows generate zero foreign exchange for the country. Multinational companies convert their rupee income into dollars in the local market and send the precious foreign exchange to their foreign sponsors in the form of dividends every year.
“Why do we need a multinational to sell us water? Why do we need foreigners to invest in our banks? Don’t we already know banking?” said Mr Zaidi.

2,Global equity funds see biggest weekly outflow in five weeks,"According to Refinitiv Lipper, investors offloaded a net $13.79 billion worth of global equity funds.","NEW YORK: Global equity funds recorded their biggest weekly outflow in five weeks in the week to July 20, on investor caution ahead of crucial central bank meetings in which rate hikes are expected to be announced.
According to Refinitiv Lipper, investors offloaded a net $13.79 billion worth of global equity funds, marking the biggest weekly outflow since June 15.
The European Central Bank raised its benchmark deposit rate by 50 basis points, above its own guidance of a 25-basis-point hike, to rein in soaring inflation levels in the region.
The US Federal Reserve is also expected to raise policy rates by another 75 basis points at its meeting next week as it seeks to balance the risks of a stubbornly high inflation and the likelihood of a recession.
US and European equities funds booked withdrawals of $8.45bN and $5.6bn, respectively, although investors poured about $740 million in Asian equity funds.
Sectoral data showed financial, consumer discretionary and metals and mining funds witnessed outflows of $995m, $445m and $416m, respectively, but healthcare gained $511m in inflows.
Selling continued for a second week in global bonds funds as investors unwind $6.9bn worth of holdings.
Government funds saw outflows of $2.49bn after 15 weeks of inflows, while net selling in short- and medium-term bond funds eased to a 15-week low of $1.88bn.
Meanwhile, investors sold money market funds worth $1.34 billion after two weeks of purchases.
In the commodities space, net selling in gold and precious metal funds stood at $1.1bn, a 63 per cent bigger outflow than the previous week, while energy funds posted a fourth weekly outflow, valued at $180m.
An analysis of 24,388 emerging market funds showed investors jettisoned equity fund worth $2.04bn, the biggest outflow in 10 weeks, while bond funds suffered a sixth weekly outflow of $2.13bn.

3,Agreement with Kabul reached to facilitate coal trade for power generation,The coal will be used in power production at two plants — Hubco and Sahiwal plants.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Afghanistan have reached an agreement to facilitate bilateral trade, especially coal for use in power generation to bridge the shortfall in electricity production in the wake of the high cost of furnace oil in the international market.
Coal is already being imported in small quantities for power generation via Chaman border station in Balochistan. Under the new agreement, coal imports will start at custom stations in Kharlachi and Ghulam Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
The coal will be used in power production at two plants — Hubco and Sahiwal plants. On July 5, the government authorised the trade of all rupee-denominated goods via land routes.
According to official sources, the coal import will address the country’s energy security to a large extent has already been reached with Kabul to import coal through trucks via land routes, the official added.
Pakistan has already turned into a net importer from Afghanistan since the Taliban took control of Kabul in August 2021. During the period, Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan also saw a deeper drop due to the non-availability of tradable currency through banking channels.
The decisions were reached during the three-day visit (July 18–20) of a Pakistan trade delegation to Kabul. Pakistan’s Secretary Commerce Sualeh Faruqui, headed the delegation to discuss mutual actions for enhancing bilateral trade, transit, and connectivity and take necessary trade facilitation measures.
Islamabad, in return, has offered several facilitation measures to promote imports from Afghanistan. One of the major demands from Kabul was for duty-free imports from Afgha­nistan, particularly of food items, to help combat rising food inflation.
An official announcement said both sides agreed that during the current financial year, bilateral trade and transit have registered growth. This momentum needs to be sustained and further strengthened on a mutually beneficial basis.
It was agreed to make border crossing points more efficient to ensure early clearance of trade and transit traffic and to address the bottlenecks and impediments on a priority basis.
The two sides agreed to implement a Temporary Admission Document (TAD) allowing free movement of bilateral trade vehicles and preventing the loading and unloading of goods at the border crossing points with the view to further increasing trade between the two countries.
The relevant authorities of the two sides also agreed to increase operational timings at all crossing points, particularly Torkham, Kharlachi, Ghulam Khan, and Chaman/Spin Boldak.
The heads of the customs departments of the two countries agreed to work together and evolve mutually connected customs procedures and systems to improve efficiency in the clearance of goods.
All possible steps will be taken to begin luxury bus service between Peshawar and Jalalabad, as well as Quetta and Kandahar, with the goal of starting the service by the end of August this year. Difficulties in visa processing would be addressed through mutual coordination.

4,Auto kit imports hit record $1.7bn in FY22,"Large chunk of foreign investment in auto sector coming from China, Korea.","KARACHI: The import bill of completely and semi-knocked down (CKD/SKD) kits of locally assembled cars hit an all-time high of $1.7 billion in FY22 compared to $1.11bn in the preceding year, a jump of 52 per cent owing to escalating demand for vehicles and low localisation.
Impressive CKD/SKD import figures also justify 55pc in car sales in FY22 to 234,180 units as consumers did not show any resilience towards vehicle buying despite high interest rates coupled with rising prices and bar on auto financing by the State Bank.
The intensity of thriving demand for locally made cars was so high that the import bill of CKD/SKD reached $1bn in just eight months (July to February) of FY22 compared to $1.11bn during the entire FY21. 
The auto sector believes that the Auto Policy 2016-2021 had definitely changed the landscape of the country’s auto sector but the policy incentives of allowing local assembly by new entrants at a mere 5pc localisation had caused a big hit to the national kitty due to a whopping import bill of both kinds of kits.

Large chunk of foreign investment in auto sector coming from China, Korea

The rest of the damage was done by the existing assemblers who had been introducing new models with fewer locally made parts.
In May 2022, Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL) informed the market that the localisation in Swift was 35pc followed by 51pc in Cultus, 60pc in WagonR, 62pc in Alto 660cc, 72pc in Bolan and 68pc in Ravi. The usage of locally made parts in Toyota Corolla and Yaris is above 65pc.
There are no apparent signs that the import bill of CKD/SKD would come down as the new entrants, whose projects were approved under the Auto Policy 2016-2021, would keep assembling the vehicles at a very low volume of locally made parts. 
However, new models being introduced by the existing Japanese assemblers would also need some time to utilise locally made parts.
A vendor said the five-decades-old auto sector has not made any serious efforts to improve the presence of locally made parts in the local assembly of vehicles. New entrants also focused more on rolling out SUVs rather than introducing small cars thus resulting in a higher value of CKD/SKD imports.
Mehran Commercial Enterprise Director Mashood Ali Khan said negligible localisation in new entrants’ vehicles, as well as existing assemblers’ new models, was because of incentives given under the auto policy. On the positive side, the country witnessed huge foreign investment in the auto sector from China and South Korea but its negative side was very less utilisation of locally made parts in the vehicles.
He said assemblers in the last few months had planned to improve imports of CKD/SKD kits despite the huge increase in freight rates to ensure better availability of vehicles, especially in June, to offset any negative impact of any budgetary measures on the consumers.
Mr Mashood recalled that auto sales had dipped at least four times since the 1990s to date after recording fabulous growth in sales. 
He feared that this trend would likely revive in the current fiscal year due to high vehicle prices, interest rates and restrictions put in place by the State Bank on auto financing.

5,Stocks tumble as uncertainty over dollar inflow grows in jittery week,"KARACHI: Political uncertainty took a toll on the stock market in the outgoing week. According  to Arif Habib Ltd,...","KARACHI: Political uncertainty took a toll on the stock market in the outgoing week.
According  to Arif Habib Ltd, the rupee continued to depreciate and reached an  all-time low of 228.37 amid a depletion of foreign exchange reserves and  uncertainty over funding from friendly countries.
Moreover, the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) is assessing as to which friendly  countries are willing to provide financial aid to Pakistan before it can  disburse the $1.17 billion tranche.
In addition, ratings agency  Fitch downgraded Pakistan’s outlook to negative. However, a slight  rebound was observed on the last trading day of the outgoing week.
The stock market closed at 40,077 points, losing 1,998 points or 4.75 per cent from a week ago.
Despite strong assurances  from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the currency and share markets have been in deep  turmoil amid uncertainty about the future course of the economy.
The rupee appreciated to 204.56 in the first week of July after  touching 211.93 on June 22. It kept losing its value against the dollar  but registered a minor appreciation when the country reached its  staff-level agreement with the IMF on July 15.
According  to a research note issued by AKD Securities over the weekend, there  still seems to be a “funding gap for 2022-23 expenditures” even though  the government has reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF.
In the outgoing  week, there was an 11-rupee change in the exchange rate in just two days  — a sharp decline in the rupee’s value that the SBP attributed to the  “market-determined exchange rate system”. 
The central bank said  the depreciation in the rupee “since December 2021 has only been 3pc”. In nominal terms, however, the local currency has depreciated against  the dollar by 18pc over the same period.
“Until  future funding from lenders/partners is ensured, the domestic currency  is expected to remain volatile, subsequently keeping investors’  confidence muted,” it added.
But a recent slump in commodity  prices may be a positive development for the country’s external account.  The brokerage also drew attention to lower oil prices to claim that  they may give the government some space to start collecting petroleum  development levy and sales taxes on retail fuel without putting  additional burden on consumers.
Sector-wise,  negative contributions to the index came from commercial banking (499  points), fertiliser (294 points), cement (245 points), oil and gas  exploration (187 points) and power generation and distribution (110  points).
Sectors that contributed positively to the benchmark were  sugar and allied industries (three points) and close-end mutual funds  (two points).
Scrip-wise, negative contributors were Habib Bank  Ltd (152 points), Lucky Cement Ltd (92 points), Engro Corporation Ltd  (92 points), Engro Polymer and Chemicals Ltd (91 points) and the Hub  Power Company Ltd (90 points).
Meanwhile, scrip-wise positive  contributions came from Shakarganj Ltd (three points), HBL Growth Fund  (two points), Highnoon Laboratories Ltd (two points), Murree Brewery  Company Ltd (one point) and Dolmen City REIT (one point).
Foreign buying was witnessed in the outgoing week, clocking in at $3.43 million versus a net purchase of $1.4m last week.
Major buying took place in technology ($1.98m) and “other sectors” ($0.75m).
On the local front, selling was reported by mutual funds ($7.76m) and insurance companies ($2.22m).
The  average daily volume clocked in at 163m shares, down 8pc week-on-week.  The average daily value traded settled at $21m, down 31pc from a week  ago.
According to AKD Securities, market activity is expected to  remain slow as investors seek an end to uncertainty on the macroeconomic  and political fronts. “We recommend market participants should stay  cautious and focus on defensive plays. Any good bull run should be taken  as an exit point,” it added.
