0,Judges who ruled against Nawaz should not hear ‘N’ cases: Sana,"Imran Khan is an untrustworthy person and is pursuing the agenda of dividing the nation and misleading youth, he says.","LAHORE/KARACHI: Judges who disqualified PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif should not hear cases related to the party, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said on Saturday as coalition partners toughened their line in the wake of the Supreme Court order to Hamza Shehbaz to stay on as a “trustee” Punjab chief minister.
The minister was apparently referring to Justice Ijazul Ahsan, who is a member of the three-judge bench hearing Chaudhry Parvez Elahi’s appeal against Hamza’s re-election and who was also part of the five-judge apex court bench that disqualified former prime minister Nawaz Sharif from holding public office in a landmark decision on the Panama Papers case in 2017. 
Talking to the media, the interior minister also requested the chief justice to constitute full benches to hear party-related cases, a demand echoed by the ruling coalition partners. 
Referring to the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Article 63A case, he said the party suffered because of it, as it led to the disqualification of 25 lawmakers and subsequently, by-polls and then the re-election for the Punjab chief minister.
He also said the Friday’s ruling by the Punjab Assembly’s deputy speaker came in favour of Hamza Shehbaz not because of Chaudhry Shujaat’s letter but due to a Supreme Court ruling.

PPP seeks suo motu on ‘attempts to storm’ SC Lahore registry

Chaudhry Shujaat’s letter has been a bone of contention since Friday’s vote as it apparently asked PML-Q lawmakers to back Hamza Shehbaz and thus prompted Deputy Speaker Dost Mohammad Mazari to reject 10 votes of the party for going against the party line.
Taking a dig at PTI chairman Imran Khan for misleading the nation “through lies and baseless propaganda”, the interior minister said Mr Khan had been alleging for the last three days that his men were being purchased, but the number of votes in the Punjab Assembly for chief minister’s election had exposed his propaganda as not a single member of either side voted against their  party.
The PTI chief was an untrustworthy person and was pursuing the agenda of dividing the nation and misleading youth, the interior minister said.
He also urged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to immediately announce the verdict in the PTI foreign funding case “as it was clear that [Imran Khan] Niazi took money from abroad to destabilise the country and a legal action should be now initiated against him”.
The interior minister said that as a lawyer, he believed that courts should be respected, but added that Imran Khan had used derogatory language against courts while they were opened for him at midnight. 
He reiterated that the PTI chairman was a troublemaker and therefore appropriate Rangers force had been provided to provinces to deal with any untoward violence in case a decision comes against Mr Khan’s party.  
PPP calls for SC full bench
Echoing their coalition partners’ demand that a Supreme Court full bench hear the case against the Punjab Assembly deputy speaker’s ruling, Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon and Adviser to Chief Minister on Law Barrister Murtaza Wahab urged the Supreme Court to take suo motu notice of attempts by some PTI supporters to scale the walls of the apex court’s Lahore registry on Friday night.
Mr Memon told reporters at a presser at Frere Hall: “These people [the PTI] want decisions in their favour by putting pressure on institutions,” adding that the Constitution and law were equal for all.
He alleged that PTI chairman Imran Khan wanted to keep the court, establishment and the ECP under pressure to achieve his objectives.
The Sindh information minister also asserted that Mr Khan’s criticism of the ECP stemmed from his fear of being exposed in the foreign funding case. 
He said the PTI chief was earlier using delaying tactics in the case but was not directly targeting the election commission.
“The purpose of speaking against the election commissioner is that if the decision comes against him, he can say that the decision is against him because he was against the election commissioner,” Mr Memon added.
Referring to a letter by PTI leader Asad Umar, which led to the disqualification of 25 party members, Mr Memon said the PTI now considered it wrong to take a similar action based on Chaudhary Shujaat’s letter.
“There can’t be one decision for the PTI and another for the rest of the country,” Mr Memon said.
Mr Wahab said the PTI was seeking anarchy in the country. He recalled that when seven votes were rejected during the election of PPP leader Yousaf Raza Gilani as the Senate chairman, the PTI said the presiding officer’s ruling could not be challenged.
He said that no one was above the Constitution and the PTI chief should be punished for “repeatedly mocking the Constitution and laws”.

Canadian climber Richard Cartier.—Adventure Pakistan

 
ISLAMABAD/GILGIT: At least one as-yet-unidentified British climber fell to his death on Broad Peak on Saturday, while another Romanian mountaineer was said to be fighting for his life on the 8,000-metre peak due to “dehydration and fatigue”.
In addition, a 61-year-old Canadian climber, has gone missing from K2, the world’s second highest mountain, during his descent from Camp 3 to base camp on Friday evening. Dr Richard Cartier, a professional mountaineer, was last spotted while descending from Camp 2 to Camp 1, according to Adventure Pakistan. Two days on, he is yet to be found, despite rescue efforts.
Alpine Club of Pakistan Secretary Karrar Haidri said there was not enough information about what happened to the two climbers on Broad Peak, only the accounts of climbers who had witnessed the calamity that befell the mountaineers.  
Quoting Italian mountaineer Francois Cazzanelli, who saw the as-yet-unidentified British climber’s fatal fall, Mr Haidri said that Cazzanelli came across the British climber after 12 hours of climbing, only 30 minutes climb from the summit. 

No sign of Canadian trekker on K2 despite rescue efforts

“Here [near the summit], he crossed paths with a British climber who was on his way down. As they passed each other, the Italian climber looked back and saw the British mountaineer suddenly losing his balance in the narrow passageway and crashing into a wall,” the APC official quoted the Italian mountaineer as saying.
Meanwhile, as per the accounts of several climbers, the Romanian mountaineer stuck on Broad Peak — identified only as George — was in “urgent need of evacuation”, while asking for a helicopter to rescue him. 
According to ACP, on July 21, Israfil Ashurli from Azerbaijan, along with other climbers, was near the upper section of Broad Peak. At 7,800 meters, Ashurli met the Romanian climber in a “moribund state”. 
“The condition of the climber made Mr Ashurli abort his summit push as he attempted to rescue the man and brought him down to 7,300m.”
From Camp III, a number of climbers hailing from Chile, Poland, and Russia moved to supplement the rescue efforts. 
They also aborted their summit push so that they could help save the life of the Romanian national.
Mr Haidri said that around afternoon the home team of the Chileans reported that the climbers had started their descent from Camp II to the base camp. 
“Given that they were dealing with an injured helpless climber and it was about to get dark, the rescue team was expecting that the day would be really long,” Mr Haidri quoted the Chilean home team.
Meanwhile, the ACP confirmed that on Friday a massive number of mountaineers, guides, Sherpas, and porters were on the K2 summit. As many as 141 people have scaled the mountain and almost half of them were Sherpa and Pakistani support teams.

The festival was held every year at the shrine of revered Sufi saint Baba Ghundi to pay homage for his services to spread Islam in the region. 
The festival, which was held near Afghanistan’s Wakhan region, brings together the Wakhi speaking people from the two countries.  
The three-day festival was inaugurated by Force Commander Gilgit Baltistan Maj Gen Jawwad Ahmed. The ceremony was attended by a large number of tourists, locals and officials. 
The festival was being organised by the Chipursan Local Support Organisation in collaboration with the Gilgit-Baltistan government. 
Sufi night, Buzkashi competitions, polo matches, traditional sword dance, Yak Safari and race, traditional food and folk Wakhi music were part of the festival. 
The festival was included in the annual calendar of the GB government in 2010. However, it couldn’t be held in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 restrictions. 
The residents of the Wakhan region, who have ancestral and cultural ties with the people of Chipursan and Gojal valleys in Upper Hunza, travel on yaks, crossing glaciers and mountain peaks for days to attend the festival. 
This journey is only possible during the summer season that lasts from June to September. 
Rahimullah Baig, a resident of Gojal, told Dawn that the people of Chipursan and Wakhan had been carrying out barter trade for centuries. 
Afghan traders cross the Irshad Pass and exchange yaks, sheep and goats with shoes, garments, utensils and other products procured from the Pakistan side. 
The organisers said the festival provided an opportunity to the people of both Chipursan and Wakhan to interact and develop trade links. 
A large number of devotees also visit the shrine from various parts of GB and enjoy Buzkashi and yak race competitions held there.  
The three-day festival will conclude on Sunday (today).

3,Commission formed to probe ‘harassment’ allegation against ex-NAB chief,The commission will have the powers of a criminal court under Section 10 of the Pakistan Penal Code.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Saturday constituted an inquiry commission to probe into the allegation of sexual offence levelled by a woman named Tayyaba Gul against former National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman retired Justice Javed Iqbal. 
According to a notification issued by the Cabinet Division, the commission comprised three members, including National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) chairperson Rabiya Javeri Agha, NCHR member (Sindh) Anis Haroon and NCHR member (Punjab) Nadeem Ashraf. 
According to the terms of reference, the commission will probe the allegations of sexual offences, including harassment, assault, outraging and insulting modesty, misdemeanour, misconduct, misuse and abuse of authority, levelled by the complainant. 
It will also look into any violation of the judicial process, security of person, and right to fair trial. 
The commission will also determine if any person(s) was liable of an offence defined in the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) 1860. 
The commission will also probe Ms Tayyaba’s allegation that the audio/video provided by her to the authorities was leaked to the media “for ulterior motive and design”. 
According to the notification, the commission will have the powers of a criminal court under Section 10 of the PPC. In light of its findings, the commission will also recommend actions. 
The issue had come to light after a private TV channel aired an audio clip in July 2020, which contained a telephonic conversation between Ms Tayyaba and the former NAB chairman. 
Ms Tayyaba had not only levelled allegations against Mr Iqbal but had also accused former prime minister Imran Khan for detaining her along with her husband in Prime Minister Office when she had met him to lodge a complaint. 
Earlier this month, National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee had also sent a recommendation to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for the removal of Mr Iqbal as the chairman of the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances in light of these allegations.
