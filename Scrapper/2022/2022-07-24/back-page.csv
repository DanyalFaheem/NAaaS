The World Health Organisation on Saturday declared the outbreak, which has affected nearly 16,000 people in 72 countries, to be a global health emergency — the highest alarm it can sound.
The WHO label — a “public health emergency of international concern” — is desig­ned to sound an alarm that a coordinated international response is needed and could unlock funding and global efforts to collaborate on sharing vaccines and treatments.
Members of an expert committee that met on Thu­rsday to discuss the potential recommendation were split on the decision, two sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity told Reuters earlier, but the final decision falls to the UN agency’s director-general.
Announcing his decision to declare the health emergency during a media briefing in Geneva, Tedros confirmed that the committee had failed to reach a consensus.
Earlier on Friday, cases of the viral disease monkeypox in the United States have been identified for the first time in children — a toddler in California and an infant who is not a US resident, according to US health authorities.
So far this year, there have been more than 16,000 cases of monkeypox in more than 60 countries, and five deaths in Africa. The viral disease —which spre­ads via close contact and tends to cause flu-like sym­ptoms and pus-filled skin lesions — has been spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men in the recent outbreak, outside Africa where it is endemic.
As monkeypox infections jump around the world, prompting a scramble for vaccines, AFP looks at how the disease has spread since first appearing in Africa in the 1970s.
Monkeypox, so called because it was first discovered in a monkey, is related to the deadly smallpox virus, which was eradicated in 1980, but is far less severe.
The strain currently circulating outside Africa is the milder of two known versions.
Human monkeypox is first identified in 1970 in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in a nine-year-old boy. In June 2003, the disease surfaced in the US — the first time it had been detected outside Africa.
The illness is believed to have spread after rodents, imported into the US from Ghana, infected prairie dogs.
Surge outside Africa
In May 2022, a flurry of cases was detected in countries outside Africa, in people with no travel links to the region. Europe is the epicentre of the new outbreak.
By May 20, Britain has recorded 20 cases, mostly among gay men. On the same date, the WHO counts 80 confirmed cases around the world, including in Australia, Belgium, Can­ada, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. On May 23, the US says it is preparing to administer smallpox vaccines, which are effective against monkeypox, to people who have been in close contact with monkeypox patients.
More than 1,000 cases
In June, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebr­eyesus said over 1,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox have been reported to WHO from 29 countries where the virus is not usually present. 
WHO experts met on June 23 to discuss the threat but decide that monkeypox does not constitute a global public health emergency.
14,000 cases, 70 countries
On July 8, health authorities in France also launched pre-emptive jabs for people considered at risk, including gay men, trans people and sex workers. On July 14, the US CDC reported 11,000 confirmed cases in some 60 countries where monkeypox is not usually found. Most of the cases are in Europe, the US and Canada. The number of infections in New York doubles in under a week to several hundred. People stand in line for vaccines, which are in short supply.
On July 20, Tedros announced that 14,000 confirmed cases have been reported to the WHO this year, from 70 countries, with five deaths, all in Africa. The WHO called a new expert meeting for July 21 to decide whether to declare a global health emergency. On Saturday, Tedros announced the monkeypox outbreak to be a “public health emergency of international concern”.

1,Odessa port strikes threaten grain deal,Russia ‘denies attack on port’; US State Dept confirms death of two Americans in Donbas region.,"KYIV: Russian missiles hit Ukraine’s port of Odessa on Saturday, in what Kyiv called a “spit in the face” of a day-old deal brokered by Turkish president and UN chief between the warring sides to resume cereal exports blocked by the conflict.
Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi  Akar has said Moscow has denied carrying out any attack on the Ukrainian  port of Odessa. “The Russians told us that they had absolutely nothing  to do with this attack and they were looking into the issue very  closely,” Mr Akar said a day after Russia and Ukraine signed agreements  in Istanbul. 
The Ukrainian military said its air defence had shot down two cruise missiles, but two more hit the port, threatening the landmark agreement hammered out over months of negotiations aimed at relieving a global food crisis. The Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman said the strike was “a spit in the face” by Russian leader Vladimir Putin against the deal brokered by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and United Nations chief Antonio Guterres.
Guterres, who presided over the signing ceremony on Friday, “unequivocally” condemned the reported attack on Odessa, his deputy spokesman said, and urged all sides stick to the deal to allow grain exports. “These products are desperately needed to address the global food crisis and ease the suffering of millions of people in need around the globe,” he said. 

Russia ‘denies attack on port’; US State Dept confirms death of two Americans in Donbas region

EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell directly blamed Russia for the strikes. “Striking a target crucial for grain export a day after the signature of (the) Istanbul agreements is particularly reprehensible and again demonstrates Russia’s total disregard for international law and commitments,” he said.
20 million tonnes of wheat 
There was no immediate reaction from Moscow after the attack.
However, Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Russia would bear “full responsibility for deepening the global food crisis” if the assault jeopardised the agreement.
The first major accord between the countries since the February invasion of Ukraine aims to ease the “acute hunger” that the UN says faces an additional 47 million people because of the war.
Ukraine had entered the Friday’s signing ceremony in Istanbul by bluntly warning that it would conduct “an immediate military response” should Russia violate the agreement and attack its ships or stage an incursion around its ports.
The two sides eventually inked separate but identical agreements in the presence Guterres and Erdogan at Istanbul’s lavish Dolmabahce Palace.
Guterres, moments before the signing, hailed the agreement as “a beacon of hope”. The United States and Britain had also hailed the accord, but urged Moscow to abide by its rules.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later said the responsibility for enforcing the deal would fall to the UN that along with Turkiye is a co-guarantor of the agreement. The deal includes points on running Ukrainian grain ships along safe corridors that avoid known mines in the Black Sea.
Huge quantities of wheat and other grain have also been blocked in Ukrainian ports by not only Russian warships but also the landmines that Kyiv has laid to avert a feared amphibious assault.
Zelensky said around 20 million tonnes of produce from last year’s harvest and the current crop would be exported under the agreement, estimating the value of Ukraine’s grain stocks at around $10 billion.
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Kremlin state media he expected the deal to start working “in the next few days” though diplomats expect grain to start fully flowing by mid-August.
Strikes on central Ukraine 
Russia is trying to fight deeper into the war zone’s Donetsk region after securing full control of neighbouring Lugansk.
The missile strikes on railway infrastructure and a military airfield in the central area of Kirovograd on Saturday killed at least three people and wounded 16 more, regional governor Andriy Raikovych said.
Two Americans have died in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, the US State Depart­ment said on Saturday.
Ukraine has established an international legion for volunteers with varying degrees of previous military training, although the State Department did not confirm whether they were in the country for combat purposes. “We can confirm the recent deaths of two US citizens in the Donbas region of Ukraine. We are in touch with the families and providing all possible consular assistance,” a State Depart­ment spokesperson said.
Moscow said two more Americans, both former servicemen, who were taken prisoner in the east of Ukraine last month, could face execution.

2,California enacts gun control law,The legislation is modeled on a controversial legal approach used in Texas to curb access to abortions.,"LOS ANGELES: Califor­nia’s governor has signed into law new gun control legislation modeled on a controversial legal approach used in Texas to curb access to abortions.
The law that Governor Gavin Newsom signed on Friday will allow individuals to seek $10,000 from any person or company that manufactures, sells, or transports firearms that are banned in the state, which includes assault rifles and homemade so-called “ghost” guns.
State Senator Anthony Portantino, speaking at a press conference, was explicit that he and his bill co-authors had the Texas law in mind when they wrote their legislation. “Frankly, if Texas can use a private right of action to attack women, we can use a private right of action to make California safer,” he said.
Court challenges to the California law, which is set to go into effect on January 1, 2023, are expected to follow from conservative organizations and the nation’s powerful gun lobby.
Newsom argued that it was the US Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, who “opened the door” to such a move.
“The Supreme Court said this was okay. It was a terrible decision. But these are the rules that they have established,” he added.
The US high court refused last year to halt the Texas abortion law from going into effect while challenges work their way through lower courts. Similar Texas-style abortion restriction laws have since been enacted in several other Republican-led states.

4,"Iraq preparing to host Saudi, Iran FMs talks publicly","""It will be a public meeting, (unlike) previous encounters which were secret,"" Iraq's foreign minister says.","BAGHDAD: Iraq has said it is preparing to host a “public” meeting of the foreign ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia as the two rivals seek to mend ties.
Since April last year, Iraq has hosted five rounds of talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which support opposing sides in various conflicts around the region. Those encounters were held privately and at a low level, involving security and intelligence officials.
On Saturday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said his Iranian and Saudi counterparts would be meeting in Iraq at an undisclosed date. “I contacted the foreign minister of Iran about this,” Hussein said in an interview with Kurdish TV channel, Rudaw.
“We are preparing the meeting, trying to find the best time to invite the foreign ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia,” he said.
“It will be a public meeting, (unlike) previous encounters which were secret and were held between intelligence and security officials,” the FM said.
His comments came days after Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told Iranian state television that his country and Saudi Arabia were ready to move reconciliation talks to a higher level.
Mr Amir-Abdollahian earlier on Thursday said that “progress” had been made at previous rounds of talks between security officials hosted by Iraq. Last week Iran had received a message from the Iraqi foreign minister who said, “The Saudi side is ready to move the talks to the political and public level”.
He also expressed the hope that new negotiations would lead to the resumption of “normal diplomatic ties”.
Riyadh had severed ties with Tehran after Iranian protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran in 2016 following the Saudi execution of Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr.

5,Panama Papers whistleblower says Russia ‘wants me dead’,Says he has evidence of wrongdoing by top Russian officials and their allies which helped fund the war in Ukraine.,"BERLIN: The whistleblower behind the  “Panama Papers” which revealed major tax evasion and fraud worldwide said he feared Russian retribution, in an interview published on Saturday by Germany’s Der Spiegel.
The magazine quoted him under his pseudonym John Doe as saying he had evidence of financial wrongdoing by top Russian officials and their allies which helped fund the war in Ukraine.
Asked by Spiegel whether he feared for his life, he said,  “It’s a risk that I live with, given that the Russian government has expressed the fact that it wants me dead.”
When Spiegel asked John Doe about tax havens used by  “strongmen in autocratic regimes”, he spoke of the alleged role they play in Russia, whose leaders deny breaking the law.
Russian President Vladimir “is more of a threat to the United States than Hitler ever was, and shell companies are his best friend,” he said.
“Shell companies funding the Russian military are what kill innocent civilians in Ukraine as Putin’s missiles target shopping centres.” He said anonymous firms  “make these horrors and more possible by removing accountability from society. But without accountability, society cannot function.” 
He said Russian state-funded channel RT had aired a two-part Panama Papers docudrama featuring a  “John Doe” character  “who suffered a torture-induced head injury during the opening credits”. “However bizarre and tacky, it was not subtle,” he said.
“We have seen others with connections to offshore accounts and tax justice resort to murder, as with the tragedies involving Daphne Caruana Galizia and Jan Kuciak,” referring to investigative reporters killed in Malta and Slovakia.
In what was billed as his first interview since the release of the Panama Papers in 2016, John Doe said he had no plans to come out from the cover of anonymity.
“The Panama Papers involve so many different transnational criminal organisations, some of them with links to governments, that it’s difficult to imagine how it could ever be safe to identify myself,” he said.
The Panama Papers were one of several leaks of financial documents by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).
Their revelations triggered the resignation of the prime minister of Iceland and paved the way for the leader of Pakistan to be ousted.
