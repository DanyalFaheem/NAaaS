0,Minor boy among eight shot as Sohrab Goth violence continues,Police say 45 rioters held in two days; violent protests spread fears in other areas.,"KARACHI: The Sohrab Goth area remained in the grip of violence on Friday as unidentified miscreants took to streets, shot eight persons, damaged public property and attempted to torch a vehicle.
However, large contingents of police rushed to the troubled area and took a number of suspects into custody and controlled the situation. 
Ethnic tensions are flared up in several areas following a strike call given by certain groups in the wake of killing of a man during a scuffle at a tea shop in Hyderabad and subsequent violent fallout in Sohrab Goth on Thursday evening resulting in killing of two persons and injuries to several others, including a boy, according to officials and witnesses. 
Commercial activities remained suspended in the particular localities on Friday where police and other law enforcers carried out a flag march to provide a sense of security to citizens. 

Police say 45 rioters held in two days; violent protests spread fears in other areas

Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that eight persons, including a nine-year-old boy, were brought to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital with bullet wounds.
They suffered bullet injuries during the violence at Sohrab Goth and Gulshan-i-Maymar. The condition of three of them was critical, she said.
A traffic police spokesperson said on Friday that both tracks of the Superhighway remained closed to traffic for over half-an-hour in the evening because of the protest. 
Vehicles coming from Hyderabad were diverted from Jamali Pull towards Safoora Goth while the vehicles going to Hyderabad were diverted towards Gulshan-i-Iqbal from Adil Shah Ramp. 
City police chief Javed Akhtar Odho told Dawn that some miscreants tried to torch an old vehicle at Sohrab Goth and damaged some property when they took to streets after Friday prayers. 
However, he added that the police took immediate action and detained around 10-15 persons. He said that since Thursday evening, around 45 people had been arrested on charges of riots and arson attacks. 
He said the held suspects were being identified with help of video clips obtained from areas.
East-SSP Syed Abdul Rahim Sherazi said that the protest had ended and both tracks of the highway had been cleared to traffic. 
Murder FIR lodged 
Meanwhile, the Sohrab Goth police have registered an FIR on behalf of the state through a police officer, Syed Ali Raza, against four identified suspects and 1,500-2,000 unidentified miscreants on charges of killing two people and injuring as many others on Thursday evening during the protest. 
The FIR has been lodged under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (premeditated murder), 324 (attempted murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 109 (abetment), of the Pakistan Penal Code. 
The complainant said he along with other police officers, including SHO Sohrab Goth Zubair Nawaz were on patrol in an official mobile and when they reached at Malik Aga Hotel at around 1630 hours, they saw four persons — Naimatullah alias Adil Shah, Shafiullah, Jamil Alkozai and Riaz Khan — were chanting ‘provocative’ slogans and drawing attention of people towards the incident that happened in Hyderabad. 
The police saw that other people also started to gather there prompting them to call reinforcement and 140 tear gas shells to meet any eventuality. In the meantime, the people got charged and started gathering at Afghan Cut on the Superhighway and instigated violence by provoking others to carry out violent protests. They started pelting stones and set up temporary barriers on the main highway, resulting in suspension of traffic. Some of protesters were carrying firearms while others carried sticks, iron rods and stones. 
They started ransacking the Karachi bus terminal at around 1645 hours on Thursday and overpowered two police officers deployed there for security and snatched an official weapon from ASI Mohammed Azam along with 10 live rounds and took his cell phone as well. They also snatched an official sub-machine gun from a police mobile. 
The miscreants used these snatched official weapons and other firearms, which they had brought and resorted to direct firing on police with intention to kill them. 
The police fired tear gas shells to disperse the crowd. The miscreants were dispersed, but they again gathered near Jamali Pull. The FIR said that the miscreants snatched valuables from commuters and people travelling by foot in the area and continued firing. They caused substantial damage to public and private property. 
The complainant said when they reached the Taj petrol pump, they received information that one person had been shot at and wounded in firing carried out by miscreants. When they reached at a service road near Jamali Cut, they were informed that another person had been shot at and wounded by the miscreants. They also received the information that two other persons also received bullet injuries. 
All the four injured people were taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital and the Dow University of Health Sciences hospital. 
The police took action and arrested 14 suspects and recovered iron rods and stones from their possession while other miscreants dispersed and fled towards different areas. 
The complainant said later on, he received the information that out of four injured persons, two had expired. They are identified as Najamul Hasan, 27, Nazeer Ahmed, 45, while the wounded were identified as Qadir Dad, 15, and Nek Zada. 
The complainant said four suspects namely Naimatullah, alias Adil Shah; Shafiullah; Jamil Alkozai and Riaz Khan and their three-four unidentified accomplices provoked around 1500-2000 miscreants to carry out riots, killings, looting and snatch official weapons. 
The police in order to control the miscreants fired 150 tear gas shells, the FIR added.

The Met office also advised fishermen to remain careful as sea conditions will become very rough till July 18.
“The low pressure area persists over northeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Run of Kutch, India with its trough extending up to southeast Sindh, which has produced dust /thunder storm at a number of places in Sindh with isolated very heavy falls in southeast Sindh.
“Under the influence of this system, widespread rain-thunderstorm with few heavy falls [very heavy at times] are likely to occur in Karachi, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Tharparkar, Tando Mohammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Sanghar, Nawabshah, Noushahro Feroze, Khairpur, Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad, Qambar-Shahdadkot, Dadu, Jamshoro, Shikar­pur, Ghotki and Kashmore district till July 18 [Monday],” says an advisory of the Met department.
Heavy falls, the advisory says, may generate urban flooding/water logging in low-lying areas in Karachi, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Dadu, Jamshoro, Nawab­shah, Jacobabad, Larkana and Sukkur districts during the period.
“Persistent heavy spell may trigger hill torrents/flash flooding along & downstream Kirthar range. Sea conditions to become very rough and fisherman are advised to remain careful. All concerned authorities are requested to remain vigilant and take necessary measures,” it adds.

2,PSP plea seeking NA-245 by-poll on weekly holiday disposed of,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday directed the Election Commission of Pakistan to approach the provincial...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday directed the Election Commission of Pakistan to approach the provincial government asking it to declare July 27 a local holiday in the NA-245 constituency for the purpose of by-election.
Disposing of a petition filed by the Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) seeking rescheduling of the polling day, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro said that the polling would be held as per schedule and also ordered to ensure peaceful atmosphere during the by-election.
The NA-245 fell vacant last month after the death of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MNA Dr Aamir Liaquat Hussain, who was found dead at his Karachi residence on June 9.
The PSP, through its vice chairman Dr Arshad Vohra, moved the SHC seeking a directive for the ECP to hold the by-election in NA-245 (Karachi East-IV) on July 31 (Sunday) instead of July 27, which is a working day.
When the bench took up the matter for hearing, PSP counsel Sofia Saeed argued that the polling day might be rescheduled to Sunday (July 31) as July 27 was a working day and it would affect the voter turnout.
The lawyer argued that there were many incidents of violence during the recently held by-election in NA 240 (Korangi & Landhi) and the voter turnout was less than 10 per cent as polling was held on a working day (June 16).
ECP law officer Abdullah Hanjrah submitted that the second phase of the local government election would be held on Sunday (July 24) and then Muharram would begin on the next Sunday (July 31). He said that Nishtar Park was the hub of religious activities during Muharram and it came within the territorial limits of the NA-245 constituency.
He submitted that the next Sunday i.e. on Aug 7 would be 9th Muharram and after that Independence Day (Aug 14) will also fall on a Sunday. He said by then the mandatory constitutional provision to hold by-election within 60 days would also exceed.

4,Sindh health dept tight-lipped after spinal injection causes adverse reactions in female patients,Draps asks company to withdraw stocks.,"KARACHI: Several female patients at different hospitals have reported complications after being administered a commonly used spinal anaesthesia during labour over the past 10 days, it emerged on Friday. 
Sources said the condition of some patients turned critical and they had to be shifted to intensive care units. 
No exact data on the number of cases or mortality was available since the hospitals where these cases had been reportedly occurred simply declined to share information when contacts were made for verification. 
The situation, sources said, had so far failed to attract due attention and required urgency from the health department that had limited itself to mere data collection and that job, too, had largely been left to the hospitals where the cases had been reported. 

Draps asks company to withdraw stocks 

The health authorities, sources said had neither called any meeting of the experts concerned so far, nor had asked health facilities to stop using the drug causing the adverse reactions. 
More importantly, there was no exercise on the part of the health department to pick up suspected drug samples for investigation. 
No forum, the sources said, was available to patients suffering in ignorance to seek compensation. 
A July 13 letter of the Directorate General, Health Services, Sindh, says “It is to inform you that various hospitals of Sindh province have reported an increased number of adverse effects/events after administration of Sensocain (Bupivacaine) drug through route spinal anaethesia for Caesarean section. 
“Therefore, you are hereby advised to provide data from all major hospitals under your jurisdiction where Caesarean sections are being carried out before 4pm sharply on a daily basis.”
It is addressed to the heads of all major tertiary care hospitals in the province, district health officers and directors of health services of Larkana, Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Shaheed Benazirabad, and Sukkur. 
Director General Health Dr Juman Bahoto and representatives of the Brookes Pharma Pvt Ltd, the drug manufacturer, were not available for comments. 
When contacted on the actions taken so far, a spokesperson for the health department said, “We will do an analysis (of the data received from health facilities and concerned officials) after two weeks.”
One patient dies 
According to media reports, three cases of similar nature occurred on June 1 at the Mother and Child Hospital, part of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Islamabad, where a patient died while two others recovered. 
A week later, a drug control team visited the store of gynaecology ward in Pims and took six samples of medicines and surgical items for testing and sealed both the hospital and store. An inquiry is still under way. 
Responding to the situation, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) in a July 14 letter asked Brookes Pharma to immediately withdraw all the stocks of the suspected batch of the product. 
“Reports have been received from hospitals countrywide such as Patel Hospital, Karachi, Imam Clinic, Karachi, and Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Islamabad, regarding the occurrence of various adverse drug events/reactions including neurological symptoms such as behavioural changes, psychosis, irritability, agitation, disorientation, photophobia etc, in patients after the administration of subject mentioned batch (Batch No. 099D2) of product Sensocain Spinal 0.5% injection.
“Keeping in view of above, you are directed to immediately recall all the stocks of suspected batch of product Sensocain Spinal 0.5% injection, alert your sales officers/suppliers/distributors to issue instructions to the pharmacies/hospitals, point of sales/purchase/use for the return of suspected stocks of product in question. And submit a comprehensive report to this division within three days positively.”
Cases in 2004
Speaking to Dawn, Dr Mirza Ali Azhar, who retired as the head of the anaesthesia department at Sessi Landhi Hospital, said it wasn’t the first time that a drug used for spinal anaesthesia caused adverse reactions. 
“In 2004, I was the first to notice and report to the concerned company adverse reaction/s being caused by the drug, which claimed two lives. At that time, too, pregnant female patients were the victims of adverse reactions,” he recalled. 
The company (not Brookes), he said, withdrew the entire suspected batch of the product from the market and since then no case of similar nature had been reported in the country.
Explaining the reasons, he said since the country lacked a culture of thorough scientific investigation, it appeared that there was a problem with only a specific batch of the drug. 
“While we are hearing about a number of cases these days, I haven’t yet encountered a single case in which a female patient experienced adverse reaction/s despite using the same drug. It seems I am using the drug of a different batch number.”
According to Dr Azhar, also the past-immediate President of Pakistan Medical Association, the signs of adverse reactions appear in most cases after 24 hours and there is no harm to the baby. 
He called for what he described as “fearless reporting of the cases” to avoid future complications in patients. 
“Unfortunately, inquiries in our country are conducted either to hush up the matter or there is an ill-intention to target someone. Hence, people are reluctant to share information.”

6,Short story writer Naseem Kharal remembered on 44th death anniversary,Murad says Naseem Kharal chair to be set up at Khairpur University,"KARACHI: Speakers shed light on life and work of distinguished short story writer Naseem Kharal at an event organised on the occasion of his 44th death anniversary at the Arts Council of Pakistan Karachi on Thursday evening.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and his predecessor Syed Qaim Ali Shah were special guests at the event, which was presided over by renowned writer Ghulam Nabi Mughal. 
Murad Ali Shah lauded the contribution to the world of literature of the late Naseem Kharal. Mentioning some of the short stories he’s read, Mr Shah said the author through his tales highlights the mentality of his characters, arguing to date we haven’t come out of that zehniat. 
Referring to the culture minister’s intentions of publishing Mr Kharal’s complete works soon, the chief minister claimed the publishing of the book would pass on the rich culture of Sindhi literature to our coming generations. He then briefly addressed the audience in Urdu on the prevailing turbulent political situation in the province, underlining the fact that Sindh is a land of Sufis which for centuries has accepted with open arms anyone who has come to it. 

Murad says Naseem Kharal chair to be set up at Khairpur University

The chief minister, after seeking permission from Qaim Ali Shah, made a few announcements the foremost of which was that a Naseem Kharal chair will be instituted at Khairpur University. 
Qaim Ali Shah praised Mr Kharal as a writer in his unique style and told the attendees a couple of socially relevant stories related to the personality for whom everyone had gathered at the council.
Mr Mughal went down memory lane about his association with the late writer and spoke about the importance of setting up a translation bureau, as had been suggested by a speaker before the chief guests.
Earlier, DIG-South Sharjeel Kharal, who is the nephew of Naseem Kharal, said he recently started taking a deep interest in the personality and literature produced by the writer, which would continue to grow. “My late uncle was born into a land owning family in Khairpur district. After doing his bachelor of art and bachelor of law, he married his first cousin in 1959. His interest in literature began while studying with his uncle who happened to be my grandfather and his would-be father-in-law, at that time a sitting justice in the judiciary. 
“What was perfunctory during his high school days developed into a full-blooded passion for writing during his final year in college. That passion enriched Sindhi literature with a considerable number of short stories. Apart from some critical and satirical articles, he also wrote semi-humorous columns for a periodical which he edited for some time. Two collections of his short stories — Shabnam Shabnam Kanwal Kanwal and Chotihoon Dar — were published in his lifetime while his third collection Dummy came out posthumously in 1984.
“As a story writer he comes across as a fine craftsman… His prose is straightforward without being poignant. He doesn’t push around words,” said Sharjeel Kharal after which he spoke about the author’s personality.
Arts Council president Ahmed Shah emphasising the importance of creative individuals said it’s the writers who build nations. Even after 44 years of his passing, Naseem Kharal and his work are alive, he added.
Education and Culture Minister Syed Sardar Shah likened Naseem Kharal to a dream. He said his department will publish the writer’s complete works and establish a translation bureau.
Mumtaz Bukhari, Ibrahim Kharal, Shabnam Gul, Mukhtiar Malik, Faisal Dara Shikoh (the author’s son) and Naeem Kharal (the writer’s brother) also spoke. Naseer Mirza moderated the programme, which was arranged by the culture department.
