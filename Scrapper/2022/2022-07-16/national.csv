0,More rainfall brings further destruction for already ravaged Balochistan,"So far, six people have been injured in rain-related accidents, while major bridges have been washed away.","QUETTA: Already reeling from the destruction caused during the first spell of monsoon rains earlier this month, the second bout of torrential rains brought further misery for the people of Balochistan, flooding their homes and washing away bridges, roads and other infrastructure.
So far, six people have been injured in rain-related accidents, while major bridges have been washed away, leaving many areas disconnected from other parts of the country.
Several rivers have flooded in Sibi and Lasbela districts since the start of second monsoon spell on July 14. At least 10 villages were submerged in Bela Town area of Lasbela, forcing the people to leave their homes.
In Leyri area, six people including women and children got injured when roof of a mud house collapsed, while a dozen of houses have been badly damaged, according to local administration.
A major portion of a bridge in Bela Town was washed away due to floods leaving the traffic between Quetta and Karachi suspended for more than 24 hours.
In Harnai, Ziarat, Loralai, Zhob, Sherani, Qila Abdullah and Qila Saifullah districts, persistent rainfall has increased the threat of flash-floods as various dams and reservoirs have been filled to maximum capacity.
According to the local administration, Winder River was receiving heavy inflow of water from catchment areas that have been receiving continuous rainfall since last night.
The situation in Sibi and Bolan districts was also worsening as heavy rain continued for the last 48 hours, which resulted in flooding in Bolan and Nari rivers.
The Nari River, which is the second largest river of Balochistan, is currently carrying around 90,000 to 100,000 cusecs of water at many points.
Sibi Assistant Commissioner Sana Mahjabeen Umrani said that several villages in Gharibabd and Allahabad areas were badly affected and the local administration is making efforts to rescue people to safe places
A big portion of a bridge connecting Mach with the Quetta-Sukkur Highway once again collapsed due to heavy flooding in Bolan River.
“Bolan River is carrying around 40,000 cusecs of water, which is expected to increase as downpour continues in the area,” a senior irrigation engineer told Dawn.
He added that six barrages have been constructed at Bolan River to protect the area from major damage in case of floods. He said that these barrages will provide irrigation water for over 200,000 acres of land in Kachhi district.
However, the rainfall has also spelled a positive omen for Karachi residents as a major source of water supply to the city, the Hub Dam, was almost filled to its maximum capacity.
Officials have said that the spillways will be opened once the dam is filled completely, adding that with its current storage, the dam can supply water to Karachi for three years.

Abu Dhabi will be the preferred location for the operational hub of AIIB, as decided by the board of directors, to be the bank’s first overseas office.
An AIIB press release said the hub will provide AIIB with a robust platform to enable effective supervision of its growing investment portfolio and strengthen its project monitoring and implementation services across the globe.
As one of AIIB’s founding members, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is one of the region’s fastest-growing economies and has been actively promoting green transition.
A formal agreement for the hub will be finalised during the coming weeks. The UAE has been designated as the preferred location for the hub because it best fits the bank’s selection criteria, in particular superb connectivity to the AIIB’s global membership.
The hub is designated as an “interim” operation for the purposes of gaining experience prior to establishing AIIB’s long-term global presence. The bank will seek board’s authorisation to open additional offices to better serve its growing roster of clients and expanding stakeholder communities.
AIIB now has a total of 105 members, starting with 57 founding members in 2016. It has developed a portfolio of 181 projects in 33 member countries.

4,"Shehbaz Sharif speaks to Chaudhry Nisar, condoles over nephew’s death","Captain Nauman, Chaudhry Nisar’s nephew, died recently in a road accident in Rawat Chak Bailey Road.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke to former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan by phone on Friday and offered condolences over the death of his nephew.
Captain Nauman, Chaudhry Nisar’s nephew, died recently in a road accident in Rawat Chak Bailey Road.
According to a statement issued by Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, Chaudhry Nisar thanked the prime minister for his gesture.
The former interior minister, once a close aide to PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, had left the party in 2017 after developing differences with the latter and his daughter Maryam Nawaz over handling of the situation after the Supreme Court’s verdict in the Panama Papers case.
Chaudhry Nisar contested elections for the National Assembly and the Punjab legislature in 2018 as an independent candidate and won the provincial assembly seat. But he did not take oath as member of the Punjab Assembly until May last year in protest against alleged rigging in the 2018 elections, stating that “my NA victory stolen in favour of PTI candidate Ghulam Sarwar Khan”.
Chaudhry Nisar had been elected from Punjab Assembly’s constituency PP-10 Rawalpindi-V with a margin of over 34,000 votes, but he lost the NA-59 election.
His vote in the provincial assembly will be valuable during the coming election for chief minister as a tough contest is expected between the PML-N’s Hamza Shehbaz and the PTI– PML-Q nominee, Chaudhry Parvez Elahi.

6,"Imran, Maryam make last-ditch effort to woo voters","PTI chief warns CEC, Mr X and admin ‘rigging’ will make country worse than Sri Lanka","LAHORE: PTI chairman Imran Khan on Friday warned Mr X, the chief election commissioner and the civil administration that any attempt to rig Punjab’s by-elections tomorrow would lead the country towards a situation worse than in Sri Lanka, where the prime minister’s house was set on fire and the president had to flee. 
Explaining the conseque­nces of any rigging attempt, Mr Khan stressed that the Sri Lankan government faced the wrath of 12.5 million people, whereas Pakistan was a country of 220m.  
Insisting that Pakistanis would never accept a rigged poll, he said: “I will prefer to embrace death than accepting slavery of looters and thieves imposed by their foreign masters.” 
The nation had decided to wage a “jihad” against corrupt elements and the looters of public wealth, the former prime minister said, adding that any attempt to stop people from getting rid of an “unconstitutional government in Punjab” would lead to serious consequences. 

PTI chief warns CEC, Mr X and admin ‘rigging’ will make country worse than Sri Lanka

While expressing the hope that the PTI would win most seats, Mr Khan asked the youth and polling agents to stay alert on the polling day and ensure that no one rigs the elections.  
The PTI chairman on Friday made whirlwind visits and addressed public meetings in by-election constituencies in Faisalabad (PP-97) and Lahore (PP-168, PP-167 and PP-170) as the election campaign concluded at midnight, a day before the by-elections in 20 constituencies in 14 districts across the province. 
He launched a tirade against Chief Election Com­missioner Sikandar Sultan Raja and asked him to resign after the commission admitted in the Lahore High Court that millions of voters had been declared dead beca­use of a computer mistake.  
The PTI chairman also chided the CEC for continuously visiting Lahore and “bowing before unconstitutional CM Hamza Shehbaz” and “all-time liar Maryam Nawaz”. Mr Khan also sho­wed different video clips of former premier Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and CM Hamza Shehbaz and asserted that all these were prone to corruption.  
The PTI chairman also warned that the DIG (Ope­rations) Lahore and CCPO Lahore would soon be brought in the dock for their “illegal actions” against peaceful PTI workers, who marched on Islamabad in May.  
Referring to “neutrals”, Mr Khan said they should explain that how a watchman could stay neutral when thieves and dacoits attacked the home being guarded by him.  
Addressing the last mass public meeting in PP-170, the PTI chairman asked the Sup­reme Court to try him under Article 6, as asked by a jud­ge, and added that he would explain everything surrounding the cipher, no-confidence movement, toppling of his government and the looters and thieves coming to power.

7,"Imran, Maryam make last-ditch effort to woo voters",Maryam says Imran forgot he committed pre-poll rigging during own tenure,"LAHORE: Political arch-rivals PTI and PML-N made a last-ditch effort on Friday to woo voters in Punjab ahead of Sunday’s high-stakes by-elections, with PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz offering a message of “love, peace and unity” to the country’s youth, including Pakist­­an Tehreek-i-Insaf supporters. 
“I don’t want a fight (with the PTI). I want Pakistan to progress,” Ms Nawaz told a rally of the party-backed candidate — PTI dissident Sal­man Naeem — in Multan. “I am taking this initiative only for Pakistan. And I also ask [PTI chairman] Imran Khan to let the country progress.” 
However, she warned the former prime minister and his party that her “offer of peace” should not be taken as her or PML-N’s weakness and that she knew “how to give a tit-for-tat response”. 
The by-elections on 20 seats of the Punjab Assembly — which Mr Khan has characterised as a battle for “good versus evil” — are due on Sunday. The seats are among the 25 vacated (including five reserved) by the Election Com­­mission of Pakistan (ECP) over defection after PTI dissident lawmakers who voted for Ha­­mza Shehbaz in the Punjab chief minister’s election.

Maryam says Imran forgot he committed pre-poll rigging during own tenure

The stakes are high because the outcome of the elections will determine who will become chief minister in Punjab, the re-election for which will be held on July 22.
Both parties have been claiming that their victory is assured.
While Ms Nawaz exten­ded a hand of friendship to PTI supporters during her Multan address, she continued to pillory Imran Khan, his wife, Bushra Bibi, and her friend Farah Khan for their alleged corruption, political victimisation of PML-N leaders and ruining the country. 
She said PTI supporters should not waste their votes and instead back PML-N’s candidates for the progress of Punjab. She was also critical of the PTI-PML-Q joint candidate Parvez Elahi.
Maryam Nawaz said Imran Khan was criticising the ECP earlier in the day for “pre-poll rigging” but he forgot that how he himself committed rigging during his tenure. 
She also targeted the ECP for allegedly making the Re­­­sults Transmission Sys­tem (RTS) ineffective in 2018 and the NAB for presenting one excuse or an­­ot­her to delay her court appe­als against her conviction in a corruption reference.
‘Lions to bring prosperity’
Earlier, at a workers’ convention in Lahore, Ms Nawaz said the by-elections were not a war between PML-N and PTI, but they were a “battle for the development of Lahore”.
She said that in the last four years, the PTI had turned the city into a “dungeon” and it “was left to fend for itself”.

8,Additional troops to be deployed during Punjab by-polls,"Four constituencies in Lahore, one each in Multan and Bhakkar declared sensitive.","ISLAMABAD: The federal government has decided to beef up security in six sensitive constituencies of Punjab where by-polls are scheduled to take place on Sunday amidst heightened political tensions.
A meeting chaired by Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah on Friday was told that four constituencies in Lahore and one each in Multan and Bhakkar are sensitive. The meeting decided to deploy the Frontier Constabulary and Rangers to ensure security and law and order during the crucial by-polls on 20 seats of the Punjab Assembly, said a statement issued by the interior ministry. 
The meeting took place a day after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) took notice of reports about the presence of armed men in various constituencies of Punjab and sought army’s deployment in sensitive constituencies. 
On the basis of intelligence reports, the meeting decided to ban entry of “miscreant elements” into the constituencies where by-polls are set to take place. It reviewed reports that at least 300 armed men have been brought from Gujrat to Lahore to disrupt peace during the by-polls. The meeting decided to take pre-emptive measures to ensure that such armed persons cannot affect the law and order situation during the elections. 

Four constituencies in Lahore, one each in Multan and Bhakkar declared sensitive

It was decided that there would be complete ban on carrying or displaying arms and ammunition in those constituencies of Punjab and Sindh where by-polls are being held. The meeting also decided that violators would be immediately arrested and their weapons and licences confiscated. 
“We will not allow presence of miscreants and armed men in the constituencies,” the interior minister said, adding that law enforcement agencies and the provincial government should ensure ban on carrying of weapons. He directed the provincial administration to show zero tolerance for such persons and also keep an eye as some miscreants have been brought from other provinces to those constituencies of Punjab where by-polls would be held. 
The meeting decided to set up a special control room at the interior ministry to continuously monitor the law and order situation on July 16 and 17. 
The interior minister directed the secretary interior to ensure implementation of the decisions taken during the meeting. “It is our national duty to ensure law and order during the election,” the minister was quoted as saying during the meeting. 
Mr Sanaullah said the government would use all available resources to ensure security arrangement during the by-elections as directed by the ECP, adding that all civil armed forces under the interior ministry would assist the provincial governments of Punjab and Sindh to ensure security during the by-polls. 
Punjab Home Minister Atta Tarar, Interior Secretary Yousaf Naseem Khokhar, Chief Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal, Inspector General of Police Rao Sardar Ali Khan and senior officials of the army and civil administration attended the meeting. 
Earlier in the day, Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja contacted Interior Minister Sanaullah and discussed with the latter security arrangements for the by-polls. 
Meanwhile, the ECP said all necessary arrangements for holding by-elections in 20 Punjab Assembly constituencies, including printing of ballot papers had been completed. The commission issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) for polling staff to conduct by-polls in Punjab. 
The ECP asked the candidates to ensure training of their polling agents and instruct them not to leave the polling station without receiving the presiding officer’s verified Form 45. 
The election campaign came to a close at 12pm on the night between Friday and Saturday, with the ECP warning that any violation would entail action under the law.

9,Efforts on to allay tensions after days of violence in Sindh,Sindh govt asks FIA to move against social media accounts fanning hate; political leaders reiterate calls for calm.,"KARACHI: With violence escalating in the wake of the killing of 35-year-old Bilal Kaka, political leaders continued efforts to allay the tensions and appealed to people to beware of conspiracies that aim to sow the seed of disharmony among Sindhis and Pashtuns.
On Friday, the Sindh government announced that another suspect accused of Mr Kaka’s killing was in custody, while 76 people involved in the violence at Karachi’s Sohrab Goth area, as well as forcibly closing businesses in other districts, have also been arrested.
Hyderabad SSP Amjad Sheikh told Dawn that the suspect, Afzal Khan, was the brother of Shah Sawar, the hotel owner who was already in custody. 
In a press conference, Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon claimed that social media accounts of deceased people were used to circulate hate messages and share videos to further fuel tensions.

Sindh govt asks FIA to move against social media accounts fanning hate; political leaders reiterate calls for calm; another suspect held for Kaka’s murder

He said the federal interior ministry had been asked to take action against those spreading hatred on social media, he said, while warning that such miscreants will be arrested.
The minister alleged that the PTI leaders tried to exploit the situation and spread chaos to further their own vested interests.
“Special Branch has sent photos of people leading the Sohrab Goth sit-in. The same person was [previously] walking around with the flag of Afghanistan and his brother is contesting local bodies elections on a PTI ticket,” he added.
‘Pashtuns playing vital role in Sindh’s economy’
On Friday, Acting Sindh Governor Agha Siraj Durrani met a 19-member delegation from the Pashtun community at the Governor’s House, where the delegates assured him of their complete support for the Sindh government in defusing tensions and maintaining the peace.
Separately, Karachi JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that ethnic polarisation was being fanned for political point-scoring in the wake of Mr Kaka’s murder.
Addressing a press conference at Idara Noor-e-Haq in Karachi, the JI leader said that some political parties who have lost popular support are attempting to regain the people’s sympathies by exploiting the situation.
Also on Friday, an MQM-Pakistan delegation, led by deputy convener Waseem Akhtar met ANP Sindh president Shahi Syed at Bacha Khan House in Karachi.
Mr Akhtar condemned the Pashtun community’s victimisation in the backdrop of the killing. Calling Sindhis “his brothers”, he urged all sides to amicably resolve their differences. 
Sindh United Party (SUP) chairman Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah also appealed to nationalist leaders to avoid provocation and maintain peace in the province.
Addressing a press conference at the Hyderabad Press Club, Mr Shah said Pashtuns living in Sindh were their brothers, but called for the repatriation of illegal immigrants.
Protests over police inaction
Workers of the Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz and other activists held a demonstration in Mirpurkhas’ Naokot and Jhuddo town on Friday. Protesters carrying banners and placards demanded the police to immediately arrest all the accused responsible for Mr Kaka’s killing. 
Separately, activists from the Awami Tehreek also staged a token hunger strike outside Hyde­r­abad Press Club on Friday against the alleged maltreatment of Sindhi families during protests at several locations in Karachi on Thursday.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also issued a statement expressing concern over the “escalation in ethnic and political tension in Sindh.”
The commission called for a “fair and transparent” investigation into the killing and demanded the Sindh government to control violence. “At the same time, it falls to the authorities as well as to all progressive voices in Pakistan to shun divisive or racist rhetoric,” the statement added.
The HRCP said it intends to conduct a fact-finding mission to ascertain the evidence surrounding the murder and ensuing ethnic tension.
While condemning the murder and subsequent violence that took place in Karachi, on Friday, said some miscreants tried to use the incident to “pit brothers against each other on linguistic basis”.

11,SC ruling makes national security subject to judicial review,"Court provides reasons why restraint exercised by judiciary in national security should ""not be absolute"".","THE Supreme Court’s July 13 verdict on the then deputy speaker Qasim Suri’s ruling has propounded a ‘new concept’ when it highlighted that any defence or immunity claimed by the government on a policy or decision on the grounds of national security cannot escape judicial review unless substantiated with evidence. 
“It is clear that the bona fides of the (PTI) government’s defen­­ce of national security must be substantiated by evidence to justify the April 3 Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri’s ruling,” says the 87-page unanimous judgment, which was authored by Chief Jus­tice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial and concurred by rest of the four judges of the Supreme Court namely Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan, Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel, Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel. 
“This tends to show that no excuse or justification can be claimed by the government on any policy of sensitive nature if it involves rights of the citizens or considered to be unconstitutional unless the government comes out with a solid reasons to justify the defence,” commented a senior counsel on condition of anonymity. 
Usually courts avoid interfering into foreign policy or defence matters whenever the national security issue is raised, he said, adding that the apex court explained in the ruling that “the restraint exercised by the courts in matters of national security should not be absolute”. 

Court provides reasons why restraint exercised by judiciary in national security should ‘not be absolute’

Senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui, when approached, was in agreement that the Supreme Court through the July 13 judgement had brought forward a concept that he dubbed as “doctrine of limited judicial review in terms of the national security”, and touched upon for the first time the issue in an elaborate manner. 
While hearing cases such as the issue of missing persons, courts including the Islamabad High Court (IHC) usually disregarded such claims on part of the government and this was for the first time that the apex court came out with an explanation in a clear manner on what grounds the court could “interfere or not interfere”, he said. 
The senior counsel also referred to the ‘Memogate’ scandal in which the government of the time had taken the plea of political question in the case, but the apex court rejected it and did not explain reasons in a detailed manner why it was taking up the matter. 
“From now on, the governments will have to show bona fide of its defence why a court cannot lay its hands on the decision by taking refuge of national security. Thus, any logic based on frivolous grounds can be ignored by the courts,” Mr Siddiqui believed. 
A senior Supreme Court lawyer Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar described the present precedent of the Supreme Court as “a big step towards enforcement of citizens’ fundamental rights in Pakistan”, which would provide the space of judicial review relating to government’s action on the touchstone of enforcement of fundamental rights. Also the court could decide further whether an action of government was based on bona fide or not, he added. 
Simultaneously, Mr Khokhar said, the judgement would bind the government to place evidence in support of their claim in matters of alleged national security; would not automatically claim the judicial restraint by mere assertion in matters of national security; and would not deny fundamental rights to citizens. 
He was of the opinion that despite adopting a cautious approach in the matters of determination of national security, the apex court categorically held for the first time while discussing previous domestic and international judgments that there would be no absolute or blanket immunity available against the judicial review in matters of national security and thus matters, if proved otherwise, would be justifiable for court’s jurisdiction. 
According to the constitutional expert, the government will be under obligation in future to justify by producing evidence in support of an action that this matter squarely falls within the ambit of national security, otherwise the superior court can take cognizance of the same and strike it down for violation of fundamental rights. 
In the July 13 ruling, the SC also mentioned the Memogate case by recalling how in the case of 2012 Watan Party, a number of constitutional petitions were filed by different persons seeking a probe into the memo drafted by a former ambassador of Pakistan to the US for the then US Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS). 
After examining the record produced by the parties, which included admissions made by the government representatives and by the CJCS that the memo existed, the apex court in its latest ruling rejected the defence of “political question” raised by the government on the touchstone of the fundamental rights. 
In the case, the aggrieved parties invoked the court jurisdiction and the evidence of admissions was brought on record but the government was disinclined to appoint an inquiry commission, the verdict explained, adding that the apex court amid these circumstances had formed a judicial commission to probe the origin, authenticity and purpose of the memo. 
The ruling stated such prerequisites were lacking in the case at hand and therefore the respondent’s (PTI) plea that the SC should take up the matter of national security as well as allegation of breach of sovereignty was without precedent. The court, however, appreciated relucta­nce by the counsel representing the previous go­­v­ernment from sharing the cipher message of March 7 or to make a full disclosure of its content. 
The cipher was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by a senior Pakistani diplomat stationed in a foreign capital alleging that it established that the no-trust motion by the then opposition parties against then premier Imran Khan was moved at the behest of a foreign state. 
Giving reasons why the restraint exercised by the courts in the matters of national security should not be absolute, the judgement also cited one of the rulings of the House of Lords in which it was held that the judicial review was “permissible but only on narrow grounds”. 
In a citation on Application for Judicial Review, Law and Practice by Graham Aldus and John Alder, the ruling highlighted, “There is a general presumption against ousting the jurisdiction of the courts, so that statutory provisions which purport to exclude judicial review are construed restrictively.”  
“There are, however, certain areas of governmental activity, national security being the paradigm, which the courts regard themselves as incompetent to investigate, beyond an initial decision as to whether the government’s claim is bona fide.”  
“In this kind of non-justiciable area judicial review is not entirely excluded, but very limited.”
