0,India exempted from sanctions over Russia trade,"US law deems waiver ""necessary"" to counter China’s growing global influence.","WASHINGTON: The US House of Representative has passed a legislative amendment that would protect India from punitive sanctions for buying missiles from Russia. 
The India-specific amendment, passed on Thursday afternoon, still has to go through the Senate before it’s signed by President Joe Biden. 
Authored and introduced by Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna, it urges the Biden administration to give India a waiver to the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which can bring immediate sanctions against New Delhi for buying weapons from Moscow. 
The amendment argues that such a waiver is needed to deter China’s influence in the region. It was passed by voice vote as part of an en bloc amendment during floor consideration of the US defence bill for 2023. 

US law deems waiver ‘necessary’ to counter China’s growing global influence 

The United States views India as a key ally in its effort to counter China’s growing global influence and has also included it in the alliance known as ‘Quad’ that aims to counter China in the Pacific region.
Enacted by the US Congress in 2017, CAATSA provides for punitive actions against any country engaged in transactions with Russian defence and intelligence sectors. 
CAATSA became a sticking point in India-US ties after New Delhi inked a deal to secure the S-400 missile defence system from Moscow, in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine war. 
India has also violated US sanctions on buying oil from Russia. 
In May, Senator Bob Menendez, who heads the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, pointed out at a congressional hearing that the Indians “go buy oil from Russia. They buy the S-400 [anti-missile system]. They abstain at the United Nations [on votes criticising Russia]” and yet they were never punished for these violations. 
Mr Khanna, who is Vice Chair of the India Caucus in the US Congress, however, urged Washington to “stand with India in the face of escalating aggression from China”. 
The Reuters news agency reported this week that India’s oil imports from Russia surged to a record of around 950,000 barrels per day (bpd) in June, as Indian refiners snapped up Russian oil sold at hefty discounts. 
India shipped in about 4.8 million bpd of oil in June, about 23 per cent higher than a year earlier, the report added.

1,Businessman acquitted of bombing killed in Canada,"The attack on the flight, which exploded over Atlantic Ocean in 1985, is one of the deadliest bombings of a commercial airliner.","OTTAWA: A man was shot dead in British Columbia on Thursday who local media reports said was Ripudaman Singh Malik, a Canadian Sikh businessman acquitted in connection with the 1985 Air India bombing that killed 329 people. 
Police, in a statement res­ponding to a Reuters request for information on Malik’s death, said they found a man suf­f­ering from gunshot wou­nds when officers respo­nded to a reported shooting just before 9:30am (1630 GMT). 
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s (RCMP) statement did not name the man but said he died on the scene in Surrey, British Columbia. An RCMP spokesperson said they could not name the victim and that the investigation was ongoing. 
Local media, citing sou­rces and a witness, reported that the man was Malik. 
The attack on Air India Flight 182, which exploded over the Atlantic Ocean in 1985, is one of history’s deadliest bombings of a commercial airliner. 
Police have alleged it was plotted by Sikh extremists living in Canada as revenge on India for its storming of Sikhism’s Golden Temple in Amritsar in 1984. The RCMP, in its statement on Thursday, said the killing appeared to be targeted and that they had found a suspect vehicle fully engulfed in fire. 
Authorities were still looking for the suspects and a second vehicle that may have been used as getaway vehicle, the RCMP added. 
Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri, a sawmill worker in Kamloops, British Columbia, were charged in 2000 with bombing Flight 182. They were also charged with killing two baggage handlers who died when a suitcase bomb, alleged by police as designed to destroy another Air India jet over the Pacific Ocean, exploded in Japan’s Narita airport.

2,"Wickremesinghe takes over, election of new Sri Lankan president due on 20th",Top court bars Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s brothers from leaving country.,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s parliament acce­pted the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Friday after he fled the country, paving the way for lawmakers to start repairing the island’s shattered politics and resume efforts to ease its economic crisis. 
Sri Lankans will now have to wait for lawmakers to elect a new president on July 20. 
Until then, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be the interim president although protesters want him gone too. His private residence was set ablaze by demonstrators last weekend and his office stormed this week. 
Nevertheless, the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party on Friday nominated Wickremesinghe to take up the top job full-time. 

Top court bars Rajapaksa’s brothers from leaving country

“Ranil Wickremesinghe is not the change we have fought so hard for,” said Wimal Jayasuriya, 43, a martial arts specialist who is on a hunger strike opposite the prime minister’s official residence that was also sacked by protesters. 
“We will not allow him to be president. The SLPP parliamentarians should stand with the people and not allow Ranil Wickremesinghe to become president.” 
The speaker of parliament, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said lawmakers would “constitutionally appoint a new president”. 
“It will happen quickly and successfully. I request everyone to support this process,” said Abeywardena, who received Rajapaksa’s resignation the previous night. 
Rajapaksa landed in Singapore on Thursday, having fled to the Maldives early on Wednesday on a military jet along with his wife and two security guards. Protesters occupied his home and office last weekend after surging past armed guards. 
Sri Lanka’s top court on Friday barred two of his brothers, former prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and former finance minister Basil Rajapaksa, from leaving the country without permission until July 28, according to anti-corruption group Transparency International Sri Lanka. 
The group approached the court seeking “action against persons responsible for the current economic crisis”. 
A lawyer for the brothers did not respond to calls from Reuters.
“We are so happy today that he resigned and we feel that when we, the people, come together, we can do everything,” said Aruna­n­andan, 34, a schoolteacher who had been camping at the main protest site opposite the presidential secretariat for the past three months. “We are the real power in this country.” 
Speaker Abeywardena said he hoped to complete the process of selecting a new president within a week. Parliament would reconvene on Saturday and be notified formally of the vacancy at the top, with a vote for a new president set for July 20.
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka, an influential lawyers’ collective, called on parliament to ensure that the election of Rajapaksa’s successor is held without delay. 
The opposition’s presidential nominee is Sajith Premadasa, while the potential dark horse is senior lawmaker Dullas Alahapperuma. 
After he was sworn in by the chief justice as interim president, Wickremesinghe said he would follow the constitutional process and establish law and order in the country. 
He also vowed to start moves to increase parliament’s powers and reduce those of the president, as demanded by protesters. 
“This change can be completed by the new president once he is elected by parliament next week,” Wickrem­esinghe said.

3,UN sounds ‘red alert’ on immunisation backslide,25 million children missed out on one or more doses of key vaccines last year.,"NEW YORK: Increased misinformation and the disruption of global supply chains due to Covid are behind the biggest sustained drop in childhood vaccinations in three decades, a UN report said. 
The percentage of children who received three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) fell five percentage points between 2019 and 2021 to 81 per cent, according to official data published Thursday by WHO and Unicef. 
This vaccine is used as a marker for immunisation coverage within and across countries. 
Catherine Russell, Unicef executive director, said the slide “is a red alert for child health”. “We are witnessing the largest sustained drop in childhood immunisation in a generation. The consequences will be measured in lives,” she added. 

25 million children missed out on one or more doses of key vaccines last year

Some 25 million children missed out on one or more doses of DTP in 2021, two million more than those who missed out in 2020 and six million more than in 2019, putting a growing number of children at risk from preventable disease. 
The slide was attributed to multiple factors, including an increased number of children living in conflict zones, rising misinformation and service and supply disruptions from the Covid pandemic, and lockdowns that limited outreach campaigns. 
The pandemic “compelled parents and families to pick between putting food on the table and getting their children vaccinated,” said Kate O’Brien, director of the WHO’s immunisation, vaccines and biologicals department. 
Of the 25 million, 18m did not receive a single dose of DTP during 2021, “the vast majority of whom live in low- and middle-income countries,” a statement said. 
Ethiopia, India, Indo­nesia, Nigeria and the Philippines recorded the highest numbers of zero-dose children. Around the world, a quarter of the coverage of human papillomavirus HPV vaccines achieved in 2019 has been lost, a blow in the fight against cervical cancers. 
Only 12 per cent of girls are fully protected, despite the first vaccines being licensed over 15 years ago. 
Observers had hoped 2021 would be a year of recovery after the lockdowns of 2020 — but instead it was the worst year for DTP coverage since 2008 and came against a backdrop of rising rates of severe acute malnutrition. 
“The convergence of a hunger crisis with a growing immunisation gap threatens to create the conditions for a child survival crisis,” the statement said. 
First dose measles coverage dropped to 81pc in 2021, also the lowest level since 2008. 
Declines were seen in every region, though some countries, including Pakis­tan and Uganda, bucked the negative trend. The global organisations called on countries to intensify their catch-up vaccination efforts.

4,"UAE mulls sending ambassador to Iran, after six years",UAE presidential adviser Anwar Gargash also calls for regional economic cooperation as a means of easing political tensions.,"DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates is considering sending an ambassador to Iran, a senior official said on Friday, six years after a downgrade in ties. 
UAE presidential adviser Anwar Gargash also called for regional economic cooperation as a means of easing political tensions. 
“We are now indeed considering sending an ambassador to Iran,” Gargash said during a video call with journalists. “The next decade cannot be like the last decade. It’s a decade where ‘de-escalation’ should be the key word.” 
With Middle East political alignments shifting, the UAE’s talk of strengthening Iran ties comes alongside Iraqi efforts to mediate between the Emirates’ neighbour Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
Riyadh and Tehran have had no diplomatic ties for six years, since Iranian protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran after the kingdom executed Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr. 
Riyadh responded by cutting relations with Tehran, while the UAE reduced its ties to the Islamic republic, without severing relations. Iran and the Emirates have been on opposite sides of the war in Yemen, where the UAE supports and trains forces as part of a Saudi-led coalition against Iran-backed Houthi rebels. 
A cross-border drone attack by the Yemeni rebels killed three oil workers in Abu Dhabi in January. Another source of rivalry has been the UAE’s claim to the Iran-controlled Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunb islands in the Gulf. 
“The UAE is not part of any axis against Iran,” Gargash said, urging “economic cooperation in various areas in order to create a greater political de-escalation”. 
The oil-rich UAE has previously said that Arab Gulf states should take part in “collective diplomacy” to reach an agreement with Iran, whose talks with Western powers over a faltering 2015 nuclear agreement have been stalled since March. 
In 2020, the Emirates established diplomatic relations with Israel, a move which Tehran condemned. Still, in July last year UAE Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan met Iranian charge d’ affaires Sayed Mohammad Hosseini to look at ways of enhancing bilateral cooperation.

5,The big default? Pakistan among a dozen countries in ‘danger zone’,"Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Russia, Suriname and Zambia already in default, Belarus on the brink.","LONDON: Traditional debt crisis signs of crashing currencies, 1,000 basis points bond spreads and burned foreign exchange reserves point to a record number of developing nations now in trouble.  
Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Russia, Suriname and Zambia are already in default, Belarus is on the brink and at least another dozen are in the danger zone as rising borrowing costs, inflation and debt all stoke fears of economic collapse.  
Totting up the cost is eye-watering. Using 1,000 basis points bond spreads as a pain threshold, analysts calculate $400 billion of debt is in play. Argentina has by far the most at over $150bn, while the next in line are Ecuador and Egypt with $40bn-$45bn.  
Crisis veterans hope many can still dodge default, especially if global markets calm and the IMF rows in with support, but these are the countries at risk. 

Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Russia, Suriname and Zambia already in default, Belarus on the brink  

ARGENTINA: The sovereign default world record holder looks likely to add to its tally. The peso now trades at a near 50 per cent discount in the black market, reserves are critically low and bonds trade at just 20 cents in the dollar — less than half of what they were after the country’s 2020 debt restructuring.  
The government doesn’t have any substantial debt to service until 2024, but it ramps up after that and concerns have crept in that powerful vice president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner may push to renege on the International Monetary Fund.  
UKRAINE: Russia’s invasion means Ukraine will almost certainly have to restructure its $20bn plus of debt, heavyweight investors such as Morgan Stanley and Amundi warn.  
The crunch comes in September when $1.2bn of bond payments are due. Aid money and reserves mean Kyiv could potentially pay. But with state-run Naftogaz this week asking for a two-year debt freeze, investors suspect the government will follow suit.  
TUNISIA: Africa has a cluster of countries going to the IMF but Tunisia looks one of the most at risk. A near 10pc budget deficit, one of the highest public sector wage bills in the world and there are concerns that securing, or at least sticking to, an IMF programme may be tough due to President Kais Saied’s push to strengthen his grip on power and the country’s powerful, incalcitrant labour union.  
Tunisian bond spreads — the premium investors demand to buy the debt rather than US bonds — have risen to over 2,800 basis points and along with Ukraine and El Salvador, Tunisia is on Morgan Stanley’s top three list of likely defaulters.  
GHANA: Furious borrowing has seen Ghana’s debt-to-GDP ratio soar to almost 85pc. Its currency, the cedi, has lost nearly a quarter of its value this year and it was already spending over half of tax revenues on debt interest payments. Inflation is also getting close to 30pc.  
EGYPT: The country has a near 95pc debt-to-GDP ratio and has seen one of the biggest exoduses of international cash this year — some $11bn according to JPMorgan. Fund firm FIM Partners estimates Egypt has $100bn of hard currency debt to pay over the next five years, including a meaty $3.3 billion bond in 2024.  
Cairo devalued the pound 15pc and asked the IMF for help in March but bond spreads are now over 1,200 basis points and credit default swaps (CDS) — an investor tool to hedge risk — price in a 55pc chance it fails on a payment.  
Francesc Balcells, CIO of EM debt at FIM Partners, estimates though that roughly half the $100bn Egypt needs to pay by 2027 is to the IMF or bilateral, mainly in the Gulf.  
KENYA: Kenya spends roughly 30pc of revenues on interest payments. Its bonds have lost almost half their value and it currently has no access to capital markets — a problem with a $2bn dollar bond coming due in 2024.  
On Kenya, Egypt, Tunisia and Ghana, Moody’s David Rogovic said: “These countries are the most vulnerable just because of the amount of debt coming due relative to reserves, and the fiscal challenges in terms of stabilising debt burdens.”  
ETHIOPIA: Addis Ababa plans to be one of the first countries to get debt relief under the G20 Common Framework programme. Progress has been held up by the country’s ongoing civil war though in the meantime it continues to service its sole $1bn international bond.  
EL SALVADOR: Making bitcoin legal tender all but closed the door to IMF hopes. Trust has fallen to the point where an $800 million bond maturing in six months trades at a 30pc discount and longer-term ones at a 70pc discount.  
PAKISTAN: Pakistan struck a crucial IMF deal this week. The breakthrough could not be more timely, with high energy import prices pushing the country to the brink of a balance of payments crisis.  
Foreign currency reserves have fallen to as low as $9.8bn, hardly enough for five weeks of imports. The Pakistani rupee has weakened to record lows. The new government needs to cut spending rapidly now as it spends 40pc of its revenues on interest payments.  
BELARUS: Western sanctions wrestled Russia into default last month and Belarus now facing the same tough treatment having stood with Moscow in the Ukraine campaign.  
ECUADOR: The Latin American country only defaulted two years ago but it has been rocked back into crisis by violent protests and an attempt to oust President Guillermo Lasso.  
It has lots of debt and with the government subsidising fuel and food JPMorgan has ratcheted up its public sector fiscal deficit forecast to 2.4pc of GDP this year and 2.1pc next year. Bond spreads have topped 1,500 bps.  
NIGERIA: Bond spreads are just over 1,000 bps, but Nigeria’s next $500m bond payment in a year’s time should easily be covered by reserves which have been steadily improving since June. It does though spend almost 30pc of government revenues paying interest on its debt.
