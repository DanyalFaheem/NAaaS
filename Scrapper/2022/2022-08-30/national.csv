“PTI Senator Shaukat Tarin’s purported audio leak in which he was asking Punjab and Khyber Pakhtun­khwa finance ministers Mohsin Leg­hari and Taimur Khan Jhagra, resp­ectively, to not sign the IMF progr­am­­me has exposed the PTI’s conspiracy against the country,” PML-N leader Hamza Shehbaz said in a statement on Monday.
The PPP accused PTI of hatching a conspiracy against the state by planning to refuse to surrender the surplus budgets of Punjab and KP to the federal government, thus endangering the government’s agreement with the IMF for the release of next tranche of its loan.
Reacting to the allegations, the PTI insisted that there was nothing wrong in the leaked conversations.

Hamza Shehbaz said the IMF programme was “very much essential” for the country’s economy. “Those conspiring against this programme are not sincere with Pakistan,” he said, adding that during the tenure of former prime minister Imran Khan, Pakistan’s relations with all friendly countries turned sour. “This man [Imran] is busy in doing politics even at a time when the country is hugely impacted by floods,” he lambasted.
PML-N’s Punjab information secretary Azma Bokhari said that after this audio leak there was no doubt that the PTI was treading on the path of anti-state. She said the PTI wanted to make this country bankrupt. “Imran Khan is trying to create a Sri Lanka-like situation, but the PML-N and its allies will not let Imran and PTI succeed in conspiracies,” she said.
Meanwhile, some PML-N women workers and lawmakers held a demonstration outside Lahore Press Club to condemn the PTI for “sabotaging the IMF deal”.
Governor rule
Separately, PPP’s central Punjab information secretary Shehzad Saeed Cheema said the leaked audio “is an open conspiracy against the state”. He said the judiciary and other state institutions should take immediate notice of the conspiracy.
The PPP leader warned that if the PTI-led provincial governments attempted to spoil the IMF agreement by refusing to surrender the surplus budgets, the federal government would be left with no option but to impose governor rules in Punjab and KP.
Mr Cheema demanded that the Federal Investigation Agency immediately conduct a forensic audit of the leaked audios to establish their authenticity. He regretted that at a time when 70 per cent of the country was under water due to heavy rains and floods, the ‘mischief-mongering’ group (PTI) was immersed in politics.
‘Nothing wrong’
Earlier, PTI leader Asad Umar, while speaking at a news conference along with KP Finance Minister Taimur Jhagra, said there was nothing wrong in the leaked conversations. He said it was a good advice and Imran Khan had also done the same thing and negotiated with the IMF when the Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak.
He said that being a former finance minister, Shaukat Tarin had every right to advise Mr Jhagra and Mr Leghari. “There is nothing wrong in Tarin speaking to Jhagra and Leghari on phone and giving advice.”
Mr Jhagra, while explaining the context of writing letter, said it also related to ex-Fata’s funding and other issues such as funds for tribal districts.
He said Finance Minister Miftah Ismail had kept delaying meetings with him on the issue despite the fact that KP and ex-Fata were also parts of Pakistan. He admitted that he wrote the letter and claimed that it was in the best interest of the people of Pakistan.

1,UN’s flash appeal today as flood aid trickles in,"Body says $34m urgently needed to ramp up relief efforts; Japan, Belgium, UAE, Singapore pledge aid.","ISLAMABAD: As the United Nations is all set to launch a $161 million ‘flash appeal’ on Tuesday (today) to provide critical food and cash assistance to Pakistan in the wake of unprecedented floods that have killed over 1,000 people and displaced millions, humanitarian aid supplies from across the world continued to arrive in the country on Monday.
Although the government and the humanitarian partners are working to provide immediate relief to the flood-hit populace, the United Nations urgently needs $34.28 million to scale up immediate relief efforts, Dawn has learnt.
UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Pakistan Julien Harneis called for “burden-sharing and solidarity” in the wake of a “climate-change driven catastrophe” which is expected to worsen. She said diseases and malnutrition are expected to rise in the post-floods scenario.
Meanwhile, the World Food Programme (WFP) is rapidly expanding its food assistance support in Pakistan. WFP aims to reach nearly half a million people in Balochistan — where it already supports nearly 42,000 people in five districts — and Sindh. However, distributions are currently on hold due to connectivity issues.

The United Arab Emirates began an air bridge to transport humanitarian aid to Pakistan that included shelter materials, food, and medical parcels. The UAE authorities also contacted Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa, APP reported. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said, “UAE has pledged 20 aircraft sorties flood relief equipment to assist the flood victims across Pakistan.”
Global aid
Japan also decided to provide emergency relief goods consisting of tents and plastic sheets through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The emergency relief goods are expected to arrive at the Jinnah International Airport, Karachi, today.
Furthermore, an emergency food relief project was signed by German Consul General Holger Ziegeler and Balochistan Rural Support Programme (BRSP) CEO Dr Shahnawaz Khan in Karachi to provide food aid to at least 1,000 families for two months in Lasbela.
The envoy stressed the swift response to mitigate the flood devastation and said: “We are shocked by the devastating Pakistan floods. Early response is crucial!”
Similarly, Belgium, via B-FAST, will offer Pakistan 300 tents to shelter a total of 1800 people.
On the other hand, the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) is committing $50,000 to support flood survivors and the affected communities. The SRC will also launch a public fundraising appeal to support the relief and recovery operations.
SRC’s contributions will directly support the humanitarian response by Red Cross and Red Crescent partners on the ground, including the Pakistan Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The PRCS is currently providing relief assistance in 23 of the most affected districts.
Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund
With over 670,000 households affected by the intense floods this season, the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) allocated Rs250 million for the flood emergency relief programme to provide immediate assistance in the nine worst-affected districts.
The relief package includes temporary shelters, food ration packs, hygiene kits, water purification tablets, medical supplies, livestock vaccination and other items of need.
Similarly, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) disbursed an amount of Rs 8.88 billion among the 353,119 flood-affected families under the BISP Emergency Flood Relief Cash Assistance Programme. BISP said affected families can send their CNIC number to 8171 to receive payments.
Corporate sector
The PTCL Group announced an Rs1.75 billion package in addition to the medical support, and the company has also decided to form a team of volunteers for the flood relief efforts. The PTCL health centers which include 13 doctors and 27 paramedical staff will extend required support in eight districts across the country.
The package also includes donations to the PM’s relief fund and NGOs along with the provision of free calls in flood-affected areas, housing loans to displaced people, and medical facilities. The management of PTCL also asked its employees and staff to voluntarily give donations for the flood relief efforts.
Meanwhile, Ufone announced free calls for people in the flood-hit regions. The U Microfinance Bank has pledged low-cost housing loans.

2,Ahsan blames PTI govt for higher flood losses,Alleges it did not implement Rs177bn flood protection scheme that could have minimised devastating impact of floods this year.,"ISLAMABAD: Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Monday alleged that the last PTI government during it tenure had not implemented the R177 billion flood protection programme that could have minimised the devastating impact of floods this year.
“During the last four years, the previous government did not spend a single penny from the National Flood Protection Programme (NFPP). As a result, the country is facing the worst calamity,” the minister said while speaking at a function on Waseela-i-Khurak — a pilot project for improved nutrition.
He regretted that the situation would have been quite different had the previous government taken the approved project forward, but they chose not to spend a single penny on the project. He said the NFPP was started for developing an integrated flood management system involving reservoir operations, flood forecasting and early warning, flood risk zoning and watershed management with an allocation of Rs177bn. No progress was made which led the country to face the worst calamity, he added.
“The current flood situation could have been different had some work been done by the previous government through the NFPP,” he said while highlighting the fresh challenges which need to be addressed immediately.
The minister said the recent flood had not only claimed human lives but also affected the infrastructure and livelihood at large. The damage caused to crops and livelihood will certainly result in severe food insecurity in the months to come, he warned. “It is time to scale up the piloted initiatives, particularly the food bank model, to curb food insecurity at large to sustain our current indicators of nutrition.”

3,SC to take up Tarin’s challenge to NAB case on Sept 1,Ex-minister wants top court to declare reference in  Rental Power Project case against him ‘illegal’.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court will take up on Sept 1 a 2018 plea filed by former finance minister Shaukat Fayaz Ahmed Tarin challenging the institution of a corruption reference against him by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) over the Rental Power Project (RPP) controversy.
A two-judge Supreme Court bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Ayesha Malik will take up the petition filed in June 2018 through senior counsel Salman Aslam Butt to seek quashment of the 2014 reference.
In the petition, Mr Tarin has requested the Supreme Court to declare the reference as illegal, without jurisdiction and without lawful effect, besides setting aside the April 17, 2018, order of maintaining it by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The petitioner argues that the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO) is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution and consequently all actions taken under it are illegal, void, without lawful authority and of no legal effect.

Ex-minister wants top court to declare reference in RPP case against him ‘illegal’

The petition also requested the top court to stay the operation of all proceedings in connection with the reference during the pendency of the case.
The corruption reference was filed after the 2012 judgement of the Supreme Court in the RPP case. But the petition argued that RPP policy was initiated in 2006, prior to the term of the petitioner as the finance minister.
In March 2008, the then PPP government had decided that the Pakistan Electric Power Company (Pvt) Ltd (Pepco) will arrange RPP projects of up to 1,067 megawatts to cope with the energy shortfall which was then prevalent in the country.
Subsequently on May 11, 2008, the water and power ministry moved a summary in the cabinet for setting up of Independent Power Projects (IPPs) of 1,000MW in the private sector and RPPs for 200MW, through international competitive bidding, which was approved by the cabinet.
On Sept 7, 2008, the ministry submitted another summary for the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet proposing to enhance the approved power capacity of RPPs, which was also approved by the ECC.
In pursuance of the Supreme Court judgement, NAB initiated an inquiry through its executive board on May 23, 2013, which concluded that Mr Tarin’s name may not be included in the list of the accused.
However, without even taking into consideration Mr Tarin’s position, NAB filed a reference in the Accountability Court of Islamabad on Feb 27, 2014, in respect of the RPP contract awarded to Messrs Pakistan Power Resources (Pvt.) Limited, which was to be situated/located at Piranghaib, Multan.
Mr Tarin then challenged the legality and validity of the reference in the IHC. However, his plea was dismissed on April 17, 2018. Now the petition has assailed the high court verdict as being illegal, unconstitutional, without jurisdiction and in violation of his fundamental rights.
The petitioner pleaded that the IHC had erred by dismissing his petition on technical grounds, when it was a settled proposition of the administration of justice that cases, especially of a constitutional nature affecting the life and liberty of a citizen, ought to be decided on merits and not on hyper-technicalities of procedure.

4,ECP seeks reply of PTI chief in Toshakhana case by Sept 7,"CEC observes that since everything is part of record, it must not take so much time to submit a reply.","ISLAMABAD: The Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday gave another week to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan to submit his reply in the Toshakhana case against him.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan while appearing before a five-member bench of the commission, headed by the Chief Election Commissio­ner Sikandar Sultan Raja, pleaded for more time to file a reply.
He said the main lawyer for the PTI chairman, Barrister Ali Zafar, was in Lahore and he was unable to consult him on the matter. He said he would try his best to submit the reply at the next hearing.
The CEC observed that since everything was part of record, it must not take so much time to submit a reply.
However, the PTI chief was granted more time and the hearing was adjourned until September 7.
National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf had earlier this month sent a reference to the ECP seeking disqualification of Mr Khan in the light of the Toshakhana case. In the reference, it was said Mr Khan did not declare the gifts taken from Toshakhana in his assets and the detail of the amount he received by selling those gifts.
Earlier in April, the former prime minister, while responding to the Toshakhana controversy during an informal media chat, had said those were his gifts and it was his choice whether or not to keep them.

5,Destructive yet necessary: South Asian monsoon explained,The South Asian monsoon was not always something to be dreaded.,"

The South Asian monsoon was not always something to be dreaded. At one time, it was welcomed by farmers and other citizens alike. But this year, floods in Pakistan have killed more than 1,000 people after a record unbroken cycle of monsoon rains with “8 weeks of non-stop torrents”.
What is a monsoon, why it is so important and yet so dangerous, and how are climate change and other man-made effects altering the vast life-giving but destructive annual weather system — this article tries to answer some basic questions.
The Southwest or the Asian Summer Monsoon is essentially a colossal sea breeze that brings South Asia 70-80 percent of its annual rainfall between June and September every year.
It occurs when summer heat warms the landmass of the subcontinent, causing the air to rise and sucking in cooler Indian Ocean winds which then produce enormous volumes of rain.
It is vital for agriculture and therefore for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and for food security in the poor region of around two billion people, but it also brings destruction every year in landslides and floods. Melting glaciers add to the volume of water while unregulated construction in flood-prone areas exacerbates the damage.
Despite being heavily studied, the monsoon is relatively poorly understood.
Exactly where and when the rain will fall is hard to forecast and varies considerably.
This year, for example, while Pakistan has seen a deluge, eastern and northeastern India reportedly had the lowest amounts of July rainfall in 122 years.
Fluctuations are caused by changes in global atmospheric and oceanic conditions, such as the El Nino effect in the Pacific and a phenomenon called the Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation only discovered in 2002.
Other factors are thought to include local effects such as aerosols, clouds of dust blowing in from the Sahara desert, air pollution and even irrigation by farmers.India’s 2021 monsoon was a case in point: June rain was above normal, in July it fell, August was nearly a drought and in September precipitation returned with a vengeance.
Several hundred died in floods in Maharashtra in July and in Gujarat in Sep­tember. The same month a cloudburst turned the streets of Hyderabad into raging rivers in just two hours.

6,IHC dismisses plea seeking contempt proceedings against PM Shehbaz,Plea was filed over PM Shehbaz not honouring his commitment to LHC for return of his brother Nawaz to Pakistan.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday dismissed a petition seeking contempt of court proceedings against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for not honouring his commitment to Lahore High Court for the return of his brother Nawaz Sharif to Pakistan.
The petitioner, Syed Zafar Ali Shah, invoked the jurisdiction of IHC under Article 199 of the Constitution to file the petition, but the registrar’s office raised the objection about its maintainability.
However, the court overruled the objection and observed that it was bereft of jurisdiction to object or adjudicate upon the question of maintainability of a constitutional petition filed under Article 199.
The court also observed that the maintainability of a petition could only be determined by the court itself.
In response to a court’s query, Mr Shah admitted that the petition wherein an interim order, dated Nov 16, 2019, had been passed, was pending with the Lahore High Court.
He further admitted that the name of Nawaz Sharif wasremoved from the Exit Control List under a decision of the federal cabinet subject to certain conditions.
The court observed: “Admittedly, the removal of the name (of Mr Nawaz Sharif) from the Exit Control List was not pursuant to an order or direction passed by any court. The conditions imposed by the Federal Cabinet were challenged before the learned Lahore High Court and they were suspended and modified vide an interim order, dated 16.11.2019. It appears that the said order was never challenged either by the Federal Government nor the National Accountability Bureau and, therefore, it stood implemented.”
The court further noted that since the petition in which the interim order, dated Nov 16 had been passed, is pending before the Lahore High Court, therefore, the IHC had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition in hand nor to grant the request sought therein.
The petitioner, after arguing the matter at length, said he did not press the petition.
The court dismissed the petition accordingly.

7,Balochistan CM orders inquiry into dam breach rumour,Fact-finding committee constituted for the probe.,"QUETTA: Taking strict notice of misinformation on social media regarding the breach of a dam near Quetta, Balochistan Chief Minister Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo has ordered an inquiry to identify the source of the news that panicked citizens late Saturday night.
Upon the chief minister’s orders, the Home and Tribal Affairs Department has constituted a fact-finding committee headed by a Quetta police DIG. Other members of the committee include Levies director operations and additional home secretary.
The committee will fix responsibility, ascertain reasons and identify those responsible for the dissemination of false information from certain control rooms. It will submit the report within seven day.
Unverified reports about a breach in Wali Tangi Dam started making rounds late Saturday night which panicked the citizens who started fleeing their homes. The news first broke in a few social media groups from where it spread like a wildfire.
Thousands of people, including women and children, abandoned their houses within hours in Nawan Killi, Zarghoon Town, Bashirabad, Chashma Achozai, Airport and other areas on the peripheries and fled towards the city centre to take refuge.
As people started fleeing, traffic in the capital went into a disarray as miles-long queues of cars coming from Nawan Killi area clogged the roads.
Quetta Deputy Commissioner Shaihak Baloch clarified later on Saturday that the news was false and the dam was intact.
The dam had overflowed and its spillways were opened to discharge excess water but there was no threat of a breach, he had said.
