0,Ancient Iranian rug tradition gets makeover as sales sink,"Changing tastes, increased competition from Asia force some in trade to redesign a tradition dating back more than 2,000 years.","TEHRAN: Striking geometric shapes that recall 20th century abstract art are not what you would expect to see adorning a handmade Iranian rug.
But changing tastes and increased competition from Asia have forced some in the trade to redesign and resize a tradition dating back more than 2,000 years.
“A revolution is underway,” said Ahad Azimzadeh, 65, who calls himself  “the biggest exporter of Persian carpets in the world”.
Rugs traditionally woven in the Islamic republic are known for dense, curving floral designs in rich colours.
Their beauty and quality have long been recognised worldwide, yet sales have collapsed over the past 30 years.
“In 1994 the value of Iranian carpets sold abroad reached $1.7 billion and represented 40 percent of our non-petroleum exports,” Ahmad Karimi, chief of the Handmade Carpet Manuf­acturers’ and Exporters’ Union, said. By 2019-20 that figure had shrunk to $70 million, he said.
By another measure, in 2000 Iran represented 32 percent of global handmade carpet exports. This fell to 7.9 percent by 2019 as exports from China and India rose, Karimi said.
There was  “an impact” from international sanctions that targeted Iran over its nuclear programme, human rights and other issues, but he said other factors are more to blame. “Especially by the big diversity of carpets on the market and the change in the mentality and tastes of the new generations,” Karimi said.
Azimzadeh, the carpet exp­orter, said  “the future is with modern handmade rugs”.
He spoke at last week’s handmade carpet exhibition in Tehran. The annual event, suspended for two years because of the coronavirus pandemic, features about 400 exhibitors from across Iran.
“The patterns of Iranian carpets are ancient but today there is a strong demand for contemporary styles. They’re more suitable for a modern house,” said Azimzadeh, a big talker who started small — as a seven-year-old weaver. By 14, he had graduated to the commercial side of the trade. Among the new styles on display at the exhibition which ended on Sunday: a rug featuring small squares of hypnotic diagonal blue and white lines.
Another depicts diamond and other geometric patterns in gold silk on a black background. One wool rug looks as if an ink roller has left splashes of gold on it.
“The colours are clear and the sizes smaller,” which is what modern tastes demand, Azimzadeh said.
As an extreme but less typical example of this  “revolution”, Azimzadeh stands in front of a woven rug three metres square (3.6 square yards) in size. It depicts global personalities including actor Charlie Chaplin, the physicist Albert Einstein and Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.

1,10 Yemeni soldiers killed in ‘dangerous escalation’,"Assault, which also left several soldiers wounded, was aimed at cutting off a key route to city of Taez, says govt.","DUBAI: Ten Yemeni soldiers were killed in an overnight rebel attack near the blockaded city of Taez, Yemen’s government said on Monday, calling it a  “dangerous escalation” after a months-long ceasefire.
The assault, which also left several soldiers wounded, was aimed at cutting off a key route to the southwestern city of about two million, the government said.
The Iran-backed Houthi rebels have blocked main roads into Taez since 2015, the same year that a Saudi-led coalition intervened in the conflict.
Yemen’s warring parties have been observing a ceasefire since April, bringing a drastic reduction in hostilities although small-scale fighting has continued.
The Taez attack was a  “blatant challenge to all initiatives and efforts seeking to end the war and achieve peace”, Yemen’s internationally recognised government said in a statement.
It was  “an attempt to undermine efforts to expand and extend the humanitarian truce”, it added.
Military sources said the rebels, who hold much of Yemen including the capital Sanaa, were trying to cut off the road linking Taez with government-controlled Lahj.
The rebels infiltrated army sites and clashed with government soldiers in a battle fought on multiple fronts, they said. No detail was available on rebel casualties.
Also on Monday, 16 human rights groups made a joint appeal for the Houthis to open roads into Taez to ease growing humanitarian problems in Yemen’s third-biggest city.
“Dangerous and poorly maintained mountain roads... are the only connection between Taez city’s besieged population and the rest of the world,” said Michael Page, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch.
“Opening the main roads would help immensely to alleviate the suffering of a population that has been in near-total isolation for seven years.” Holding talks about opening the roads was one of the conditions of the UN-brokered truce. But despite meetings in Jordan, no breakthrough has been reached.

2,"N-deal pointless without end to IAEA probe, says Iran",US has been adamant that Tehran cooperates with IAEA to clear up suspicions about earlier work at three undeclared sites.,"TEHRAN: The Iranian president said on Monday that reviving a 2015 atomic deal with world powers would be pointless unless the UN nuclear watchdog put an end to its probe of undeclared sites in the country.
Ebrahim Raisi’s comments came as Tehran reviews the US response to its suggestions on a  “final” text put forward by the EU to salvage the landmark deal.
The United States had been adamant that Tehran cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to clear up suspicions about earlier work at three undeclared sites.
“In the negotiations, safeguard issues are one of the fundamental ones. All of the safeguard issues must be resolved,” Raisi told reporters at a news conference in the capital Tehran.
“Without resolving the safeguard issues, talking about the agreement is meaningless,” he added. The IAEA has referred to the traces of nuclear materials as a  “safeguards” issue.
Iran has repeatedly urged the agency to end the issue before any revived deal is implemented, but US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel on Thursday said  “we do not believe there should be any conditionality” between the deal and undeclared sites.
In June, the IAEA’s board of governors adopted a resolution censuring Iran for failing to adequately explain the previous discovery of traces of enriched uranium at three sites not declared by Tehran as having hosted nuclear activities.
Last week, amid rising hopes of a revived deal, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, in an interview with CNN, rejected the idea of the agency closing its probe without receiving answers.
“This idea that politically we are going to stop doing our job is unacceptable for us,” he said.  “So far Iran has not given us the technically credible explanations we need.” The agreement between Iran and six world powers — Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States — gave the Islamic republic sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme.
Since taking office in 2021, President Joe Biden has sought to return the US to the deal unilaterally abandoned by his predecessor Donald Trump in 2018.
The Vienna talks, which began in April last year, aim to return the US to the nuclear pact, including through the lifting of sanctions on Iran, and to return Tehran to full compliance with its commitments.
The indirect negotiations between Tehran and Washington have so far been carried out through the mediation of the European Union. Asked if he will meet with Biden during the UN General Assembly next month, Raisi reiterated his position by saying  “No”.
“There’s no benefit in a meeting between me and him... There is no plan for such a meeting and there will not be any,” he added.
Israel, Iran’s arch-enemy, has been pushing its ally, the United States, as well as other Western countries to stop the nuclear negotiations with Tehran.
Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid on Sunday said any new agreement with Tehran would have to include an expiration date, and tighter supervision that would also  “address Iran’s ballistic missile programme”.

3,Swiss woman shows no remorse in ‘IS’ knife attack trial,BELLINZONA: A Swiss woman undergoing psychiatric treatment showed no remorse on Monday when she went on trial ...,"BELLINZONA: A Swiss woman undergoing psychiatric treatment showed no remorse on Monday when she went on trial accused of trying to murder two women in the name of the militant Islamic State group.
The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is accused of committing a  “terrorist act” on Nov 24, 2020 — a knife attack in the plush Manor department store in Lugano, in southern Switzerland’s Italian-speaking Ticino region.
One of the two victims — who was attending the trial — suffered a serious neck injury. 
The second sustained wounds on one hand and managed, with others, to control the assailant until the police arrived.
“If I could go back, I would do it better... with accomplices,” the 29-year-old told Switzerland’s Federal Criminal Court in Bellinzona, also in Ticino.
Having discovered the IS jihadist group on social media, she said she had planned for  “months, years” to  “do something” for IS and show that she was  “capable of carrying out a terrorist act”. A photograph of the neck injury was shown to the court.
“It didn’t go as deeply as I thought,” the accused woman observed, before repeating:  “It has no effect on me.” Dressed in black, in accordance with court rules, the accused wore a long tunic, tights, a black face mask and a hoodie.
She wanted to keep her head covered, saying:  “I’m Muslim”, before agreeing to lower the hood to comply with court rules.
According to the indictment issued by the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, the accused  “acted wilfully and with particular ruthlessness”.
During the opening hearings, the accused woman answered questions posed by the presiding judge. Three justices are hearing the trial.
The daughter of a Swiss father and a Serbian mother, the woman said she suffered epileptic seizures during her early childhood.

The 65,000-tonne aircraft carrier, which cost 3.1 billion pounds to build, left Portsmouth on Saturday for a three month exercise working closely with the United States on stealth jet and drone operations.
“HMS Prince of Wales remains in the South Coast Exercise Area while conducting investigations into an emerging mechanical issue,” a Royal Navy spokesperson said in a statement.
The UK Defence Journal website reported the ship was anchored off the Isle of Wight and divers had been sent down to determine what was wrong, with concerns about damage to a propeller.

5,Elon Musk subpoenas Twitter whistleblower in buyout battle,Seeks information about spam accounts at the social network.,"NEW YORK: Elon Musk has formally subpoenaed a Twitter whistleblower to share information about spam accounts at the social network, as the billionaire fights in court to back out of a massive buyout deal.
Musk has tried to pull out of the $44 billion agreement by saying Twitter misled him on the number of false accounts, or bots, prompting strong denials and a lawsuit from the social media firm.
The Tesla boss hopes that allegations made by the former Twitter security chief Peiter Zatko, about major security gaps and problematic practices at the firm, will bolster his case.
According to court documents made public on Monday, Musk’s attorneys served Zatko with a subpoena Saturday demanding he share any documents or messages regarding the impact of spam and false accounts on Twitter’s activity, dating back to January 2019. Zatko was also ordered to answer questions on the record for Musk lawyers on September 9.
Zatko’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk’s attempt to back out of buying Twitter has struggled for momentum in court.
Twitter won some early battles in the case, including a fast-track trial date, and its stock had risen as analysts predicted the platform would prevail over the mercurial Musk.

6,Russia curtails war games as Ukraine war begins to bite,Russian military exercises in the Far East this week will take place on a far smaller scale than when they were last held in 2018.,"LONDON: Russian military exercises in the Far East this week will take place on a far smaller scale than when they were last held in 2018, reflecting the strain on Moscow’s forces as they struggle to make headway on the battlefields of eastern Ukraine.
Announcing the  “Vostok 2022” war games, in which China will also participate, the Russian defence ministry said last month that its capacity to stage such exercises was in no way affected by what Russia calls its  “special military operation” in Ukraine.
But the 50,000 personnel that Moscow said on Monday will take part are a fraction of the official figure of 300,000 that were said to be involved four years ago — though some Western military analysts suspect that number was overstated.
The defence ministry said 140 military aircraft and over 5,000 items of military hardware would be deployed — way down on the 1,000 aircraft and 36,000 tanks and armoured vehicles that were reported to have been sent into the 2018 manoeuvres.
“This is going to be the smallest strategic-level exercise in years because the entire ground forces potential is engaged in operations in Ukraine. So the exercise will have to be very small,” said Konrad Muzyka, director of the Rochan military consultancy based in Poland.
Still, the exercises will be closely watched by regional powers such as Japan and South Korea as a significant show of force by Russia and China, which joined up in Vostok 2018 and will take part again in drills on land and at sea.
Russia said its Pacific Fleet and China’s navy would take part in  “joint practical actions to defend maritime communications and areas of maritime economic activity” in the Sea of Japan.
Russia’s armed forces news channel Zvezda on Monday posted video of Chinese troops unloading armoured vehicles delivered to Russia by rail.
Russia has drawn heavily on units from the Far East to reinforce its war effort in Ukraine, thousands of miles to the west, where its forces have sustained heavy losses in men and equipment in the six months since its Feb 24 invasion while occupying about a fifth of its neighbour’s territory.
Muzyka said he estimated that 70-80pc of units from Russia’s eastern military district had been deployed to Ukraine, making it  “impossible” for Moscow to free up 50,000 men for exercises. He said a more plausible figure would be 10,000 to 15,000.
“Its just Russia pretending everything is fine and they still have the capability to launch a large-scale military exercise with China. But in reality I think the scope of this exercise, especially from a ground force perspective, is going to be very, very limited,” he said.
The eastern military district includes part of Siberia and has its headquarters in Khabarovsk, near the Chinese border.
The defence ministry said the exercises would take place from Sept 1 to 7 and would also involve military contingents and observers from Algeria, India, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Syria and the former Soviet republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

7,"Gibraltar recognised as a British city, 180 years late","LONDON: Gibraltar finally joined the official list of British cities on Monday, after 180 years in which its status,...","LONDON: Gibraltar finally joined the official list of British cities on Monday, after 180 years in which its status, granted by Queen Victoria, had been overlooked due to an administrative error.
The British overseas territory bid to become a city earlier this year as part of the celebrations for Queen Elizabeth’s Platinum Jubilee, but research in the National Archives established it had in fact been granted city status in 1842.
“It is excellent to see official recognition given to the City of Gibraltar, a huge accolade to its rich history and dynamism,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.
“This official recognition re-affirms Gibraltar’s special status in the Realms of Her Majesty, and rightly signifies the pride that Gibraltarians feel for their community and their distinctive heritage.” 
Spain ceded the strategically important rocky outpost at the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea to Britain in 1713 after a war but has long called for it to be returned. In 2002, 99pc of voters in Gibraltar rejected the idea of Britain sharing sovereignty with Spain.
The status of Gibraltar and how to police the border with Spain has been a point of contention since Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the European Union. The peninsula was excluded from the exit deal reached between Britain and the EU.
Informal arrangements are in place while the two sides negotiate over Gibraltar, which overwhelmingly backed remaining in the EU in the Brexit referendum.

8,Turkey moves pop star from jail to house arrest,ISTANBUL: An Istanbul court on Monday moved one of Turkey’s biggest pop stars from jail to house arrest pending...,"ISTANBUL: An Istanbul court on Monday moved one of Turkey’s biggest pop stars from jail to house arrest pending trial on charges of  “inciting hatred” by making a joke about religious schools.
Gulsen Bayraktar Colakoglu, 46, who uses her first name on stage, was jailed last Thursday, sparking an outcry from her legion of fans and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s political foes.
Although she made the joke on stage in April, it went viral on social media after being re-posted by a pro-government daily last week.
Top members of Erdogan’s Islamic-rooted party then voiced moral outrage, turning her joke into another divisive issue roiling the polarised country 10 months before crunch national polls.
Gulsen had quipped that her guitarist’s  “perversion” was rooted in his upbringing in an Imam Hatip school, which specialises in religious education combined with a modern curriculum. Erdogan himself went to such a school.
“Our Imam Hatip schools came under attack from serious threats,” Erdogan told one of his daily rallies a few hours after Gulsen’s release.
“For years, they tried to exclude my people,” he said in reference to decades of staunchly secular Turkish rule.
“They were trying to intimidate and frighten our people, whom they insulted and called stupid... We will be vigilant and not allow ourselves to be subjugated to that again.” Turkey is a predominantly Muslim but officially secular state.
Tensions between the two sides of Turkey’s national identity have been the defining feature of the modern republic that emerged from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire a century ago.
Gulsen was swarmed by reporters but did not speak as security guards guided her from a woman’s prison to a waiting van.

“If we act collectively then we can overcome the risk of shortages, but unless everyone takes part and if all the bad-case scenarios come together then we could be forced to impose reductions on consumers,” she told the Medef business group.
“If we end up with rationing, companies will be the most affected and unfortunately we need to be prepared for it,” she continued. Borne said the government was already drawing up contingency plans which included a  “quota trading system” that would enable companies to buy and sell power quotas. The government was also preparing measures to support companies that would be  “too severely affected” by rationing.
The clear warning about the risk of shortages further underlines efforts by the government to prepare public opinion and businesses for looming difficulties caused by the ongoing war in Ukraine.
Speaking last week at the first cabinet meeting since the August summer holidays, President Emmanuel Macron warned that France might need to make  “sacrifices” as a result of its support for Ukraine and its fight against Russia.

11,Experienced Liz Truss favourite to be next UK prime minister,"Truss has doggedly hammered home a direct and consistent message, promising massive tax cuts.","LONDON: Liz Truss has emerged as the clear favourite to succeed Boris Johnson as leader of the ruling Conservative party and UK prime minister, using her political experience to pull ahead of challenger Rishi Sunak.
Sunak helped to spark the contest after resigning in opposition to a series of government scandals, prompting others to follow and Johnson to step down.
But although considered a better public speaker, he has come under fire for clinging to fiscal orthodoxy to tackle the economic crisis and hamstrung by his image as a wealthy technocrat.
Sunak, who would become Britain’s first prime minister of colour, has also faced accusations of treachery for bringing down the Tories’ Brexit hero Johnson.
Truss meanwhile has doggedly hammered home a direct and consistent message, promising massive tax cuts, and has shied away from criticising Johnson.
“She’s a better politician,” said John Curtice, a political scientist at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. “If you ask me what Liz Truss’s campaign was about I will immediately say to you: ‘a tax cut not a handout’. Very clear,” he said.
“There is no strapline for Sunak, nothing.” For Curtice, Truss has effectively conveyed  “traditional Conservative messages” to Tory members while Sunak has been more nuanced.
“It’s also a bit of a lecture,” he said, assessing that he has come across as  “a wee bit brittle” under pressure. “You can see that she’s been in the game for longer,” he added.
Political journey
Truss, 47, has described her ascent towards the top of British politics as a  “journey” that has seen her criticised for being ambitiously opportunistic. She comes from a left-wing family and initially joined the centrist Liberal Democrats before jumping ship to the right-wing Conservatives.
She became MP for the South West Norfolk constituency in eastern England in 2010, surviving revelations of an affair that almost cost her the nomination.
Since 2012 she has held a series of ministerial posts in the education, finance and departments as well as a difficult spell in justice.
In 2016, she campaigned for the UK to remain in the European Union but quickly became one of its strongest supporters when Britons voted for Brexit.
When the UK left the EU, Johnson put her in charge of negotiating new free trade deals before appointing her as foreign secretary last year.
In the role, she took on the controversial task of trying to overhaul differences with Brussels about post-Brexit trade in Northern Ireland. Like Johnson, she has talked tough on Russia and given unswerving backing for Ukraine.

12,Skeleton of huge dinosaur  unearthed in Portugal,LISBON: Palaeontologists in Portugal have unearthed the fossilised skeleton of what could be the largest dinosaur...,"LISBON: Palaeontologists in Portugal have unearthed the fossilised skeleton of what could be the largest dinosaur ever found in Europe.
The remains are thought to be those of a sauropod, a herbivorous dinosaur 12 metres (39 feet) tall and 25 metres long that roamed the Earth around 150 million years ago.
“It’s one of the biggest specimens discovered in Europe, perhaps in the world,” palaeontologist Elisabete Malafaia, from the Faculty of Sciences at Lisbon University, said on Monday.
The bones were uncovered by Portuguese and Spanish scientists in the garden of a house near Pombal in central Portugal at the beginning of August. Among the bones collected, they found the remains of a rib about three metres long, Malafaia said.
Fossil fragments were first noticed at the site in 2017, when the owner was digging up his garden to make way for an extension. He contacted palaeontologists, who unearthed part of the dinosaur skeleton earlier this month and have been examining it ever since. 
Sauropods have characteristically long necks and tails and are among the largest animals to have ever lived.
The fossils discovered at the Monte Agudo site in Pombal are thought to be those of a brachiosaurid who lived during the Upper Jurassic period. The fact that the vertebrae and ribs were found at the same location and in the position they would have been in the dinosaur’s anatomy is  “relatively rare”, Malafaia said.
The team may conduct more digs in the coming months at the site and in the surrounding area.
