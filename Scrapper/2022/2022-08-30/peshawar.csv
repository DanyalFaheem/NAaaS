2,"KP okays climate change policy amid flooding, food insecurity fears","CM also approves action plan with mitigation, adaptation steps.","PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan has approved the climate change policy for the province along with an action plan containing 129 climate mitigation and 172 adaptation measures for 10 sectors.
The action plan is to be carried out as priority and on short-, medium- and long-term basis as envisaged under the KP Climate Change Policy, 2022.
Officials told Dawn that a climate change policy was announced in 2017 but the need for a new policy was felt by the environment, forestry and wildlife department in the view of the merger of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas with the province, glacial lake outburst floods as well as locust attacks in southern districts, and for the determination of new ecological zoning.
The documents revealed that the policy was focused on adaptation approach to the climate seeking to reduce vulnerability of natural and human systems or to capitalise on the anticipated changes in climate conditions, and secondly mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through technological and nature-based solutions.

CM also approves action plan with mitigation, adaptation steps

It also called for the streamlining of climate change mitigation measures in various sectors of economy and development to achieve sustainable development and resilience to natural disasters.
The policy said KP had witnessed longer summers and shorter and milder winters due to climate change, which impacted agricultural output.
It added that surface warming would increase the intensity of rainfall posing a flood risk in the province combined with the increased rates of glacier melting in northern parts of the province, which were dominated by glaciers and sub-humid forest.
The policy said the climate change had also resulted into precipitation changes, changes in food production, shifting weather pattern, glacial melting and loss of biodiversity.
It also analysed the existing situation of the impact of climate change on various thematic groups as well as strategies for translating national climate change policy into a provincial policy.
Regarding water situation, it said water stress would have a disproportionate impact on food security and agriculture in KP.
“As a result, a decline in water supplies might have a severe spillover effect not just in KP but also in adjacent provinces. These consequences will include forced relocation, economic losses, and diminished activity in agriculture, livestock, industry, and other domestic areas. Water resource management can improve agricultural land revenue and alleviate water scarcity difficulties in the province,” it said.
The policy said it had taken stock of the existing situation and future challenges in agriculture, livestock, forestry, wildlife and biodiversity, vulnerable ecosystems and other sectors.
The action plan outlined mitigation strategies and measures for agriculture, forestry, environment, wildlife, energy and transport sectors for incorporation in the National Climate Change Policy.
The documents showed that the action plan was categorised into priority actions to be carried out in two years, short-term in five years, medium-term in 10 years and long-term in 20 years.
According to them, the adaptation strategies included 31 for agriculture and livestock sector, 34 for forestry, eight for health, 32 for water, 11 for biodiversity, 18 for mountain and pastures, eight for poverty eradication, nine each for gender issues and youths affairs. 
As for mitigation strategies, 11 are for energy efficiency, 24 for transport, 11 for waste management, 13 for industries, 10 for urban planning, nine for ‘carbon sequestration’, 15 for agriculture and livestock, 22 for capacity building, 11 for technology transfers and three for climate finance.

Peshawar Deputy Commissioner Shafiullah Khan has warned the people against holding unauthorised donation camps in the city. He has asked the people to stay away from giving donations to them.

13,Pakistan to host Asia Pacific ICT Alliance Awards this year,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is set to host the Asia Pacific ICT Alliance Awards (APICTA) for the first time ever. This will...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is set to host the Asia Pacific ICT Alliance Awards (APICTA) for the first time ever. This will provide representatives from local companies to meet innovators and entrepreneurs from the region. The event is planned for the first week of December where all 16 member countries are expected to participate.
This was announced by a delegation headed by Stan Singh, that is currently visiting Pakistan.
Mr Singh said the reason for choosing Pakistan was that the country went through a challenging period and the economy was now back on track, and information and communication technology (ICT) sector of the country was growing at a fast pace, with high quality human resource.
He was accompanied by Badar Khushnood as well as Fulvio Inserra.
They pointed out that APICTA was an international awards programme which aimed to increase awareness about communication and technology and assist communities in bridging the digital divide.
Mr Singh said the ICT was no more a business enabler but business itself and there was a need to develop a competitive environment among the APICTA members to enhance the quality of IT services.
Current members are Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Macao, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam and Nepal, whereas South Korea, New Zealand andthe Philippines have applied for membership.
Participants of the programme comprise members of the Asia Pacific ICT Alliance and the key benefit of the awards is gathering help in identifying how member countries can work together for growth of the ICT industry in the region.
Mr Khushnood said P@SHA, the apex trade body for the IT and IT-enabled Services (ITeS) industry, was conducting the 18th annual P@SHA ICT awards later in October this year and through a detailed process of evaluation by a jury of world-renowned members.
The winners and runner-ups will consequently be participating in the Asia-Pacific ICT Alliance (APICTA) Awards 2022 to showcase their talent and compete on an international platform.
He said the IT industry was currently the only industry in Pakistan that could grow at an exponential rate and contribute towards export growth in the same spirit by the highest cash flow positive grading and the easiest to expand since the industry relied only on availability of talent and conducive policies to help it grow. He said the ICT sector was the second biggest exporting sector of Pakistan after textile as it had already surpassed rice exports.
The IT industry exports in the last two years have jumped from approximately $1.4 billion in 2020 to $2.62 billion in 2022, and P@SHA had asked the government to maintain consistent policies in IT and telecom for long-term growth in this sector.
