0,IMF approves much-needed $1.1bn payout,Extension of programme till end-June 2023 approved; govt required to raise power rates to meet Fund’s terms.,"• Lender’s acting chair advises ‘tight monetary policy’
• Govt required to raise power rates to meet Fund’s terms
• Miftah thanks PM for ‘taking tough decisions’; Shehbaz calls it outcome of ‘excellent team effort’
WASHINGTON: The Exe­cu­tive Board of the Interna­tional Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday completed the combined 7th and 8th revi­ews of a loan facility for Pak­is­tan, allowing immediate disbursement of $1.1 billion to the country, said an official IMF announcement.
The statement pointed out that the disbursement “brings total purchases (money made available) for budget support under this arrangement to about $3.9 billion.”
This Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement — signed in July 2019 — was to provide $6bn to Pakistan during a 39-month period. On Monday, the IMF board approved an extension of the programme until end-June 2023.
The board also approved “rephasing and augmentation” of Pakistan’s access to the funds by SDR720 million ($934m) that will bring the total access under the EFF to about $6.5bn.
The executive board also approved Pakistani authorities’ request for waivers of nonobservance of performance criteria.
“The immediate priority is to continue the steadfast implementation of the rece­ntly approved budget for FY23, adherence to a market-determined exchange rate, and pursuit of a proactive and prudent monetary policy,” said a statement issued by the IMF headquarters in Washington.
“It is also important to continue to expand social safety to protect the most vulnerable and accelerate structural reforms including to improve the performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and governance,” the statement added.
The board noted that authorities in Pakistan have taken important measures to address the country’s worsened fiscal and external positions resulting from accommodative policies in FY22 and spillovers from the war in Ukraine. These two factors “have placed significant pressure on the rupee and foreign reserves,” the board noted.
IMF’s Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair Antoinette Sayeh also issued a statement, observing that Pakistan’s “economy has been buffeted by adverse external conditions, due to spillovers from the war in Ukraine, and domestic challenges, including from accommodative policies that resulted in uneven and unbalanced growth”.
She reminded Pakistan “steadfast implementation of corrective policies and reforms” were “essential to regain macroeconomic stability, address imbalances and lay the foundation for inclusive and sustainable growth.”
She also supported the decision to tighten monetary conditions through higher policy rates, describing it as “a necessary step to contain inflation”.
Going forward, she advised continuing a tight monetary policy, which she said, “would help to reduce inflation and help address external imbalances,” adding that “maintaining proactive and data-driven monetary policy would support these objectives.”
The IMF official also advised a “close oversight of the banking system and decisive action to address undercapitalized financial institutions” as it would help support financial stability. “Preserving a market-determined exchange rate remains crucial to absorb external shocks, maintain competitiveness, and rebuild international reserves,” Ms Sayeh said.
The Fund advised Islamabad to accelerate structural reforms to strengthen governance and improve business environment as it would support sustainable growth. “Reforms that create a fair-and-level playing field for business, investment, and trade necessary for job creation and the development of a strong private sector are essential,” the board added.
In an earlier statement, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail congratulated the nation for getting IMF’s endorsement and thanked Prime Minis­ter Shehbaz Sharif for “taking tough decisions” and “saving Pakistan from default”.
Praising the finance minister and his team, PM Sharif tweeted: “The formal resumption of an IMF programme is a major step forward in our efforts to put Pakistan’s economy back on track. It is outcome of an excellent team effort. I commend Finance Minister Miftah Ismail & his team and other stakeholders for their hard work.”

 





 
Ensuring provincial surpluses this fiscal year is a key requirement of an earlier agreement with the IMF for reviving the programme. Pakistan entered the IMF programme in 2019, but only half the funds has been disbursed to date as Islamabad struggled to keep targets on track.
The IMF made the last disbursement in February and the next tranche was to follow a review in March, but the government of ex-premier Imran Khan introduced costly fuel price caps, which threw fiscal targets and the programme off track. The new coalition government has removed the price caps, with petrol and diesel prices going up by as much as 66pc and 92pc in over a month. On June 21, Pakistani authorities and the IMF staff mission reached an understanding on the current federal budget to revive the stalled programme as the former committed to generating Rs436bn more taxes and gradually increasing petroleum levy to Rs50 per litre. An IMF staff review acknowledged that important progress had been made over the federal budget.
Later, Pakistan provided a written commitment from the provinces to provide Rs750bn in cash surplus to the Centre to contain the fiscal deficit within 4.9pc of GDP and help generate a Rs152bn primary fiscal surplus.
Pakistan is now required to increase electricity tariff by Rs7.91 per unit, besides direct pass-through of monthly fuel cost adjustments in a timely manner to meet IMF demands.

• Huddle of top civil, military brass resolves to get rid of illegal structures along riverbanks
• PM visits Nowshera, Charsadda; CM Bizenjo anticipates flood losses over Rs200bn for Balochistan alone
ISLAMABAD / QUETTA / CHARSADDA: The ruling alliance on Monday held threadbare discussions to devise comprehensive plans for the relief and rehabilitation of millions of flood victims, as well as chalking out a strategy to meet natural catastrophes of this magnitude in future as the flooding caused by unprecedented monsoon rains swept nearly a third of the country.
The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, also decided to form a National Flood Response and Coordination Centre to provide proper institutional response to the calamity, which will comprise federal ministers, representatives of armed forces, chief ministers and experts
It was also decided that all illegal constructions on the banks of rivers and other water courses would be removed.

The meeting was attended by the top civil and military brass, including the three services chiefs, the chief ministers of Balochistan and Sindh through video link, leaders of allied parties, federal ministers and senior officials from Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
After the meeting, in a series of tweets, the PM Office said: “The Centre will serve as a bridge between disaster management authorities, donors and government institutions. It will collect and analyse latest information and pass it on to the relevant government agencies. It will also oversee rescue and relief work including restoration of infrastructure.”

 





 
Earlier, during a visit to the flood-hit areas of Charsadda and Nowshera in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, PM Shehbaz announced Rs25,000 for every family hit by the calamity, saying the funds would be disbursed by September 3.
The prime minister also visited relief camps set up at the Abdul Wali Khan sports complex and at the Agra union council in Charsadda and met with the affected families.
The PM told reporters that the families of flood victims would be provided with Rs1 million.

QWP chairman Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao and JUI (F) district emir Maulana Gohar Shah also briefed the prime minister on the reconstruction of Munda headworks and efforts to rehabilitate the flood affected population.
Balochistan losses
The devastation from flooding caused by hill torrents and rains is continuing in Balochistan hampering rescue and relief operation and efforts to restore connectivity with other provinces and creating fear of food shortage, while more deaths are being reported from different areas of the province.
During an interaction with journalists on Monday, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudus Bizenjo revealed that the province suffered over Rs200 billion in financial losses due to rain and flood related damages over the past couple of months. In the past, he said, destruction from natural disasters was limited to certain areas, but this flood had affected all 34 districts.
He said that a survey was being conducted in all the affected districts and the losses may be well over Rs200bn when the final report is presented.
He said that due to a lack of connectivity, the province could face acute food shortages and said that he had suggested to the prime minister that food and other items should be airlifted to the province.
Separately, five members of a family including four women were killed when the roof of their house collapsed in Mach area of Bolan district.
In addition, gas supply to Quetta and other areas of the province could not be restored as the Bolan River was still in high flood, washing away three big bridges in Bibi Nani, Mach and near Dhadar of Bolan district, which closed the Quetta-Sukkur highway for the last two weeks. Commander 12 Corps Quetta Lt-Gen Asif Ghafoor also visited the Bibi Nani bridge area and asked the concerned officials of NHA to complete the repair on all three bridges within the next 24 hours.
In view of the serious flood and rains situation, the Balochistan government has extended closing of all government and private schools, colleges and universities for another week, until September 4.

President Xi and Prime Minister Li Keqiang in their messages to President Arif Alvi and PM Shehbaz Sharif hoped that the government and people of Pakistan will overcome the challenge and rebuild the devastated areas at the earliest.
Chinese ambassador Nong Rong, at an event in Islamabad, said the Chinese government was fast-tracking the delivery of 25,000 tents and other supplies to Pakistan.
The Red Cross Society of China is providing $300,000, in emergency cash assistance, to the Pakistan Red Crescent Society whereas the All China Enterprises Association in Pakistan donated Rs15 million to the premier’s relief fund, the envoy added.

3,Gill ‘ready to apologise’ as decision on bail plea today,"ISLAMABAD: A court in the capital reserved its decision on the post-arrest bail petition of Shahbaz Gill, on Monday,...","ISLAMABAD: A court in the capital reserved its decision on the post-arrest bail petition of Shahbaz Gill, on Monday, even as his counsel revealed that the PTI chief’s aide was willing to tender an apology.
Additional District and Ses­sions Judge (ADSJ) Zafar Iqbal is expected announce the order today (Tuesday).
Police produced the relevant record before the court and on the request of Mr Gill’s counsel the court allowed him to peruse the record.
The counsel argued that the city magistrate had accused Mr Gill of sedition, an allegation which the acc­u­sed had never thought of.
He pointed out that the police registered a case against Mr Gill on the basis of a selected portion of the transcript of his live interaction on a private television channel.
He claimed that the statement of the accused was taken out of context, adding the accused was, however, ready to tender an apology.
The counsel stated that Mr Gill had talked about the pride of the country’s armed forces and never attempted to incite mutiny among them.
Special prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi, on the other hand, argued that Mr Gill had launched a systematic campaign against the senior hierarchy of the armed forces and tried to politicise the institution.
He added that the accused had tried to provoke the bureaucracy and incite them for disobedience of the government.
Regarding allegation of torture on the accused, Mr Abbasi told the court that the medical board had dismissed these allegations. He concluded that the evidence against the accused was sufficient to connect him with the crime.
The Kohsar police arrested Mr Gill on Aug 9 and the judicial magistrate remanded his custody to police till August 12. The police requested the magistrate to extend the remand order, however, he was sent to judicial lockup.
Advocate General Islamabad Barrister Jahangir Khan Jadoon filed a revision petition before Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Mohammad Adnan which was dismissed.
Later, acting Chief Justice IHC Justice Aamer Farooq remanded the matter back to the sessions court with the direction to decide the revision petition in accordance with the law.
ADSJ Zeba Chaudhry in a subsequent hearing granted two days’ remand of Mr Gill to the police.
However, her remand order was criticised in social media and PTI Chairman Imran Khan at two public speeches censured the judge as well as the police authorities.
Interestingly, the IHC acting chief justice while disposing of the petition related to Mr Gill’s remand had also upheld the order of ADSJ Chaudhry.
Owing to ‘threatening’ speeches, Mr Khan was booked under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) while IHC’s larger bench issued a show-cause notice to him over alleged contempt of the judge.
Separately, Nusrat Gill, sister of Mr Gill, in a video message condemned the alleged torture on her brother. She said her brother was well settled in the US and went to Pakistan ignoring her advice.
She said Mr Gill was determined to do something for Pakistan but in return he was sent to jail and subjected to torture.

4,Ban on Imran’s live speeches suspended for a week,IHC CJ asks PTI counsel how threatening language against judge could be justified; Imran holds live telethon,"ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) on Monday lifted a ban on the live coverage of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chair­man Imran Khan’s spee­ches, observing that the Pak­is­tan Electronic Media Regula­tory Authority (Pemra) invo­ked wrong sections of the law while prohibiting the broadcast.
On Aug 20, while addressing a public gathering in Islamabad to express solidarity with party leader Shahbaz Gill, who is imprisoned in a sedition case, Mr Khan had lashed out at the Islamabad police over alleged torture on Mr Gill and warned the judge, who sent the leader on physical remand, of dire consequences. Soon after the rally, Pemra banned live broadcast of the PTI chief’s speeches on television, and a case was also registered against him.
On Monday, Mr Khan petitioned the IHC against the ban through his counsel Barrister Syed Ali Zafar. Arguing before the court, the counsel pointed out that Pemra invoked sections 26 and 27 to impose a ban on live coverage of the PTI chairman’s speeches. He said these sections could not be invoked in this case, as they empowered the regulator to ensure broadcast of suitable content.
Even otherwise, since Section 26 entailed penal consequences, the regulator was under an obligation to serve a prior notice to Mr Khan before banning broadcast of his live speeches.

IHC CJ asks PTI counsel how threatening language against judge could be justified; Imran holds live telethon

Mr Zafar informed the court that the former premier intended to participate in a live telethon to raise funds for flood-affected people.
Justice Minallah inquired from the counsel the reason that led to a ban on Mr Khan’s speech. He replied that on Aug 20, the PTI chairman had warned the Islamabad inspector general of police, deputy inspector general and Additional District and Sessions Judge Zeba Chaudhry of consequences for sending Mr Gill on a two-day physical remand.
The IHC chief justice expressed displeasure over the remarks against the judge and called it unacceptable. “How can you justify such threatening language against a judge of the lower court, which is an important tier of the judicial system?” Justice Minallah asked the counsel.
Barrister Zafar argued that it was a reaction from Mr Khan on the alleged torture on Mr Gill.
Justice Minallah observed that the worst form of torture was enforced disappearances, and reminded the counsel that the IHC had sent a number of cases of missing persons to the previous PTI government, but to no avail. He remarked that in case the party was keen to probe the allegations of torture, it could have been done in a proper manner.
The counsel replied that since the IHC had already initiated contempt proceedings against Imran Khan, he would submit his response on the date fixed for hearing.
Arguing against Pemra’s directive, Zafar said it was issued without observing the principles of procedural fairness. He drew the court’s attention to Pemra’s prohibition order and termed it ultra vires articles 19 and 19-A of the Constitution as well as Pemra Ordinance 2002.
Justice Minallah observed: “Without commenting on the said objectionable portion [of the speech], it prima facie appears that the authority has issued the impugned order in excess of jurisdiction vested in it and without having regard to the constitutional rights guaranteed under Articles 19 and 19-A of the Constitution.”
He further observed that “a plain reading of Section 27 [of Pemra Ordinance] also prima facie shows that it does not empower the authority to issue a blanket prohibition order. Moreover, the prohibition order appears to be in violation of the principle of proportionality”.
The court noted that TV channels were required to observe the prescribed procedure regarding the time-delay mechanism. Failure on the part of the licensees to violate the prescribed procedure, prima facie, could have been made a ground for issuance of the impugned prohibition order.
Subsequently, the court suspended Pemra’s directive and issued notices to the regulator and the attorney general. Further hearing in this matter was adjourned till Sept 5.
Imran’s telethon
Meanwhile, PTI chief Imran Khan held a telethon that provided direct access to national and international callers to pledge funds for the support of flood victims. Senator Faisal Javed was the moderator of the telethon.
Mr Khan said he had participated in flood relief activities when the country was ravaged in 2010, and according to his estimates the current floods were worse than that. He said bank accounts had been opened in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab to collect funds that would be spent transparently under a committee.
At the time of going to print, ARY News reported the telethon had secured Rs5bn in pledges.

5,Furore over Tarin’s leaked audios telling ministers to ‘torpedo’ deal,Shireen admits clips genuine; Miftah demands resignation of KP finance minister; Tarin says finance minister’s own party ‘wants...,"ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail on Monday accused the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leadership of attempting to sabotage the revival of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout package after leaked audio clips of purported telephonic conversations between PTI Senator Shaukat Tarin and the finance ministers of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa mired the former ruling party in controversy.
In the clips that surfaced on Monday, former finance minister Tarin can be heard telling Punjab Finance Minister Mohsin Leghari and KP’s Taimur Jhagra to tell the federal government that provinces could not post a budget surplus — an IMF demand — in the light of devastating floods.
On Monday, PTI leader Shireen Mazari admitted that the clips were authentic. Fawad Chaudhry, while speaking at a news conference outside Banigala, said the recording of Shaukat Tarin was a “montage” but the conversation of the two provincial ministers was authentic.
Meanwhile, former Punjab governor Omer Sarfraz Cheema, who is currently an adviser to Punjab chief minister, said: “There is nothing wrong in what Senator Tarin is saying to the Punjab and KP finance ministers.”

Shireen admits clips genuine; Miftah demands resignation of KP finance minister; Tarin says finance minister’s own party ‘wants him gone’

In one recording, Mr Leghari — who has yet to comment on the veracity of the clips — asked Mr Tarin whether such a letter would hurt the interests of the state. Mr Tarin purportedly replied: “They (PML-N) continue blackmailing us in the name of the state and we keep on helping them. This cannot happen.
“The federal government is registering terrorism cases against the party chairman so how we can let it go scot-free?”
Asking Mr Leghari to write a letter, Mr Tarin purportedly stated that the KP finance minister was also sending the letter to him and he would send both letters to the federal government and consequently release the letters on social media. Mr Tarin also told the Punjab finance minister that party chairman Imran Khan would decide whether the letter be released to the IMF or not. “If we will send the letter to the federal government alone, we can always raise the issue with the IMF,” he said.
In the purported leaked conversation with Mr Jhagra, Mr Tarin asked him whether he had prepared the letter for the federal government but Mr Jhagra said he would get the letter prepared and send it to him. Mr Tarin purportedly asserted that the letters should immediately be sent to the IMF representatives so that the PML-N coalition government could be taught a lesson for maltreating the PTI workers. Mr Jhagra purportedly added that he would “send all information and letters to the IMF’s second in command representative”.
Mr Tarin purportedly added that the Punjab and KP’s letters would persuade the IMF to ask the federal government to show money as committed. “In order to meet the funds’ shortage, the coalition government in the centre will be compelled to bring mini-budget…,” he said.
Mr Jhagra had sent a letter to Finance Miftah Ismail saying that the surplus by the KP government was not possible due to floods, but there has been no letter from the Punjab government so far.
When asked, Mr Leghari stayed silent on whether he had plans to send such a letter to the federal government.
Miftah’s presser
In his press conference, the federal finance minister lashed out at the PTI leadership for allegedly conspiring against Pakistan.
“Pakistan is sinking and needs the life support of the IMF to sail through and avoid default while they (PTI) took such a cheap move … shameful act to sacrifice interests of the state just because Imran Khan is not the prime minister,” the minister added.
He asked Mr Tarin to quit politics and Mr Jhagra to resign for stooping so low for party politics instead of protecting the country’s interests. The finance minister said Mr Jhagra had told him that he had not shared the letter with IMF but his audio clips and subsequent developments proved otherwise. “I checked with the IMF within an hour and they already had it [the letter],” he thundered, asking the PTI chairman Imran Khan to “apologise to the nation”.
“Taimur Jhagra should resign and Shaukat Tarin should quit politics. Is this why you do politics?” he questioned.
He said he never conceded it publicly but told Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif first thing in office that Pakistan was facing default after the PTI reneged on its IMF agreement and left behind about Rs1.6 trillion primary deficit against a commitment of Rs25bn surplus. He said not only his party but other coalition partners like PPP and MQM sacrificed their political capital to save Pakistan but “they (PTI) are committing treason”.
“Should we sacrifice everything even Pakistan for personal politics on Imran Khan’s directives? Should we change Pakistan’s name to Banigala? Is Imran Khan bigger than Pakistan? Don’t they feel ashamed?” he asked.
He called upon the PTI “to be like Mohsin Leghari” who asked Mr Tarin if the state’s interest would not suffer because of the letter he proposed. “Nobody else asked this. Jhagra said I know IMF’s number 2 and I will give him the information. Did you become politicians for this?
“When I raise the price of petrol, Shaukat Tarin and Asad Umar criticise and people of my party join in as well. What choice did I have? Would we bankrupt the country to save our ministries? he said, adding the coalition government had saved Pakistan from a Sri Lanka-like situation.
The finance minister confirmed that the KP government had demanded additional funds for merged tribal districts but when asked for details of expenditures, these were not provided.
He said similar demands were also on the table from other provinces, including Sindh, but such demands can be discussed but “does this mean you derail the IMF programme” at the eleventh hour.
Tarin fires back
However, when Mr Ismail took to Twitter to slam Mr Tarin, the latter recalled that the finance minister was facing a ‘mutiny’ within his own party.
“Miftah, for asking you to think of the marooned people of the country, we have nothing to be ashamed off. It is you who should seek forgiveness from the the people of Pakistan for inflicting misery and the highest inflation in our history. Your own party wants you to go,” he tweeted in response to the minister.

6,‘Veg-imports’ from India floated to control prices,"Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief suggests starting import of raw material, not finished goods, immediately.","ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: While the country faces a severe shortage of various vegetables after massive floods destroyed standing crops on millions of acres, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail on Monday said the government is planning to allow the duty-free import of vegetables and other edible items from India through the Wagah border to minimise the negative impact of rising inflation on the people.
Following the announcement, the business community voiced its support for the proposal, but cautioned the government to restrict traders to import only raw vegetable and not finished goods.
The finance minister mentioned the proposal regarding import from India in response to a question at a news conference, called to lambast the PTI leadership following the purported audio leaks of former finance minister Shaukat Tarin with the finance ministers of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa regarding the IMF programme.
When asked what steps the government planned to take to counter record inflation, Mr Ismail said: “We are considering duty-free import of vegetables and other edible items,” he said, adding the ministries of commerce and finance had already held consultations on the subject and would be seeking the prime minister’s approval immediately.

LCCI chief suggests starting import of raw material, not finished goods, immediately

In his view, he said, if need be, the government would also allow import of vegetables and other such items from India through the land route given the extraordinary situation, as onion and tomato prices had surged manifold within a couple of days after flash floods devastated local crops.
‘Start import immediately’
Following the announcement, the trader community of Lahore sounded optimistic. “We think that import of vegetables from India (Punjab) must be started immediately in a bid to meet our demand and reduce the increasing prices of tomato, onion and other required vegetables,” Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Mian Nauman Kabir told Dawn on Monday. “But the government must keep the imports limited to vegetables alone and not their respective finished products such as tomato ketchup, French fries, onion powder and other vegetable- or fruit-related goods.”
Moreover, Lahore’s Market Committee Secretary Shehzad Cheema said whatever proposal is being thought out must be finalised immediately. “If the government keeps this suggestion in ambiguity, the prices of tomato, onion etc will increase further in the coming days, as the importers bringing them from Kabul have started slowing down the procurement,” he explained.
According to Yasir Bhatti, a Lahore-based importer currently in Kabul, the government must open trade with India by initially getting tomato, onion and other required vegetables. “At present, the rate of tomato and onion in Kabul is rising due to the floods. Moreover, the quality is also not good. Therefore, we must start importing them from India if we want to avert a massive increase in their prices within the next 10 days,” he warned.
A spokesperson for the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan also told Dawn they would implement any decision for the import of onion, tomato. “We are yet to receive any information from the respective ministry. As soon as we get, our fruits and vegetable division will start working on it,” she added.

7,Situationer: How trade with India may prove ‘cost-effective’,"Pakistan had banned imports and exports from India on Aug 9, 2019.","With the devastating monsoon hitting all crops, the government’s proposal to allow import of vegetables from India via Wagah seems to have been necessitated by the destruction of onion and tomato crops, among others, in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
This has, obviously, driven the prices of perishable products in the domestic market to their highest-ever levels. Tomatoes are mainly produced in KP, while onions come from Sindh and Balochistan.
The sowing of the second crop of tomatoes and onions was about to start in Sindh and Balochistan, an official source in the Ministry of Food Security told Dawn.
However, this will now be further delayed, while the standing crop from the first sowing has been damaged. It is worth noting that between April and June, the supply of tomatoes and onions comes from Punjab.
Well-placed sources told Dawn the government had allowed the import of tomatoes and onions from Afghanistan and Iran to meet a shortage in the domestic market. Imports from Iran is allowed for Balochistan, they further said.
According to the sources, Indian-origin vegetables could also be sourced from Dubai to improve the supply situation in the domestic market in case Islamabad did not allow direct trade from India.
Pakistan had banned imports and exports from India on Aug 9, 2019. However, through two notifications on Sept 2, 2019 it allowed the import and export of pharmaceutical products to and from India.
On the contrary, India exports pharmaceutical products to Pakistan directly, while it imports all types of products from Pakistan.
According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, Indian exports to Pakistan stood at $0.0021m between July and March 2021-22 against $0.0662m over the previous year. The Indian exports included all crude minerals, medical and surgical instruments.
The Indian imports from Pakistan stood at $281.33m in July-March 2021-22 against $237.26m over the last year. India imports medical and pharmaceutical products and chemical products in bulk from Pakistan. However, there are other products also that India imported in small quantities.
The trade with India gained a negative momentum in 2020-21 when its exports to Pakistan fell to $0.078m from $8.04m in 2019-20. However, Indian imports from Pakistan stood at $317.35m in 2020-21 from $380.09m over the previous year. Contrary to this, Pakistani importers used third countries -- Dubai and others -- to import products of Indian origin.
Chandigarh-based journalist and blogger Chanchal M S Bedi told Dawn via WhatsApp that Pakistani importers trade with India via Dubai. He said the retail price of onion in Chandigarh near the Wagah border was Rs69 per kilogramme in the Pakistani currency, while tomatoes were available at Rs83 per kg and potatoes Rs69 per kg.
Mr Chanchal further said these prices would be much lower in case of bulk purchase for export. He said these crops were in abundance this season and could easily be exported to Pakistan through the Wagah border.
The UAE has emerged as one of the largest trade partners of Pakistan. Their total bilateral trade reached $10bn during 2021-22. Pakistan’s exports to the UAE amounted to $1.36bn and imports from the UAE stood at $8.66bn. This depicts Pakistan’s sourcing of Indian goods via Dubai.
According to the source, Pakistan could save foreign exchange by allowing direct import with lesser cost than sourcing through a third country, which increased the cost. He said the direct import of vegetables through Wagah would be cost-effective to help improve supply in the domestic market.
In March 2021, the Economic Coordination Committee announced it would allow the private sector to import 0.5 million tonnes of white sugar from India and cotton via Wagah border. However, the decision was reversed within days following severe criticism from the then opposition parties -- the PML-N and PPP.
