0,FO concerned by Indian bid to ‘infiltrate’ Twitter’s security,Calls on New Delhi to revoke access restrictions on Pakistani accounts,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Monday said it was seriously concerned by the news emanating from the Indian and US media that Delhi had attempted to “infiltrate the security system” of social media platform Twitter by “forcing it to employ an Indian agent/representative”.
Quoting media reports, the Foreign Office in a statement noted that the matter came up during Twitter’s briefing to India’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information and Technology where “legal depositions” made in the US by a former Twitter employee were also discussed.
Regrettably, it pointed out, a large number of Twitter handles, particularly those belonging to Kashmiri political leaders and media persons, “continue to remain blocked due to India’s frivolous legal objections”.
Only last month, Islamabad lodged a strong protest with the Indian government over the blocking of access to content of several Twitter handles of Pakistan’s diplomatic missions as well as the national broadcaster Radio Pakistan, it added.

Calls on New Delhi to revoke access restrictions on Pakistani accounts

Pakistan deplored India’s “brazen abuse of state-power and strong-arm tactics to manipulate and force-regulate the internet sphere”.
These actions are not only against international standards, obligations, norms, and framework of flow of information but also reflect the alarming pace of shrinking space for pluralistic voices and curbing of fundamental freedoms in India, the statement added.
Pakistan called upon India to immediately reverse the blockage of Twitter accounts of Pakistan’s diplomatic missions and Radio Pakistan to adhere to the established international norms and standards of freedom of expression as espoused by the United Nations, and desist from employing subterfuges to control the global internet domain.
It is obvious that India under a well-thought-out policy has been trying to tame the microblogging platform to achieve its diplomatic goals.
In late June, Pakistan expressed alarm after India blocked Twitter accounts of Pakistani embassies in several locations.
“Deeply concerning that India has blocked flow of information to Indian Twitter,” the FO had said in a tweet after India withheld access to some accounts at that time.
The FO said the accounts that were withheld in India were official handles run by Pakistan’s missions in Iran, Turkiye, Egypt, and the United Nations. In its tweet, the FO had identified these handles as @PakinIran, @PakinTurkey, @PakinEgypt and @PakistanUN_NY.
The Foreign Office pointed out that these accounts were in addition to many others to which access had been blocked.
On June 27, it was reported in Indian news outlets that Delhi had also withheld the Twitter handle of the official Radio Pakistan. The reports at the time said the move came after the Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting had blocked 16 YouTube channels, including six Pakistan-based channels, claiming they were “spreading disinformation related to India’s national security, foreign relations, and public order”.
Twitter had also blocked accounts of certain journalists — Indian and international — who were critical of the Modi regime.
The FO at the time urged Twitter to immediately restore access to the Pakistan missions’ accounts and ensure adherence to democratic freedom of speech and expression.
In response to the development, Radio Pakistan spokesperson Chaudhry Zameer Asharf had said the broadcaster upheld objectivity in its news stories and strictly abided by international journalistic norms.

1,12 killed in Baghdad clashes as Moqtada Sadr loyalists storm complex,Curfew imposed across Iraq; Sadr says will ‘quit politics’; UN calls development extremely dangerous.,"BAGHDAD: Twelve protesters were killed on Monday after powerful cleric Moqtada al Sadr said he would quit politics, prompting his loyalists to storm a palatial government complex in Baghdad and leading to clashes with rival Shia groups.
Young men loyal to Sadr charged the government headquarters in Baghdad’s Green Zone, once a palace of Saddam Hussein, and took to the streets outside the area where they skirmished with supporters of rival Tehran-backed groups.
As gunfire echoed over the capital, some people were seen firing guns towards the ranks of supporters of Sadr, while others fired into the air in a nation awash with weapons after years of conflict and unrest. Supporters of rival groups also hurled rocks at each other.
The flare-up followed a political deadlock lasting months that has blocked the formation of a new cabinet. The army swiftly ordered a curfew.

Curfew imposed across Iraq; Sadr says will ‘quit politics’; UN calls development extremely dangerous, urges protesters to leave the area immediately

“I hereby announce my final withdrawal,” Moqtada Sadr had announced earlier on Twitter, criticising fellow Shia political leaders for failing to heed his calls for reform.
The clashes erupted hours after that declaration, prompting his supporters, who had already been staging a weeks-long sit-in at parliament in the Green Zone, to demonstrate and storm the main cabinet headquarters. Some jumped into a swimming pool at the palace, cheering and waving flags.
Calling the developments “an extremely dangerous escalation”, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI) urged “protesters to immediately leave” the area. It urged “all” to “refrain from acts that could lead to an unstoppable chain of events”.
Iraq’s military declared an open-ended nationwide curfew and urged the protesters to leave the Green Zone.
During the stalemate over forming a new government, Sadr has galvanised his legions of backers, throwing into disarray Iraq’s effort to recover from decades of conflict and sanctions and its bid to tackle sectarian strife and rampant corruption.
Sadr, who has drawn broad support by opposing both US and Iranian influence on Iraqi politics, was the biggest winner from an October election, but withdrew all his lawmakers from parliament in June after he failed to form a government that excluded his rivals, mostly Tehran-backed parties.
Sadr has insisted on early elections and the dissolution of parliament. He says no politician who has been in power since the US invasion in 2003 can hold office.
In Monday’s announcement, Sadr said he would close his offices, although he said cultural and religious institutions would remain open.
Sadr’s decision ramped up dangerous tensions among heavily armed groups. Many Iraqis worry that moves by each camp could lead to a new civil conflict.
“The (Iran) loyalists came and burned the tents of Sadrists, and attacked protesters,” said Kadhim Haitham, a supporter of Sadr.
Pro-Iran groups blamed the Sadrists for the clashes and denied having shot at anyone. “It’s not true — if our people had guns why would they need to throw rocks?” said one militia member.
Sadr has withdrawn from politics and the government in the past and has also disbanded militias loyal to him. But he retains widespread influence over state institutions and controls a paramilitary group with thousands of members.
He has often returned to political activity after similar announcements, although the current deadlock in Iraq appears harder to resolve than previous periods of dysfunction.
The current impasse between Sadr and rivals has given Iraq its longest run without a government.
Sadr’s ally Mustafa al Kadhimi, who remains caretaker prime minister, suspended cabinet meetings until further notice after protesters stormed the government headquarters.
Iraq has struggled to recover since the defeat of the militant Islamic State group in 2017 because political parties have squabbled over power and the vast oil wealth possessed by Iraq, Opec’s second-largest producer.

2,Ukraine prepares fresh offensive to ‘retake’ southern region,IAEA team to visit Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to ‘ensure safety and security of Europe’s biggest nuclear facility’.,"

ZAPORIZHZHIA: Ukraine on Monday announced the start of a long-awaited counter-offensive to retake territory in the south seized by Russian forces since their invasion six months ago, a move reflecting Kyiv’s growing confidence as Western military aid flows in.
The news came as a team from the UN nuclear watchdog headed to Ukraine to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant — captured by Russian forces in March but still run by Ukrainian staff — that has become a hotspot in the war.
Moscow and Kyiv have traded accusations of shelling in the vicinity of the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest and close to front lines, amid fears of a radiation disaster in a country still haunted by the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.
“Today we started offensive actions in various directions, including in the Kherson region,” Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne cited Southern Command Spokeswoman Natalia Humeniuk as saying.

IAEA team to visit Zaporizhzhia plant to ‘ensure safety and security of Europe’s biggest nuclear facility’

Russia rapidly captured swathes of Ukraine’s south near the Black Sea coast, including the city of Kherson, in the early phase of the war in stark contrast to its failed attempt to capture the capital Kyiv.
Ukraine has been using sophisticated Western-supplied weapons to hit Russian ammunition dumps and wreak havoc with supply lines. Ms Humeniuk told a briefing on Monday that Ukraine had struck more than 10 such ammunition dumps in the past week, adding they had “unquestionably weakened the enemy”. The governor of Ukraine’s Russian-annexed Crimea Peninsula, Sergei Aksyonov, dismissed her announcement as “another fake of Ukrainian propaganda”. Crimea is adjacent to the Kherson region.
Russia’s RIA news agency, quoting local official Vladimir Leontiev, reported that people were being evacuated from workplaces in Nova Kahokva, a town 58km to the east of Kherson, after Ukrainian forces carried out more than 10 missile strikes there.
IAEA team to visit Zaporizhzhia
Earlier, the head of the International Atomic Agency (IAEA) said he would lead a team of inspectors this week to the Zaporizhzhia plant, on the Dnipro river in southern central Ukraine, without specifying the expected day of their arrival.
“We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility,” Rafael Grossi said in a post on Twitter.
The IAEA tweeted separately that the mission would assess physical damage, evaluate the conditions in which staff are working at the plant and “determine functionality of safety & security systems”. It would also “perform urgent safeguards activities”, a reference to keeping track of nuclear material.

 





 
On Monday Russian-installed officials said a Ukrainian missile strike had punched a hole in the roof of a fuel depot at the Zaporizhzhia plant.

3,"Taliban officials, Russia near energy deal",Afghan commerce ministry source says they are working on text of the contract.,"KABUL: The Taliban administration is in the final stages of talks in Moscow over the terms of a contract for Afghanistan to purchase gasoline and benzene from Russia, Afghan commerce ministry officials told Reuters.
Habiburahman Habib, the spokesperson for Afghanistan’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry, confirmed that an official delegation chaired by the commerce ministry was in the Russian capital and finalising contracts for supplies of wheat, gas and oil.
“They are in negotiation with the Russian side,” he said in a message to Reuters, adding that they would share details once the contracts were complete.
A source from the office of the Minister of Commerce and Industry told Reuters technical officials from his ministry and the ministry of finance had stayed in Moscow to work on the contracts after a ministerial delegation visited this month.

Afghan commerce ministry source says they are working on text of the contract

“We are working on text of contract, (we have) almost agreed on gasoline and benzene,” said the official, adding they expected it to be finished soon.
Spokespeople at Russia’s foreign and energy ministries did not respond to requests for comment.
The contracts come after a Taliban delegation, led by the acting commerce minister, visited Russia in the mid of August to hold talks on trade, while the United States tries to convince other nations to cut down on use of Russian oil.
If completed, the contract with Russia would be a sign of foreign countries increasingly doing business with the Taliban, despite its administration not being officially recognised by any international government since it regained control of the country a year ago.
Both Russia and Taliban-led Afghanistan face economic sanctions from international governments, including the United States.
No foreign government, including Moscow, formally recognises the Taliban administration and Afghanistan’s banks have been hampered by the sanctions which have left most international banks unwilling to carry out transactions with Afghan banks.
The official source said they had a plan for how payments would be made but declined to provide details on whether official banking channels would be used.
Despite Afghanistan’s central bank assets being frozen, its banking sector hampered by sanctions, and a lack of formal recognition from abroad, some countries are doing business with Kabul, helping it access global markets amid a domestic economic crisis.
Pakistan is receiving thousands of tonnes of coal from Afghanistan a day, which the former has welcomed to ease its energy crisis. Transactions are carried out by private businesses in each country, and the Taliban administration collects duties on the coal exports.

4,Nasa calls off Moon rocket launch after engine issue,Delay caused as one of the engines failed to reach temperature needed for liftoff.,"

KENNEDY CENTRE: Nasa called off a test flight on Monday of its largest-ever rocket in a setback to the ambitious programme to send humans back to the Moon and eventually to Mars.
“We don’t launch until it’s right,” Nasa administrator Bill Nelson said after an engine temperature issue forced liftoff from Kennedy Space Centre to be scrubbed.
“This is a very complicated machine,” Nelson said.
Alternative dates for launch of the US space agency’s un-crewed Artemis 1 mission are Friday and next Monday.

Delay caused as one of the engines failed to reach temperature needed for liftoff

Blastoff had been planned for 8:33am (1233 GMT) but was cancelled because of a temperature problem with one of the four engines.
Nasa said a test to get one of the engines to the proper temperature range for liftoff was not successful.
Nelson said delays were “just part of the space business” and expressed confidence that Nasa engineers will “get it fixed and then we’ll fly”.
Tens of thousands of people, including US Vice President Kamala Harris, had gathered near the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida to watch the launch.
The goal of the flight is to test the SLS and Orion crew capsule.
Mannequins equipped with sensors are standing in for a crew for the mission.
Overnight operations to fill the orange-and-white rocket with more than three million litres of ultra-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen were briefly delayed by a high risk of lightning.
Around 3:00am, another hiccup emerged: a potential leak was detected during the filling of the main stage with hydrogen, causing a pause. After tests, the flow resumed.
Nasa engineers later detected the engine temperature problem and put a hold on the countdown before eventually scrubbing the launch.
The rocket’s Orion capsule is to orbit the Moon to see if the vessel is safe for people in the near future. At some point, Artemis aims to put a woman and a person of color on the Moon for the first time.
Extreme temperatures
During the 42-day trip, the Orion capsule will orbit the Moon, coming within 60 miles (100km) at its closest approach, and then fire its engines to shoot out 40,000 miles — a record for a spacecraft rated to carry humans.
One of the mission’s primary objectives is to test the capsule’s heat shield, which at 16 feet in diameter is the largest ever built.
The craft will also deploy small satellites to study the lunar surface. A complete failure would be devastating for a programme costing $4.1 billion per launch that is already years behind schedule.
Life on the Moon
The next mission, Artemis 2, will take astronauts into orbit around the Moon without landing on its surface. The crew of Artemis 3 is to land on the Moon in 2025 at the earliest.
And since humans have already visited the Moon, Artemis has its sights set on another lofty goal: a crewed mission to Mars.
The Artemis programme is to establish a lasting human presence on the Moon with an orbiting space station known as Gateway and a base on the surface.
