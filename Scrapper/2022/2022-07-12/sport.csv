0,SL give strong reply after Jayasuriya’s six restricts Aussies,Skipper Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Mendis hit gritty half-centuries.,"GALLE: Skipper Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Mendis hit gritty half-centuries on Saturday to lead a strong Sri Lankan reply on day two of the second Test against Australia.
The hosts reached 184 for two at stumps at the Galle International Stadium, where only a few spectators watched from the stands after a fresh outbreak of political unrest in the country.
Karunaratne made 86 in a marathon stand of 152 with Kusal before Mitchell Swepson broke through with the captain’s wicket.
Kusal was still batting on 84 alongside Angelo Mathews, on six, at close of play, with Sri Lanka trailing Australia’s first innings 364 by 180 runs.
Debutant Sri Lankan spinner Prabhat Jayasuriya claimed six wickets to bowl out Australia in the first session, with Steve Smith left unbeaten on 145.
“I enjoy playing away from home. I’ve missed it, we only had the three Tests in Pakistan, before that we had a pretty long lay-off because of Covid,” Smith, who scored his first Test ton after 18 months, told reporters.
“I enjoy the challenge of playing in foreign conditions and being able to adapt. It’s always good fun.”
Smith said the tourists are in a  “decent place” and few early wicket on Sunday will help them get into the Sri Lankan  “deeper middle-order”.
The hosts were dealt an early blow when Mitchell Starc’s pace bowling got Pathum Nissanka to edge the ball to gully, where Cameron Green took a good catch.
The left hand-right hand batting pair of Karunaratne and Kusal survived an inspired spell of pace bowling from Starc and skipper Pat Cummins to grind their way through the afternoon.
Karunaratne raised his fifty with a boundary off Swepson, while Kusal’s stubborn resistance prompted Australia to rotate their bowlers.
Premier off-spinner Nathan Lyon, who starred in the team’s opening win with nine wickets, had 21 overs without success.
Swepson eventually trapped Karunaratne lbw on a delivery that skidded straight into the batsman’s pads, but Kusal then took it to stumps alongside Mathews.
“The game is evenly balanced,” Sri Lanka’s batting coach Naveed Nawaz said.
“The first two sessions we need to further establish ourselves and if we do so we can be in a good position.”
The tourists started the day on 298-5 with Smith, who scored his first Test hundred in 18 months on day one, resuming on his 109.
Jayasuriya, who took three wickets on the opening day, set a trap for overnight batsman Alex Carey, who miscued a reverse sweep to be caught at backward point for 28.
The left-arm spinner soon got Starc out for one to become the seventh Sri Lankan bowler to take five wickets in an innings on Test debut.
Jayasuriya was one of the three Sri Lankan players, along with Maheesh Theekshana and Kamindu Mendis, to be awarded a first Test cap following a Covid outbreak sidelining several members of the squad.
There were barely any spectators in the stadium for the second day’s play, with the host country embroiled in public unrest arising from its painful economic crisis.
The morning session saw hundreds of protesters looking down on the Galle fort to demand the resignation of Sri Lanka’s president — who fled his home on Saturday shortly before a huge crowd of protesters stormed his residence.
Australia lead the two-match series 1-0 after a crushing opening win inside three days during last week’s first Test.

1,Moscow-born Rybakina powers past Jabeur to clinch first Wimbledon title,"Defeats Ons Jabeur 3-6, 6-2, 6-2.","LONDON: Moscow-born Elena Rybakina rallied from a set down to defeat Tunisia’s world number two Ons Jabeur 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 in an entertaining final on Saturday to become the first player from Kazakhstan to win a Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon.
With Russian and Belarussian players banned from the grasscourt major following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Rybakina would have been excluded from this year’s Wimbledon had she not switched allegiance from Russia four years ago.
But even if the repeated questions on her links to Russia during the past fortnight impacted Rybakina mentally, it did not have any discernable impact on the 23-year-old’s game.
In a final featuring two first-time Grand Slam finalists for the first time since 1962, it was the lanky Rybakina who lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish after another power-packed performance to become the fifth different women’s champion in as many editions at the All England Club.
After the final, Rybakina said she feared she would not make the second week at the All England Club.
“I did not expect to be in the second week of a Grand Slam at Wimbledon. To be a winner is just amazing. I don’t have the words to say how happy I am,” she said.
“I was super nervous before the match, during the match and I’m happy it’s finished to be honest.”
The big-hitting Rybakina, ranked a modest 23 in the world, had never previously got beyond the last eight at a Slam before this Wimbledon.
“I want to congratulate Ons for a great match and everything you have achieved. I think you are an inspiration for everybody.
“I ran so much, I don’t think I need to do fitness anymore,” the victorious player stated.
Jabeur was bidding to make history as the first African woman to win a Grand Slam singles title.
“First of all I want to congratulate Elena and her team — great job and she deserved this and hopefully next time it will be mine,” said the world number three.
She then joked: “Elena stole my title but it’s OK.

“I love this tournament so much and I feel really sad, but I’m trying to inspire many generations from my country. I hope they are listening.”
Before Saturday’s final, Rybakina and Jabeur had met three times and both players had won a match apiece before the Moscow-born Rybakina retired due to illness in Chicago in their last showdown a year ago.
Rybakina’s booming delivery was supposed to be a key factor in Saturday’s contest but it was Jabeur who had less trouble in holding on to her serve in the opening stages on a sun-bathed Centre Court.
Jabeur’s ploy to mix things up clearly upset Rybakina’s rhythm as the Tunisian landed the first blow with a break in the third game.
Stepping inside the baseline to punish her opponent’s second serve, Jabeur made optimum use of her slices during the rallies to slow the pace down.
Rybakina appeared to lose the plot while trailing 5-3 as she committed four unforced errors — including a double fault — to hand Jabeur a second break and with it the opening set in just 32 minutes.
But the match was far from over.
The momentum shifted in the Kazakh player’s favour as she nosed ahead in the second set with an early break.
The red-framed racket of Rybakina was suddenly spitting fire while she demonstrated the agility to run down Jabeur’s drop shots despite her tall frame.
Jabeur tried to match Rybakina’s power but instead her game unravelled. The drop shots started looking less venomous as Rybakina also cut down on her unforced errors.
The Tunisian had three chances to level things up during a lengthy fourth game but Rybakina held firm and then broke Jabeur in the next game to take a 4-1 lead.
Three games later the 17th seed slammed down an 116mph ace to send the contest into a deciding set.
Rybakina took the lead by breaking Jabeur in the opening game of the final set.
Known back home as ‘Minister of Happiness’, Jabeur by then cut a frustrated figure on the lush green lawns despite enjoying the raucous backing of the Centre Court crowd.
Jabeur got them more excited in anticipation when she set up three breakpoint chances in the sixth game but once again Rybakina shut her out.
She won five straight points to save the breakpoints and then broke Jabeur again to leave the Tunisian, who was attempting to become the first African woman as well as the first Arab to win a major, burying her face in her towel during the changeover.
Rybakina appeared a bit nervous while serving for the match but then sealed the title on her first championship point as Jabeur sent a backhand wide.
The cool-as-cucumber Kazakh celebrated the victory with barely a fistpump and just a fleeting smile.

2,"Ireland  tri-series, CWG opportunities for youngsters: Bismah",KARACHI: Pakistan women’s team’s tour to Ireland for a Twenty20 tri-series and the Common­wealth Games after...,"KARACHI: Pakistan women’s team’s tour to Ireland for a Twenty20 tri-series and the Common­wealth Games after that will be an opportunity for its emerging players, captain Bismah Maroof has said.
The Ireland tri-series, set to start in the Belfast on July 16, will involve the hosts and world champions Australia. 
Following the tournament, Pakistan will fly to Birmin­gham for participate in the Commonwealth Games, which commence on July 28.
Bismah believed the eve­nts will provide the likes of youngsters Tuba Hasan, Aye­sha Naseem and Fatima Sana the stage to make a mark.
“We have a good team combination with youngsters like Tuba Hassan, Ayesha Naseem and Fatima Sana providing real energy, skill and talent, they are the ones for the future and this tour is a real opportunity for them to make a big impression,” the experienced batter said on Saturday.
Tuba impressed on her debut in Pakistan’s recent T20 series at home against Sri Lanka, bagging five wickets in three matches. Ayesha and Fatima, on the other hand, are slightly more experienced than Tuba. 
While Ayesha too was instrumental for in the Sri Lanka T20s, Fatima was named the ICC Emerging Women’s Cricketer of the Year for the year 2021.
“The tri-series in Ireland provides us a good opportunity of acclimatising to the conditions ahead of the Commonwealth Games,” Bismah said.
“At the Commonwealth Games, we would take on the challenge of playing formidable opponents as to succeed there we need to beat the big teams, our aim would be to target a victory.”
Pakistan’s preparations for the events, however, were marred by the weather and the scheduled intra-squad practice matches were compromised. Bismah said the nine-day camp, held at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium and the House of Northern here, was helpful despite the rains.
“Our preparations have suffered a bit due to the persistent rains as we could not play practice matches, we had to hence shift our focus to fitness more,” said the 30-year-old. 
“We tried to make most of the indoor facility we were provided and that did come as a good help to the side amid the weather challenges.”
The Pakistan squad is scheduled to fly to Belfast on Tuesday. The side will play their opening match of the tri-series against Australia at the Bready Cricket Club ground on 
July 16. 
Pakistan will play both Australia and Ireland twice, the top two sides will progress to compete in the final. All seven tournament matches will be staged at the same venue.
In the Commonwealth Games, Pakistan are placed in Pool ‘A’ alongside Australia, India and Barbados. 
Squad: 
Bismah Maroof (captain), Aimen Anwar, Aliya Riaz, Anam Amin, Ayesha Naseem, Diana Baig, Fatima Sana, Gul Feroza (wicket-keeper), Iram Javed, Kainat Imtiaz, Muneeba Ali Siddiqui (wicketkeeper), Nida Dar, Omaima Sohail, Sadia Iqbal, Tuba Hassan.

3,Pakistan’s entry confirmed for SAFF Women’s Championship,This will be the first event any team from Pakistan will take part in since 15-month suspension on PFF was lifted.,"KARACHI: Pakistan national women’s football team is set to end its eight-year international exile next month.
The South Asian Football Federation on Saturday confirmed that it has received Pakistan’s entry form for the SAFF Women’s Championship in Nepal, making it the first event any team from the country will take part since the 15-month suspension on the Pakistan Football Federation was lifted by FIFA last week.
“We have received their entry form yesterday,” SAFF Secretary General Anwarul Haque Helal told Dawn early Saturday morning.
Friday was the deadline for SAFF member associations to submit their entry forms and Helal had told Dawn on Friday night that South Asia’s football body was yet to receive it from the PFF Normalisation Committee.
The confirmation on Saturday means that the Pakistan women’s team will play for the first time since it featured in the 2014 edition of the SAFF Championship.
Since then, Pakistan football has been mired in crisis and controversy due to infighting in the PFF which in September 2019 forced FIFA into appointing a Normal­isation Committee for the PFF.
But even the appointment of the NC did not spare Pakistan football from further controversy.
Pakistan was suspended by FIFA in April last year after the PFF headquarters were seized by a group of officials led by Ashfaq Hussain Shah, who was elected PFF president in polls held by the Supreme Court which FIFA never accepted.
The suspension was lifted last month after the PFF NC got back control of the PFF headquarters and arranged another way to obtain FIFA funding as a case regarding its bank accounts is still being heard in court.
NC sources have told Dawn that since FIFA funding hadn’t resumed as yet, participation in the SAFF Women’s Championship would be a special case and finances for it would be arranged.

4,Djokovic set for the unexpected as Kyrgios blocks path to 21st Slam,LONDON: Novak Djokovic has contested 31 Grand Slam finals and faced just about every scenario possible in collecting...,"LONDON: Novak Djokovic has contested 31 Grand Slam finals and faced just about every scenario possible in collecting 20 titles but even he will not know what to expect in Sunday’s Wimbledon showdown against Australian showman Nick Kyrgios.
The 35-year-old Serbian, bidding for a fourth successive title, will prepare for every eventuality but the likelihood is that world number 40 Kyrgios will still conjure up some surprises.
It could be an underarm serve played between the legs on the first point of the match, a tweener drop shot from the baseline on a break point or picking a fight with a fan.
But Djokovic will know that amidst all the theatre and bravado, Kyrgios possesses a lethal range of grasscourt weapons that threaten to end his 27-match unbeaten run at Wimbledon and wrench the title from his grasp.
He will start as favourite but, significantly, in their only two previous meetings, both in 2017, Djokovic did not win a set, did not break the Kyrgios serve and had only one break point.
Djokovic is regarded as the best returner in the game, perhaps of all time, but such is the potency and disguise of the Kyrgios delivery that, if it is firing, the defending champion’s patience will be tested to the maximum and opportunities will be fleeting. 
“I guess it’s going to be a game of small margins,” said Djokovic, who is bidding for a seventh Wimbledon crown. 
“His motion for the serve is so fluid and just very quick. He can hit any angle really. He tosses it forward so he can come in, serve and volley. He puts himself in a great position to be aggressive or to stay back. 
“It’s tough to read. I haven’t practised with him or played with him since the last time I lost to him.”  
The reason for that is that there was very little love lost between the pair until a sudden thawing of their relationship this year after Kyrgios’s public support for Djokovic when he was deported from the Australian Open for not having a Covid-19 vaccination.
Kyrgios once labelled Djokovic a “tool”, said he had a “sick obsession” with wanting to be liked and described Djokovic’s trademark post-match celebration as “cringe-worthy”.
Djokovic once said he had little respect for Kyrgios off the court but ahead of Sunday’s final something of a bromance has developed between the two.
“We definitely have a bit of a bromance now, which is weird,” said Kyrgios on Friday. 
“We actually message each other on DMs in Instagram now and stuff. Earlier in the week, he was like, ‘Hopefully I’ll see you Sunday’.” 
Victory on Sunday would make Kyrgios only the third unseeded man to lift the trophy after Boris Becker in 1985 and Goran Ivanisevic in 2001.
In a campaign of all-out attack, he has fired a tournament-leading 120 aces, 292 winners, the second-fastest serve of 137 miles per hour (220 kilometres per hour) while being broken only six times.
But he has picked up a further $14,000 in fines, spat in the direction of fans and was even accused of having an “evil side” and being a “bully” by third-round rival Stefanos Tsitsipas.
He also has the added distraction of a court appearance in Australia next month, related to an allegation of assault. 
“I never thought I’d be here at all, to be brutally honest with you,” said the 27-year-old. 
“I’m just super proud and I’m just ready to go. Once you are able to raise a Grand Slam trophy, that’s like, I mean, kind of what else is there to achieve?” Kyrgios said that, win or lose on Sunday, he has already put his many detractors in their place. 
“Since I was born, only eight people have ever won this title, like eight people. I’m just going to give it my best shot.”

5,"PBF president regrets exclusion of badminton from CWG contingent, criticises PSB",LAHORE: Expressing his surprise over Pakistan Sports Board’s decision to exclude badminton from the national...,"LAHORE: Expressing his surprise over Pakistan Sports Board’s decision to exclude badminton from the national contingent which will represent the country at the upcoming Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Pakistan Badminton Federation (PBF) president Wajid Ali on Saturday said all the arrangements had been made for the badminton squad’s participation at the July 28-Aug 8 gala in Britain.
“The PSB organised a 15-day training [camp] of Pakistan’s badminton team in Lahore for the [Commonwealth] Games. Moreover, all the four players and their coach had obtained their accreditation card as well as visas, and were all set to leave for Birmingham. But the PSB has decided to exclude badminton, reportedly on the pretext that the squad has no chance of winning medals [in Birmingham],” Wajid told Dawn.
“If the entire sporting world follows the same formula which was adopted by the PSB [to exclude the badminton squad] then there is no need to send around 15,000 athletes to participate in the games as only 500 [potential] medal winners are enough to go and compete for the medals,”  Wajid added.
The PBF had selected Muard Khan, Hafiz Irfan (male), Mahoor Shahzad and Ghazala Siddiqi (female) for the Commonwealth Games, and all of whom attended the Lahore camp.
“We are trying to request the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) to help the PBF in sending the players [to Birmingham] as it will give an opportunity to them to hone their skills.
“Yes, we have no chance for medals but is the whole [sporting] world sending athletes for the medals [only]?” asked Wajid, who ruled the national circuit for more than 12 years as national champion from 1990s to around mid 2000s.
While regretting that the POA had not responded yet to PBF’s request, Wajid said still he was repeating request to the POA, insisting “it is not appropriate to drop the players when the accreditation cards had been issued to them and visas had also been obtained”.
To a question, Wajid said no reason was given to the PBF by the PSB for dropping the players as badminton was the only sport, which was excluded from the national contingent.
According to Wajid, the PSB did not organise any training camp for badminton players during the last five years, except for holding a 15-day camp in Lahore.
“Yes, medals should be the target of the PSB. But did the PSB chalked out any comprehensive training programme for athletes in the past five years to bring the players at the level from where they can earn medals at these top-level international contests [like Commonwealth Games]?” he asked.
“If the PSB expects the athletes to bring home medals after holding a 15-day camp then it is not possible.”
It is a hard fact that almost all the national sports bodies in Pakistan -- other than cricket -- were running their affairs with limited resources since it is not easy to get sponsors.
It may be mentioned that  the PSB had only cleared a contingent of 61 persons, including  42 players (39 males and three females) besides 19 officials, all men.
The Pakistan women cricket team’s entire  expenses are to be borne by the PCB, being the richest sport body of the  country.
Pakistan is fielding three male players each in athletics and boxing with one official apiece. The biggest share in the contingent is of the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) comprising 18 players and three officials.
Interestingly, the PSB on Friday also denotified the PHF, but on the other hand it has cleared the sport’s biggest contingent for Birmingham.
Only three officials are going with the national hockey team, which has some chances to finish at the podium.
Others players and officials of different disciplines which are part of the contingent include: judo (two male players, one male official), squash (two male and female players each and one officials), weightlifting (three players, one officials), wrestling (six players, one officials), swimming (one player, no officials), para athletic (one female player, one official) and table tennis (one player, one official).
Five officials and three guests, all males, are also included in the contingent.

6,Van Aert wins again as Pogacar consolidates Tour de France lead,LAUSANNE: Wout van Aert consolidated his lead in the points classification of the Tour de France with an impressive...,"LAUSANNE: Wout van Aert consolidated his lead in the points classification of the Tour de France with an impressive late burst of speed on Saturday to win the eighth stage of cycling’s biggest race, a hilly 186.3-km ride from Dole to Lausanne across the border in Switzerland.
The Belgian bagged his second stage win in this edition in a reduced bunch sprint at the top of the Cote du Stade Olympique, a 4.8-km effort at an average gradient of 4.6%.
Green jersey holder Van Aert, who now has a 115-point lead in the points classification over Dutchman Fabio Jakobsen, beat Australian Michael Matthews after launching his sprint with 200 metres left.
Tadej Pogacar took third place to retain his overall leader’s yellow jersey, picking up a four-second time bonus in the process.
Sunday’s ninth stage is a 192.9-km mountainous trek from Aigle, Switzerland, to Chatel back in France.
Pogacar was involved in an early mass pile-up that brought two-time runner-up Nairo Quintana, two-time podium finisher Romain Bardet and fellow Frenchman David Gaudu, as well as 2018 champion Geraint Thomas, to the ground - or into a grassy ditch.
None of them appeared to have been injured.
A three-man breakaway featuring Mattia Cattaneo, Frederik Frison and Fred Wright built up a lead of around three minutes on the peloton but they were kept on a tight leash.
Australian Ben O’Connor, fourth overall last year, struggled throughout the day with hip pains following a crash in Wednesday’s fifth stage. He received treatment from the race doctor and ground his way through the stage.
Wright, who had dropped Frison and Cattaneo, was finally caught with 3.5 kilometres remaining as Pogacar’s UAE Emirates team mate Rafal Majka rode a hard tempo in front of a skimming peloton.
Pogacar took a chance in the final sprint but Van Aert had too much power for him, and the Jumbo-Visma rider claimed an eighth career win on the Tour in awe-inspiring fashion.
Earlier, Pogacar’s team-mate Vegard Stake Laengen tested positive for Covid-19, and the team now face a nervous three days to see if others on the team fall sick. The 33-year-old Norwegian, often seen pulling at the front of the UAE Team Emirates train in a headwind, took ill overnight despite testing negative on Thursday morning.  
“He reported symptoms of a sore throat late last night,” said team doctor Adriano Rotunno. “The antigen test was positive and it was confirmed by a PCR.” Rotunno expressed concern the virus may have spread within the team.  
“We believe he was infected by an outside source, three to five day ago, giving him time to infect other team members,” he said outside the team bus at the start line Saturday.

England, who had been mired in a run of one win in 17 Tests, brought in McCullum as coach and named Ben Stokes as their new captain in May and the duo have made an immediate impact.
England have won all four Tests since the pair took charge, crushing world Test champions New Zealand 3-0 in June before chasing down a record 378 against India this week.
“I don’t have any idea what ‘Bazball’ is,” McCullum said.  “It’s not just all crash and burn, if you look at the approach, and that’s why I don’t really like that silly term that people are throwing out there.
“There’s actually quite a bit of thought that goes into how the guys manufacture their performances and when they put pressure on bowlers and which bowlers they put pressure on.”
McCullum also downplayed the significance of the results England have achieved with new approach.
England host South Africa in a three-Test series beginning in August and take on rivals Australia in the 2023 edition of the Ashes.
“I certainly wouldn’t say that we’ve changed the face [of Test cricket],” McCullum said.  “All we try and do is play a brand of cricket which gives the guys the greatest amount of satisfaction and gives them the best opportunity.
“We’ve also got an obligation to entertain. It’s been a tremendous month, [but] we know that there’s big challenges to come, one of which will be the Aussie boys, but we’ve just got to keep doing what we’re doing.”

The 26-year-old, who won the Olympic 400m hurdles in Tokyo last year, made a disastrous start to his season when he tore a muscle after jumping one barrier at the meet in Rabat.
“I’ve really had to be smart and to do the right things and try not to get setbacks because I didn’t have time for that,” Warholm told reporters on Friday.
“I think I’m in good shape, and all that work done before I got the injury, but for now, if my hamstrings can’t take the power that it takes to run, I have a big problem. We go flat out when we run the finals.
“I have been going 96% [in training] and haven’t felt anything. So I don’t know what’s between there [and 100%]. That is what I’m going to find out in the days coming up to the championships.” 
The World Championships will be held in Eugene, Oregon from July 15, where Warholm will renew his rivalry with American Rai Benjamin.

Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc will line up alongside the Dutch driver on the front row after a scrap for second with Spanish team-mate and British Grand Prix winner Carlos Sainz, who finished third.
The victory at the Red Bull Ring stretched Verstappen’s championship lead to 38 points over team-mate Sergio Perez, who finished fifth after starting 13th. Leclerc is six points further back. 
“It was a decent race. We had a good pace at the beginning and after that we were very closely matched. It was good, it was like a sprint should go, quite flat out,” said Verstappen, who had qualified on pole on Friday. 
“The car is good. Just a few things to fine tune but overall we’ve been really competitive again this weekend,” added the 24-year-old, who took the chequered flag 1.675 seconds clear of Leclerc.
Verstappen also won the season’s previous sprint at Imola in April and his army of Dutch fans let off flares to send clouds of orange smoke billowing from the stands before and after the 23-lap race.
Mercedes’s George Russell took fourth place, with seven-times world champion team mate Lewis Hamilton taking a point in eighth.
Alpine’s Esteban Ocon was sixth, the Frenchman stopping on track after the chequered flag, with Kevin Magnussen seventh for Haas.
The sprint race awards points to the top eight, with the winner taking eight.
Ocon’s team-mate and twice world champion Fernando Alonso failed to start the sprint after his car remained jacked up on the grid with tyre blankets still on.
It was then pushed back into the garage with Alonso set to start on the back row on Sunday with Aston Martin’s four-times champion Seba­stian Vettel the only other retirement.
The field did a second formation lap after Alfa Romeo’s Chinese rookie Guanyu Zhou stopped, sending him to the pit lane.
Leclerc passed Sainz on lap one but the Spaniard remained on his tail, trying to retake the position in a battle that would have done little to calm the nerves of Ferrari bosses on the pitwall. 
“Probably tomorrow we cannot afford to do what we did today,” said Leclerc.
Hamilton started ninth but made contact with Pierre Gasly’s AlphaTauri on the opening lap, dropping to 11th. The Briton then battled back but had a tough and lively battle with Mick Schumacher for eighth.
The Haas driver, who was passed on the penultimate lap, was summoned to the stewards after the race for alleged ‘starting procedure infringements’.
Williams’s Alex Albon was also in trouble with stewards, collecting a five-second penalty for forcing McLaren’s Lando Norris off the track on lap four. He also tangled with Vettel.
