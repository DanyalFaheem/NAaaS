0,Auto industry fears massive drop in sales,"New taxes, curbs on auto financing and soaring fuel prices cause anxiety among buyers.","KARACHI: Auto industry players anticipate a 30 per cent sales drop in 2022-23 in view of uncertainty after the increase in withholding tax on filers and non-filers, imposition of one per cent capital value tax on vehicles exceeding 1,300cc, strict auto financing rules to compress demand, high interest rates and more price shocks on the cards.
Speaking to Dawn, market sources said assemblers are also flexing their muscles to pass on the impact of the continuous rupee devaluation against the dollar and high sea freight rates in the form of price hikes in vehicles after Eidul Azha, with many stressing that the industry is passing through a crisis.
Indus Motor Company (IMC) has already closed down the advance booking of vehicles from May 18, followed by Lucky Motor Corporation Limited (LMCL) from May 20 on Picanto Automatic and Sportage and Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited (PSMCL) from July 1.
These decisions were taken by the assemblers owing to looming exchange crisis and the SBP’s decision to disallow the opening of letters of credit (LCs) for the import of parts and accessories from May 20, 2022.

New taxes, curbs on auto financing, soaring fuel prices cause anxiety among buyers

Talking to Dawn, IMC CEO Ali Asghar Jamali anticipates at least a 30pc plunge in vehicle sales in FY23 due to rising fuel prices, SBP’s restrictions on opening LCs for auto parts and new taxes imposed from July 1.
On the chances of a price increase after Eid, Mr Jamali said, “We have to jack up prices. No [other] choice.”
According to auto industry insiders, the impact of increase in various taxes, soaring interest rates, vehicle prices, high petrol and diesel prices, LC restrictions, and reduction in consumer financing tenure will be visible in September 2022 vehicle sales data, as assemblers are currently upbeat over thousands of advance booking orders for cars, jeeps, SUVs, and pickup made a few months ago and would be delivered in the next few months.
Around 26pc of total sales of IMC are from auto financing, while the share of consumer financing in total sales of Pak Suzuki stands at 35pc.
Fearing a 25-30pc sales fall in FY23, a Korean vehicle assembler said the company has not increased the prices of Kia vehicles. Some changes have emerged after the Finance Act relating to the implementation of 1pc CVT on vehicles above 1,300cc from July 1. As a result, two Kia Stonic models now have a 1pc CVT for Rs44,250-47,250, three Sportage models for Rs53,000-64,990, and three Sorento models for Rs68,360-74,990.
According to Honda Atlas Cars Limited (HACL), the 1pc CVT on the City 1.5 ranges between Rs35,890-38,990 while on two modes of the Honda BR-V, the CVT hovers between Rs42,490-42,740. The 1pc CVT on six Honda Civic models costs between Rs55,490-66,740.
On withholding tax on filers and non-filers, the HACL official said there is no change in WHT on filers in the Honda product line. However, Rs75,000 is charged for non-filers on purchasing the Honda City 1,200cc, which was Rs50,000. For the 1,301,600cc version, the rate of non-filers is Rs150,000 instead of Rs100,000.
PSMCL has informed its authorised dealers to charge Rs10,000 for Alto (all variants), Bolan and Ravi from filers, which was Rs7,500, while the non-filers will pay Rs30,000 instead of Rs15,000 on the same models.
Income tax filers interested in purchasing a WagonR or Cultus (all variants) will need to pay Rs20,000 instead of Rs15,000, while Swift buyers will pay Rs25,000.
The non-filers of Wagon R and Cultus will have to deposit Rs60,000 instead of Rs30,000, while a non-filer will make a payment of Rs75,000 instead of Rs50,000.
An Excise and Taxation Sindh official, who asked not to be named, said the motor vehicle registration charges have been the same in the last two years but the rate of WHT on filer and non-filer and CVT has been raised from July 1. 
The motor registration fee payable at the time of registration for cars/jeeps not exceeding 1,000cc is 1pc of the value of the vehicle, followed by 1.25pc on 1,000-1,300cc vehicles, 2.25pc on 1,301-2,500cc vehicles, and 5pc on cars/jeeps exceeding 2,500cc.
A private bank employee dealing in the auto leasing said, “Targets to achieve auto financing are tough due to limited enquiries from the customers.”
Car sales of Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association members soared to 210,633 in 11MFY22 from 139,613 units in the same period last fiscal. Sale of LCVs, vans and jeeps swelled to 40,255 from 45,891 units.

1,Fitch cuts Turkey’s debt ratings to ‘B’,Cites  increasing inflation and broad concerns about economy as reasons for downgrade.,"ISTANBUL: Ratings agency Fitch HAS downgraded Turkey’s debt rating to  “B” from  “B+” citing increasing inflation and broad concerns about the economy, from a widening current account deficit to interventionist policies.
Inflation in Turkey shot to a 24-year high 78.62 per cent in June, mainly due to a currency crisis at the end of last year and the lira’s continued decline.
The economic fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also stoked prices in import-dependent Turkey, especially due to rising energy and commodity costs.
In a statement on Friday, the agency affirmed its ratings outlook at  “negative”, adding that it expects Turkey’s consumption to slow given rising inflation, a weaker exchange rate and diminishing domestic confidence. Fitch forecast annual inflation to average 71.4pc this year, the highest among sovereigns rated by the agency, adding that its trajectory remains highly uncertain. Average inflation is set to slow to 57pc in 2023, Fitch said, due to overly accommodative policies until parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for no later than June 2023.
The lira lost 44pc of its value against the dollar last year, mainly due to a series of rate cuts from the central bank, sought by President Tayyip Erdogan. The currency is down a further 23pc so far this year.
The government has taken steps to stem the lira’s decline. A recent move by the BDDK banking watchdog to restrict lira lending to foreign currency-rich companies helped it rally briefly last week as corporates sold hard currencies.

2,Growth in micro-loan disbursals flatlines,"Micro-loan disbursals in the first quarter of 2022 total Rs134.7bn, up 0.1pc from the October-December quarter of 2021.","KARACHI: The disbursement of microfinance loans flat-lined in January-March on a quarterly basis after registering an almost 20 per cent increase in the preceding three-month period.
Micro-loan disbursals in the first quarter of 2022 totalled Rs134.7 billion, up 0.1pc from the October-December quarter of 2021, latest data released by the Pakistan Microfinance Network (PMN) shows. However, the increase was 30.6pc on a year-on-year basis.  
Negligible quarterly growth in disbursements came alongside a 6.3pc increase in the gross loan portfolio (GLP), which amounted to Rs417.2bn. Loan disbursements are fresh credit extended in the three-month period while GLP accounts for the entire outstanding principal owed by existing clients.
According to the commentary by the PMN analysts, the major contribution in the growth of GLP was from the microfinance bank peer group where Mobilink Microfinance Bank Ltd was at the top of the list owing to the significant adoption of digital credit and a greater outreach to the customer base.
On an annual basis, outstanding microfinance loans rose 22.5pc over the trailing 12 months.
The flat-lined quarterly growth in fresh loan disbursements is apparently reflective of the high-base effect. The one-fifth increase in micro-loans in October-December of 2021 was owing to the sowing of wheat, which takes place in the last three months of every year. No such seasonal impetus greased the loan disbursal process in the January-March quarter.
The microfinance industry disbursed 5.2 million loans in the three-month period under review, up 10.5pc from the preceding quarter.
There were 8.2m active borrowers at the end of January-March, up 0.9pc from the number of borrowers at the end of the October-December quarter.
The average loan size in January-March was Rs25,629, down 9.4pc from Rs28,292 in the preceding quarter. The sharp decrease in the average ticket size is because of no growth in fresh loan disbursements (numerator) coupled with a notable rise in the number of loans (denominator).
On an annual basis, however, the average loan size increased 2.4pc in January-March. The State Bank of Pakistan has now allowed microfinance banks to disburse small business loans of up to Rs3m. This is expected to result in an increase in quarterly disbursements and the overall average loan size. Unlike in the past, microfinance banks are now actively financing tractors and other commercial vehicles and extending long-term loans for affordable housing.
The ratio of early delinquencies — loans more than 30 days overdue — improved from 5.8pc at the end of December to 4.2pc at the end of March. The share of clientele of the microfinance industry in the rural areas increased to 70pc from 65pc in the previous quarter.
As for micro-savings, the number of active savers remained 84.2m, up 7pc and 25pc on a quarterly and annual basis, respectively.
The value of savings stood at Rs429.5bn at the end of January-March, up 1.7pc from a quarter ago. Mobilink Microfinance Bank Ltd and Telenor Microfinance Bank Ltd drove the expansion in the active savers base primarily because of mobile wallets.
The microfinance penetration rate — which shows the share of the relevant population that has used microfinance products at least once in their lifetime — was 40pc at the end of March versus 37pc a year ago. This means six in every 10 potential customers in the country still can’t access microfinance.

3,Underground storage must for availability of low-cost gas,"Project will cost $1,388.82m, and the most likely option for implementation is a hybrid of public and private participation.","ISLAMABAD: An underground gas storage (UGS) project on the depleted Khorewah-1 gas reserve in Badin district is viable for making low-cost gas available in the country all year around, an economic feasibility study commissioned by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said.
The feasibility report has been prepared by a Danish consulting company in association with German and Pakistani partners within the framework of ADB’s technical assistance for gas development projects signed by Pakistan and the bank in July 2019.
The report proposed that the project be financed through a combination of debt and equity with the expectation of a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The Khorewah project will cost $1,388.82 million, and the most likely option for implementation is a hybrid of public and private participation, according to the financing framework.
The expected storage capacity at Khorewah gas reserve is 70BCF, which is flexible depending upon the market demand and supply. The Khorewah gas reserve is in the sandstones of the Lower Goru Formation.
The ADB study proposed that the gas be imported under the Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India (TAPI) Pipeline and Iran-Pakistan (IP) Gas Pipeline and transported to the storage site via the Sui Southern Gas Company’s pipeline. Initially, a certain amount of gas would be stored in the storage as a “cushion,” which is the volume of gas required as permanent inventory to support the technical operation of an underground gas storage.
In order to meet the growing energy demands, the government of Pakistan is pushing the implementation of various gas import projects, such as TAPI, Offshore Gas Pipeline Project (OGPP), etc. Currently, the growing energy demands of Pakistan are partially met through the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
According to the final report of the economic feasibility study, the development of the project in Khorewah has neither resulted in unacceptable impacts on the environment during the construction phase nor will impose any threat to the environment in the subsequent operation phase.
One major concern addressed by the Pakistan government was the non-availability of an underground gas facility as the Khorewah Mining Lease is still valid and producing, with an expiry date of December 2024. The field is still producing, however, at very low rates. All rates will be zero in December 2020.
The report says working gas is the volume of gas in the storage facility above the cushion gas. Injection capacity is the amount of gas that can be injected into a storage facility daily. Withdrawal capacity is the amount of gas that can be withdrawn from a storage facility.
The report says that there might be an additional benefit to having LNG storage capacity in place to provide some gas supply to the southern area during winter periods, while the UGS storage will be primarily used to provide natural gas to the northern region of Pakistan. This has the advantage that the gas can be directly supplied from the LNG storage facility instead of re-gasifying the LNG, sending it to the northeast to the UGS facility, and later sending it back to the south during high demand.
The report, apart from the contracting strategy proposed, calls for the need also look at additional gas supply by constructing storage facilities near existing LNG infrastructure and adjacent to the tie-in of the future North-South Gas Pipeline, in addition to the construction of a UGS in Khorewah.

4,Soaring inflation pushed 71m into poverty: UN,"Study says as interest rates rise in response to soaring inflation, there is risk of further recession-induced poverty.","ISLAMABAD: The United Nations Development Progr­amme (UNDP) has warned that the impact of soaring inflation is drastically faster than the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic and that 71 million people in the developing world have fallen into poverty in just three months as a direct consequence of the global food and energy price surge. 
The UNDP in a new study released on Thursday says that as interest rates rise in response to soaring inflation, there is a risk of triggering further recession-induced poverty that will exacerbate the crisis even more, accelerating and deepening poverty worldwide. 
The report, “Addressing the Cost of Living Crisis in Developing Countries”, says the projected number of people falling into poverty at $1.90 a day reaches 51.6m after the short-term impact of soaring food and energy prices, and up to 71m people if poverty is measured with higher poverty lines. The cost-of-living crisis could also worsen the conditions of the existing poor population. 
Developing countries, grappling with depleted fiscal reserves and high levels of sovereign debt as well as rising interest rates on global financial markets, face challenges that cannot be solved without urgent attention by the global community. 
Analysis of 159 developing countries globally indicate that price spikes in key commodities is already having immediate and devastating impacts on the poorest households, with clear hotspots in the Balkans, countries in the Caspian Sea region and Sub-Saharan Africa in particular the Sahel region, according to the UNDP estimates. 
Countries facing the most drastic impacts of the crisis across all poverty lines are Armenia and Uzbekistan in Central Asia; Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, and Sudan in Sub-Saharan Africa; Haiti in Latin America; and Pakistan and Sri Lanka in South Asia. 
In Ethiopia, Mali, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Yemen the impacts could be particularly hard at the lowest poverty lines, whereas in Albania, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Mongolia and Tajikistan the hits could be hardest. 
“Unprecedented price surges mean that for many people across the world, the food that they could afford yesterday is no longer attainable today,” says UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. “This cost-of-living crisis is tipping millions of people into poverty and even starvation at breathtaking speed and with that, the threat of increased social unrest grows by the day.” 
Policymakers responding to the cost-of-living crisis, particularly in poorer nations, face difficult choices. The challenge is how to balance meaningful short-term relief to poor and vulnerable households, at a moment when most developing countries are struggling with shrinking fiscal space and ballooning debt. 
The report shows that energy subsidies disproportionately benefit wealthier people, with more than half of the benefits of a universal energy subsidy favoring the richest 20 per cent of the population. By contrast, cash transfers mostly go to the poorest 40pc of the population. 
The report notes that multilateral and bilateral actors face an additional challenge, which is to refrain from repurposing fiscal resources from one set of development challenges to another set of challenges. Resources for both humanitarian and development assistance are needed. 
The bridge that links cash transfers to compensate for food and energy price spikes in the short run to the labour markets, social protection systems and small and medium businesses needed to reactivate supply chains and catalyse inclusive growth in the medium run is a quintessential development challenge.

5,US to end tax treaty with Hungary,"Move comes in wake of Budapest’s decision to block EU’s implementation of new, 15pc global minimum tax.","WASHINGTON: The US Treasury on Friday said it was moving to terminate a 1979 tax treaty with Hungary in the wake of Budapest’s decision to block the European Union’s implementation of a new, 15 per cent global minimum tax.
A Treasury spokesperson said that since Hungary lowered its corporate tax rate to 9pc - less than half the 21pc US rate - the tax treaty unilaterally benefits Hungary.
“The benefits are no longer reciprocal - with a significant loss of potential revenues to the United States and little in return for US business and investment in Hungary.”  The timing of the termination following years of US concerns about the treaty suggests that Treasury is using it to try to pressure Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to agree to implement the 15pc global minimum tax agreed by nearly 140 countries.
Hungarian Fore­ign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that the global minimum tax would ruin Europe’s competitiveness and endanger jobs in Hungary.

6,Twitter has legal edge in deal dispute with Musk,WILMINGTON: Twitter Inc has a strong legal case against Elon Musk walking away from his $44 billion deal to acquire...,"WILMINGTON: Twitter Inc has a strong legal case against Elon Musk walking away from his $44 billion deal to acquire the US social media company but could opt for a renegotiation or settlement instead of a long court fight, according to legal experts.
Delaware courts, where the dispute between the two sides is set to be litigated, have set a high bar for acquirers being allowed to abandon their deals. But target companies often choose the certainty of a renegotiated deal at a lower price or financial compensation rather than a messy court battle that can last for many months, three corporate law professors interviewed by Reuters said.
“The argument for settling at something lower is that litigation is expensive,” said Adam Badawi, a law professor at UC Berkeley.  “And this thing is so messy that it might not be worth it.”  Twitter and Musk spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Musk’s main claim against Twitter is that the San Francisco-based company breached their deal because it will not share with him enough information to back up its claim that spam or fake accounts constitute less than 5 per cent of its active users. Twitter has stood by this estimate but also said it’s possible the number of these accounts is higher.
Musk also said in a letter to Twitter on Friday that the company’s misrepresentation of the number of spam accounts might be a  “material adverse effect (MAE)” that would allow him to walk away under the terms of the deal contract.
But legal experts said Delaware courts view MAEs as dramatic, unexpected events that cause long-term harm to a company’s performance. Deal contracts such as the one between Musk and Twitter are so prescriptive that a judge has ruled that an MAE has validly been triggered only once in the history of such litigation -- in the case of German healthcare group Fresenius Kabi AG ending its deal for US generic drugmaker’s Akorn Inc in 2018.
In that case, a court ruled that Akorn’s assurances to Fresenius that it was in compliance with its regulatory obligations were inaccurate. It also found that Akorn had withheld facts about its deteriorating performance that emerged in whistleblower allegations.
Legal experts were dismissive of the idea that inaccurate spam account numbers would amount to an MAE for Twitter on the same level as the problems that plagued Akorn.
“If it goes to court, Musk has the burden to prove more likely than not, that the spam account numbers not only were false, but they were so false that it will have significant effect on Twitter’s earnings going forward,” said Ann Lipton, associate dean for faculty research at Tulane Law School.
Musk also claimed that Twitter breached their agreement by firing two key high-ranking employees, its revenue product lead and general manager of consumer, without his consent as required by their contract.
“That’s probably the only claim that has any purchase,” said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, but he added he did not believe the firings were serious enough to affect Twitter’s business.
In 2020, the Delaware court allowed Mirae Asset Capital Co of South Korea to walk away from a $5.8 billion luxury hotel deal because the pandemic caused the seller, Anbang Insurance Group of China, to alter its ordinary course hotel operations.
Litigation to the end
Most of the times the courts find in favour of the target companies and order acquirers to complete their deals - a legal remedy known as  “specific performance.”  In 2001, for example, Tyson Foods, the largest US chicken processor, decided it no longer wanted to buy the largest meatpacker, IBP Inc. A judge ordered that the deal be completed.
Many companies, however, choose to settle with their acquirers to end uncertainty about their future that can weigh on their employees, customers and suppliers.
This happened more frequently when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out in 2020 and delivered a global economic shock. In one instance, French retailer LVMH threatened to walk away from a deal with Tiffany & Co. The US jewellery retailer agreed to lower the acquisition price by $425 million to $15.8bn.
Simon Property Group Inc, the biggest U.S. mall operator, managed to cut its purchase price of a controlling stake in rival Taubman Centres Inc by 18pc to $2.65bn.
Other companies let the acquirers walk away in exchange for financial compensation. That includes medical technology firm Channel Medsystems Inc, which sued Boston Scientific Corp for trying to walk away from their $275 million deal. In 2019, a judge ruled the deal should be completed and Boston Scientific paid Channel Medsystems an undisclosed settlement.
