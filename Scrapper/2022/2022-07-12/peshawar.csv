1,KP govt starts providing free healthcare to tribal people,25 patients from ex-Fata hospitalised during last 24 hours.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has started free treatment of the residents of the newly-merged districts after the federal government stopped their cashless medication on June 30 this year.
“We have included the population of the newly-merged districts and frontier regions in Sehat Card Plus programme run by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government,” said Provincial Minister Taimur Khan Jhagra in a statement.
He expressed concerns over the abrupt decision by the federal government to exclude the 1.6 million people of tribal districts from availing free health services. He said that provincial government decided to continue providing free health services to people of former Fata.
“We have asked the State Life Insurance Corporation (SLIC) to extend the facilities to the population of erstwhile Fata on emergency basis. It means that now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will be giving free services to all its population. We are already providing free health coverage to eight million families of the province. Now the population of tribal districts has been included in the Sehat Card Plus (SCP) programme,” said the minister.

25 patients from ex-Fata hospitalised during last 24 hours

He said that provincial government restored not only free health services to the residents of tribal districts but also enhanced the annual package per family to Rs1 million from Rs720,000, they had been receiving from the federal’s Sehat Sahulat Programme (SSP).
He said that those 1.6 families of the tribal districts were excluded by federal government unilaterally from the programme without taking into account that they needed free health services more than the residents of other parts of the country.
The minister said that Rs1 million was not the limit. He added that all those people, who possessed the identity cards of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, were eligible to free health services. “They stand eligible to all services, including liver and renal transplants at the premier health institutions of the country free of cost. These procedures cost Rs5 million and Rs1.5 million, respectively,” he added.
Officials told this scribe that during the last 24 hours, 25 patients from tribal districts were admitted to empanelled hospitals under the programme. They said that it was an interim relief given by the provincial government to the people of tribal districts.
They said that provincial government had taken up the issue of funds for the treatment of the residents of former Fata as they were supposed to get free health services under the federal’s SSP till June 30, 2023.
They said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government required about Rs5 billion to pay for the treatment of the residents of tribal districts for one year. They added that it had been decided by the government that the centre would sponsor the programme till 2023 and in case of shifting it to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, assets would also be transferred.
Officials said that Chief Minister Mahmood Khan had already written letter to the federal government to reconsider the move of halting funds for the programme and release the required amount to the province. They said that federal government had provided free services to 189,047 people but the package was Rs720,000 per family and renal and liver transplant were not part of the package announced for people of former Fata.
“We got data from Nada and have asked SLIC for implementation of the programme as interim arrangement,” they said. They added that there were more than 1,100 public and private hospitals across the country where the entitled families could get free health services. So far, Rs28 billion has been spent on the free treatment of 1.2 million people of the province. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has 192 hospitals empanelled for the scheme.

6,Irrigation system in Shangla ‘dysfunctional’,Growers say low rainfall causing low productions...,"SHANGLA: Growers have complained about dysfunctional irrigation system and said they had to rely on rains to grow crops, so low rainfall caused low productions.
They told Dawn that the damaged irrigation channels coupled with delayed rains and growing fertiliser and seed prices were turning fertile lands barren.
The farmers said most irrigation channels in the district, including the main Bisham tehsil, had been dysfunctional for around a decade.
“I used to get three tons of wheat and corn from my agricultural lands 12 years ago but crops are no more grown there due to the diversion of water from the Khan Khwar (river) to a 72 megawatts power project as well as the broken irrigation channels,” said Bisham resident Rozi Shah.

Growers say low rainfall causing low productions

He said all three major irrigation channels of the area had long been in bad shape with the relevant authorities continuing to ignore requests for their repairs.
Dr Bahr-i-Karam of Damorai area in Kana tehsil said his family used to grow wheat, corn and rice on its land but that was no more the case as water unavailability over the years had rendered it barren.
He complained about low rainfall and said limited water was there to irrigate agricultural lands.
Another local farmer, Mohammad Ali, said wheat, rice and corn crops grown by his family on its land used to be its main source of livelihood but the land’s barrenness over the years had forced it to buy them from the market for own consumption.
He said the irrigation channels in Damorai, Kekor, Olandar were damaged by the 2010 flash floods but they had neither been inspected or repaired ever since.
“We even formally requested NGOs for repairs, but to no avail,” he said.
The grower insisted that the district was self-sufficient in food production.
The irrigation department’s records show that the 2020-21 Annual Development Programme had Rs75 million projects of flood protection works, irrigation channels and installation of solar tubewells.
When contacted, assistant commissioner Muneeba Fatima insisted that the irrigation department didn’t have an office in the district, so most problems of the local growers stayed unresolved.
She, however, claimed that the irrigation department had been ‘engaged’ for the resolution of those issues.
“Shangla was declared a district in 1995, so the streamlining of its affairs will take time,” she said.

7,37.56 million saplings to be planted in monsoon drive,"Forestry dept says exercise to begin in province next week, last until end of Sept...","PESHAWAR: The forestry department has planned to plant around 37.564 million saplings in the province during the ongoing monsoon season.
Official documents show that the plantation campaign will be carried out in all three forest regions, including tribal districts, in collaboration with all stakeholders, including security forces and educational institutions.
According to them, the forestry department, in collaboration with other stakeholders including defense forces and educational institutions, would carry out the plantation drive.
In the Central Southern Forest Region comprising southern and tribal districts, a total of 19.624 million saplings will be planted, while the plantation target for the Northern Forest Region (Hazara Division) is 8.927 million saplings and 9.013 million for the Malakand Forest Region.

Forestry dept says exercise to begin in province next week, last until end of Sept

Under the departmental plantation plans, 20.686 million saplings will be planted.
The documents show that the campaign will be carried out in urban and semi-urban areas of the province.
According to them, the forestry department will provide 3.879 million young trees to the defence forces, while educational institutions will plant a total of 0.948 million saplings.
Officials of the forestry department told Dawn that the plantation campaign would begin in the second week of the current month and would last until the end of September.
They said that indigenous and exotic species would be planted in all three forest regions of the province. The drive is a part of the 10 Billion Tree Afforestation Programme (10-BTAP).
The federal and provincial governments are jointly financing the 10-BTAP. The department has planted total 640 plants in the province so far.
Under its flagship billion Tree Tsunami programme, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government had planted around one billion plants in the province between 2013 and 2018.
Meanwhile, the forestry department has decided to reduce the plantation of eucalyptus saplings by slashing their number from 28 million to 120 million.
According to it, the species will be planted only in waterlogged and saline areas of the province that is less than three per cent of the total target area.
Officials told Dawn that all field formations had been directed to plant eucalyptus trees in only water logged and marshy places, as recommended in PC-I of the 10 BTAP. Environmentalists have serious reservations about eucalyptus plantation.
Sources said that the assembly’s standing committee on climate change had directed the forestry departments of all provinces to discourage the plantation of eucalyptus, because the species, which was first imported from Australia in the 1960s, consumed a huge amount of water, so the local environment wasn’t suitable for the tree’s plantation.

At PAL’s Diamond Jubilee Celebrations titled ‘75 Years of Pakistani Urdu Novel’, Dr Yousaf Khushk said Pakistan experienced many ups and downs after partition which was reflected in the Urdu novel.
“It can be said that Urdu novels tell the history of a 75-year-old Pakistan. All the work done in the fields of science and literature in Pakistan during these years … should be turned into a document to provide a platform for researchers and critics,” according to the PAL chief.
Dr Ziaul Hassan presided over the session while Dr Ravish Nadeem was the chief guest on the occasion. 
A book ‘75 Years of Pakistani Urdu Novel’ published by the PAL was also launched at the event in Islamabad which was also attended by writers, intellectuals, teachers and students through Zoom. The session was moderated by Dr Shahid Nawaz.
During the session, Dr Hassan said that hundreds of novels have been written in Urdu. 
He added literature is written for two types of people: laypersons; and people who understand high literature. 
Dr Ravish Nadeem, while sharing his views, said that a novel was an expression of the urban situation of the modern industrial age. 
“It is a reflection of the multifaceted and layered cultural situation that studies human society and introduces cosmic questions into contemporary scientific and historical consciousness,” he said.

Most people sink their differences on the propitious occasion by visiting their relatives and friends and exchanged Eid greetings.
House wives remain busy in preparing variety of dishes with obviously comprised meat as major ingredient owing to slaughter of sacrificial animals. 
Men, especially youth, get engaged to cook their favourite dishes and yet groups of friends plan to enjoy trips to scenic spots together where they cook meat dishes along with mangoes or some other fruit variety.
Elders on such happy occasions come together to resolve internecine disputes and also participate in happy rituals mostly arranged during the Eid holidays. 
Village meetings are held to resolve disputes between individuals, groups and even tribes through negotiations and table talks followed by celebrations and exchange of pledges to live like friends in future.
Old women have their own duties. 
They most often walk out to look for suitable girls for their young ones because it is considered the right time to choose girls for their sons as they entertain the guests in homes and the old women judge overall personality including attitude, smartness and way of presentation.
Children, who mostly enjoy such happy occasions to the maximum, are allowed to visit village fairs in groups while young boys as said earlier arrange short trips to tourist spots where they together chit chat, prepare delicious meals and also at times enjoy live music as it is often seen that local musicians entertain the occasional visitors with their enchanting folk music.
A marked difference could be seen between rural and urban areas as people from the latter leave for rural areas to celebrate Eid holidays with their dear and near ones and also to refresh their past memoires with their friends and relatives. 
Such visits keep people living in the city areas close to their parents, friends and relatives residing in the rural areas and villages.
People in rural areas enjoy sitting around one long table cloth for eating dishes with different tastes and flavours and every single home dweller contributes his dish and thus the tradition of togetherness lives on.
Open spaces including village hujras are fast being devoured by increasing population but in tribal districts and elsewhere across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, people still enjoy Eid pleasantries in their hujras where elders hold jirgas and several cultural events and youngsters arrange live music shows, engage in folk dances and meal parties to welcome friends and guests. 
Grand meals, warm greetings and entertaining guests and dine outs are some of the highlights of the Eid festival.

11,PHC orders return of voluntary payment made in corruption case,Ex-deputy secy insists he was coerced for ‘voluntary return’ deal with NAB.,"PESHAWAR: Accepting the petition of a former deputy secretary (establishment) facing trial for the alleged accumulation of illegal assets, the Peshawar High Court has ordered the National Accountability Bureau to return Rs2.317 million paid under the voluntary return (VR) deal seven years ago.
A bench consisting of Justice Musarrat Hilali and Justice Ijaz Anwer accepted a petition filed by former deputy secretary Riaz Hussain Khattak seeking orders for the NAB to return Rs2.317 million deposited by him on Jan 16, 2015, under the voluntary return agreement.
The petitioner claimed that he was ‘coerced’ to make the VR agreement with the NAB though he was innocent and had not committed anything declared a crime by the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999.
He contended that now he had been facing trial for the same offence, therefore, the said deposited amount should be returned back to him.

Ex-deputy secy insists he was coerced for ‘voluntary return’ deal with NAB

The respondents in the petition were the NAB through its chairman, the NAB Peshawar’s director general, and the federal government.
The petitioner’s counsel, Ashfaq Ahmad Daudzai, said that the NAB had initiated an inquiry against his client on allegation of accumulation of assets disproportionate to his known sources of income.
He said that during course of inquiry the petitioner was suffering from Parkinson and 
some other diseases and he was under acute physical and mental stress.
The lawyer contended that the respondent succeeded in compelling the petitioner to sign VR agreement as result of coercion, humiliation and pressure exerted on him.
He said that the petitioner had deposited Rs2.317 million in the name of NAB’s chairman out of total liability calculated by the NAB of Rs6.815 million, whereas rest of the amount had to be paid in two equal installment s as per existing policy.
Mr Daudzai said that the NAB later issued certain notices to the petitioner for the default of payment of the rest of the amount which was challenged in the high court through a petition.
He pointed out that the said petition was decided on April 26, 2017, wherein it was held that the petitioner could not be pressured to deposit the rest of the amount as against the mandate of the statute rather recovery could be made under Section 33 of the NAO and the impugned notices were set aside.
The counsel said that the respondents were aggrieved with the said judgment and they challenged it before the Supreme Court, which was allowed on June 19, 2019, on the basis of the submission made by the present petitioner’s counsel there that he was no longer interested in voluntary return deal, so the respondents were directed to proceed in accordance with the law.
He said that the NAB later re-authorised inquiry/investigation in the case, while on the completion of investigation, a reference was filed against the petitioner that was pending trial before the accountability court.
Mr Daudzai argued that as the reference in question was the result of the inquiry into the matter for which that VR amount was deposited, his client approached the accountability court for the return of that amount to him, but the application was turned down on Nov 12, 2021.
He contended that the act of the respondents while retaining the amount in question after the filing of the reference was against the provisions of the NAO regarding the voluntary return deals.
