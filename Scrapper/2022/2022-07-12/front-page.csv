0,‘N’ foregoes ministers to ensure hold over Lahore ‘citadel’,"Claims Ayaz Sadiq, Salman Rafique stepped down for by-poll campaign; Marriyum says they'll return to their portfolios after polls.","• Party claims Ayaz Sadiq, Salman Rafique stepped down to campaign for by-poll in PP-158
• Marriyum says both will return to their portfolios post-elections
LAHORE: The departure of a minister each from the federal and Punjab cabinets, and the official reasons cited for it, makes it clear that the PML-N cannot afford any embarrassment in the upcoming by-polls in Punjab and wants to retain its hold over its citadel of Lahore, for which it has deployed its trusted lieutenants.
Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Punjab Minister Salman Rafique resigned on Saturday citing ‘personal reasons’. Although Mr Sadiq’s resignation as the economic affairs minister may not be significant in the larger scheme of things, it does raise a question that the PML-N could sacrifice the head of such a vital ministry at a time when the economy is on a downward spiral, but not lose Lahore at any cost, especially when former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman Imran Khan is making whirlwind tours to every constituency to give a tough time to the ruling alliance in Punjab.
The resignations of Sadiq and Rafique — said to be part of the PML-N’s ‘Nawaz group’ — also cast doubt over whether all was well within the nine-party coalition government, as well as foreboding differences of opinion between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his elder brother Nawaz, who has been living in the UK since Nov 2019 ‘on medical grounds’.
The PML-N was quick to issue the ‘real reason’ behind the two resignations to quash any rumours. “Ayaz Sadiq and Salman Rafique have resigned because of the by-elections in their constituencies. They have to take part in the election campaign (of PML-N-backed candidates). They resigned because they did not want to violate the election commission’s code of conduct,” Punjab Home Minister Attaullah Tarar said in a statement.
The former National Assembly speaker said in his resignation to the prime minister: “Due to my personal reasons I am unable to continue holding the office and tender my resignation. I will remain available to work in the best interest of Pakistan and my party.”
A PML-N insider told Dawn that resignations of the two ‘Nawaz group’ ministers were being seen in two contexts within the party – their effectiveness in the ongoing by-poll campaign in PP-158 (and why two ministers had to resign to canvas in just one constituency) or something cooking between the Nawaz and Shehbaz groups.
“The by-elections are being held on 20 Punjab Assembly seats on July 17. Sadiq and Rafique have resigned to campaign in only one constituency -- PP-158 Lahore – that falls in the National Assembly seat that the former speaker won in 2018. Salman Rafique had won in PP-157 where the poll isn’t even being held. How effective will these two ‘political heavyweights’ be for the remaining constituencies is to be seen,” he said.
The insider said since PTI dissident Aleem Khan, who had won in PP-158 in 2018 and was de-seated by the ECP over defection in the chief minister’s election in April, was not ‘seriously’ canvassing for the PML-N candidate, Mr Sadiq was sent for his aid. But what was the utility of Salman Rafiq since he was elected from another constituency? he questioned.
The PML-N’s move to forego two ministers to ensure by-poll victory also raises a question whether party vice president Maryam Nawaz wasn’t effective enough in spearheading the election campaign so far. She has already held a public rally in PP-158, which was a relatively better show than the other two constituencies she visited in Lahore to canvas for PTI dissidents now contesting the by-polls with the backing of the PML-N.
On the other hand, there are reports PM Shehbaz is not obliging his elder brother Nawaz in certain departments. “Nawaz wants Ishaq Dar back in Pakistan to manage the Finance Ministry but the Shehbaz group of the party insists on sticking to Miftah Ismail. Similarly, the former premier has directed Shehbaz to make certain appointments on important positions, including the Pakistan Cricket Board, and also wants to see some of his favourites as Punjab ministers. But both Shehbaz and his son Hamza have so far tactfully delayed acting on these instructions,” another party leader told Dawn.
He said since Mr Shehbaz was heeding more to the suggestions of the powers that be, these resignations could be a ‘message’ from Nawaz for the powerful quarters.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said in a statement that both ministers would return to their respective ministries after the by-elections were over.

1,Broken promises fuel mistrust of TTP bid to enter mainstream,"Experts raise questions over integration of banned outfit, possible fallout of talks.","PESHAWAR: The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is vying to enter the political mainstream as talks with the outlawed group — sanctioned by parliament — inch forward amid reservations expressed by experts and victims alike over demands, including reversal of Fata’s merger, put forth by the militant outfit to “gain political legitimacy”.
For experts and victims of the violence perpetrated by the TTP during its reign of terror, it is very difficult to trust the militant outfit, as several questions about the future of the talks and their possible fallout remain unaddressed. 
The primary reason behind this trust deficit is the fact that the militant outfit reneged on its promises made during multiple rounds of talks in return for peace in the tribal districts since TTP’s establishment in December 2007. The exodus of US-led Nato forces and the takeover of Kabul by the Afghan Taliban in August 2021 seem to have given the group a new lease of life, as the latter not only reorganised itself but also received recognition as a force to reckon with, after Islamabad agreed to hold fresh talks with the group under the auspices of the interim Taliban government.
Opposition to Fata merger
In a bid to gain political legitimacy by cashing in on political issues, the TTP recently praised the Federal Shariat Court’s order to the government to implement an Islamic, interest-free banking system within five years. 
“Raising voice against an interest-based economy is commendable,” said a statement released to the media on July 8, as the TTP took up the narrative of Pakistan’s religious parties that have been campaigning against the interest-based economy for decades. 

Experts raise questions over integration of banned outfit, possible fallout of talks

It seems the group has now softened its stance by putting forward demands which are political in nature, as the first demand from the TTP negotiators, which took many analysts in Pakistan and abroad by surprise, was the reversal of the merger of ex-Fata region with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Though Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah promptly dismissed the TTP demand, the group’s chief Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud reiterated the call for the reversal during a recent interview with a YouTuber in Kabul. Compared to the former leaders of the group, Mehsud appeared articulate and his tone was a clear break from the more aggressive stance of his predecessors.
Comprising seven tribal agencies and six Frontier Regions (FRs), the erstwhile Fata was merged with KP through 25th Amendment in 2018. 
Some political parties with a religious and nationalist bent, such as Fazlur Rehman’s Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, and other influential tribal elders have been opposing the merger. Even pro-status quo elements within the civil-military establishment expressed displeasure with the decision to merge the erstwhile Fata with the province. 
The demand for the reversal of the merger may become a shared goal of the TTP, certain political forces and those with an “anti-reforms outlook”.
While commenting on the demand for the reversal of Fata’s merger, Dr Hussain Shaheed Soherwordi, chairperson of the Department of International Relations at the University of Peshawar, said: “The TTP has jumped on the bandwagon to garner public support for itself.” Likewise, he said, “The TTP knew the vast majority of the public was against an interest-based economy, hence the media statement to cash in on an opportunity [presented by the Federal Shariat Court] to gain popularity.”
He hinted at the possibility that certain political and religious groups as well as the TTP may end up having the same agenda in the future.
‘Refined demands’ 
Peshawar-based political commentator Dr Khadim Hussain said the Kabul jirga in June that also had representation from political elements helped “refined” the TTP demands as it sent a “message that an agenda in contrast to the Constitution may not be achievable”.
“Recent NSC [National Security Committee] meetings also suggested openness on part of the establishment to streamline the TTP,” he said. “There is even a willingness on part of certain elements in TTP leadership to open up to mainstreaming,” he added, “whereby they could take part in elections, organise as a political party, and even formally join the ranks of security forces as done in the case of Swat.”
“Through its political statements, it appears that the TTP is preparing its foot-soldiers to work within the constitutional framework of the country,” he said while terming the efforts an attempt to reposition the group in line with its agenda.
One of the TTP demands was against the disarming of the group. Dr Hussain said if the establishment cedes that, then the group would exist as a private militia for which there is no room in the constitution. “It appears we are following the classic paradigm of reconciliation whereby disarmament would happen alongside reintegration and rehabilitation,” he said while referring to the strategy Pakistan employed to bring the outfit to table. “But even for that, the parliament and the civil society will have to be taken into confidence. Somebody has to take responsibility to mainstream the TTP and only the parliament can do it.”
Victims matter
While alluding to violence perpetrated by the terror outfit across Pakistan, Dr Hussain said the government could not make peace with the militant outfit while ignoring the victims of their violence. He said everyone, including political parties and civil society, would need to talk to the families of martyrs to convince them regarding the talks with the TTP. “Someone will have to speak to [South Waziristan MNA] Ali Wazir and the Bilour family to convince them to consider the mainstreaming of TTP,” he added.
Equally important questions are about “the mode of the mainstreaming of militants”. “Would they lay arms, and disband? Will it be registered as a political party or a civil society organisation? What is the plan of the state to deal with splinter groups even if the talks concluded successfully?” he asked. 
“All these issues have to be resolved before integration of the TTP can possibly happen.”

2,Rajapaksa quits after being chased out of residence,"Protesters storm presidential palace, set fire to PM’s own home; Galle Test unaffected...","COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s President Gota­baya Rajapaksa announced his resignation on Saturday, hours after a crowd of angry protesters chased him from his residence, as months of frustration brought on by an unprecedented economic crisis boiled over.
Hundreds of thousands of people massed in the capital to demand the government take responsibility for mismanaging the nation’s finances, and for crippling food and fuel shortages.
After storming the gates of the presidential palace, a throng of protesters walked through its rooms, with some among the boisterous crowd jumping into the compound’s pool.
Others were seen laughing and lounging in the stately bedrooms of the residence, with one pulling out what he claimed were articles of Rajapaksa’s clothing.
At around the same time, the leader had boarded a naval craft at the Colombo port and was taken to the island’s southern waters, where he let it be known he was finally bowing to months of calls for his resignation. 

Protesters storm presidential palace, set fire to PM’s own home; Galle Test unaffected

“To ensure a peaceful transition, the president said he will step down on July 13,” parliamentary speaker Mahinda Abeywardana said in a televised statement.
Rajapaksa had to be extracted from his residence by troops who fired into the air to keep the crowd outside at bay.
Soon after they stormed the presidential palace, Rajapaksa’s nearby seafront office also fell into the hands of protesters.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the first person in line to succeed Rajapaksa, called a meeting with political leaders and said he was willing to step down to pave the way for a unity government.
But that failed to placate protesters, who stormed the premier’s private residence and set it alight after night fell.
Footage shared on social media showed a crowd cheering the blaze, which broke out shortly after a security detachment guarding Wickremesinghe attacked several journalists outside the home.
No casualties have been reported in the fire so far, and police said Wickremesinghe and his family were away at the time.
Security forces attempted to disperse the huge crowds that had mobbed Colombo’s administrative district earlier in the day, with dozens injured in the resulting clashes.
A spokeswoman for Colombo’s main hospital said three people were being treated for gunshot wounds, along with 36 others suffering breathing difficulties after being caught up in tear gas barrages.
‘Not a deterrent’
Sri Lanka has suffered through months of shortages of basic goods, lengthy blackouts and galloping inflation after running out of foreign currency to import necessities.
The government has defaulted on its $51 billion external debt and is seeking an International Monetary Fund bailout.
Thousands of people had poured into the capital for Saturday’s demonstration, the latest outbreak of unrest sparked by the crisis.
Police had withdrawn a curfew issued on Friday after opposition parties, rights activists and the bar association threatened to sue the police chief.
Thousands of anti-government protesters ignored the stay-home order and even forced railway authorities to operate trains to take them to Colombo for Saturday’s rally, officials said.
“The curfew was not a deterrent. In fact, it encouraged more people to get on the streets in defiance,” the defence official said.
Sri Lanka has nearly exhausted its already scarce supplies of petrol, and people unable to travel to the capital held protests in other cities across the island.
Demonstrators had already maintained a months-long protest camp outside Rajapaksa’s office demanding his resignation.
The camp was the scene of clashes in May when a gang of Rajapaksa loyalists attacked peaceful protesters gathered there.
Nine people were killed and hundreds were wounded after the violence sparked reprisals against pro-government mobs and arson attacks on the homes of lawmakers.
Cricket continues
The unrest comes at the tail end of Australia’s ongoing cricket tour of Sri Lanka, with Pakistan’s squad also on the island for their upcoming series.
Cricket officials said there were no plans to change their schedules, adding that the sport was unaffected by the political turmoil.
“The Australian Test is coming to an end and we are due to start the Pakistan series,” a cricket board official said.
“There is no opposition to having the games. In fact, fans are supportive and we have no reason to reschedule. “

3,Imran should reveal who’s pressuring him: Shujaat,"Shows concern over trend of leaked audios, videos; denies rifts in PML-Q but says there're ""ideological differences"" with Elahi.","ISLAMABAD: Expre­ssing his concerns over the trend of leaked audios and videos of politicians that have begun to surface on and off, PML-Q president and veteran politician Cha­udhry Shujaat Hussain on Saturday advised PTI chairman Imran Khan to “spill the beans about those pushing him against the wall”. 
Talking to reporters after meeting with Azad Jammu and Kashmir President Barrister Sultan Mehmood, Mr Shujaat said: “Presently, our politics is facing a strange situation. Every day, videos are being played.” 
“How will the outside world view our politics?” asked the PML-Q chief in an apparent reference to the recently-leaked audio conversations of former first lady Bushra Bibi and former president Asif Ali Zardari. 
When asked to comment on the statement of former prime minister Imran Khan, where he had threatened to spill the beans if pushed to the wall, Shujaat asked Mr Khan to first reveal who was putting pressure on him. 
Mr Shujaat also dismissed reports of rifts within the PML-Q, adding that he had no differences with Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Pervez Elahi. “Have we ever made any statement against each other?” he questioned when asked about possibility of rifts within the Q-League. 
The PML-Q chief, however, admitted that there were some “ideological differences” with Mr Elahi, but he downplayed the severity of those differences. adding that such matters could even crop up between a father and his son, and there was no harm in it. 
Elders must listen to the viewpoint of the younger generation and political rivalry should not be allowed to become a personal rivalry, he said, in an apparent reference to Mr Elahi’s son, Moonis, who is believed to have pushed his father firmly into the PTI’s camp even as Shujaat lent his support to the PML-N-led coalition government. 
The elder Chaudhry also called for free and fair by polls on July 17, while adding that Punjab’s political situation would become clearer after the election. 
He also termed national security institutions the “guarantors of Pakistan’s stability”, ostensibly in response to Mr Khan’s incessant criticism on the role of the establishment in his government’s ouster.

4,Sindh leads charge against lumpy skin disease,"Vaccine for disease afflicting cattle developed; trial in final phase, local production to begin in March 2023.","KARACHI: Rising to the challenge of fast-spreading Lump Skin Disease (LSD) that has put Pakistan’s 100 million cattle population at risk, Sindh’s livestock researchers in a nick of time have managed to develop a vaccine that the authorities believe can help cattle owners and ranchers in all the four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir in saving their animals from the bovine disease. 
While the vaccine trial is in the final phase, the local production of drug for treatment of the viral disease, characterised by raised nodules, lesions or disseminated rash on skin of cattle, is expected to begin in March 2023.
Senior officials and sources privy to the recent development said the “major achievement” was made possible with Turkish support as the Sindh government had imported nearly four million LSD doses from Turkey with the goal to not only save the animals but also to start its local production. Support from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations further accelerated the process. 
The “research work and sample production” had met all formalities and local and international standards of vaccine production, they disclosed.

Vaccine for disease afflicting cattle developed; trial in final phase, local production to begin in March 2023

“The trial phases are in final stages and all have met the desired results,” Sindh Livestock Secretary Tameezuddin Khero told Dawn. “By December [2022], this process would be over and three months after that we would be able to start production of the doses in March [2023]. 
“The day the first shipment [of imported LSD vaccines] landed here, there was clear direction from the government, minister and everyone concerned that we have to do it ourselves. We met the deadline set for this challenge and now you will see production starting in March 2023.”
The Sindh government, he said, had raised a building in Karachi’s Korangi area for that purpose. It was being converted into a lab, he disclosed, claiming that the government would meet all requirements ranging from machinery to human resource and production facility.
The vector-borne, transboundary disease started emerging here late 2021 and till date it affected 52,000 animals across Sindh and killed 571 of them.
Animal experts say the disease, which spreads primarily through biting insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, was first discovered among livestock in Zambia, in 1929. In March 2022, the Sindh government announced import of the vaccine from Turkey with Rs500 million as the cost of the first shipment of two million doses. 
Giving credit to the Sindh Institute of Animal Health that “took up the challenge, rolled out the research process at a staggering pace and achieved the desired result”, the authorities believe the local production would cut the vaccination cost drastically, from Rs250 per to as low as Rs25 per animal. 
The researchers are confident about the efficacy of the locally developed LSD vaccines, citing history of ‘success rate’. “There are some nine trials for this LSD vaccine. This is actually a poxvirus which typically results in the formation of lesions, skin nodules or disseminated rash,” said Dr Nazeer Hussain Kalhoro, a PhD in virology and recombinant viral vaccines, who is currently serving as director general of the Sindh Institute of Animal Health.
With experiences of supervising research work that led to development and production of 29 different vaccines of animal diseases locally, Dr Kalhoro is sure that the domestically produced doses would have much more efficacy than being imported. Currently the institute is producing up to 350 million doses of 68 vaccines for animal diseases.
Half of the vaccines produced by the institute are consumed in Sindh and the rest is supplied to the three provinces as well as GB and AJK. Every year, a “moderate number” of Pakistani vaccines is exported to Afghanistan as well.
“We have so far imported 3.9 million doses of vaccines from Turkey. Some 3.2 have already been consumed through a massive vaccination campaign across the province. The rest of the stock is still being used by different district administrations through their respective task forces.”
Experts see the development of vaccine as a major achievement in view of the risk that the country’s livestock may continue to see for different reasons. They believe effective government policy in the “ignored sector” was the only way forward to meet future challenges for the livestock industry that according to the Pakistan Economic Survey is the largest sub-sector in agriculture, contributing 60.1 per cent to the agriculture value addition and 11.5pc to the GDP during the 2020-21.
“I am glad and definitely see it a big achievement if the Sindh government has developed the LSD vaccine,” said Prof Dr Aneela Durrani, a professor of medicine at Lahore’s University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences. 
‘Unchecked import’
“But we need to understand why these diseases which are there in the world for decades but not in Pakistan start suddenly emerging in our country. There is a growing trend of import of cattle that mostly goes unchecked. Such imports with the least care and quarantine facility in the country bring so much risk.”
She also referred to undocumented trade of the livestock and ill-planned farming, without proper policy and guidelines from the authorities that compromises the health of cattle and multiplies the risk when they are moved with herds.
