0,Legislators move motion of no confidence against Senate committee’s head,"Members allege chairman of standing committee on NHS is misusing his powers, refusing to conduct voting on two bills.","ISLAMABAD: After a heated debate in the Senate Standing Committee on the National Health Services (NHS) on two bills, members of the coalition government parties moved a no-confidence motion against chairman of the committee who belongs to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).
The committee had to discuss two bills titled ‘The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) Bill 2022’ and ‘The Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) Bill 2022’ moved by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Saleem Mandviwalla on Aug 1. The house had referred both bills to the standing committee with a suggestion to consider and report within two days.
The first bill has been moved to repeal the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) and the second has been moved to repeal the Medical Teaching Institution Act in Pims.
Senators from the ruling party wanted to get the bills passed but the committee chairman, Senator Mohammad Humayun Mohmand from the PTI held a debate and later announced to call off the meeting without voting.

Members allege chairman misusing his powers, refusing to conduct voting on two bills

However senators, belonging to the ruling party, criticised this and decided to move a no-confidence motion against the chair.
The motion, signed by PPP senators Jam Mahtab Hussain Dahar, Bahramand Khan Tangi, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PMAP) Senator Sardar Mohammad Shafiq Tareen and others, stated that members of the committee had lost confidence in the chair while discussing private member’s bills as the chair had misused his powers.
Despite requests of all the committee members to conduct voting on the PMDC bill, Mr Mohmand categorically refused and did not put the bill for voting and adjourned the sitting of the meeting, the motion stated.
Earlier, Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, who reached the committee room of the Parliament House to defend his bills, said the PMDC had made everything simple while the PMC had increased problems of doctors.
“A number of doctors have called me and shared their grievances. We should work for the betterment of the health fraternity,” he said.
Health minister Abdul Qadir Patel also spoke in favour of the bill and said a large number of seats of medical colleges of Sindh and Balochistan remained vacant.
“Due to the policy of the PMC, billions of dollars of Pakistan went abroad as students took admission to institutions in other countries and paid fee in foreign exchange. Moreover, fee for the Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Tests (MDCAT) was increased from Rs1,500 to Rs6,000 due to which parents and students suffered.
“The PMC officers at administrative posts have been getting at least a salary of Rs500,000 per month,” he said.
The PMDC was functional during the tenure of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) but later during the PTI’s term, the council was dissolved and around 200 of its employees were dismissed. Later, new appointments were made.
Jamaat-i-Islami Senator Mushtaq Ahmed suggested that the condition of the National Licensing Exam (NLE) should also be withdrawn as it was creating problems for students.
However, PTI Senator Dr Zarqa Suharwardy Taimur spoke in favour of the NLE and alleged that some appointments were being suggested for monetary benefits.
The committee chairman postponed the debate till the next meeting and left but the members insisted on voting. Senator Tangi announced that he would chair the meeting. However, later they moved a no-confidence motion against the chairman.

2,Capital admin says talks with transporters continuing,ISLAMABAD: The capital administration is in the process of convincing transporters not to participate in the...,"ISLAMABAD: The capital administration is in the process of convincing transporters not to participate in the nationwide strike against increase in taxes.
Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon told Dawn that the administration was holding negotiations with transporters and trying to convince them not to participate in the strike. Islamabad is a small city and people will suffer, he said, adding that the strategy of local transporters is yet to be cleared.
Transporters’ Association President Irfan Niazi said all intra-city passenger bus services were closed in the twin cities since Aug 1. All 22 bus terminals of the intra-city bus services remained closed and 7,500 long route passenger vehicles were parked inside and around the terminals, he added.
The strike was planned against the increase in taxes, Mr Niazi said, adding that due to this increase, it was impossible for transporters to operate their business.
Hike in prices makes the life of citizens miserable because everything is beyond the reach of normal people, he said, adding that transporters did not want to get the amount from the pocket of commuters to pay taxes, but under the present situation it was hard to run the business. So far, only long route transporters participated in the strike while local transport is operational in the twin cities, only to accommodate locals, he said.
However, Mr Niazi said highways and roads would be blocked if the government did not accept their demands and reduce taxes.
Negotiation will only be held with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman or the finance minister as the matter was related to them and the local administration had nothing to do with it, he added.

4,AJK Minister Malik Zaffar Iqbal gets life imprisonment in murder case,Complainant says Iqbal was among 16 people who attacked his shop and shot his brother to death.,"


 
MUZAFFARABAD: A sitting member of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) cabinet was arrested by police on Wednesday moments after the Shariat Appellate bench of the AJK High Court slapped him with rigorous life imprisonment and Rs1 million fine in a nearly two decades old murder case.
Minister for Higher Education Malik Zaffar Iqbal, who had returned from LA-8, Kotli-I on PTI ticket, was nominated in this case in an application lodged with Kotli police station on Sept 29, 2003by Rashid Hussain Shah for the murder of his brother Amir Asif Shah.
The complainant had alleged that a group of around 16 lethal weapon-wielding people, including Mr Iqbal, had attacked his shop in Riyan Gala village in the wake of a brief altercation with Mansha Malik a few days ago. 
According to him, Mr Iqbal, who was wielding a Kalashnikov, had fired a shot at the complainant’s brother Amir Asif Shah which hit him in his forehead and subsequently killed him.
The FIR was initially registered under sections 324,147, 148, 149, 337-A1 of Azad Penal Code (APC) but section 302 of APC and section 13/20/65 of Arms Act were added to it after the victim died of his wounds in the hospital the same evening and the accused persons failed to provide licence of recovered weapons.
The trial of the case was conducted by the district criminal court Kotli, comprising the sessions judge and districtQazi. At the conclusion of the trial, the sessions judge had acquitted the accused persons from all the charges by extending benefit of doubt, but the district Qazi convicted Mr Iqbal under section 302(B) of the APC and awarded him death sentence asTazir,coupled with five-year imprisonment under the Arms Act.
The Qazi also awarded five-year imprisonment to another accused Imran under the Arms Act but concurred with the acquittal order of the rest of accused persons vide the impugned judgement delivered on May 19, 2008.
After hearing the counsel for the parties, going through their written arguments and record of the case as well as statements of the eyewitnesses in Kotli circuit, the Shariat Appellate bench, comprising Justice Mohammad Ejaz Khan and Justice Chaudhry Khalid Rasheed, had reserved the judgement early last month.
It was announced on Wednesday at the principal seat in a packed courtroom, where minister for local government Khawaja Farooq Ahmed, parliamentary secretary Asim Sharif Lone and a large number of PTI supporters were also present.
The bench held that the prosecution had proved the guilt of Mr Iqbal without any considerable or substantial shadow of doubt and set aside the impugned judgement to his extent recorded by the sessions judge and converted the capital punishment handed down by the district Qazi into 14 years rigorous imprisonment.
Separately, Mr Iqbal was also sentenced to three-year simple imprisonment under the Arms Act.
The bench declared that the convict would pay Rs1 million as compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased, and in default of payment the amount would be recovered from him under the Land Revenue Act.
While acquitting Mr Imran of charges by giving him the benefit of doubt, the bench sustained the impugned verdict to the extent of the remaining accused persons.
Soon after the announcement of the verdict, police shifted Mr Iqbal to the nearby civil secretariat police station from where he would be handed over to Kotli police to be lodged in judicial lockup.
However, his lawyers said they would challenge the decision in the Supreme Court.

7,"No plan to withdraw administrative, financial powers from AJK: Kaira","Says proposed amendments cannot come into force unless agreed to by region’s govt, political parties.","MUZAFFARABAD: Prime Minister’s Adviser for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Qamar Zaman Kaira on Wednesday asserted that there were no plans to withdraw the financial, administrative or any other authority already given to the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government “except for removal of some anomalies in AJK Constitution”.
“I belong to the Peoples Party which has a special bondage with Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, more than anyone else in the country. We are the ones who have given constitutions and rights, who have rectified wrongs in them. We believe in devolving powers and not centralising them,” Mr Kaira said in a press conference at the Central Press Club.
He was flanked by three AJK lawmakers from his party, including Leader of the Opposition Chaudhry Latif Akbar, and scores of other party workers.
After Mr Kaira was asked to clarify position on a draft of 15thconstitutional amendment that his ministry had recently floated, he said he was unable to understand why a storm in the teacup had been created on this issue.

Says proposed amendments cannot come into force unless agreed to by region’s govt, political parties

He claimed that the draft had been prepared during the PTI and PML-N governments in Islamabad and Muzaffarabad, respectively.
“I have just thrown it open so as to solicit suggestions from the stakeholders to remove anomalies in the [AJK] Constitution because the constitution and laws are living documents and should keep on undergoing amendments in accordance with the demands of the time and situation,” he said.
However, later at an informal talk in the club president’s office, when Mr Kaira was asked what was his take on the draft, he said since he had not gone through it in totality he could not immediately make a precise statement about it.
“Whatever the proposed amendments, they cannot and will not come into force unless agreed to by your [AJK] government and political parties and subsequently approved by the AJK Legislative Assembly,” the prime minister’s aide said.
Responding to questions, he said every politician and political party in Pakistan, including Imran Khan, had as much connection with the Kashmir issue as the Kashmiris themselves had with it.
“But my party carries a distinction. It was founded for the cause of Kashmir,” he added.
When a senior reporter asked if India’s Aug 5, 2019 move was a “fixed match” [with Pakistan], he replied: “This is a sensitive issue and I should not talk about it randomly.”
In the same breath, he added that in his view no Pakistani politician, including Imran Khan and Ziaul Haq, was the enemy of Pakistan. Their wrong decisions, wrong steps may have harmed the interests of the country, but intentionally no one is the enemy,” Mr Kaira said.
In response to a question, the adviser claimed that the AJK council was bereft of funds and “its employees were drawing salaries from the federal government in the shape of grants”.
However, his reply was in sharp contrast to factual position, as since the passage of 13thamendment in June 2018 funds for payment of salaries and allowances to council members and employees were allocated in the AJK’s budget.
Replying to a question on the prohibited funding case, Mr Kaira said the law would take its course [in this regard].
“We are neither accelerating nor delaying it,” he said.

Participants of the meeting discussed preventive measures to control spread of dengue fever during the ongoing summer season.
The deputy commissioner said the district administration had devised a plan to control spread of dengue fever and destroy breeding sites of mosquitoes in Attock.
He underlined the need for taking solid measures against the virus by eliminating the growth of dengue larva. Officials have been directed to identify and destroy breeding sites of dengue mosquitoes, remove tyres, plastic bags and bottles from open spaces and cover open drinking water containers.
“A proper campaign must be initiated to create awareness among people for which different teams must be formed. The teams must visit block factories, tyres shops, service stations, houses and launch a campaign to clear stagnant water ponds,” he said and directed relevant officials to depute indoor and outdoor surveillance teams so that they can begin fogging potential areas across the district. 
He said the teams must create awareness among people about preventive measures through door-to-door visits. 
There is a dire need is to increase the process of eradicating larvae as much as possible. 
“Strict action should be taken against those who are negligent in this regard,” he added.

The CDA is also planning to move a summary to the federal cabinet seeking end to the civic agency’s deal with Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority, as it has still not deposited the initial amount with the CDA.
The CDA officials said if the cabinet allowed the civic body to end its deal with the Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority, it will then construct 3,876 apartments to sell them in the open market.

12,Work on Soan bridge may take more than a year to complete,New contract likely to be awarded to FWO this month...,"RAWALPINDI: With a new contract likely to be issued to the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) this month, re-construction work on the bridge over Soan River may take an additional one-and-a-half years to complete.
According to an official of the National Highways Authority (NHA), the contract of remodelling of the bridge had been terminated in April 2022 and the contractor was black-listed due to multiple reasons. Now, a fresh contract is to be awarded to the FWO this month, he said, adding that, “yes, the FWO would be given one year’s time to complete the work with a six-month extension. But due to monsoon and flooding in the river, work on the bridge will not commence in the next two months”.
There is an additional issue brought on by busy traffic, school and office hours as well as other factors.
The contract of remodelling of the bridge had been terminated in April 2022 due to multiple reasons, including delay and poor workmanship. Strict notice had already been taken at the top level and it was decided that a fresh contract would be awarded to the FWO so expansion of the bridge could be completed as soon as possible.

New contract likely to be awarded to FWO this month

Construction work on the bridge over Soan River was started in 2017 and was scheduled to be finished by Jan 20, 2022. Sources said senior NHA officials were summoned by higher authorities in Chaklala who expressed concern over slow pace of work. Later, it was decided that a fresh contract would be awarded to the FWO so that the remaining work could be completed.
Due to the damaged road and construction material scattered on the bridge, near the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench building, motorists entering the city have been facing problems. It has left only one lane for vehicles to pass due to which commuters and motorists remain stranded on Soan Bridge. Throughout the day, especially in the morning and evening, traffic remains even more congested.
The road is used by thousands of people including goods transporters who come to the city from other parts of the district via the G.T. Road.
The NHA official also attributed the poor work and construction material to the policy of awarding lowest rate tenders to private contractors for public welfare projects.
“It usually happens in political governments because of many reasons – one of which previously observed was that of the fear of government departments like the National Accountability Bureau (NAB),” he said, adding that no one can take any decision on their own.

13,PTI removes objections from petition pertaining to MNAs’ resignations,"Petition states speaker's move of approving resignations of only 11 MNAs out of 123 is ""unsustainable"".","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Wednesday removed administrative objections from the petition filed against acceptance of resignations of its Members National Assembly (MNAs) in ‘piecemeal’.
A day earlier, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) acting chief justice Aamer Farooq heard the arguments of the petitioner’s counsel on objections.
He instructed the petitioner, PTI’s General Secretary Asad Umar, to remove the objections raised by the registrar office that the petitioner did not produce authority letter of the MNAs.
PTI cited Speaker National Assembly, Election Commission of Pakistan, Secretary Cabinet Division and ex Deputy Speaker Qasim Khan Suri as respondents.
The petition stated that after the ‘regime change operation’, PTI leadership decided to tender resignation from the National Assembly since it was seeking “fresh mandate” from the people of Pakistan.
It said that in pursuant to the decision of a meeting of the Parliamentary Party held in the Parliament House on April 11,  123 MNAs tendered resignations which were accepted by the deputy speaker.
However, the newly-elected Speaker NA Raja Pervaiz Ashraf withheld these resignations and did not forward it to the ECP on the pretext of “so called verification of the resignation”.
“Now after the lapse of around three and a half months, NA Speaker approved resignations of only 11 MNAs of the PTI” and forwarded them to the ECP which has denotified the lawmakers, said the petition.
“The impugned act of the so called verification of resignation of PTI MNAs conducted by the present speaker of the National Assembly and his purported approval of the resignations and forwarding the same to the ECP in a piecemeal manner, despite the fact that all the 123 resignations of the PTI MNA s had already been accepted on April 11 by the then speaker, as well as the impugned act of the ECP to denotify the PTI Members in the piecemeal manner, are unsustainable,” the petition added.
It requested the court to direct the Speaker NA to accord approval to all the PTI’s MNAs resignations. 
The petition further requested that the direction be given to the ECP to de-notify these members en masse.

14,"350,000 children suffer from autism in Pakistan: expert","ISLAMABAD: While autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a progressive brain disease, there are 350,000 children suffering...","ISLAMABAD: While autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a progressive brain disease, there are 350,000 children suffering from autism in Pakistan but majority of them are not diagnosed.
This was stated by Canada-based Pakistani psychologist and autism expert Saima Akram at the launching ceremony of her book titled ‘Autism and Behavioural Science’ on Wednesday.
ASD begins at the age of three and last throughout a person’s life, although symptoms may improve over time. 
Studies have shown that one third parents noticed the problem before their child’s first birthday, and others saw problems by 24 months of age, she said. 
Some children with ASD seem to develop normally until around 18 to 24 months of age and then stop gaining new skills, or they lose the skills they once had.
ASD is a complex condition involving persistent challenges with social communication, restricted interests and repetitive behaviour.
Saima Akram said according to estimates about one in 100 children has autism.
“This estimate represents an average figure, and reported prevalence varies substantially across studies. Some well-controlled studies have, however, reported figures that are substantially higher,” she said.
She said the statistics from South Asia estimate that there may be 350,000 children with autism in Pakistan.
“Unfortunately, most of these children remain undiagnosed due to the lack of awareness and expertise in diagnosis,” Saima Akram said.
The purpose of this book is to provide the reader with the indispensable knowledge, awareness, treatment plans and scientific approach for autism.
The concepts are premeditated with a balance of conceptual, practical, empirical and theoretical information to bridge the gap between research and everyday practice. 
While acknowledging empirical researches and models, book provides practical strategies in the recent scientific research and practice in the field of autism.
Saima Akram received her M.Phil degree in Psychology from Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, and Master in Psychology from Govt. College University, Lahore, Pakistan and Ontario graduate diploma in autism and behavioural science from Canada.
She has also completed advanced certificate for Autism USA, Red Cross Canada, and Ontario Colleges Canada.
