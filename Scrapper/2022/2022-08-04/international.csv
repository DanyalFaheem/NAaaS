0,Protest leader Stalin arrested in Sri Lanka,"""He is being arrested for holding a demonstration in May in violation of a court order,"" police say.","COLOMBO: A top Sri Lankan trade union leader in the forefront of protests which led to the ousting of Gotabaya Rajapaksa from the presidency was arrested on Wednesday, witnesses and officials said.
Joseph Stalin, the secretary of the Sri Lanka Teachers’ Union, becomes the senior most activist to be arrested in a crackdown against protesters forced Rajapaksa to flee last month.
“He is being arrested for holding a demonstration in May in violation of a court order,” police told reporters at Stalin’s union office in Colombo as he was being detained.
Scores of others have already been remanded in custody by police on charges of damage to public property during months of protests which peaked with the storming of Rajapaksa’s palace on July 9.
Tens of thousands of people incensed by the island nation’s economic crisis stormed Rajapaksa’s palace and his seafront office — forcing him to flee the country and later resign.
Rajapaksa’s successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has drawn a distinction between  “protesters” and  “rioters” and vowed tough action against  “any trouble maker.” Police also arrested another protester who had raided the liquor cabinet of the deposed leader, downed a beer and took off with a presidential mug.
The 43-year-old man’s arrest comes after he shared a photo of himself on Facebook at Colombo’s Presidential Palace, a police official said.
The man was arrested earlier this week for alleged unlawful entry into a state building and retaining stolen property. “He will be brought to Colombo to stand trial,” the official said.

1,Researchers claim restoring cell function after death,"The results show that when the heart stops, the body is  “not as dead as we previously assumed”, one researcher says.","WASHINGTON; Rese­archers have found that decay of tissues after death can be halted and cell functions restored based on early experiments in pigs that may eventually help increase the number of transplantable human organs.
Sixty minutes after stopping the heart in the anaesthetised animals, Yale researchers were able to restart the circulation using a specialised machine and a synthetic fluid carrying oxygen and other components that promote cellular health and suppress inflammation. Six hours later, treatment with the so-called OrganEx technology had reduced or corrected some of the damage, such as organ swelling and collapse of blood vessels, that typically results from lack of oxygen when cardiac arrest halts blood flow.
The results show that when the heart stops, the body is  “not as dead as we previously assumed”, Zvonimir Vrselja of Yale University said at a press briefing. “We were able to show that we can persuade cells not to die.”  Genetic analysis of the tissues suggested that molecular and cellular repair processes had begun once circulation had been restored, the researchers reported on Wednesday in the journal Nature.
Compared to the traditional means of restoring circulation, OrganEx “preserved tissue integrity, decreased cell death and restored selected molecular and cellular processes across multiple vital organs”, the researchers wrote.
They hope OrganEx will eventually enable increased use of organs retrieved after withdrawal of life support in donors with severe, irreversible brain injuries by preventing the damage that ensues when blood stops circulating. Currently, these organs do worse after transplant than those procured from brain-dead donors who remain on life-support.
That could be years away, however.
The pig study result “stops far short of saying that any organs were restored to the level of function” necessary to support life, said Stephen Latham.
Theoretically, the technology could someday be used to restore life in someone who has just died. “In order to do that, there’s a great deal more experimentation that would be required,” Latham said. 
“And you’d have to think about what is the state to which a human being would be restored.”

2,First grain shipment from Ukraine sails through Istanbul,The Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni’s voyage from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Lebanon is being watched closely.,"ISTANBUL: The first shipment of grain from Ukraine since the Kremlin’s invasion five months ago sailed through Istanbul on Wednesday under a landmark deal designed to help alleviate a global food crisis sparked by the war.
The Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni’s voyage from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Lebanon is being watched closely for signs of how the first agreement signed by Moscow and Kyiv since Russia invaded its pro-Western neighbour holds.
A deal brokered by Turkey and the United Nations last month lifted a Russian naval blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea cities and set terms for millions of tonnes of wheat and other grain to start flowing from filled silos and ports.
Ukraine exports roughly half of the sunflower oil used on the world market and is one of the world’s main suppliers of grain. An almost complete halt to its exports helped push up global food prices and make imports prohibitively expensive in some of the poorest countries in the world.
The Razoni took 26,000 tonnes of maize through a specially designated corridor in the mine-infested waters of the Black Sea before reaching the northern edge of the Bosphorus Strait on Tuesday.
A team of 20 inspectors from the two warring parties and the UN and Turkey strapped on orange helmets and boarded the ship early on Wednesday for a mandated inspection that officials said lasted less than 90 minutes.
The ship’s passage is being overseen by an international team that includes Russian and Ukrainian officials in Istanbul.
“This marks the conclusion of an initial ‘proof of concept’ operation to execute the agreement between the Russian Federation, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Nations,” the team said after the ship was cleared to pass through Istanbul.
The 186-metre (610-foot) long vessel now moves on to the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean before it is set to reach the coast of Lebanon in the coming days. Kyiv says at least 16 more grain ships are waiting to depart.
But it also accuses Russia of stealing Ukrainian grain in territories seized by Kremlin forces, then shipping it to allied countries such as Syria. Turkish hopes that the deal could help build trust and lead to ceasefire talks have so far been disappointed.

3,HK chief among world’s highest-paid politicians,"John Lee, who assumed office in July, is paid $58,000 a month, and will receive an entertainment allowance of over $10,000.","HONG KONG: Hong Kong’s new leader John Lee received a salary bump that would make him among the world’s highest-paid politicians, according to figures provided by his office on Wednesday, even as the financial hub’s economy undergoes a downturn.
The government announced this week that its economy has tipped into a technical recession, after being battered by the pandemic, mounting interest rates and weakened global trade. Despite the city’s dip in fortunes, the chief executive will still be comfortably compensated, according to figures provided by his office.
The former security chief, who assumed office in July, is paid $58,000 a month, and will receive an entertainment allowance of over $10,000 as well, his office said.
His salary is a step-up from that of his predecessor Carrie Lam, who used to earn around $54,000 a month.
This means Lee earns more than US President Joe Biden — whose annual salary is $400,000 — and is second only to Singaporean leader Lee Hsien Loong, who nets around $1.6 million a year.

4,Dutch declare shortage in ‘land of water’,THE HAGUE: The Netherlands declared an official water shortage on Wednesday as the low-lying  “land of water” ...,"THE HAGUE: The Netherlands declared an official water shortage on Wednesday as the low-lying  “land of water” was hit by Europe’s sweltering summer.
The Dutch government said it was eyeing further measures to conserve water amid a drought, and authorities have already imposed limits on farming and shipping.
The country is protected from the sea by a famed system of dams, dykes and canals but remains particularly vulnerable to climate change.
“The Netherlands is a land of water, but here too our water is precious,” Infrastructure and Water Management Minister Mark Harbers said in a statement.

5,US state votes to maintain abortion rights in test case,Kansans reject amendment that would have scrapped language in the state constitution guaranteeing the right to the procedure.,"OLATHE: Abortion rights advocates celebrated on Tuesday as the Midwestern US state of Kansas voted to maintain the right to the procedure, the first major poll on the flashpoint issue since the Supreme Court overturned nationwide access in June.
Kansans rejected an amendment that would have scrapped language in the state constitution guaranteeing the right to the procedure and could have paved the way for stricter regulations or a ban.
The vote was widely seen as a test case for abortion rights nationwide, as Republican-dominated legislatures rush to impose strict bans on the procedure following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Pro-abortion rights campaigners and supporters celebrated the win for their side of the hotly contested US debate. “I’m just beside myself,” campaign volunteer Anne Melia said.
When polls closed at 7pm, Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab said turnout was as high as 50 percent on this referendum, local media reported, a number usually expected for a general election.
Poll worker Marsha Barrett said some 250 voters had come to a station in the Kansas City suburb of Olathe by noon — the same number it might see all day in a presidential election. “This election is crazy,” Barrett said.  “People are determined to vote.” President Joe Biden also hailed the result.  “Tonight, Kansans used their voices to protect women’s right to choose and access reproductive health care,” he said on Twitter.
“It’s an important victory for Kansas, but also for every American who believes that women should be able to make their own health decisions without government interference.” In a separate statement, he urged Congress to  “listen to the will of the American people” and pass a bill codifying the right to abortion.
Other states including California and Kentucky are set to vote on the hot-button issue in November, at the same time as Congressional midterm elections in which both Republicans and Democrats hope to use it to mobilize their supporters nationwide.
‘Remarkable’ result 
In Kansas, the ballot centered on a 2019 ruling by the state’s supreme court that guarantees access to abortion.
In response, the Republican-dominated state legislature introduced an amendment known as  “Value Them Both” that would have scrapped the constitutional right — with the stated aim of handing regulation of the procedure back to lawmakers.
In the opposing camp, activists said the campaign was a barely masked bid to clear the way for an outright ban — one state legislator had already introduced a bill that would ban abortion without exceptions for rape, incest or the mother’s life.
For Ashley All, spokeswoman for pro-abortion rights campaign Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the result of Tuesday’s referendum was  “remarkable.”  “Kansans understood that this amendment would mandate government control over private medical decisions,” she said.
But voter Sylvia Brantley, 60, said earlier in the day she voted in favor of the change because she believes  “babies matter, too.” She said she wanted to see more regulations, in the 
hope that  “Kansas will not be a marketplace for killing babies.”

6,Sinkhole larger than tennis court has Chile perplexed,A 100-metre security perimeter has been erected around the hole in the Tierra Amarilla municipality.,"SANTIAGO: Experts in Chile on Tuesday were investigating the appearance of an enormous sinkhole, bigger than a tennis court, that has appeared near a copper mine in the Atacama desert.
Experts were dispatched to examine the hole, some 32 metres (104 feet) across and twice as deep, which appeared in an area about 800 kilometres (nearly 500 miles) north of Santiago over the weekend, the National Geology and Mining Service (Sernageomin) said in a statement.
A 100-metre security perimeter has been erected around the hole in the Tierra Amarilla municipality, near the Alcaparrosa mine operated by Canadian firm Lundin Mining.
The company said in a statement there had been  “no impact to personnel, equipment or infrastructure,” and the sinkhole has remained stable since its detection.
As a preventive measure,  “development work in an area of the Alcaparrosa underground mine has been temporarily suspended,” the company said.
Sernageomin director David Montenegro said experts would seek to determine the cause of the collapse and  “ensure that all safety measures are taken to safeguard the lives of workers and communities close to the site.” Cristian Zuniga, mayor of the Tierra Amarilla municipality of some 13,000 inhabitants, told journalists the sinkhole was unprecedented.
“We ask that the cause be clarified: whether the collapse is the product of mining activity or something else,” he said.
Chile is the world’s largest copper producer, responsible for a quarter of global supply.

7,Taliban tight-lipped over US strike that killed Zawahiri,The Taliban have not confirmed Zawahiri’s death.,"KABUL: Top leaders of Afghanistan’s Taliban were holding discussions on Wednesday about how to respond to a US drone strike in Kabul that the United States said killed Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, three sources in the group said. 
The United States killed Zawahiri with a missile fired from a drone while he stood on a balcony at his Kabul hideout on Sunday, US officials said, the biggest blow to the Taliban since Osama bin Laden was shot dead more than a decade ago in Pakistan. 
The Taliban have not confirmed Zawahiri’s death. 
Officials of the group, long-time allies of Al Qaeda, initially confirmed the Sunday drone strike, but said the house that was hit was empty. 
“There are meetings at a very high level on whether they should react to the drone strike, and in case they decide to, then what is the proper way,” a Taliban leader who holds an important position in Kabul said. 
The official, who said there had been lengthy leadership discussions for two days, declined to be identified. He did not confirm that Zawahiri was in the house that the missile struck. 
How the Taliban react could have significant repercussions as the group seeks international legitimacy, and access to billions of dollars in frozen funds, following their defeat of a US-backed government a year ago. 
Zawahiri, an Egyptian doctor, was closely involved in the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and was one of the world’s most wanted men.
His death in Kabul raises questions about whether he received sanctuary from the Taliban, who had assured the United States as part of a 2020 agreement on the withdrawal of US-led forces that they would not harbour other militant groups.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Taliban had “grossly violated” the agreement by hosting and sheltering Zawahiri. 
Outside a tight circle of top Taliban leaders, group members appeared in the dark about whether Zawahiri was actually in Kabul, let alone his fate.
Another Taliban official confirmed the high-level meetings, but said he did not know what was being discussed and he did not believe Zawahiri was in the house.
Suhail Shaheen, the designated Taliban representative to the United Nations, who is based in Doha, told journalists that he had received no word on the Taliban position.
“I am awaiting details and reaction from Kabul,” he told reporters in a message.

8,"Heatwaves increasing in India, but related deaths fall",NEW DELHI: Tempe­ratures during India’s monsoon season have risen this century and the country could see more...,"NEW DELHI: Tempe­ratures during India’s monsoon season have risen this century and the country could see more frequent heatwaves in future, the government said on Wednesday, but it added heat-related deaths have fallen in recent years.
India suffered its hottest March in more than a century this year and temperatures were unusually high in April and May too, mainly blamed on climate change. The government says heatwaves are common mainly between April and June.
“The average temperature during the monsoon season is found to be rising in the last two decades,” India’s science and technology and earth sciences minister, Jitendra Singh, told parliament.
“The warming of the tropical Indian Ocean and more frequent El Nino events in future may lead to more frequent and long-lasting heatwaves over India.”  El Nino is characterised by a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific. It causes heavy rains and floods in South America and scorching weather in Asia and even east Africa. Singh said India’s mean temperature during the June-September monsoon season rose to nearly 28.4 degrees Celsius last year.
