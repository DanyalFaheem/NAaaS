0,"Govt can’t ban Imran Khan, says Fawad",ECP says ‘propaganda’ (against its verdict) has nothing to do with reality,"ISLAMABAD: Highlighting what he claimed were serious flaws and loopholes in the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) verdict in the prohibited funding case against his party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry said on Wednesday the coalition government cannot ban Imran Khan and his party.
He said the federal government would soon be asked to take a vote of confidence, claiming it had lost the trust of its allies.
Addressing a press conference, the former minister said Chief Election Comm­issioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja announced a reserved verdict in the PTI prohibited funding case after meeting leaders of the Pakistan Democratic Movement. The “unconstitutional and illegal” decision was announced at the request of Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, he alleged.
The ECP had ruled on Tuesday that the PTI received millions of dollars from 351 foreign companies and 34 foreign nationals, and sought an explanation as to why the prohibited funds should not be forfeited.

ECP says ‘propaganda’ (against its verdict) has nothing to do with reality

Mr Chaudhry claimed the ECP verdict published on its website was different from the one released to the party and the media, adding the PTI had already filed a reference against the CEC so the commission didn’t have any legal power to send a reference to the federal government.
He further said the party would contest the ECP’s decision, which he declared was in contravention of the law and Constitution, adding the government cannot ban any political party. Highlighting ‘flaws’ in the verdict, he said several locals and dual nationals had been shown as foreign nationals.
Mr Chaudhry said Beenish Faridi was a British-Pakistani, who has recorded a video about it too, yet she was mentioned as a foreign national. He emphasised all the money was deposited through legal channels, adding there was a difference between affidavits and certificates as well as their writing format.
He said Shaukat Khanum Hospital received Rs9 billion annually, but their sources were unknown. However, he added, all of the funds came legally. Fawad Chaudhry further alleged that everyone knew the ruling parties took money from abroad, as the PPP’s accounts for 2014 and 2015 were not verified and millions had been transferred to the accounts of the Sharifs’ employees.
The former minister said slain former premier Benazir Bhutto had accused PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif of taking money from Osama bin Laden to oust her government, adding the cases of PML-N and PPP were also pending with the ECP.
He announced that the PTI was going to challenge the ECP verdict and demand action against the electoral watchdog.
Talking about reports of adding names of PTI leaders to the Exit Control List, Fawad said PTI chief Imran Khan did not go out of the country even once after he was ousted from power through a “foreign-backed conspiracy”. Adding his name to the ECL would serve no purpose as the PTI would continue to fight this “fascism”.
He said the ruling coalition could not go into elections as it was scared of a crushing defeat at the hands of Imran Khan, who was “the most popular leader in the country”. The government launched a campaign against overseas Pakistanis because it was running away from elections.
Later, the PTI women’s wing, headed by Kanwal Shauzab, held a press conference and criticised the ECP verdict.
ECP rebuts ‘propaganda’
Later in the day, the ECP said the claims that the commission issued two verdicts in haste were “misleading and a part of propaganda” by certain individuals.
“It is surprising that some people are trying to find flaws in a verdict being released after eight years,” the ECP said in a statement.
Without naming the PTI, the electoral body dismissed the party’s claims, saying “this propaganda has nothing to do with reality”.
“The commission has given a single decision, which is signed page by page and the same has been released on the official website,” the statement added.

1,Rare white elephant born in Myanmar,"YANGON: A rare white elephant has been born in western Myanmar, state media said on Wednesday, unveiling what many ...","

YANGON: A rare white elephant has been born in western Myanmar, state media said on Wednesday, unveiling what many in the Buddhist-majority country believe to be an auspicious creature.
Born last month in western Rakhine state, the baby weighs about 80 kilograms and stands roughly 70 cm (two-and-a-half feet) tall, according to the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper.
Footage released by state TV showed the tusker tot following his mother to a river and being washed by its keepers, and later feeding from her.
The mother — a 33-year-old called Zar Nan Hla — is kept by the Myanmar Timber Enterprise in Rakhine state, the Global New Light said, adding the baby possessed seven of the eight characteristics associated with rare white elephants.
“Pearl-coloured eyes, plantain branch-shaped back, white hair, a distinctive tail, auspicious plot signs on the skin, five claws on the front legs and four on the back legs and big ears,” the newspaper reported.
Social media users first posted about the birth of the elephant — which has not been named yet — late last month.
Historically, white elephants were considered extremely auspicious in Southeast Asian culture, and the region’s ancient rulers acquired as many as they could boost their fortunes.
But the ruinous cost of keeping the beasts in appropriately lavish style gave rise to the modern expression in which a “white elephant” is a useless, if beautiful, possession.
With Myanmar reeling from a military coup last year and its bloody crackdown on dissent, the reaction of many on social media was muted or sceptical.
“Am I colourblind if it just looks brown to me?” posted one user.
“Elephants were important only in the old eras,” said another. “Now the poor elephant will have to go to jail.”

2,Wife’s right to be ‘maintained’ by husband is absolute: SC,Justice Mansoor Ali Shah says payment of dower to bride intrinsic part of Muslim marriage.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court held on Wednesday that a woman’s right to be “maintained” by her husband was absolute under Islamic law as long as she remains “faithful and discharges her own matrimonial obligations”.
“A Muslim husband is bound to maintain his wife even if no term in this regard is agreed to between them at the time of marriage or she can maintain herself out of her own resources,” observed Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in a judgement he wrote.
Justice Shah was a member of a three-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, which had taken up an appeal moved by Haseenullah against a March 9, 2020, Peshawar High Court (PHC) ruling.
The controversy at hand concerns a case filed by Ms Naheed Begum — wife of Haseenullah — in a family court at Charsadda for the recovery of her dower: four kanal of agricultural land which was mentioned in column no.16 of her Nikahnama as well as maintenance for herself and her five minor children. The husband had contracted a second marriage and was living with his second wife.

Justice Mansoor says payment of dower to bride intrinsic part of Muslim marriage

The court decreed the suit to the extent of her claim for maintenance of her minor children, but rejected her claims for recovery of her dower and maintenance. A district court dismissed her appeal, upholding the verdict of the family court.
She then approached the PHC, which reversed the judgements of the courts and decreed her claims of dower and maintenance. Conse­quently, the petitioner approached the Supreme Court through an appeal.
In the judgement, Justice Shah emphasised the Holy Quran enunciates that men were the protectors and maintainers of women because God has given one more strength than the other and because they support them with their money.
Moreover, the Holy Prophet (PBUH) has also instructed Muslim men to provide their wives with maintenance in a fitting manner and declared it to be a woman’s right, the judgement said. But the judge regretted that the petitioner, instead of paying maintenance and giving the dower to the respondent willingly and graciously, has been evading his legal as well as moral obligation on one or the other pretext.
First, he totally denied to have agreed to and mentioning in Nikahnama, the term of giving four Kanal agricultural land as dower to his wife and later started opposing it with the argument that it was an alternative to be given only if seven tola gold ornaments mentioned in column no.13 of the Nikahnama had not been paid.
“This is a male-dominated society; men since ages have always been more concerned about their rights by using religion for their own convenience, especially in matrimonial matters, but forget religion when it comes to their duty and obligation towards women,” Justice Shah observed.
Justice Shah also traced the history of dower by recalling how payment of dower (mahr) at the time of marriage was a customary practice in Arabia before the advent of Islam. This practice of paying dower as a bride-price to male guardians of the bride was reformed by Islam through the Quranic commands of paying dower as the bride-wealth to the bride herself, who becomes the sole owner of it, he added.
The Holy Quran also forbids the believers to take back anything from their wives out of the paid dower even it be a great sum, Justice Shah observed. In Islam, the payment of dower to a bride at marriage was an obligation that was imposed by God Almighty, and was thus an intrinsic and integral part of a Muslim marriage.
This case where a husband disputes the payment of maintenance and dower to his wife, provides an occasion to underline the principles, duties and obligations of a husband towards his wife under Islamic law with regard to maintenance and dower, Justice Shah observed.
“It is regrettable that the petitioner, an educated person who belongs to the noble profession of teaching, does not realise his obligation to pay the dower agreed upon by him at the time of marriage, not only under the law of the land but also under the commandments of the God Almighty given in the Holy Quran to persons who proclaim to be Muslim.
Justice Shah observed that the petition moved by Haseenullah was baseless and therefore dismissed.

3,Knife attack in China kindergarten kills three,"A “gangster wearing a cap and mask” stormed the private kindergarten, say police; suspect at large.","BEIJING: Three people were killed and six others wounded in a knife attack on Wednesday at a kindergarten in southeast China’s Jiangxi province, police said.
A “gangster wearing a cap and mask” stormed the private kindergarten in Anfu county at about 10:00am local time (0200 GMT), police said in a statement published on China’s Twitter-like Weibo.
The 48-year-old suspect is still at large, they added.
“Public security organs are making every effort to hunt down the suspect,” the police statement said.
In a video of the scene shared by state-run Beijing Daily, a police officer can be seen carrying a tiny child in his arms to an ambulance.
The ages of the victims have not been announced.
Mass violent crime is rare in China, which strictly prohibits citizens from owning firearms, but there has been a spate of mass stabbings in recent years.
And fatal attacks specifically targeting kindergarten and school students have occurred nationwide, carried out by people reportedly wishing to wreak revenge on society or because of grievances with colleagues.
The attacks have forced authorities to step up security.

4,Taiwan defiant as China readies military drills,"Asean urges all sides to exercise restraint, de-escalate tension","TAIPEI: Taiwan struck a defiant tone on Wednesday as it hosted US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, with a furious China gearing up for military exercises dangerously close to the island’s shores in retaliation for the visit.
As the tension is mounting in the region, Southeast Asian nations urged restraint over Taiwan after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island prompted an enraged China to vow “punishment”.
Pelosi landed in Taiwan on Tuesday despite a series of increasingly stark threats from Beijing, which views the island as its territory and had said it would consider the visit a major provocation.
China responded swiftly, announcing what it said were “necessary and just” military drills in the seas just off Taiwan’s coast — some of the world’s busiest waterways.

Asean urges all sides to exercise restraint, de-escalate tension

“In the current struggle surrounding Pelosi’s Taiwan visit, the United States are the provocateurs, China is the victim,” Beijing’s foreign ministry said.
But Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said the island of 23 million would not be cowed. “Facing deliberately heightened military threats, Taiwan will not back down. We will... continue to hold the line of defence for democracy,” Tsai said at an event with Pelosi in Taipei.
She also thanked the 82-year-old US lawmaker for “taking concrete actions to show your staunch support for Taiwan at this critical moment”.
China tries to keep Taiwan isolated on the world stage and opposes countries having official exchanges with Taipei.
Pelosi, second in line to the presidency, is the highest-profile elected US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years.
“Today, our delegation... came to Taiwan to make unequivocally clear we will not abandon our commitment to Taiwan,” she said at the event with Tsai.
She added her group had come “in friendship to Taiwan” and “in peace to the region”.
Before leaving Taiwan, Pelosi also met several dissidents who have previously been in the crosshairs of China’s wrath — including Tiananmen protest student leader Wu’er Kaixi.
Asean FMs’ meeting
Pelosi’s dramatic trip to Taipei overshadowed a meeting of Asso­ciation of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) foreign ministers in Phnom Penh, which had been expected to focus on the bloody crisis engulfing Myanmar.
Asean spokesman Kung Phoak, Cambodia’s deputy foreign minister, said ministers at the closed-door talks — meeting face to face for the first time since the pandemic — had expressed concern over growing tension in the Taiwan Strait.
“We hope that all sides will try their best to deescalate the tension there, avoid actions that may contribute to the escalation of tension and engage in dialogue,” Kung Phoak told reporters.

5,"Iran, US hint at resumption of talks on revival of N-deal this week","Iran’s top nuclear negotiator, US envoy will travel to Vienna this week for talks on reviving 2015 nuclear pact, say officials.","DUBAI: Iran’s top nuclear negotiator and a senior US envoy will travel to Vienna this week for talks on reviving the 2015 nuclear pact, officials from both governments said on Wednesday, rekindling a process that stalled in June.
Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said Tehran was ready to reach a deal that guarantees its rights, according to state media.
“(Iranian negotiator) Bagheri Kani will leave Tehran in a few hours ... In this round of talks, which will be held as usual with the coordination of the European Union, ideas presented by different sides will be discussed,” Kanaani said.
A US official said Rob Malley, the US special envoy for Iran, will travel to Vienna for talks this week on reviving the nuclear agreement.
Last month, top European Union diplomat Josep Borrell said he had proposed a new draft text to revive the accord under which Iran curbed its nuclear programme in return for relief from economic sanctions.
In 2018, then-US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal, calling it too soft on Iran, and re-imposed harsh US sanctions, spurring Tehran to begin breaching the nuclear limits set in the pact.


Rob Malley

 
The deal seemed near revival in March after 11 months of indirect talks between Tehran and President Joe Biden’s administration in Vienna.
But talks then broke down over obstacles including Tehran’s demand that Washington should give guarantees that no US president would abandon the deal as Trump did.
In June, the EU-mediated, indirect talks between Bagheri Kani and Malley aimed at breaking an impasse over how to salvage the 2015 nuclear pact ended in Qatar without the progress.
“Iran is determined to reach a stable agreement that guarantees the rights and interests of the Iranian nation,” Kanaani said, calling on Washington to “provide the conditions for the effective progress of the talks by taking the necessary decisions”.
An Iranian official said that the talks in Vienna will be “in the format of the Doha meeting”, where EU envoy Enrique Mora shuttled between Bagheri Kani and Malley because Tehran refused to hold direct talks with Washington.
Earlier on Wednesday, Mora tweeted: “On my way to Vienna to discuss #JCPOA back to full implementation on the basis of the coordinator’s text tabled on 20 July.”
