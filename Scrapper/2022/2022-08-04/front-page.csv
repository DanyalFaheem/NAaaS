• PDM wants PTI chairman held, placed on ECL
ISLAMABAD: While announcing that the ruling Pakistan Democratic Movement coalition had decided to submit a reference against the PTI chairman in light of Article 62 (1)(f) of the Constitution, following the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision in the prohibited funding case against the party, PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Wednesday demanded that “Imran Khan should be made an example of”.
In its verdict on Tuesday, the election watchdog ruled that PTI had “wilfully” and “knowingly” received prohibited funding from a number of foreign donors. In its order, the commission had also said that it was “constrained to hold that Imran Khan failed to discharge his obligations as mandated under the Pakistani statutes”.
“A reference should be filed against Imran Khan as he is no more Sadiq and Amin (truthful and honest),” the PDM leader said at a press conference after a meeting of the multi-party alliance at the PM House to decide the line of action against Imran Khan.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
He also demanded placement of the PTI chairman on the Exit Control List (ECL) as he beseeched “all institutions to save” Pakistan.
Maulana Fazl, who heads his faction of Jamiat Ulema-i-Pakistan-Fazl (JUI-F), urged authorities to detain the former premier along with PTI office-holders.
“Whether it is Imran Khan or Dr Arif Alvi, [they] should immediately resign from the party because they have proven to be criminals,” he said, adding that “all the political parties had decided to initiate action” against Imran Khan and his party as they were now “proven criminals”.
The JUI-F leader said that for eight years, Imran tried to “run away” from the ECP by levelling accusations against the institution and its chief. “He blackmailed the ECP but the reality is that the commission is an [independent] institution and it can’t falsify the facts,” Maulana Fazl stated.
Mr Khan and his supporters have on multiple occasions cast aspersions on the ECP and Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, accusing the body and its chief of bias. The ECP, however, denied all accusations.
Editorial: Imran vs the CEC
According to the PDM chief, “The verdict has proved that he [Imran Khan] is an incompetent leader. All these years the PTI submitted false certificates and declarations in the ECP which is a violation of the Constitution.”
“But today, we have reached the stage where it is now clear that he was backed by a foreign agenda and tried to harm Pakistan,” he claimed.
Read: Prohibited funding case —  the verdict and after
The verdict, Fazl continued, showed that Imran was a “foreign puppet who was brought into politics as [part of] a foreign agenda”. “He took help from Israel and India […] today all these facts have been unearthed. His fundraisers had links to Israel, India, Denmark, Canada, Finland and many other countries,” the PDM chief alleged.
Speaking about the PDM meeting, Fazl stated that the government and its allies had agreed that the “matter of the state’s security” was the utmost priority and stressed that all the “institutions and powers” should work as one to protect the country.
Such “criminal elements” should be “uprooted from the country’s history and be made an example for the upcoming generations”, he suggested.
On the other hand, PTI central leader Fawad Chaudhry, when asked to comment on the demand for putting PTI chief’s name on the no-fly list, said Imran Khan was not going anywhere.
The government can place Imran’s name on ECL anytime as Mr Khan has no intention of leaving the country. If PDM demands his name on ECL, then they can go ahead and do it,” he told Dawn.
‘Markets happy’
Meanwhile, Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal claimed the stocks and foreign exchange markets had responded positively to the ECP decision against the PTI led by Mr Khan.
The stock market showed positive signs soon after the announcement of the verdict and gained around 900 points on Wednesday, while the rupee got strengthened against the dollar by Rs9.59, he said while addressing the press conference.
Ahsan Iqbal said there might be some other factors behind the positive development, but political stability was one of the main reasons which impacted the market positively. He said the people knew very well that the PTI’s only objective was “to create anarchy” in the country.

1,"PTI files reference with Supreme Judicial Council, seeks removal of CEC",Seeks CEC's removal over “commission of continuous and deliberate misconduct”; PTI to protest outside ECP offices today.,"ISLAMABAD: A day after the announcement of the verdict by the Election Commission of Pakistan in the prohibited funding case, the Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf moved a reference before the Supreme Judicial Council against Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja on Wednesday.
Moved through Babar Awan, the reference pleaded with the SJC to order removal of the CEC on account of the “commission of continuous and deliberate misconduct”.
The reference alleged that on July 29, a delegation of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) met the CEC and four other members of the ECP in his office to “pressure” him into announcing the verdict in the prohibited funding case.
It was a consequence of that meeting that the Election Commission decided to deliver the verdict on Aug 2.

Imran reaffirms party decision to hold protest outside ECP offices today

Thus the CEC allegedly violated his oath, the reference argued.
The reference contended that the ECP decision was illegal, unlawful and coram non judice. The PTI will challenge the order in court, it added.
The reference further argued the CEC had violated the ECP’s code of conduct and failed to fulfil his constitutional obligations.
The code of conduct for judges of the superior judiciary applies to the chief election commissioner as well, the PTI said, adding that a high court judge never discusses pending cases with any person or institution.
“The CEC must be removed from one of the most respectable and sacred constitutional posts,” the reference said.
Joint hearing
Sikandar Sultan Raja, the CEC, had dismissed many PTI applications in the prohibited funding case, including a request to conduct a joint hearing in funding cases of PTI and other parties, the reference said.
The Islamabad High Court provided relief to PTI, asking the ECP to extend an equal treatment to all political parties and to hear their cases with due diligence and to concluded these within a reasonable time, the reference said.
Instead, the reference complained, the ECP announced a verdict in the PTI case only and kept the cases of other parties in abeyance. “This is absolute discrimination.”
It is a routine matter that judges of the Supreme Court meet members of the Pakistan Bar Council, the Supreme Court Bar Association and other lawyer forums, but it has been observed recently that the apex court refused to meet a delegation of the Supreme Court Bar Association during hearing of the suo motu petition under article 184(3) of the Constitution in the “Parvez Elahi versus Deputy Speaker, Punjab Assembly” case since it was one of the parties in the proceedings.
The same rule applied to the CEC, the reference said, but he not only met the PDM delegation but also admitted that a discussion did take place on the timing of the judgement in PTI prohibited funding case.
The reference recalled that the Lahore High Court had asked the Election Commission in 2018 to dispose of a funding case related to the Peoples Party within one month. But the ECP did not comply with the directive “only to benefit (PPP chief) Bilawal Bhutto in the run-up to the general election”, the PTI alleged.
“The discriminatory attitude of the respondent has been noticeable time and again since 125 members of the National Assembly resigned their seats on April 9, which was accepted by former deputy speaker (acting as Speaker) Qasim Suri.
“Their resignations were published in the gazette on April 13 and sent to the ECP, but they were not denotified, whereas the current National Assembly Speaker, by doing an illegal and unconstitutional act, accepted the resignation of 11 members out of 125 and sent the reference to the CEC. He took no time to denotify them,” the PTI said.
In the disqualification case of Mohammad Kashif Chaudhry, a PML-N member of the Punjab Assembly, the CEC delayed the process of his denotification, the PTI said. But when Faisal Niazi, a former member of the Punjab Assembly belonging to PML-N, resigned his seat to dissociate himself from his party, the CEC delayed the denotification process, the reference alleged.
Electronic voting machine
The CEC has been opposing the introduction of Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) so that the PTI’s opponents “are able to use unfair means during elections”, the reference further alleged.
The PTI-led government in the centre was toppled through a “conspiracy initiated upon the cypher issued by Donald Lu, a US Deputy Undersecretary of State”, on March 8, the reference alleged.
Meanwhile, Imran Khan said he would thank the coalition government if they included his name in the exit control list (ECL), adding he did not want to fly abroad as he didn’t own any flats there.
Khan, in an interview with a private news channel, said PTI will approach the Supreme Judicial Commission against Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja.
He said the PTI leaders, workers, and supporters will stage a peaceful protest outside the ECP (on Thursday) and will not enter the Red Zone.

BIRMINGHAM: After Shah Hussain Shah ended Pakistan’s medal wait, Nooh Dastagir Butt sma­shed the Common­wealth Games record.
On the sixth day of competition in Birmingham, the duo’s exploits ensured Pakistan got its first gold and bronze medals.
It was Nooh’s breathtaking lift that delivered the gold, the 23-year-old improving on his bronze at the previous edition of the Games in Australia’s Gold Coast four years ago.
Nooh had signalled his intent to win gold from the start of the men’s +109kg weightlifting final when he was imperious in the scratch — first lifting 170kg and then improving it to 173kg in his second attempt.
A botched attempt at 175kg didn’t matter. Nooh led the field halfway through the final, with New Zealander David Andrew Liti (170kg) second and India’s Gurdeep Singh in a tie for the third spot with Gordon Shaw at 167kg.
Nooh then obliterated the field in the clean and jerk session, twice beating marks of 218kg and 224kg by Liti, as well as a lift of 223kg by Gurdeep, by lifting 225kg in his first attempt and then a massive 232kg to finish with a total of 405kg. He bettered the record of 403kg set by Liti on the way to gold four years ago.
Liti took silver with 394kg while Gurdeep claimed bronze on 390kg.
Nooh matched Shuja­uddin Malik as the only weightlifters from the country to have won a Commonwealth Games gold. Malik won in 2006 in the 85kg category.
Hours earlier, judoka Shah Hussain got Pakistan off the mark on the medals table when he won bronze in the men’s -90kg category at the Coventry Stadium.
The 29-year-old Shah Hussain, the son of Pakistan’s legendary boxer Hussain Shah, overwhelmed South African Thomas-Laszlo Breyytenbach by ippon — the highest score a fighter can achieve — in their bronze medal bout.
Shah Hussain wrapped up the contest in just under three minutes with a sankanku-jime, a chokehold that encircles the opponent’s neck and one arm with the legs.
It is the second Commonwealth Games medal for Shah Hussain, who finished with a silver in the men’s -100kg competition at Glasgow in 2014.
Shah Hussain, who is based in Japan, had earlier lost his quarter-final bout against Australia’s Harrison Cassar by ippon.
However, with just six competitors in the field for the -90kg category, he got a chance for bronze against the 43rd-ranked Breyytenbach.
Breyytenbach had a bye to the semi-finals, where he lost to eventual gold medalist Jamal Petgrave of England.
Petgrave overcame Remi Feuillet of Mauritius by waza-ari — the second-highest score in judo — in the final, while Cassar picked up the other bronze medal on offer.
Elsewhere, Pakistan’s hockey team kept alive its hopes of advancing to the semi-finals from Group ‘A’ after they registered their first win of the campaign in their match when Rooman’s 55th-minute goal secured a 3-2 win over Scotland.

3,Drone that hit Ayman al Zawahiri flew from Kyrgyzstan: reports,Analyst says the drone strike has generated “lots of discussion” in the US on “Pakistan’s possible role” in the raid.,"WASHINGTON: The American drone that eliminated Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri in Kabul was possibly laun­ched from an airbase in Kyrgyzstan, some US media reports claimed on Wednesday.
The reports claimed that the attack was launched from Ganci Airbase, a US transit facility at Manas in northern Kyrgyzstan.
According to the US Department of Defence, Ganci is a former American military base in Kyrgyzstan, near the Bishkek international airport. It was operated by the US Air Force, which handed it over to the Kyrgyz military in June 2014.
The US administration, however, is still refusing to disclose where the drone take-off from and what route it used. The Department of Defence only issued a brief statement, saying: “Zawahiri was killed in an over-the-horizon operation in downtown Kabul, where he was residing as a guest of the Taliban. The house was struck by two Hellfires missiles in a precision, counterterrorism operation at 6:18am Kabul time on Sunday.”
The National Public Radio (NPR), America’s largest radio news network, noted that US officials were not saying where they launched the drone from, “but the US no longer has any military bases in the immediate region, suggesting the aircraft may have flown a long distance before reaching its target”.
Michael Kugelman, a scholar of South Asian affairs at the Wilson Center, Washington, noted that the drone strike has generated “lots of discussion” in the US on “Pakistan’s possible role” in the raid.
“I wouldn’t overstate its role, but also would take with some grains of salt the contention that there was no role at all.”
Mr Kugelman focused his attention on two possible forms of support: airspace and intelligence. “The geography doesn’t lie. If this drone was launched from a US base in the Gulf, it wouldn’t be able to fly over Iran. Flying over Central Asia is circuitous and hard to pull off if you’re undertaking a rapid operation,” he wrote.
“This leaves the Pakistani airspace as the most desirable option for intelligence support and US officials have indicated the planning and surveillance for this operation took months.”
“Could it do that all alone, with no on-ground presence?” he asked, adding that if not Pakistan, “some renegade Taliban members might have supplied that information to the US”.
But Mr Kugelman does not rule out the possibility of Afghanistan’s Central Asian neighbours providing that support to the US.
A BBC report explored the possibility of the CIA conducting the drone strike without any support from Afghanistan’s neighbours.
“When a missile is launched from a drone, a weapons operator — sometimes sitting in an air-conditioned control room as far away as the continental US — sees a live video stream of the target, which the drone’s camera sensors feedback via satellite,” the report pointed out.
“Using a set of targeting brackets on the screen, the camera operator is then able to lock up the target and point a laser at it. Once the missile is fired, it follows the path of that laser until striking the target.”
The report also noted that the US used drone-fired Hellfires air-to-surface missile that has become a fixture of US counter-terrorism operations overseas in the decades since the 11 September 2001 attacks.
“The missile can be fired from a variety of platforms, including helicopters, ground vehicles, ships and fixed wing aircraft — or, in Zawahiri’s case, from an unmanned drone.”

4,NAB won’t be able to probe graft cases below Rs500m,NA passes bill to further clip NAB’s wings; bill proposes stripping president of power to appoint accountability court judges.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly passed a bill on Wednesday that aims to further clip the wings of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) by proposing that all corruption cases involving an amount below Rs500 million would not come in its purview.
The bill also proposes that the federal government, and not the President, should have the power to appoint judges of accountability courts.
“A judge shall be appointed by the federal government after consultation with the chief justice of the high court concerned,” the bill stated. As per the bill, the service tenure of NAB’s prosecutor general can be extended by three years.
The Minister of State for Law and Justice, Shahadat Awan, presented the National Accountability (Second Amendment) Act, 2022, in the lower house to further amend the law regulating the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).

NA passes bill to further clip watchdog’s wings

The bill amended Section 16 of the National Accountability Ordinance 1999 (NAO), stating that an accused would be tried for an offence under the ordinance in the court under whose territorial jurisdiction the offence was alleged to have been committed.
Meanwhile, in an amendment to Section 19E, NAB’s authority to allow surveillance with the help of a high court has been withdrawn, including any assistance from government agencies.
“Any person called to provide information in relation to an offence alleged to have been committed will be informed of the allegations against them so they can file their defence in court,” the bill stated.
Moreover, the NAB chairman will now be able to recommend the termination of a reference before indictment.
A joint session of Parliament had approved the National Accountability (Second Amendment) Bill, 2021, in June.
The lower house passed another bill to amend the Publication Laws Pakistan Act of 2016.
The NAB amendment bill said the prosecutor general’s service can be extended by three years.
The bill suggested that cases against an accused will be tried in the area where the crime is committed.
Under an amendment, NAB will not be allowed to take assistance of any other department for investigation.
Earlier, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairman, Noor Alam, called for an inquiry against former chief justice Saqib Nisar in order to “ascertain facts regarding the funds collected by him for the Mohmand and Diamer Bhasha dams”.
He said it should be made mandatory for all NAB officers, including retired military officials, to place details of their assets before the Establishment Division.
The NA session started after a delay of 90 minutes.

5,Rupee sees biggest single-day gain in over two decades,"Rises 4.2pc to close at 228.80 in interbank market; gold falls Rs9,600 per tola","KARACHI: The rupee jumped 4.2 per cent in the interbank market against the US dollar on Wednesday, making the largest single-day gain in years after weeks of battering amid political and economic turmoil.
The rupee closed at 228.80 on Wednesday, up from 238.38 a day earlier, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said, a day after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the country had cleared all prior actions needed to unlock the much-needed loan programme.
Fahad Rauf, head of research at Ismail Iqbal Securities, told Reuters news agency that it was the highest rupee rally in both absolute and percentage terms since 1999, according to central bank data.
After two weeks of battering against the dollar, the rupee fell to its lowest level against the dollar on July 28, closing at 239.94. It then started to bounce back from Friday, rising 4.7pc until Tuesday.

Rises 4.2pc to close at 228.80 in interbank market; gold falls Rs9,600 per tola

Currency dealers and experts expect the local curr­ency to continue to recover in the next few days.
SBP Acting Governor Murtaza Syed also said on Wednesday the rupee was undervalued at the moment and the dollar had overshot in the forex market due to several reasons. He assured the business community that the dollar would come down to its “real value” in two to three months.
In the open market, the rupee appreciated by 11 to Rs230 on Wednesday, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).
ECAP chairman Malik Bostan said the rupee would further gain in the coming days since chances were bright for dollar inflows, as the IMF board is set to meet later this month on Pakistan’s bailout package.
Finance Minister Miftah Ismail recently said Pakistan could receive up to $8 billion after the release of the IMF tranche, which amounts to $1.18bn.
Mr Bostan said the government had taken several measures that aided the rupee’s recovery, including reducing the import bill and hence the trade deficit, cracking down on dollar smuggling to Kabul, and taking a better approach towards opening letters of credit (LCs) — bank documents that guarantee payment.
According to the latest numbers released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the country’s trade deficit was $2.6bn in July, down 18pc from a year ago and down 47pc from June. Imports fell 13pc from a year ago and 38pc from June to $4.8bn, the lowest level since December 2020.
On Tuesday, Pakistan got the green light from the IMF for the release of $1.18bn of bailout funds after certain conditions were met. The last condition was an increase in the petroleum development levy on July 31.
Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market, said, “Exporters have started selling dollars on a large scale which accelerated the process of rupee recovery.”
He said the central bank was also selling dollars in the interbank market to cool the demand while it discourages forward booking.
However, the inflow of the dollar has yet to begin from bilateral or multilateral creditors, which could improve the SBP-held foreign exchange reserves, which stand at $8.6bn.
Gold falls Rs9,600
The price of 24-karat gold dropped by Rs9,600 per tola to Rs145,300 on Wednesday, down from Rs154,900 the previous day in the local market, the All Sindh Sarafa Jewellers Association said. The price of the 10-gram fold fell by Rs7,373 to Rs124,571.
The price of 22-karat gold dropped to Rs114,190 from Rs120,950 a day earlier. The rate of silver fell by Rs20 to Rs1,620 per tola and by Rs17.15 to Rs1,389 per 10g.
In the international market, gold’s price decreased by $14 to $1,766 on Wednesday, the association said.

6,Country sees 180pc more rains in wettest July since 1961,Karachi’s PAF Masroor received highest monthly rainfall of 606mm.,"

Ziauddin

 
KARACHI: With the monsoon season expected to last two months, the country has already witnessed record rains last month when the national rainfall was recorded at 181 per cent above average, making this July the wettest since 1961.
Pakistan’s Monthly Climate Summary for July, issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) on Wednesday, said this year’s monsoon set on in the country from June 30, a day before its normal onset date when strong moist currents from the Arabian Sea started penetrating into southern Sindh from July 1.
It also mentioned reasons based on detailed data information of 25 climate stations of the country. The currents “spread over upper and central parts of the country from July 6. In addition, the moist currents from the Bay of Bengal also kept entering the country and these features lasted almost through the entire month,” said the summary.
The summary is produced by PMD’s Climate Data Processing Centre in Karachi to provide the major features of weather events occurred in the country during the month. With above-average rainfall across the country in July, the month’s showers were “excessively above average” in Balochistan and Sindh.

Karachi’s PAF Masroor received highest monthly rainfall of 606mm

“National rainfall for the month of July 2022 was largely (181pc) above average and stood as record wettest July since 1961,” it said, adding that the previous month’s rainfall alone exceeded the total normal monsoon seasonal rainfall by 26pc.
Balochistan and Sindh received 450pc and 308pc more rainfall than average, it said. The above-average figure was 116pc in Punjab, 32pc in Gilgit-Baltistan and 30pc in KP.
“The wettest day of the month in the country was July 25, when Badin (Sindh) recorded 219mm (of rainfall), whereas PAF Masroor (Karachi) remained the wettest place with a monthly total of 606mm,” it said.
Other areas that received significant monthly rainfall were Islamabad Airport 573.3mm, Padidan 535.4mm, Gujranwala 494mm, Islamabad (old airport) 481.9mm, Takht-i-Bahi 456.2mm, Islamabad Zero Point 449mm, Gujrat 424mm, Sialkot Cantt 423.1mm, Lasbela 404.7mm, Mangla 391.2mm, Jhelum 383.7mm, Chakwal 383.6mm, Kotli 360mm, Murree 356mm, Sialkot airport 352.4mm, and Balakot 352.4mm.
On the other hand, Chilas and Nokkundi were the only two stations that remained dry with no rain at all during July.
According to the PMD summary, the country witnessed three widespread rainy spells in July, considered to be the wettest month of the year.
After lashing mostly light to moderate rains in most parts in the first week of July, the monsoon season started turning stronger in the second week when a low-pressure area developed over southern areas of Punjab on July 7 and prevailed until July 15.
“Another monsoon low developed over Gulf of Kutch (India) on July 16, which converted into a depression on July 17 and lay over Northeast Arabian Sea-Gulf of Kutch, India,” the summary said, adding that among all three spells, the third one in late July proved the heaviest when mostly southern parts of the cou­ntry witnessed torrential rains.
“A fresh low-pressure area formed over southeast Sindh and adjoining areas on July 22 and persisted until July 27, which produced heavy rains in central and southern Sindh, including Karachi, leading to urban flooding in Karachi, Thatta and Badin districts,” it said.
“Overall, the monsoon axis (a line stretching from the seasonal low’s centre to the Bay of Bengal in the east) remained to the south of its normal position,” it said.
