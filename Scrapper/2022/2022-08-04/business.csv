0,Joint committee with FPCCI to redress grievances,SBP's senior management visits FPCCI to discuss current economic challenges.,"KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Acting Governor Dr Murtaza Syed announced the formation of a committee and the appointment of an SBP liaison officer for close coordination with the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) and timely redress of grievances of the business committee.
A statement issued by the central bank on Wednesday said that Dr Syed made the announcement during his visit to the FPCCI at the invitation of their management.
The senior management of the SBP including deputy governors Inayat Hussain and Sima Kamil, visited the FPCCI to discuss current economic challenges and the measures being taken by the government and the central bank. 
On the occasion, Dr Syed said the SBP believes the rupee is currently undervalued and that the dollar has overshot in the forex market for a variety of reasons, but that it will return to its true value in 2-3 months.
Dr Syed also assured the participants to look into the technical requirements of prior approvals required by the commercial banks from SBP on the clearance of financial documents of the consignments with the H S Codes starting with 84 & 85 as these restrictions were affecting the import of tractor parts and other agricultural machinery as well.
FPCCI President Irfan Iqbal Sheikh requested the SBP governor to use policy tools available at the central bank’s disposal to check the speculative dollar trading over the past few weeks.
He observed that importers, manufacturers, and industries were at the receiving end due to the speculative nature and unavailability of dollars, the shortage of industrial raw materials, and the resultant disruptions in the production processes.
Mr Irfan said that over the past several weeks the commercial banks have been offering LCs to importers at the rates higher than inter-bank rates and requested the SBP to play its role for course correction.
According to a senior SBP official, the bank has increased short-term export refinance limits from Rs432 billion to Rs857bn in the last four years, a nearly 100 per cent increase.
Similarly, the outstanding stock of SBP’s long term fixed rate financing for exporters (LTFF) has increased by 57pc in the last three years, from Rs209bn to Rs329bn.

5,Govt plans to auction 2100MHz spectrum,Three cellular operators oppose the move.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday decided to hold a spectrum auction of 2100MHz band in 2x5 bandwidth for 10 years for the Next Generation of Mobile Services (NGMS) although three out of four existing cellular operators had opposed the fresh auction.
The decision was taken at the first meeting of the Spectrum Auction Advisory Committee (SAAC) presided over by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail and attended by ministers for information technology and telecom, economic affairs, commerce and power besides the chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and other members and stakeholders.
The finance minister told the meeting that the government was aiming at improving mobile broadband services as this sector contributed heavily to the country’s economic development. “The committee unanimously decided to go for auction of 2100 MHz band in 5, 5 MHz bandwidth for 10 years using the current consultant’s report at net present value”, an announcement said.
The committee was briefed about demand and supply and recommendations of PTA for the release of available spectrum for NGMS in Pakistan. It was also shared that 4G penetration was spectacularly increasing in the country which was a really good sign for the development of the IT-related infrastructure in the county.

Three cellular operators oppose the move

The meeting was told that the frequency spectrum was available in two major categories — 1800MHz band in 1733.9–1737.5 or 1828.9-1832.5MHz frequency with a total available bandwidth of 2x3.6MHz and 2100MHz band in 1960-1975 or 2150–2165 MHz frequency with a total available bandwidth of 2x5 MHz.
The meeting was told that three operators — Jazz, China Mobile and Ufone — had opposed the fresh auction for one or another reason while Telenor showed keen interest in 2x5 MHz spectrum allocation in the 2100MHz band.
The 15-member SAAC was constituted last month by the Federal Cabinet to oversee the process and secure the best out-of-spectrum auctions for NGMS. The committee led by Finance Minister Dr Miftah Ismail comprised four other federal ministers, three federal secretaries and representatives from other telecom stakeholders including General Headquarters (GHQ) and Inter-Services Intelligence.
The committee has been tasked to examine and evaluate the market assessment report and spectrum demand and supply and recommendations of PTA for the release of available spectrum for NGMS.
The committee is also required to examine and finalise the policy directive for the federal government for the release of the NGMS spectrum and oversee the auction and release process to be conducted by PTA. The Ministry of Information Technology & Telecommunication had proposed four federal ministers for the committee including the finance minister as its chairman and three other ministers — for information technology, economic affairs and science and technology.
However, the nomination of the minister for science and technology was replaced and instead two more ministers — for power and commerce — were included in the SAAC on the recommendations of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet. As such, the number of federal ministers in the SAAC increased to five including the finance minister as the chairman.
Other members of the committee include secretaries for Finance, IT & Telecom and Law & Justice Divisions besides Chairman PTA, Executive Director Frequency Allocation Board, a representative of GHQ, Director General Technical of ISI, Members Legal and Telecom of IT ministry and any other person that the committee may wish to co-opt.
The spectrum auctions for NGMS in Pakistan were conducted in 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2021 under the policy directives issued by the federal government. Consequently, a paired spectrum of 30MHz in 1900/2100 MHz band, 29MHz in 1800MHz band and 10MHz in 850MHz band was auctioned and assigned to the cellular mobile operators.

6,SBP cracks down on exchange firms to stabilise rupee,Says some banks are charging much higher dollar rates than the rates shown by the State Bank.,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Wednesday said it has started a crackdown on exchange companies (ECs) in the light of findings from ongoing inspections and mystery shopping.
In a statement, the central bank stated that due to recent volatility in the exchange rate and the difference between the interbank rate and the rate offered by ECs and banks to their customers, it has increased its monitoring of ECs and banks’ foreign exchange operations.
In this respect, the SBP started inspections of a number of exchange companies and banks on Monday (Aug 1), it added.
There was clear evidence that banks were involved in minting money as they were charging much higher dollar rates than the rates shown by the State Bank. Moreover, some importers were getting dollars easily to open Letters of Credit, while many were facing difficulties arranging dollars even from outside the banking channels.
On Tuesday (August 2), the SBP suspended the operations of four branches of two ECs (Galaxy Exchange Co and Al-Hameed International Money Exchange Co) for violation of its regulations.
The SBP has also imposed monetary penalties on some ECs in the recent past. “Besides, due to violations of SBP instructions, arrangements of 13 franchises have been terminated by six different ECs in the recent past,” said the SBP.
The SBP has also started conducting mystery shopping exercises throughout Pakistan to investigate the apprehensions that some ECs are not selling foreign currency to their customers.
A meeting of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan has also been called for August 4.
“If needed, the SBP would augment its enforcement actions on the ECs and the banks in light of the findings of the on-going inspections and mystery shopping,” said the SBP.

7,Opec+ agrees small oil output rise despite Biden plea,"VIENNA: The Opec+ oil cartel agreed to a tiny increase in production on Wednesday, an amount analysts say will...","VIENNA: The Opec+ oil cartel agreed to a tiny increase in production on Wednesday, an amount analysts say will disappoint US President Joe Biden after he personally lobbied Saudi leaders for help to tame soaring energy prices.
The cartel led by Saudi Arabia and Russia decided to raise production by 100,000 barrels per day for September, much lower than previous increases, according to a statement issued after a ministerial videoconference.
Oil prices seesawed following the announcement, rising before falling more than two percent in afternoon trading, with the main international contract, Brent, slipping under $100 per barrel. Traders were also reacting to data showing US crude inventories had unexpectedly risen last week. “The smallest increase in Opec+ history will do little to help the ongoing global energy crisis,” Edward Moya, analyst at OANDA trading platform, told AFP.
“The Biden administration will not be happy and this will be a setback in improving US-Saudi relations,” said Moya, who expects oil prices to remain stuck around $100.
With energy prices soaring following Russia’s war in Ukraine, Biden made a controversial trip to Saudi Arabia in July in part to convince the kingdom to loosen the production taps to stabilise the market and curb rampant inflation.
The US president met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite his promise to make the kingdom a  “pariah” in the wake of the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Biden said after his meetings with Saudi officials that he was  “doing all I can” to increase the oil supply. “A 100,000 barrel per day output hike is a pittance,” said Han Tan, chief market analyst at Exinity.
“It’s likely that the Biden administration will feel let down, considering its overtures to Saudi Arabia have yielded scant results, at least this time around,” Tan said.
Saudi Arabia faced a balancing act between its old ally, Washington, and its Opec+ partner Moscow, which has been hit by Western sanctions over the Ukraine invasion.
“The increase was a token gesture to appease US President Joe Biden,” said Stephen Bren­nock, analyst at PVM Energy.
The Opec+ statement emphasised the  “value and importance of maintaining consensus as essential to the cohesion” of the group, which includes the 13-member Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 allies including Russia.
