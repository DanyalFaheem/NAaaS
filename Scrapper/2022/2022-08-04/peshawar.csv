0,PHC denies bail to 29 in Bajaur lynching case,Orders release of 11 for not being named in FIR.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has rejected the bail plea of 29 people charged with lynching a murder suspect after vandalising a police station in Bajaur district two months ago.
The bench, however, granted bail to 11 suspects observing that their names did not appear in the FIR and instead, they were named in the case belatedly, so a further inquiry was needed into the charges against them under Section 497(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
It directed every suspect to produce two surety bonds each of Rs100,000.
Two petitions were jointly filed by 40 of the arrested suspects.
One petition was filed by Yar Khan and 27 others but it was rejected, while the second petition was filed by 12 suspects but the court granted bail to 11 of them.

Orders release of 11 for not being named in FIR

The FIR of the lynching incident was registered by the Nawagai police station on the complaint of SHO Inspector Fazalur Rehman on May 19, 2022, under sections 302, 324, 353, 427, 436, 148, 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
The complainant claimed that he was busy interrogating suspect Abdur Rashid in connection with a missing person, Ghafoor Rehman.
He said as the probe was under way, the missing person was found dead and his body was shifted to the district headquarters hospital in Khar.
The complainant alleged that the father of deceased Ziarat Khan invited the residents to the police station attack.
He claimed that relatives of the deceased along with around 900 residents surrounded the police station and demanded the custody of the suspect for punishment.
The complainant claimed that the violent mob later attacked the police station while throwing stones and firing bullets at the building.
He added that the crowd smashed the main gate, entered the premises, damaged property and torched different parts of the building.
The complainant alleged that the arsonists dragged the suspect out of the lock-up and killed him by hitting him with sticks and stones before throwing the body on the road.
The bench observed that records showed that the petitioners, including Yar Khan, Zar Bacha and 27 others, were directly named in the FIR for making an attack on the Nawagai police station in the form of a mob armed with weapons and sticks.
The bench observed that that the mode and manner of the occurrence emerging from the evidence on record suggested that the petitioners were directly charged while forming an unlawful assembly, had challenged the writ of the government by taking the law into their own hands by dragging the suspect on the road and committing his murder in a brutal manner.
About four of the petitioners, who contended that they were juveniles, the court observed that it was a settled law that the juvenile accused deserved a lenient view but not in each and every case nor could the tender age be used as a licence by a juvenile to kill or attempt to kill innocent people.

The abducted businessman identified as Wahab Khan had left his residence in Gulshan Town opposite the Sheikh Maltoon Town in his car two days ago. However, the anti-narcotics wing of the Sheikh Maltoon police station allegedly stopped him on the bypass road, took him out of his car, and bundled them away for “investigation”.
Rafiq Khan, a brother of the kidnapped person, told reporters at the press club that when his brother did not reach home till late night, he became worried and asked about his brother from the police station in the city, but to no avail. 
“Afterwards, I filed a daily report of the disappearance of his brother at the Sheikh Multoon Town police station,” he said, adding he received a call from a number and the caller demanded Rs20 million ransom to release his brother. He said he tried to reach the kidnappers, but could not.
Mardan city mayor Himayatullah Mayar, who was also present at the press club, said the abducted person narrated his ordeal to him, saying that he assured his kidnappers that he himself would manage the ransom amount of Rs20 million through ATM card if they took him to the relevant bank.
The mayor said when the kidnappers took the trader to the ATM booth he raised an alarm, forcing them to flee.
Mr Mayar said involvement of police in the kidnapping incident had spread a wave of fear among the people.
The district police officer suspended an inspector, the head of anti-narcotics wing, an assistant sub-inspector and two policemen for their involvement in the kidnapping of trader. 
He also ordered an inquiry into the matter.

2,Tribesmen to block North Waziristan roads against targeted killings,NORTH WAZIRISTAN: The jirga of Uthmanzai tribe on Wednesday decided to block the main highway and all link roads in...,"NORTH WAZIRISTAN: The jirga of Uthmanzai tribe on Wednesday decided to block the main highway and all link roads in North Waziristan tribal district today (Thursday) after talks between elders and senior officials over targeted killings remained inconclusive here.
Deputy commissioner Shahid Ali Khan and senior officers of the administration held several rounds of talks with the protesting Uthmanzai elders but failed to achieve a breakthrough.
Head of the 50-strong committee Malik Rab Nawaz Khan later announced that the protest would be extended to the entire district.
He said under the plan, members of all Uthmanzai clans would block roads in their respective areas from Thursday onward.
Mr Khan also said the jirga also decided about the closure of all bazaars and markets in the district.
Members of the Uthmanzai tribe had begun a protest against targeted killings and the deteriorating law and order situation in the area. In the first phase, they had organised a sit-in in Eidk village near Mirali area around 17 days ago.
Mr Rab Nawaz told reporters that the tribesmen didn’t want to inconvenience the people but the situation forced them to take the extreme step of blocking roads.
He said the district would remain cut off from the rest of the province until their demands were met.
The elder said roads would remain closed at Kajori checkpost and in Shiwa, Spin Wom, Razmak, Datakhel and Khaisur areas.
Meanwhile, deputy commissioner Shahid Ali Khan confirmed an increase in targeted killings in the district but said the administration was taking concrete measures to check those acts.
He told a news conference in Miramshah that 63 incidents of targeted killings and murders had been reported in North Waziristan in the current year.
The deputy commissioner claimed that security forces had killed 105 target killers, terrorists, and their facilitators, and arrested 204 suspects in the area.
He said 42 security officials had embraced martyrdom during operations against target killers and terrorists.
Mr Shahid said the law-enforcement agencies had arrested five ‘target killers’ over the assassination of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl leader Qari Samiuddin and several others.
“Miscreants want to create mistrust between the people and the government,” he said.
District police officer Farhan Khan, who was also in attendance, said 30 of 63 cases of murder reported to the police were actually those of enmity.
He also said four people were killed ‘in the name of honour’.

3,Health department focusing on Covid booster jabs,Ongoing special vaccination drive to last till 25th...,"PESHAWAR: The health department is focusing on the administration of first and second coronavirus booster jabs to the people already vaccinated against the infectious disease to prevent its outbreak in case of the emergence of new variants, say officials.
Under new guidelines of the National Command and Operation Centre, the nerve centre for the country’s anti-Covid measures, vaccinators have been giving first and second booster doses to the fully immunised people besides trying to inoculate 80 per cent of the population above 12 years during the month-long special campaign, which began last week.
“The people are required to get first booster shot six months after full vaccination and second four months later to ensure their protection against the virus due to the emergence of new variants from time to time,” director at the Expanded Programme on Immunisation Dr Arif Khan told Dawn.
According to him, the special campaign began on July 25 and will end on August 25 to achieve the target set by the NCOC and provide safety to the population against the virus.

Ongoing special vaccination drive to last till 25th

Dr Arif said except Charsadda, no district had achieved more than 80pc coronavirus vaccination rate.
He said only four districts had given 30 per cent booster doses to their residents.
“Our initiative will achieve the target as our workers, including LHWs, have been visiting houses and are busy at community level to reach most of the population. On a daily basis, we are giving vaccine jabs to 80,000 people on average in a bid to get the campaign target,” he said.
The director said the province had 65 per cent fully immunised people and the department was reaching out to the people to administer first and second booster doses for their further protection against the virus.
He said the province had enough stock of Covid-19 vaccines and more could be acquired in case of need.
“We want to ensure that people get doses in all 36 districts. More than 1,000 vaccination centres are operational as usual but during the special drive, our workers are visiting houses, markets and bus terminals to immunise the people,” he said.
Dr Arif said the campaign had received positive response from the people in Mardan, Abbottabad and South Waziristan districts.
He said some people were still unwilling to get vaccinated falsely believing that the pandemic was over though the cases were rising.
“First and second booster shots are highly important, so most of the vaccinated people are coming over to get them to increase their immunity against coronavirus,” he said.
Health officials told Dawn that chief secretary Dr Shahzad Khan Bangash had taken notice of low vaccination rates, so the special vaccination drive was launched.
They said the people got 70-80 per cent protection against Covid-19 even after receiving first and second doses but the new NCOC guidelines declared that first and second booster jabs ensured their 100 per cent protection against the virus.
The officials said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had the lowest coronavirus vaccination rate compared with other provinces, so its population was highly vulnerable to the infection.
They warned if new variants of the virus emerged, the disease incidence would rise and so would be the case with hospitalisation and mortality rates. The officials called for vaccination against coronavirus to prevent outbreak.

In a press statement issued here on Wednesday, he stressed the need for declaring emergency in the province for treatment and protection of the livestock from the viral infection. 
He said that the livestock department should take immediate measures for vaccination of animals for protecting them from LSD besides treatment of the infected cattle. He said if immediate steps were not taken the disease could hit the livestock and result in heavy losses for the dairy farm owners.

The traders warned the government of launching an organised protest campaign across the province if it didn’t withdraw its decision forthwith. 
According to a statement issued here on Wednesday, the traders and industrialists said in a joint meeting that the collection of fixed tax through power bills was unacceptable and it should be abolished. They said the traders had already paid the sales tax and they considered the new tax in bills as double taxation. 
Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Hasnain Khurshid Ahmad chaired the meeting where the business community representatives who shared their views also included SCCI’s senior vice-president Imran Khan Mohmand, vice-president Javed Akhtar, FPCCI former president Ghazanfar Bilour, Industrialist Association Peshawar president Malik Imran Ishaq, Anjuman-i-Tajiran Peshawar chairman Shaukat Ali Khan and its president Mohammad Afzal. 
Without differentiating between small- and large-scale businesses and warehouses, the forced system of ‘fixed’ sales tax on commercial power metres was a reflection of the government’s anti-business policies, they said. 
The traders said they were already paying sales tax and the collection of Rs3,000 to Rs20,000 fixed tax through power bills was unfair. 
The SCCI chief also rejected the frequent increase in power tariff and collection of charges under the Fuel Price Adjustment in power bills. He asked the government to immediately withdraw such taxes. 
Khurshid Ahmad asked the federal government to refrain from imposing anti-business policies, as the traders and poor people couldn’t afford any new tax and subsequent inflation. 
The chamber’s president vowed to resist the government’s decision of the fixed ‘sales tax’ on power bills by launching an agitation across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

11,Work on Soan bridge may take more than a year to complete,New contract likely to be awarded to FWO this month...,"RAWALPINDI: With a new contract likely to be issued to the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) this month, re-construction work on the bridge over Soan River may take an additional one-and-a-half years to complete.
According to an official of the National Highways Authority (NHA), the contract of remodelling of the bridge had been terminated in April 2022 and the contractor was black-listed due to multiple reasons. Now, a fresh contract is to be awarded to the FWO this month, he said, adding that, “yes, the FWO would be given one year’s time to complete the work with a six-month extension. But due to monsoon and flooding in the river, work on the bridge will not commence in the next two months”.
There is an additional issue brought on by busy traffic, school and office hours as well as other factors.
The contract of remodelling of the bridge had been terminated in April 2022 due to multiple reasons, including delay and poor workmanship. Strict notice had already been taken at the top level and it was decided that a fresh contract would be awarded to the FWO so expansion of the bridge could be completed as soon as possible.

New contract likely to be awarded to FWO this month

Construction work on the bridge over Soan River was started in 2017 and was scheduled to be finished by Jan 20, 2022. Sources said senior NHA officials were summoned by higher authorities in Chaklala who expressed concern over slow pace of work. Later, it was decided that a fresh contract would be awarded to the FWO so that the remaining work could be completed.
Due to the damaged road and construction material scattered on the bridge, near the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench building, motorists entering the city have been facing problems. It has left only one lane for vehicles to pass due to which commuters and motorists remain stranded on Soan Bridge. Throughout the day, especially in the morning and evening, traffic remains even more congested.
The road is used by thousands of people including goods transporters who come to the city from other parts of the district via the G.T. Road.
The NHA official also attributed the poor work and construction material to the policy of awarding lowest rate tenders to private contractors for public welfare projects.
“It usually happens in political governments because of many reasons – one of which previously observed was that of the fear of government departments like the National Accountability Bureau (NAB),” he said, adding that no one can take any decision on their own.
