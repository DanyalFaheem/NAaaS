0,"49 more dengue patients land in Rawalpindi, Taxila hospitals","Health authority’s chief says 300 beds allocated in hospitals and number will be increased to 1,000 gradually...","RAWALPINDI: As many as 49 dengue patients landed in the hospitals of Rawalpindi and Taxila on Saturday, taking the tally of the season to over 500.

Health authority’s chief says 300 beds allocated in hospitals and number will be increased to 1,000 gradually

He said a mobile health unit had been mobilised in Chak Jalaldin union council while focal persons from different departments had been deputed at the control room.
He said it was decided that private housing societies would be included in the anti-dengue activities from their own sources. 
He said 80 teams had been trained by the health department and they are taking part in the campaign along with 4,000 focal persons.
He said that local chamber of commerce, trade unions, peace committees and other stakeholders had also been sensitised and taken on board while private schools association was also actively taking part in the anti-dengue campaign.
Taxila
The number of dengue patients in the town on Saturday rose to 19 and 13 of them belonged to the cantonment and six to rural areas. 
Health experts feared that reporting of dengue fever cases from such a number of localities had made the situation alarming as it may increase the chances of a severe outbreak in the town.
Mian Israr Ali, an entomologist at the tehsil health department, confirmed that the number of dengue patients in health facilities was continuously increasing as the prevailing weather was suitable for the breeding of the dengue larvae.
“Dengue cases have increased due to more than normal rains during the current season,” he added.
Health experts and social circles attributed the massive increase in dengue positive cases to the failure of the civic bodies especially the cantonment boards and municipal committee to identify the hotspots and carry out larvicide sprinkling in the high risk areas. 
It has been learnt that no fogging and indoor residual spraying was carried out in the high risk areas as per protocol.
“No anti-dengue measures including timely fogging were taken during the breeding season even at high risk areas from where in the past dengue positive cases were reported,” said Munazza Perzada, the president of a local NGO.
“Officials of the health department and administration are holding meetings but have failed to adopt a strategy as fake activities by the anti-dengue teams were also detected during a third-party audit of these teams,” said Malik Aftab Hussain, vice president of another NGO.
Malik Saeed Siddiqui, a social worker, said contrary to the past no anti-dengue activity or fogging was conducted and focus was being made only on sealing junkyards and imposing fines on trye shops.
He was of the view that the first priority of the health department should be to eliminate unnecessary water reservoirs besides carrying out sprinkling of larvicide on all of them.
A senior health official said the local administration had failed to launch an anti-dengue campaign between February and August and as a result there had been an increase in the number of dengue cases in September. 
He said it was high time civic bodies, especially the municipal committee and the cantonment boards, conducted spraying and fogging on a daily basis to control the increasing number of patients.
“As per international health organisations’ data, the disease of dengue is a threat to nearly half of the world’s population while around 220 million people get infected each year with about two 
million of them, mostly children in Latin America and Asia, develop its severe form called dengue hemorrhagic fever,” said Dr Asad Ali, president of the local chapter of Pakistan Academy of Family Physicians.
He said that there was no specific treatment for the disease though its early detection can help in the treatment.

2,Police councils established to empower female officers,The councils will work for the welfare and professional capacity building of female police officers.,"ISLAMABAD: Female police councils in all provinces of the country have been established in order to create a more inclusive working environment for women in the police force by training them so they are given equal opportunities like male officers.
This declaration was issued at the end of the three-day National Fellowship for Women Police Council 2022 conference in Islamabad. The conference was organised by the Parliamentary Commission for Human Rights and Police Awam Sath Sath in Bhurban.
The purpose of the three-day programme was to train members of police councils nominated by the department and to prepare the annual plan of the councils. The councils will work for the welfare and professional capacity building of female police officers, and the supply of equal resources and opportunities along with proactive efforts for the maximum induction of women in police.
Inspector General of Police Punjab Faisal Shahkar said he wished that female police officials would get promotions and their inclusion should be mandatory in policy making.
Aamir Zulfiqar of the Anti-Narcotics Force said that women had been facing drastic issues while performing their professional responsibilities in the police force. He said change would be visible in the performance of female officers once their issues are addressed. IGP Azad Jammu and Kashmir Amir Ahmed Sheikh said that it was the need of the hour to establish these councils. Furthermore, he said, women are half of the country’s population and without figuring out their issues the country would not be able to progress.
Senior PTI leader Riaz Fatyana said it is the requirement of the contemporary scenario to rethink things for effective management and persistent reliability. In the past, many initiatives were shelved.
Another speaker, Mohammad Shafique Chaudhary said that senior police officials and representatives of the civil society contributed tremendously towards the establishment of these councils. He stressed that crime rate would decrease and proper investigation report of women centric cases would be logged before the judiciary after this initiative.
Dr Adnan Rafique said that the speed of change is slow but we are going in the right direction and establishment of these police councils is the first step towards it. In addition to this, he said that recommendations will also be taken for further progress.
Senior leader of the PML-N Shaista Pervez Malik said that the impression that women are providing their services in the police department under compulsion must be dissolved.  Kashmala Khan, federal ombudsman for protection against harassment, advised participants that women should not remain silent about any kind of injustice because times have changed now and women must fight for their own rights bravely.
Addressing participants of the conference, former judge of Lahore High Court Justice Nasira Javed Malik appreciated establishment of the councils and expressed hope that through these councils will help in resolving complex problems of women in the country.
Director General Legal and Justice Authority Dr Rahim Awan said that women have set examples of being great governors in the history of both Islam and the subcontinent. Our police officers should also be aware of their constitutional and legal rights which will help in empowering them, he said, adding after establishment of the councils, female citizens coming to police stations during investigation will feel safe.

8,Concern voiced over use of inappropriate words for differently-abled persons,ISLAMABAD: Use of derogatory remarks and language for differently-abled people on social media has been continuously...,"ISLAMABAD: Use of derogatory remarks and language for differently-abled people on social media has been continuously increasing and hurting their sentiments.
Belittling words like “blind”, “deaf”, “crippled and handicapped” not only hurt the feelings of persons living with disabilities but also damage their inherent dignity.
These observations were made by Potohar Mental Health Association (PMHA), a non-governmental organisation. The association has expressed concern over the rise in derogatory language for persons living with disabilities and strongly condemned its usage on various media platforms.
Instead of bringing positive change into the lives of persons living with disabilities, they are objectified by being called different names. The most labels are used to settle scores, a statement issued by PMHA stated.
Farah Zulqurnain, project director (PMHA) said persons living with disabilities face several challenges in their lives due to theologies and stereotypes.
“The community of persons living with disabilities is already marginalised, barren of their rights and prospects. Use of derogatory language is a reflection of victimisation of persons living with disabilities which not only increase their marginalisation but also aggravates their social and economic exclusion,” she said.
“Belittling words like blind, deaf, crippled and handicap not only hurt the feelings of persons living with disabilities but also damage their inherent dignity,” she said.
“Persons living with disabilities do not have enough space to express their views about how they should be represented in electronic, print and social media; they are not objects of shame nor are they superheroes of a fantasy world. First and foremost, they should be treated as human beings,” she said.
In 2018, Lahore High Court (LHC) had expelled the practice of politically incorrect language like blind (andha), hearing impaired (goongha / behra) and physically impaired (langra) in official matters and directed the government to make essential modifications in the Disabled Persons (Employment and Rehabilitation) Ordinance of 1981; the decision emphasised the use of “person-centered language”.
Furthermore, it had also been recognised that “discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of a person”.
“The honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan had issued directions to federal government and the provincial governments, to stop using the derogatory words such as ‘disabled’, ‘physically handicapped’ and ‘mentally retarded’ in all official correspondence, directives, notifications and circulars. Phrases like ‘persons with disabilities’ or ‘persons with different abilities’ must be adopted instead.
“Person-centered approach should be acquired. This monumental decision is welcomed by the civil society at large and persons living with disabilities in particular,” she said.
Print, electronic and social media platforms can play a vital role in educating mindfulness, defying humiliation and misrepresentation. It can be an influential source to transform the societal misinterpretations, she said, adding: “Capacity building programmes, disability sensitisation trainings, seminars should be initiated and encouraged that could disintegrate disagreeable labels and uphold the civil liberties and self-respect of persons living with disabilities,” she said.
Talking to Dawn, she said that recently a prominent personality in a tweet, while criticising an opponent, stated that “When the blind lead the blind, this happens”.
“I do not want to go in any controversy by mentioning the name of the personality but I appeal to masses to avoid using such statements,” she said.

The show is called Void.
Fundamentally transformative, his pieces manage to merge the tactile and fluid aspect of sculpture with the reflective and powerful density of metal. “The work is vibrant and has to be seen in person,” said the organisers.
“My work revolves around the pragmatic reformation of a selected material. I use different techniques to explore my observations,” the artist said on the opening day of the show.
Executed on stainless steel, the works are untitled, he said, adding that the forms he encountered through these experiments gave small details and textures that, when enlarged in scale and size, illuminated the behaviour of the material, which wasotherwise concealed.
Nawaz, born in 1989, is a Lahore-based visual artist who completed his Bachelors in Fine Arts (BFA) from National College of Arts (NCA) in 2014, where he was also appointed as an instructor.
Along with teaching at NCA, Nawaz has participated in various exhibitions and residencies all over Pakistan. His practice revolves around unnoticed mundane materials and their interaction with the artist’s studio, where every material was observed, reshaped or reformed. The show will go on till Sept 15.

“In order to prove their sincerity towards protecting themselves against the climate change risks, people will have to adopt a sustainable environment-friendly lifestyle and protect their natural water resources and arable lands. 
If the improvement of environment is not among the foremost priorities of a state or society, its members should then brace themselves for the worst consequences,” he said on Saturday.
“It’s imperative upon every concerned and conscientious member of society to join hands with each other to reduce pollution and protect natural environment,” he added.
The AJK premier was of the view that human race was at the most critical juncture of its history due to global warming.
Over the past several decades, the willful acts of ruthless deforestation, indiscriminate dumping of solid waste into the water bodies, obstruction of the paths of water channels as well as the race to raise illegal constructions had inflicted the worst ever losses on the environment, including depletion of water sources, he said.
Referring to former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Billion Tree Tsunami Project, he said it was a revolutionary undertaking which had been hailed across the world.
“The prevailing situation warrants for an urgent and sustained focus on as much as possible plantation of trees, prevention of illegal constructions and recycling of solid waste to ensure a better living for our future generations,” he said.
The AJK premier made it clear that his government would not allow at any cost any construction in violation of building codes.
The government was also contemplating adopting a comprehensive policy after examining the factors behind deterioration of natural environment, he said.
He asserted that during his rule AJK would undergo a promising change.
