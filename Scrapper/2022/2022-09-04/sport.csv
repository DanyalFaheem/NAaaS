Dortmund won their fourth game of five  this season and their third 1-0 victory of the campaign.
The Ruhr valley club, who host Copenhagen in their Champions League group opener on Tuesday, bagged the three points when Reus opened the scoring after 16 minutes, thumping in a ball slid in by  English teenager Jamie Bynoe-Gittens after some creative work from the  impressive Julian Brandt.
The goal was Reus’ 146th Bundesliga strike in 345 games — and the 60th time he has put his team up 1-0
Dortmund are top on 12 points, two points clear of second-placed champions Bayern Munich. Hoffenheim are fifth with nine.
Dortmund failed to add another goal in a dominant first half and had to survive a wobbly start in the second with Hoffenheim playing with more energy and committing more men forward.
Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann denied the hosts another goal in the 67th with a double save, first stopping substitute Thorgan Hazard’s effort and then blocking Anthony Modeste’s rebound shot.
There was some bad news for Dortmund with teenager Jamie Bynoe-Gittens dislocating his shoulder just before halftime.
“It was an unfortunate incident that did not seem so serious but the shoulder popped out. We hope he comes back quickly,” Terzic said.
Dortmund are already without midfielder Mo Dahoud, who will require surgery for his own shoulder injury and will be sidelined for months.

1,September Cup two-horse contest at KRC today,KARACHI: The September Cup seems to be a two-horse race between chestnut horse Thunder Star and bay horse Kuwait...,"KARACHI: The September Cup seems to be a two-horse race between chestnut horse Thunder Star and bay horse Kuwait Edition when it takes place in the Gymkhana race meeting here at the Karachi Racecourse on Sunday.
Thoroughbred Thunder Star had prevailed over Kuwait Edition convincingly by four lengths in the last outing and on present form he looks fancied to stretch his unbeaten run. However, if on job, Kuwait Edition may pull off an upset.
The September Cup which features prominently in a healthy six-race card, is also the day’s feature event under top scale order I and will be contested over five furlongs. It has a small field of four horses and is the day’s fourth race.
The other two horses who are in contention in the cup race are filly Spirit and chestnut horse Violent Romeo.
Either of the two – bay horse Fabulous and chestnut horse Marvellous – who belong to same connection, look poised to dominate the fifth race classified under scale order IV and V which will go over four-and-a-half furlongs. The race has eight aspirants.
Mares New Market and Balochistan Queen look a better choice for the second and third places on board.
Gelding Thunder Smile is on course to make it two on the trot and should he repeat his winning feat in the sixth and concluding race to be run over four-and-a-half furlongs. The race which is classified under scale order II and III, is the supporting event.
Thunder Smile is expected to be chased by bay horse Geo Jalal. However, the pair of horses namely fillies Queen of Spades and Regardless who belong to the same connection, may create quite a stir. Both will make their appearance after a long layoff.
With a win under his belt, bay horse Hi Alert looks smart to dominate the opening race under scale order VIII to be run over four furlongs.
Mare Sana Again may occupy second place on board among seven horses.
Chestnut horse Faster Than You is likely to prevail over a strong field of 11 opponents and pick up spoils in the second race under scale order VI and VII to be run over four furlongs.
Faster Than You could not make it to the last race after being scratched in the morning declaration.
He may be followed by bay horse Epsom and mare Janan. Mare Heer, if backed by connection, can upset the applecart.
Trio of horses — Stella, Take Care and Daffodles Wave — are tipped to grab the top three places on board respectively in the third race under scale order V and VI that will take place over four furlongs.
Filly Trouble Princess has the ability to overcome the trio. The race has a field of 12 horses.
Altogether, a good number of 49 horses including three debutants — Sherzadi, Come on Champion and Silent Response — will make their presence felt barring last-minute withdrawal(s), if any.
The first race starts at 2:30pm.

2,Duplantis given ‘wake-up call’ as Obiena steals pole vault win,BRUSSELS: Armand ‘Mondo’ Duplantis vowed that any danger of becoming complacent would be shelved after he...,"BRUSSELS: Armand ‘Mondo’ Duplantis vowed that any danger of becoming complacent would be shelved after he suffered a rare defeat at Friday’s Diamond League meet in Brussels.
Duplantis failed three times at 5.91 metres, falling to the mat on the third botched effort with a gaping mouth in stunned disbelief.
Ernest John Obiena of the Philippines passed at the same height on the third time of asking, which left the Filipino also shaking his head in disbelief, so dominant has Duplantis been in his event.
It was the first defeat of a sparkling season that has seen the 22-year-old US-born Swede win 17 competitions, 14 achieved with vaults over the six-metre barrier.
Those victories have seen Duplantis seal world indoor gold in Belgrade in March and world outdoor honours in Oregon in July. Both were achieved with world record vaults, of 6.20 and 6.21m respectively.
“I did a lot of things poorly technically,” said Duplantis, a meticulous perfectionist in a notoriously technically-testing discipline that needs mastery of the runway approach, proper handling of the pole and complete confidence in the exacting projection upwards and over the bar.
“It’s rare for me to jump the way I did. Maybe I needed a bit of a wake-up call. I’ve got to come back next year and do something more special for the people that came out.”Duplantis said he would aim to improve by the time of next week’s Diamond League finals in Zurich.
“In Zurich I’ll try to come back a little stronger than here. I want to put up another good performance at the end of the year and end on a high.” For very many meets, Duplantis has completely dominated his competition.
Waiting patiently to enter at a height that has normally seen a couple of rivals already out, the Swede makes sure of the victory and then goes to plus-6m before deciding whether to have another tilt at the world record.
Asian champion Obiena, a bronze medallist at the Eugene worlds, has a personal best of 5.94m, which he vaulted in Oregon.
That height put the Filipino third on this season’s world outdoor list, behind Duplantis and American Chris Nilsen, who went clear at 6m dead in May.
And Obiena made the most of his opportunity as Duplantis failed in his three attempts.
“It took a lot of luck, a good day and some excellent calls to beat Mondo today,” said Obiena.
“Its always my goal to win, but I definitely have the magic number of 6m on my mind. That’s what I’m training for and I really think that I’m capable of jumping that height.
“It’s only a matter of time and some good circumstances.” Nilsen finished third and was not happy.
“Third with 5.71m is all I can say. No one produced any good marks today except Ernest John with a first Diamond League win,” he said.
“Everyone is a little tired with the end of the season. I am ready to go to the Diamond League Final. In Zurich the goal is a top three and 5.90m.
“If I make this I will shoot for 6m. I maybe need to do some speedwork because I felt kind of sluggish today.”

The  LRC administrators released to Dawn a detailed 16-slab prize-money  package showing a marked increase over the existing package which will  come into effect from Sept 4 (today).
Welcoming the LRC decision, owners reckoned though it would not completely nullify the price-hike of food grains and animal feeds, yet would suffice their needs to some extent to enable them to keep the wheel of  racing sailing, which is a source of bread earning  for thousands of  people.According to the revised package,  horses in class five division I and II occupying the first three  positions will receive Rs345,600, Rs115,200 and Rs57, 668  respectively plus Rs16,000 will go to the winner as feeding subsidy.
The same for class V division III for the first three positions will be Rs331,200, Rs110,400 and Rs55,200, respectively while Rs16,000 will be the  feeding subsidy.
Prize money for class VI (all divisions) shows a  slight downward variation in amounts of rupees few thousands, as  reserved for horses occupying the first three positions. However, they will  receive Rs16,000 as feeding subsidy.
Prize money for the  thoroughbred two-year-olds racing has been set at Rs259,200 for winner, Rs86,000 for second position and Rs43,000 for third place.
Horses in class VII division I, II, III  and IV have been placed equally in the receipt of prize money and will  now get Rs132,000 (winner), while Rs44,000 and Rs22,000 will be awarded to the second-  and third-placed horses. They will receive Rs5,000 as feeding subsidy.
Class VII division IV and V horses will receive Rs120,000 (winner), Rs40,000 (second place) and Rs20,000 (third place) with Rs5,000 feeding subsidy for the winner.

The meeting is being held as the nation observes the Defence of Pakistan Day to pay tributes to the September 1965 war heroes who laid down their lives in the defence of the motherland.
Some magnificent arrays of thoroughbreds in turf action will be demonstrating the country’s thoroughbred breeding in practical evidence to the delight of a bumper crowd of equine sports connoisseurs.
The war heroes to be honoured, all recipients of Nishan-i-Haider, include Lance Naik Mohammad Mahfooz Shaheed, Major Tufail Mohammad Shaheed, Havaldar Lalak Jan Shaheed,  Major Shabbir Sharif Shaheed, Pilot Officer Rashid Minhas Shaheed, Major Mohammad Akram Shaheed, Sawar Mohammad Hussain Shaheed and Major Raja Aziz Bhatti Shaheed.

7,Verstappen delights home crowd with pole in Dutch Grand Prix,ZANDVOORT: Red Bull’s Max Verstappen fired up his fans by seizing pole position at his home Dutch Formula One ...,"ZANDVOORT: Red Bull’s Max Verstappen fired up his fans by seizing pole position at his home Dutch Formula One Grand Prix for the second year in a row with a storming final effort here on Saturday.
Red Bull’s runaway championship leader was joined on the front row by Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc after qualifying at Zandvoort ended with Verstappen’s Mexican team mate Sergio Perez crashing at the final corner.
The accident prevented seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton making a last-gasp bid for pole in his Mercedes, and the Briton ended up in fourth place with Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz in third.
The pole was Verstappen’s fourth of the season and first since Austria in July, while the margin of 0.021 between the top two drivers made it the tightest qualifying battle of the season so far.
“Unbelievable,” said the 24-year-old, who had struggled in Friday practice, as the jubilant crowd celebrated in the grandstands.
“Especially after yesterday as well. We had a difficult day but we worked really well overnight with the whole team to turn it around.
“Today we had a quick race car again but it was very close. A lap around here, a qualifying lap, is insane.”
Leclerc, a massive 98 points behind Verstappen after 14 of 22 races, was fastest after the first flying laps of the third session, with Verstappen 0.059 slower and Hamilton third quickest.
The Ferrari driver went faster again with his second effort, a one minute 10.363, but Verstappen then put in a clinching 1:10.342 before Perez ended the session.
The Mexican -- 93 points behind Verstappen and second overall -- will start fifth with Mercedes’ George Russell sixth and Lando Norris seventh for McLaren.
Mick Schumacher, his future uncertain beyond 2022, bagged eighth place on the grid for Haas.
Yuki Tsunoda was ninth for AlphaTauri and Canadian Lance Stroll completed the top 10, although the Aston Martin driver was unable to take part in the final session due to a technical problem.
The second phase of qualifying at the seaside circuit was briefly halted after an orange flare was thrown onto the track, with the governing FIA saying the person responsible had been identified and removed by security.
Williams’ Alex Albon was the sole driver on track at the time and he sounded more vexed by the local wildlife, reporting a ‘tonne of pigeons’ pecking at the edge of the track at the final corner.
Another thrown flare was caught by television cameras at the start of the third and final phase, but it ended up in the grass by the side of the track.

8,Pakistan look to stay ‘brave and calm’ in another India clash,Fans from both countries anticipate a third meeting in next week’s final.,"DUBAI: Pakistan’s wicket-keeper Moha­mmad Rizwan says his side are striving to stay  “brave and calm” for their second clash with India as the arch-rivals prepare for their next T20 Asia Cup showdown here at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.
Babar Azam’s team crushed Hong Kong by 155 runs on Friday to seal their spot in the final four of the tournament, an entree to the T20 World Cup in October-November.
Afghanistan were playing Sri Lanka in the first Super Four stage match on Saturday in Sharjah, but it’s the much-awaited India-Pakistan battle that is expected to pack the Dubai stadium a day later.
“Playing India is always a pressure game. The whole world, even beyond Asia, wait for it,” Rizwan, who hit an unbeaten 78 against Hong Kong, told reporters on Friday.
“The pressure will be equally on India and us, but the result will be with whoever remains brave and keeps calm,” added the wicket-keeper-batsman.
Pakistan posted 193-2 and skittled out Hong Kong for a paltry 38 in Sharjah to bounce back from their opening loss to India, who won both their matches in Group A.
“I tell players, whether you play India or Hong Kong, it’s a game of bat and ball,” said Rizwan, 30.
“So keep it simple. Yes, it’s a big game and our confidence is high but only hard work is in our hands, as the result is from God.”
Every India-Pakistan match draws packed stadiums and millions of viewers on TV and digital platforms.
The two rival nations only play each other in multi-nation events thanks to years of political tensions that have occasionally erupted into war.
Fans from both countries anticipate a third meeting in next week’s final.
“We have to play good cricket and make the final,” said Rizwan. “Our fans demand that we give our best and it is visible this time that the boys are giving it their all.”
Pakistan, over the last week, have grappled the conditions well in the UAE and the team has improved performance on every front after their outing against Hong Kong. Be it batting, bowling or fielding, the Pakistan players have shown distinct improvement. Though there is hardly anything to separate them on the UAE pitches but Pakistan seem to be more motivated to beat the archrivals India.
What is encouraging for Pakistan is the fact that they posted the highest total of the ongoing T20 Asia Cup so far and maintained the highest run-rate (3.811) at the group stage despite finishing second in Group B.
Pakistan fast bowlers especially Nassem Shah has created a ripple through stellar performances in the game’s shortest format after making debut in the India game while the spin duo of Mohammad Nawaz and Shadab Khan have given match winning performances. 
For India, all-rounder Hardik Pandaya, the chief destroyer in the previous encounter against Pakistan, will  return to the side after sitting on the bench during match  against Hong Kong. 
Rizwan and skipper Babar played a starring role in their team’s  10-wicket win over India in last year’s T20 World Cup -- a match that is  still talked about on both sides.
DAHANI TO MISS TODAY’S GAME
Meanwhile, Pakistan suffered a new Asia  Cup blow with fast bowler Shahnawaz Dahani ruled out of the India  clash due to a suspected side strain.
Dahani  is the third Pakistan quick to be forced out with injury after Shaheen  Shah Afridi and Mohammad Wasim left the team ahead of the six-nation  tournament in the United Arab Emirates.
The team said Dahani’s injury  “happened while bowling in the match against Hong Kong in Sharjah on Friday”.
“As  in the case with any suspected side strain injury, the medical team  will monitor him for the next 48-72 hours, following which they will  make decisions, including carrying out a scan and further participation  in the tournament,” read a team statement.
But it is feared that  Dahani will have to sit out the rest of the matches, with Hasan Ali, who  made the team in place of Wasim, his likely replacement in the XI.
Afghanistan and Sri Lanka are the other two teams in the Super Four from Group B after Bangladesh bowed out.

9,US Open dream over as legendary Serena bows out,"""It’s been the most incredible ride and journey I’ve ever been on, I mean, in my life,"" she says.","NEW YORK: Serena Williams bowed out of the US Open and headed into retirement on Friday after a battling loss to Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic while world number one Daniil Medvedev crushed the giant-killing dreams of Chinese youngster Wu Yibing with an emphatic victory.
On another night of searing emotion in the Billie Jean King Tennis Center’s main Arthur Ashe Stadium, 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena finally met her match in Tomljanovic, losing 7-5, 6-7 (4-7) 6-1 in an attritional slug-fest lasting more than three hours.
The defeat was almost certainly Serena’s last ever appearance in Grand Slam singles event, the final act of a 27-year professional career that saw the 40-year-old American become a sporting and cultural icon who many believe is the greatest women’s tennis player in history.
“It’s been a fun ride,” a clearly emotional Serena said in an on-court interview following her loss.
“It’s been the most incredible ride and journey I’ve ever been on, I mean, in my life.
“I’m just so grateful to every single person that’s ever said, ‘Go, Serena,’ in their life. You got me here.”
Although Serena has not definitively announced her retirement, she said in a Vogue magazine essay last month that she would  “evolve” away from tennis after the US Open.
Serena said on Friday that she was excited by the prospect of her life after tennis.
“I’m ready to, like, be a mom, explore a different version of Serena,” she said.
“Technically in the world I’m still super young, so I want to have a little bit of a life while I’m still walking.”
Golf superstar Tiger Woods and former US first lady Michelle Obama were among a legion of admirers who paid tribute to Serena following her US Open exit.
“@serenawilliams you’re literally the greatest on and off the court,” tweeted Woods. “Thank you for inspiring all of us to pursue our dreams.”
Obama meanwhile saluted Serena’s rise from the gritty Los Angeles neighbourhood of Compton to the pinnacle of her sport.
“Congrats on amazing career, @SerenaWilliams! How lucky were we to be able to watch a young girl from Compton grow up to become one of the greatest athletes of all time,” tweeted Obama.
In other matches, Tunisia’s fifth-seeded Ons Jabeur made it to the fourth round at the 10th attempt with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory over 31st seed Shelby Rogers.
“I know that I don’t play the best on hard courts, but it’s always amazing to see how I’m improving, how I’m pushing my limits,” Jabeur said.
Jabeur will face 18th seed Veronika Kudermetova in the last 16. The Russian blew past Hungary’s Dalma Galfi 6-2, 6-0.
US teenager Coco Gauff meanwhile reached the last 16 with a 6-2, 6-3 defeat of compatriot Madison Keys.
In the men’s draw, defending champion Medvedev ended the run of China’s Wu to set-up a blockbuster last-16 clash against Nick Kyrgios.
Medvedev eased past world number 174 Wu, who came through qualifying, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2.
Medvedev, who won his maiden Grand Slam title in New York last year, is delighted with his form as he approaches the business end of the tournament.
“If you ask me what I could improve, I don’t see many things,” he said. “Maybe a little bit less double-faults, but that’s if we’re trying to dig somewhere.
“If I continue this way, I have good opportunities to do something big.” Wimbledon runner-up Kyrgios made the fourth round for the first time by seeing off America’s J.J. Wolf 6-4, 6-2, 6-3.
Kyrgios says he is relishing the opportunity of playing on the big stage against Medvedev.
“Win or lose, I’m proud of how far I’ve come,” he said.  “I’ve worked hard to be in the fourth round. I want to be there. I think that’s where every tennis player wants to be, playing the best players in the world in the best stadiums in the world, getting paid well. I’m looking forward to it.”

TOWNSVILLE: Zimbabwe stunned a nearly full-strength Australia by three wickets on Saturday to claim a historic victory in the third One-day International here at the Riverway Stadium.
After leg-spinner Ryan Burl (5-10) played a starring role in dismissing the hosts for a lowly 141, Zimbabwe overcame a wobbly chase to beat the cricket powerhouse for the first time in Australia when they hauled in the target in the 39th over, triggering scenes of celebration.
It was a consolation victory for Zimbabwe to conclude the three-match series.
Zimbabwe skipper Regis Chakabva, who top-scored with a composed 37 not out.
The tourists started the chase impressively, with Takudzwanashe Kaitano and Tadiwanashe Marumani posting a 38-run opening stand.
But Australia quick Josh Hazlewood turned the game on its head with the wicket of Kaitano (19) in the ninth over, and soon after dismissed Wessly Madhevere and Sean Williams on consecutive deliveries.
A nervous Zimbabwe, seeking just their third victory against Australia from 32 ODIs, batted defensively and slumped to 77-5 after Murumani (35) fell to towering all-rounder Cameron Green.
Chakabva calmed the nerves and was joined by an inspired Burl, who hit a six off player-of-the-series Adam Zampa to get Zimbabwe within sight of a famous victory.
He fell with five runs needed but there was no late twist.
In their first series in Australia since 2004, Zimbabwe struggled to be competitive in the opening two matches at the same venue and were routed for just 96 on Wednesday.

11,Serena’s likely retirement heralds sunset of sport’s golden era,Serena could be the first in a series of ageing greats to call time on their playing careers in the near future.,"NEW YORK: The likely end of Serena Williams’ tennis career has left the game staring at the beginning of the end of the sport’s golden era, a dreaded prospect that has long been on the horizon.
The American, who will turn 41 this month, bid an emotional goodbye to the US Open with a third-round loss to Australian Ajla Tomljanovic on Friday, in what may have been the last singles match of her glittering career.
Although Serena left the door slightly open on an unlikely comeback, her apparent departure - not unexpected, given Serena’s struggles with form and injury in the past 12 months -- would have sent shivers down the spines of tennis administrators and organisers.
“She’s box office,” former British number one Greg Rusedski summed it up on Sky Sports after Serena informed the world of her decision last month in a Vogue article.
“She’s carried women’s tennis for the last two decades with her sister Venus as well. You’ve obviously had other great players around them, but she brings your non-tennis fan to the sport.
“If you know absolutely nothing about tennis, you know the name Serena Williams. She’s iconic and we’re losing an icon of our sport and she will be truly, truly missed.”
But it will not just be a loss for women’s tennis. Serena could be the first in a series of ageing greats to call time on their playing careers in the near future.
Like Serena, the triumvirate of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic have dominated tennis for the last two decades and revolutionised the sport, drawing in new and old fans and a long line of sponsors.
All of them continue to lure fans to the stands, mobile and television screens even after two decades on the tour, while their commercial pull still mesmerizes brands and advertisers.
Injuries to Serena, Federer and Nadal in recent years have raised the question of their retirement time and again. Fans and pundits have wondered how the sport would cope with the prospect of losing their most marketable athletes.
Federer, 41, has had multiple knee surgeries in the last two years and has not played a competitive match since going down in the quarter-finals of last year’s Wimbledon.
The 20-time major winner has only committed to playing the Laver Cup this month and his hometown tournament in Basel in October. It remains unclear if the father of four would be ready to commit to the rigours of the tour again.
At 36, Nadal is a bit younger, but a chronic foot issue forced the Spaniard to contemplate retirement in 2021 and again this year after he won a men’s record 22nd major title at the French Open, playing with numbing injections before each match in Paris.
A radio frequency treatment eased pain in his foot and allowed him to play Wimbledon, but the left-hander does not know whether the injury will flare up again.
The 35-year-old Djokovic is the youngest among the lot, undoubtedly the fittest and appears to be the best bet to keep the flag flying for tennis’ older generation.
The Serbian won his 21st major title at Wimbledon last month and has made it clear he does not lack motivation in chasing more silverware.
While the so-called Big Three of the men’s game have continued to stave off the younger generation when it comes to major success, Serena’s tennis career has been less productive in the past couple of years.
Her last Grand Slam triumph came in 2017 and she did not win a WTA title since lifting the ASB Classic in Auckland at the start of the 2020 season.
Despite all that, Serena remained the biggest draw in women’s tennis whenever she took the court.
“She’s an inspiration for a lot of people around the world. She gave a lot to tennis, so we are lucky to have had such a great ambassador like Serena for such a long time,” Nadal said after Williams’s defeat on Friday.
“She deserves to choose whatever fits for her at this stage of her life.”

12,"Havertz seals controversial Chelsea win, Pickford denies Liverpool",Thomas Tuchel’s side remain unconvincing but they are up to fifth place after their third win in six games.,"LONDON: Kai Havertz scored the late winner as big-spending Chelsea fought back for a controversial 2-1 win against West Ham United, while Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp praised Everton keeper Jordan Pickford’s  “spectacular” display in Saturday’s goalless Merseyside derby.
Having embarked on a 250 million ($280 million) spending spree in the summer transfer window, Chelsea are expected to deliver on their new owners’ eye-watering investment.
The early returns had been mixed as Chelsea crashed to defeats against Leeds and Southampton.
So when Michail Antonio gave West Ham a shock 62nd minute lead with a close-range finish, the critics were sharpening their knives at Stamford Bridge.
But Ben Chilwell equalised in the 76th minute, just three minutes after the England left-back replaced Marc Cucurella.
Chilwell headed Thiago Silva’s lofted ball past his marker, spun around and poked his shot through Lukasz Fabianski’s legs from a tight angle.
Kai Havertz cleverly finished off Chilwell’s cross to complete Chelsea’s escape in the 88th minute of a thrilling finale.
There was still more drama as Maxwel Cornet appeared to equalise in stoppage-time, only for the goal to be controversially disallowed by VAR for Jarrod Bowen’s foul on Mendy.
Thomas Tuchel’s side remain unconvincing but they are up to fifth place after their third win in six games, while West Ham boss David Moyes was livid with the officials for denying his team a point.
At Goodison Park, there was more VAR intrigue as Conor Coady thought he had put Everton ahead with a close-range finish from Neal Maupay’s shot in the second half.
But Coady’s goal was correctly disallowed for offside after a VAR check.
There could easily have been goals aplenty but for a man of the match display from Pickford and some fine stops from his Liverpool counterpart Alisson Becker.
Everton are now without a victory in their first six games this term, while Liverpool’s momentum was checked after winning their previous two matches.
KANE REACHES MILESTONE
Unbeaten Tottenham made it four wins from six games with a 2-1 victory against Fulham in north London.
Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg broke the deadlock for Tottenham in the 40th minute, sweeping home from Richarlison’s pass.
Harry Kane increased Tottenham’s lead in the 74th minute from Ryan Sessegnon’s cross to become the third highest goal-scorer in the Premier League history, with 188 goals taking him past Andy Cole.
Only Alan Shearer (260) and Wayne Rooney (208) are now above Kane in the scoring chart.
Kane’s goal also moved him level with Thierry Henry’s tally of 43 in Premier League London derbies.
Fulham’s Aleksandar Mitrovic curled home in the 82nd minute, but Tottenham held firm.
Managerless Bournemouth came back from two goals down to win 3-2 in a thriller at Nottingham Forest.
The Cherries looked on course for another thrashing as Forest led at the break through Cheikhou Kouyate’s header and Brennan Johnson’s penalty.
But Philip Billing’s long-range blast and Dominic Solanke’s acrobatic effort drew them level before Jaidon Anthony sealed the points in the 87th minute.
Ivan Toney scored a hat-trick as Brentford beat Leeds 5-2 at the Community Stadium.
Daniel Podence scored as Wolves beat Southampton 1-0 at Molineux for their first league victory this season.
Podence’s simple finish in first-half stoppage time lifted Bruno Lage’s side out of the relegation zone.
Newcastle striker Alexander Isak wasted the opportunity to mark his home debut with a goal as Crystal Palace drew 0-0 at St James’ Park.
The 60 million ($69 million) man, who scored in his first appearance at Liverpool in midweek, missed two good chances to leave Newcastle without a win since the opening day of the season.
