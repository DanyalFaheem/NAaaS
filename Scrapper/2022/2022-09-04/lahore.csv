Post-flood ailments in the trans-Indus districts are being reported. The situation has been exacerbated by a lack of coordination among the departments and mismanagement in providing relief to the shelterless. The delay in relief and rehabilitation has led to onset of health problems for the people, especially children and the elderly.  
Muhammad Asadullah Shahzad, the spokesperson for the secretary health south Punjab, said on Saturday 18,854 (10,201 in Rajanpur and 8,653 in DG Khan) people including children were suffering from diarrhoea and under treatment at medical camps. The number of patients, he said, was feared to rise.  
As many as 35,114 people were suffering from skin diseases while 20,064 people had complained of fever, he said. According to him, eye infections were spreading as 2,437 people were getting treatment in both Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur districts.  
“It is alarming that 42,958 flood-stricken people are suffering from respiratory diseases,” said the spokesperson.  
In all, according to official data, 86,685 people have visited the medical camps in south Punjab.  
Shahzad said there was enough stock of medicines at the camps meant for the ailing. He said the data compiled covered a period of a month and a half -- July 15 to Sept 2.  
As many as 570 cases of diarrhoea were reported in Rajanpur on Thursday.  
The affected people are also facing starvation and incidents of food snatching have taken place. 
A handout said a 20-member medical team of the Institute of Public Health (IPH) reached Dera Ghazi Khan to provide aid to the flood victims. The doctors would treat patients and help prevent outbreak of diseases.  
IPH Dean Prof Dr Zarfashan Tahir sent off the team comprising Assistant Professor Dr Mohsin Aftab, Dr Mursaleen Ali, Dr Mudassar Saleem, Dr Ali Raza (MPhil), Dr Obaidullah Qazi (molecular biologist) and lab technicians and assistants. The team, Dr Tahir said, had taken dry ration, flour, pulses, juices, biscuit packets, clothes and shoes to be distributed among the flood victims. These had been donated by employees of the institute, she added.  
The public health experts would also collect blood samples for diagnosis and knowing the trend of various epidemic diseases, she said, adding that the team had also taken medicines for fever, diarrhoea, infections, skin allergy and other diseases.

3,PML-N warns of disaster if parties fail to help the flood-hit,Sardar Awais Leghari chides Punjab government for not playing its role in helping flood victims.,"LAHORE: The PML-N fears if all the political parties fail to help out the flood victims, Pakistan will be at the brink of disaster in the coming few years.  
Speaking at a press conference here on Saturday, PML-N Punjab secretary general and PM’s assistant Sardar Awais Leghari said there was no wheat production in Sindh and it was likely that people of the flood-hit areas might lose their lives because of starvation. He said two districts of south Punjab had been destroyed completely while over 100,000 houses in DG Khan and Rajanpur districts had been wiped out by the flood.  
Mr Leghari drew the attention of the government towards the challenge of provision of aid to the flood victims.  
“A number of non-affected persons have reached to the flood-hit areas, making it difficult for the government and other bodies to give aid to the deserving ones,” he said and chided the Punjab government for not playing its role in this regard.  
There was need to give relief to the farmers, he stressed.  
Leghari lamented that Chief Minister Parvez Elahi visited the south Punjab during flood only for a few hours. He also criticised PTI chairman Imran Khan for holding rallies during the flood.  
“The PTI is demanding fresh election while hospitals and schools have been washed by the flood in many districts. Where will the election will be held?” he asked.  
The PML-N leader further said it’s the time that everyone should think of Pakistan. “The PMLN-led government has taken all decisions for Pakistan and never cared about its politics,” he added.  
In a separate presser here PM’s assistant Attaullah Tarar also criticised PTI chief Imran Khan for holding public meetings during the flood. Saying that a rally cost from Rs200m to Rs250m, he chided Imran for having enough time for addressing rallies but not going to flood-hit areas.  
Mr Tarar said the report by International Monetary Fund (IMF) was a charge-sheet against Imran.  
PPP Punjab parliamentary leader Hasan Murtaza, in a statement, questioned Imran Khan’s claim to have collected Rs5bn for flood affectees in a telethon. He said this claim was not realistic.

5,Khursheed calls out ‘politician-bashers’,Says state organs must work within the purview of constitution...,"LAHORE: Federal Minister for Water Resources Syed Khursheed Ahmad Shah has criticised those, especially the media, for holding politicians responsible for the entire mess in the country.  
“My question to media anchors and analysts is that why do you make politicians, who have ruled the country for 35 years, accountable alone. If  you are doing our accountability, you must do same with those who ruled  for 40 years,” he deplored while speaking at a ceremony at the Lahore Chamber of  Commerce & Industry (LCCI) on Saturday.  
He also regretted wastage of water worth $10 billion to $15bn each year by a country seeking $2bn loan from the IMF. Mr Shah said no country could progress by ignoring the constitution and rule of law. But, he regretted, Pakistan was not being run as per the constitution. “These days, even court decisions are not being taken as per the constitution and law. This is really damaging to our country,” the minister lamented.  

Says state organs must work within the purview of constitution

He said all institutions, including parliament, judiciary and establishment, will have to play their role by doing their work within their domains. 
Talking about floods, he said there was forecast of 40 per cent more rain in Sindh and Balochistan and all arrangements were done in accordance with the prediction. “But there were rains 700pc more than the last year that caused great difficulties. In such a situation, what can the government do,” he questioned. Talking about the new small hydel power projects, he said his ministry had identified as many as 70 spots where 5 to 25MW hydropower projects can be launched and completed within a period of three years.
The minister informed the business community that the water capacity of Pakistan is 140 million acre feet but the storage capacity is only 13MAF. The infrastructure, according to him, is being built to increase the storage capacity by 14 to 15 MAF.  
Speaking on the occasion, LCCI President Mian Nauman Kabir said keeping in view the floods, more and more dams should be built without any further delay. “Look at Iran that is saving water by man-made lakes while we are wasting it to the sea,” he added.  
Earlier, the minister while speaking to the senior Wapda officials during his visit to Wapda House on Saturday, underlined the significance of constructing dams.  
Wapda Chairman retired Lt-Gen Sajjad Ghani apprised the federal minister of the grim water situation in Pakistan.  
He also informed the minister about adverse impact of the recent floods on the construction sites of Dasu Hydropower Project and Mohmand Dam.  
The chairman said every effort is being made to resume construction activities on these projects in the shortest possible time by devising an effective strategy.

Famous wrestlers of the country will participate in the event.  
Dangal is an old traditional sport that was popular among the masses. There were 600 ‘Akharas’ (arenas) in Lahore and the popularity of this game can be judged by this fact. Almost 20 years ago, this traditional wrestling vanished from old Lahore and moved to other places in Punjab.
According to the custom, a day before the competition the wrestlers were to be introduced and a procession taken out along with the beat of the drums.  
The WCLA is now reviving this popular sport and wrestling arenas.
In the matches to be held on Sunday, Malu wrestler will face Mohsin Mochi wrestler and Rustam Gujra, Heera Baloch wrestler against Umar wrestler, Goonga wrestler against Qazi Mehboob wrestler, Multan, Arshad Pathan will face Usman Tobewala. Mithu Pehlwan will fight against Wasim Gadhi. Apart from wrestling, there will be muscle boat competition and open boat contest.
WCLA Director General Kamran Lashari said the arenas are the landmark of old Lahore and the authority is paying full attention to this sport.
