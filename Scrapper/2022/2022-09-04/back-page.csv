0,Footprints: Displaced under open sky,The National Highway is witnessing heavy traffic with long queues of vehicles since closure of the N-55 stretch of Indus Highway.,"“Note my name, please. I didn’t get anything to feed my family,” Sahib Khatoon urged Dawn. Zahida Naich interjected to concur with her viewpoint. When asked about accounts of their ordeal, these flood-affected people were under the impression they were speaking to a government representative compiling data to provide them succor.
Some minors virtually demanded money. Haggard men waited for boats to take them to the water-sieged areas to provide food to their family members, who stayed back to protect their properties. According to a displaced woman, those operating the boats were themselves stealing. “They are trying to get anything they can lay their hands on,” she says.

These people, on a hot and humid Saturday, were being evacuated from Khairpur Nathan Shah, a city of Dadu in the north of Sindh around 200km from Hyderabad, ravaged by torrents from Balochistan and incessant rains.

For the past few days, the N-55 part of Indus Highway has remained cut-off from the rest of upper Sindh as well as Balochistan and Punjab provinces. This strip beyond the signboard of Goth Yusuf Naich remained virtually closed. Marooned men, women and children were being ferried to safer areas along with their goats.

Khairpur Nathan Shah is witnessing the same fate it did during the 2010 super floods.
Boats are being commercially run; their owners appear to be making an extra buck while “cashing in on” the miseries of the flood-hit population. Those who left the city even before the deluge hit ended up on the roadsides of Indus Highway along with their livestock and cattle so they could frequent their villages. Each person is charged Rs200 per trip and, according to another local, “if you book a whole boat you may have to pay Rs25,000”.

The dwellers feel that in view of the 2010 floods, the deluge in the city would take a considerable time to recede and once Manchhar Lake is offloaded into the river. They aren’t wrong, but the Indus is swollen and passing through the peak of a second high flood of over 0.5m cusecs.
“We are left to fend for ourselves,” screams a woman while beckoning me in Seraiki. A naked-eye observation shows the water could be around 10ft deep.

Volunteers of charity organisations were present in the city but felt handicapped in providing assistance to the marooned population — a major chunk of which has left, though several hundreds are still said to be staying behind for some reason. “It is difficult to enter the area with huge quantities of ration bags of 25kg each,” said Abdul Karim from a charity organisation.

Many locals moved towards Hyderabad and other districts after having been displaced by floodwaters, which submerged Khairpur Nathan Shah after breaching the Flood Protection Bund that otherwise protected the upper Sindh districts.

Amir Ali Jokhio, a resident, put the estimated trap­ped population at 50,000. People were staying in patches of dry land or elevated surfaces in villages. Electricity supply was affec­ted except for those with solar facilities.
The rescue operation in the area was, apparently, hit by a lack of coordination. “Rescuers need a coordinated effort, which seems missing,” Jokhio added. He believed local volunteers were there to guide officials in the affected area, but their services were not being utilized in the desired manner.

“We have rented a tent for Rs200 per day to shelter ourselves and our cattle. Animals need fodder which I bring from another area,” complained a young Moin Naich. “We were lucky we left our village Arzi Naich on time, but ended up on the road under the open sky,” he bemoaned.
Rangers personnel were there. So were navy officials with a couple of hovercrafts for evacuation. One official was overheard telling a resident, “Given its shape, a hovercraft cannot access narrow streets. But our smaller boats are rescuing people and we are trying to enter with hovercrafts from another location.”

The National Highway is witnessing heavy traffic with long queues of vehicles since closure of the N-55 stretch of the Indus Highway.
Back when he was the Sindh government’s planning and development adviser in 2010, economist Dr Kaiser Bengali had suggested solutions for facing disasters of such epic proportions. But to no avail.
“Torrents need to be channelized and trained horizontally. We had discussed Sindh’s left bank’s drainage issues as well in the Hakro river context [in lower Sindh]. Sadly, I feel after six months we will forget this flooding and its fallouts like we did in 2010,” he said disappointingly.

Sindh Provincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Salman Shah suggested: “Water is to be drained out. The irrigation department is pondering over how to dispose of it through its natural route. The Indus is already in heavy flood Sukkur downstream. Such huge quantum of water standing in KN Shah won’t evaporate, while people need relief.”

2,Huge python killed in AJK,Villagers take selfies with 15 foot-long reptile.,"

MUZAFFARABAD: A more than 15-foot-long Indian python was killed by villagers in a suburban area of Mirpur after it tried to swallow a goat, a wildlife official said on Saturday.
Mohammad Sajid, assistant director of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s (AJK) wildlife and fisheries department, told Dawn a man was grazing his flock along a water channel in the Chittar Parri area at about 5pm on Friday when he noticed that the python was trying to eat one of his goats.
The man, identified as Mohammad Faisal, immediately phoned fellow villagers, many of whom reached the site within 20 minutes, the official said. “In their attempt to free the goat from python’s grip, the villagers hit it with wooden rods, ultimately killing the reptile,” he said.
Some India pythons (P. molurus) regularly exceed 10 feet, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica. “Despite their large size, some of these species survive in urban and suburban areas, where their secretive habits and recognised value as rat catchers par excellence serve to protect them,” it says.

Villagers take selfies with over-15-foot-long reptile

Video clips posted on social media showed people gathered around the dead python, close to which was also lying a dead black goat.
In one video clip, villagers could be seen carrying the dead python on their shoulders towards a main road, where they took selfies with it.
Mr Sajid said officials came to know about the incident late on Friday after people posted videos on social media and shared them on WhatsApp groups.
By the times official reached the site, the villagers had already buried the reptile, he said, adding that one of his subordinates had prepared a detailed report into the incident on Saturday after visiting the area. A case would be registered under wildlife conservation laws, he said.
Mr Sajid said his department had consistently run campaigns for the conservation of pythons by urging villagers not to kill the non-venomous reptiles, and this was why the animal’s population had increased in Mirpur division, which comprises Bhimber, Mirpur and Kotli districts.
“Our guards have taken possession of at least seven pythons from different areas of Mirpur division in the past 12 months or so and subsequently released them into their natural habitat in Pir Galli area, some 30 kilometres on the outskirts of Mirpur towards Kotli,” he said.

5,"After grain deal, Turkiye offers to mediate in N-plant standoff","Erdogan says he wants to avoid ""another Chernobyl"".","KYIV: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has offered to mediate in the standoff over a Russian-occupied nuclear power station in war-torn Ukraine that has raised fears of an atomic disaster.
Alarm has grown in recent weeks over shelling hitting the area of Europe’s largest nuclear plant, Zaporizhzhia.
Erdogan on Saturday told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin “that Turkey can play a facilitator role in the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as they did in the grain deal,” the Turkish presidency said.
During their phone call on Saturday, Erdogan and Putin agreed to talk further in Samarkand on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit on September 15-16, the presidency said.

Erdogan says he wants to avoid ‘another Chernobyl’

However, there was no immediate mention of Erdogan having also spoken to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday to offer his mediation.
Ukraine on Friday claimed to have bombed a Russian base in the nearby town of Energodar, destroying three artillery systems as well as an ammunition depot. 
As Ukraine — one of the world’s largest grain exporters — was forced to halt almost all deliveries after Russia invaded in late February, raising fears of a global food crisis, Kyiv and Moscow in July inked a deal, with the United Nations and Turkey acting as guarantors, for resumption of exports of grain across Black Sea ports.
Last month, Erdogan warned of the danger of a nuclear disaster when he visited Lviv for talks with the Ukrainian leader. The Turkish leader said he wanted to avoid “another Chernobyl”, referring to the world’s worst nuclear accident in another part of Ukraine in 1986, when it was still part of the Soviet Union.
This week, a 14-strong team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visited Zaporizhzhia, with the UN nuclear watchdog’s chief Rafael Grossi saying the site had been damaged in fighting.
Russia’s envoy to Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, said six IAEA inspectors would stay behind for several days and that two more would remain there “on a permanent basis”.
Ukraine has accused Russia of storing ammunition at Zaporizhzhia and deploying hundreds of soldiers there. It also suspects Moscow is intending to divert power from the plant to the nearby Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014.
‘Gas weapon’ 
Group of Seven (G7) major industrial democracies earlier on Friday vowed to move urgently to set a price cap on Russian oil imports, a crucial source of revenue for Moscow. As if on cue, Russian gas giant Gazprom said it had halted gas deliveries to Germany for an indefinite period, as there were leaks in a turbine. Its German manufacturer said that was not a valid reason to halt gas flows.
On Saturday, EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni, however, said the European Union was “well prepared” in the event of a total halt in Russian gas deliveries, thanks to storage capacity and energy-saving measures.
“We are well prepared to resist Russia’s extreme use of the gas weapon,” he told reporters on the sidelines of an economic forum organised by The European House — Ambrosetti.
In the EU, “gas storage is currently at about 80 percent, thanks to the diversification of supplies,” even if the situation varies from one country to another, Gentiloni said.
Aegean islands
Meanwhile, Turkiye accused Greece of occupying islands in the Aegean Sea that have a demilitarised status, as Erdogan said Turkiye was prepared to “do what is necessary” when the time comes. 
Historic rivals while also being fellow members of Nato, Turkey and Greece have been at odds over issues ranging from overflights and the status of Aegean islands to maritime boundaries and hydrocarbon resources in the Mediterranean, as well as ethnically split Cyprus. 
Ankara has recently accused Athens of arming the demilitarised Aegean islands — something Athens rejects, but Erdogan had not previously accused Greece of occupying them. “Your occupying the islands does not bind us. When the time, the hour, comes, we will do what is necessary,” Erdogan said, speaking in the northern province of Samsun. 
Greece reacted by saying it will not follow Turkey in its “outrageous daily slide” of statements and threats. 
“We will inform our allies and partners on the content of the provocative statements ... to make it clear who is setting dynamite to the cohesion of our alliance during a dangerous period,” the foreign ministry said. 
Turkey has recently been angered by what it said is harassment of its jets by Greek forces. Ankara has said that S-300 air defence systems used by Greece had locked on to Turkish jets during a routine flight. 
Turkey celebrated Victory Day on Aug 30, a national holiday commemorating Turkish forces driving out Greek forces in 1922. Ankara says the Aegean islands were given to Greece under the 1923 and 1947 treaties on condition that it does not arm them. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has repeatedly said Turkey would start questioning Greek sovereignty over the islands if Athens persisted in arming them. 
Also, Erdogan called on Greece to “not forget Izmir”, referring to the Turkish victory.
