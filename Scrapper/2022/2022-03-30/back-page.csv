0,"Opposition certain of victory, even without two MNAs","National Assembly speaker yet to issue production orders for Ali Wazir, Jam Abdul Karim Bijar.","ISLAMABAD / KARACHI: While the opposition has been pressing National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser to issue production orders for the detained independent member from South Waziristan Ali Wazir and Pakistan Peoples Party MNA from Karachi Jam Abdul Karim Bijar to ensure their participation in the vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan, it is hopeful that their move would  succeed even without both legislators on voting day.
Members of the joint opposition had submitted a written request on March 25, asking the NA speaker to issue the production order for every detained lawmaker — irrespective of their party affiliation — allowing them to exercise their right to vote.
Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement-backed Ali Wazir has been languishing in jail since December 31, 2020 for allegedly delivering provocative speeches against security establishment. The MNA was granted bail by the Supreme Court in November last year, but his release was stalled after an anti-terrorism court asked for additional verification before another arrest order was issued.
Also, the Sindh High Court on Tuesday dismissed as not maintainable a petition of PPP MNA Jam Karim, seeking not only contempt proceedings against Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid for putting his name on the Provisional National Identification List despite his protective bail in a murder case, but also extension in his protective bail that the court had granted him on March 25. 

Speaker yet to issue production orders for Ali Wazir, Jam Karim

Signed by National Democratic Movement chief Mohsin Dawar, PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal and others, the letter stated: “As speaker of the National Assembly, the impartiality of your office demands that you may issues production orders of every MNA regardless of party affiliation so that no constituency of Pakistan remains unrepresented.” 
Under the assembly rules, the NA Speaker and chairman of a committee have the power to issue production order for any arrested lawmaker to ensure his presence during the sittings of the house and its committees and in the past many speakers have used this discretionary power. Speaker Qaiser, too, once issued the production order of Mr Wazir, who has spent most of the time in jail since the 2018 elections. 
Speaking at a news conference in Islamabad on Tuesday, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said Ali Wazir’s production orders should be issued by the speaker, but at the same time he declared that even if he did not do so, the opposition had the required numbers for the success of the no-confidence resolution.
About MNA Jam Abdul Karim, he said it was the right of an individual to be granted protective bail by a court and the court had done so. While referring to the statement of Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed that the PPP MNA would be arrested, he said: “I hope that the courts will take contempt action against those who are threatening to go against its orders.”
The counsel for the lawmaker earlier appeared before a two-member bench in the Sindh High Court and informed that the teams of police, FIA and other agencies at various airports had been directed to arrest the petitioner despite the fact he was on protective bail. Also, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail had asked the FIA to take the petitioner into custody upon his return from the UAE. The lawyer contended that since the PM was facing no-trust move and all of this was being done to stall any possibility of the MNA to reach the assembly and urged the court to extend his protective bail for 20 days. However, the SHC bench observed the petition was not maintainable before his arrest or the expiry of the protective bail that had been granted to him on March 25.
At the press conference in Islamabad, however, PPP chairman Bhutto-Zardari sounded confident about the success of the opposition’s move even if the two legislators were not allowed to attend the NA session on crucial vote.
The PPP leadership appeared definite due to the announcement by the four members of the BAP, Jamhoori Watan Party MNA Shahzain Bugti and two independents Ali Nawaz Shah and Aslam Bhootani to lend support to the opposition. 
At the time of the tabling of the no-trust resolution before the assembly on Monday, the opposition had succeeded in ensuring the presence of all of its members as the motion that allowed Mr Sharif to formally table the resolution had been approved by the chair when 161 opposition members stood up for its support. 
At present, the opposition has 163 members in the lower house of the parliament and only Mr Wazir and Mr Karim were not present in the assembly when the resolution was tabled.

1,Russia agrees to scale down fighting at Istanbul talks,"Western powers sceptical of Moscow’s commitments, say will judge ""actions, not words"".","ISTANBUL/KYIV: Russia said it would scale down fighting around two Ukrainian cities following talks with Kyiv on Tuesday and raised the possibility of a meeting between the two presidents. 
The outcome of the face-to-face talks held in Istanbul raised hopes after more than a month of conflict that has left thousands dead and forced millions from their homes. 
As he opened the Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan acknowledged that both sides had “legitimate concerns”, but urged the delegations to “put an end to this tragedy”. 
Following the talks, Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said there were “sufficient” conditions for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet. 
He also called for “an international mechanism of security guarantees where guarantor countries will act in a similar way to NATO’s article number five -- and even more firmly”. 

Western powers sceptical of Moscow’s commitments, say will judge ‘actions, not words’

Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin said there had been progress in talks on “the neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine”. 
Therefore, “a decision has been made to radically, by several times reduce the military activity” around the capital Kyiv and the city of Chernigiv, he said. Chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said there had been a “meaningful discussion”. 
Western skepticism
The leaders of the United States, UK, France, Germany and Italy, however, urged the West not to drop its guard against Russia, after Moscow signalled it would scale down fighting around two Ukrainian cities. 
“They agreed there could be no relaxation of Western resolve until the horror inflicted on Ukraine is over,” they said, according to a read-out from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Downing Street office.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also responded quickly, saying he doubted Russia’s “seriousness”. 
“There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does. We’re focussed on the latter,” he said, speaking at a press conference in Morocco. 
“What Russia is doing is the continued brutalisation of Ukraine and its people, and that continues as we speak.”

2,Plea against inserting 7-ATA in Priyantha lynching case dismissed,One of the accused in the case had filed the petition.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday dismissed a petition challenging the inclusion of Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 in the FIR of lynching of Sri Lankan factory manager in Sialkot over blasphemy allegations. 
One of the accused, Mohammad Taimur, filed the petition.
The petitioner’s counsel argued before the court that the offences narrated in the FIR did not attract the provision of the ATA as only one person was murdered in the incident. He said the police wrongly inserted Section 7 of the ATA in the FIR due to the pressure from the government. 
The counsel said a similar application was filed before the trial court but the same was dismissed. He requested the court to allow the petition and order the trial court to delete the charges of terrorism in the FIR. 
However, a two-judge LHC bench headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi dismissed the petition. 
An anti-terrorism court is holding jail trial on a daily basis in the lynching case wherein 89 suspects have been indicted. 
The victim, 49-year-old Priyantha Kumara, was tortured to death and his body was set on fire on Dec 3, 2021 by furious workers of Rajco Industries garment factory, where he was a manager. 
The prosecution in its challan included 40 witnesses, besides videos, digital evidence, DNA evidence and forensic evidence. The witnesses also include Mr Kumara’s colleague who tried his best to save him from the mob. 
According to the challan, footage from 10 digital video recorders in the factory was sent for forensic analysis and the accused were traced via social media videos and footage recovered from the mobile phones of 56 accused. 
An FIR was registered against 900 workers at the Uggoki police station for aggravated murder and burning of the body against dozens of unidentified people under terrorism and murder provisions.

3,Six Pakistanis martyred as UN chopper shot down in  DR Congo,DAKAR: Six Pakistani peacekeepers were martyred in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Monday when rebels shot down ...,"DAKAR: Six Pakistani peacekeepers were martyred in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Monday when rebels shot down a United Nations helicopter. One Russian and one Serbian peacekeepers also died in the crash.
The helicopter was among two carrying out reconnaissance for the UN mission in DR Congo, according to a statement by the country’s army on Tuesday. Those on the helicopter were assessing the movements of communities that had been attacked by a rebel group in order to coordinate humanitarian assistance.
The M23 rebel group attacked several villages in DR Congo’s east, according to the statement.
The Inter-Services Public Relations identified the martyred Pakistani soldiers as Lt Col Asif Ali Awan, Major Saad Nomani, Major Faizan Ali, Naib Subedar Sami Ullah Khan, Havaldar Muhammad Ismail and Lance Havaldar Muhammad Jamil.
“Pakistan has always played a pivotal role as a responsible member of the international community to help realise ideals of global peace and security through UN peacekeeping missions,” the statement said.
DR Congo’s east is prone to insecurity as several armed groups are vying for control of its mineral-rich lands. In 2012 the M23 rebels controlled large areas of eastern Congo, including the provincial capital of Goma.

4,US official to attend Afghanistan meeting in China,The ministerial meeting will be chaired by China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi.,"BEIJING: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi reached China on Tuesday to attend the third meeting of foreign ministers of countries neighbouring Afghanistan, which would also be attended by a US representative. 
Chinese special envoy for Afghanistan Yue Xiaoyong would host the meeting, said Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry.

Besides attending the ministerial meeting, the foreign minister will interact with counterparts from the participating countries. In a video message before departing for China, Mr Qureshi said: “We will run through the situation of peace in Afghanistan and discuss its economic development and connectivity projects.” 
“This is an important platform for consensus-building,” the minister said, adding that the trip would be a “fully packed” one. 
According to a statement issued by the Foreign Office, he said Pakistan wanted good relations with all nations.

5,UK police to issue 20 initial ‘Partygate’ fines,PM Boris Johnson not among those hit in first wave of sanctions; opposition politicians reiterate calls for his resignation.,"LONDON: British police announced on Tuesday they would be issuing 20 initial fines, after probing suspected breaches of Covid-19 lockdown laws by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his staff in Downing Street. 
London’s Metropolitan Police said it would not be disclosing the number or identities of those being fined, but Johnson’s spokesman confirmed that the UK leader was not among those hit in the first wave of sanctions. 
The news nevertheless revives the so-called “Partygate” scandal, which left Johnson fighting for political survival after a number of lawmakers from his ruling Conservatives withdrew their support for his leadership.
Opposition politicians promptly reiterated their calls for his resignation following the Met’s announcement on Tuesday.
“We will today initially begin to refer 20 fixed penalty notices to be issued for breaches of Covid-19 regulations,” the Met said in a statement, adding that its investigation was continuing.

Johnson not among those hit in first wave of sanctions

“We are making every effort to progress this investigation at speed and have completed a number of assessments,” it added.
Because there was still a “significant amount” of evidence to be assessed, they did not rule out further action.
The London force is investigating claims that Johnson and his Downing Street officials organised and attended at least a dozen alcohol-fuelled events in 2020 and 2021 that violated Britain’s then-strict virus curbs.
Johnson has already apologised for the parties, which included Christmas celebrations and a drink-fuelled gathering the evening before Prince Philip’s funeral.
The prime minister, who initially denied any rule-breaking events had occurred in the complex where he lives and works, has consistently rejected personal wrongdoing.
But the 57-year-old faces a fine unless he can adequately explain why he appeared to attend some social gatherings when his government was telling the public that they were illegal.
His office confirmed last month that Johnson had submitted his response to a police questionnaire on the matter, but sources have said he has not been interviewed in person by investigating officers.
His spokesman restated on Tuesday that he would disclose any significant developments in the probe relating to the prime minister.
The “Partygate” revelations and a steady stream of other scandals dating back to late 2021 had left Johnson’s position as prime minister hanging by a thread at the start of this year.
The mood among some of his own MPs grew increasingly mutinous and his position was weaker than at any time since he became prime minister in 2019 on a wave of support for his populist Brexit agenda.

6,Reclusive French family’s ‘group suicide’ shrouded in mystery,Five members of the family jumped from the balcony of their apartment; 15-year-old boy only survivor.,"GENEVA: A French family gripped by conspiracy theories jumped one after the other from their seventh-floor apartment in the Swiss town of Montreux, police investigating the mystery said on Tuesday. 
Only a 15-year-old boy survived the tragedy last Thursday near the casino in the plush town on Lake Geneva. He is in a coma in a stable condition in hospital. 
The Vaud regional police announced on Tuesday that their findings “make it possible to rule out the intervention of a third party and suggest that all the victims jumped from the balcony one after the other”. 
Police and prosecutors are working on the theory of “collective suicide”. 

Five members of the family jumped from balcony of their apartment; one survives 

A man aged 40, his 41-year-old wife, her twin sister, the couple’s eight-year-old daughter and their boy plunged more than 20 metres from the apartment, where they all lived “withdrawn from society”, according to police. 
Timeline of events 
Investigators said two officers knocked on the apartment door at 6:15 am, wanting to speak with the father about the home-schooling arrangements for his son.
A voice asked who was at the door, but then said nothing further. Unable to enter, the officers left. Shortly before 7:00am, all five jumped from the balcony within the space of five minutes. 
Police detected no trace of a struggle, seemingly confirming that they jumped of their own accord. A step-ladder was found on the balcony. 
“Before or during the events, no witnesses, including the two police officers present on the spot from 6:15am and the passers-by at the foot of the building, heard the slightest noise or cry coming from the apartment or the balcony,” police said. 
“Technical investigations show no warning signs of such an act,” they added, noting however that “since the start of the pandemic, the family was very interested in conspiracy and survivalist theories”. 
The family lived in virtual self-sufficiency having amassed a well-organised stockpile of various food, taking up much of their living space but enabling them to see out a major crisis. 
Only the mother’s twin sister worked outside the home, while neither the mother nor the eight-year-old girl, who did not attend school, were registered with the local authorities. 
“All these elements suggest... fear of the authorities interfering in their lives,” the police statement said.
Granddaughters of Algerian writer
France’s Journal du Dimanche newspaper said the father, Eric David, grew up in a wealthy part of Marseille and attended the Ecole Polytechnique, one of the most prestigious schools in the country. 
The twin sisters, Nasrine and Narjisse Feraoun, grew up in a family of five children who were all educated at the elite Lycee Henri-IV in Paris, the weekly said. The mother was a dentist and her sister an ophthalmologist. 
The newspaper also said the twins were granddaughters of Algerian novelist Mouloud Feraoun. 
A close friend of the French philosopher Albert Camus, Feraoun was assassinated in Algiers in 1962 by a far-right French pro-colonial group.
