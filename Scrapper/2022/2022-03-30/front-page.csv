• Buzdar to stay on until no-trust vote against PM    
LAHORE: Less than 24 hours after Prime Minister Imran Khan announced Chaudhry Parvez Elahi as the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) nominee for the Punjab chief minister after incumbent Usman Buzdar was asked to resign, the Punjab Assembly speaker sprung into action on Tuesday to muster as much support as possible for his election to the new office.  
Mr Elahi got in touch with the disgruntled Jehangir Tareen group to ensure it supported him in the face of the joint opposition’s announcement to field its candidate against him. He also contacted some dissident MNAs of the ruling PTI, persuading them not to support the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan.

“PM Khan will survive the no-confidence motion and the new Punjab chief minister will also belong to the PTI coalition. We will accomplish both targets,” Mr Elahi confidently claimed while talking to a private TV channel on Tuesday, when told the opposition claimed to have the required numbers to oust the premier and also install its chief minister in Punjab.   
Justifying his party’s decision to stay with the PTI government, the PML-Q senior leader said: “We found out that the Maryam Nawaz group in the PML-N was against giving anything to the PML-Q, and called us a party with five seats. We were told by our sources that we will stay in power for not more than four months after joining hands with the opposition.”

Moreover, he claimed he had spoken to the Tareen group members and they would support him in the election for the CM. A Punjab lawmaker supporting Mr Tareen, Rafaqat Ali Gilani, met Mr Elahi on Tuesday and assured him of his support. “Federal Minister for Water Resources Moonis Elahi spoke to Mr Tareen’s son Ali to galvanise their group’s support,” Elahi claimed.  
PML-Q Senator Kamil Ali Agha also said the party’s priority is to ensure the no-trust move against the prime minister fails. “We are trying our best to ensure the coalition government completes its tenure.”  
He further said the PML-Q was trying to persuade MNA Tariq Bashir Cheema not to go against the party line in the vote of no-confidence. However, Mr Cheema said he was still with the Chaudhrys of Gujrat, but did not commit to changing his mind about voting against the prime minister.  
Rift among Chaudhrys
PML-Q president Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain dismissed reports of a rift within the Chaudhry family and the party over their decision to remain a part of the PTI coalition.  
“All political decisions are made in consultation with me and I fully support them being the head of the family. Our family and party are on the same page. Rumours were spread after our decision to stay in the coalition,” he maintained. “Those who want to gain political advantage by spreading rumours about differences in our family will be disappointed.”  
Meanwhile, PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb refuted Mr Elahi’s statement related to Maryam Nawaz. “Parvez Elahi’s statement about Maryam Nawaz is not true. It was a decision of the joint opposition to make an offer to the PML-Q. Their decision to go against this offer was based purely on their personal reasons and has nothing to do with any statement falsely associated with Maryam Nawaz,” Ms Aurangzeb maintained.  
On the other hand, federal Minister for National Food Security Syed Fakhar Imam denied he had resigned. In a tweet, he said: “News about my resignation and joining PMLN is baseless.” 
Opposition’s candidate for CM
After losing hope that the Chaudhrys had no intentions to part with the government, the opposition has started deliberation on finalising its candidate against Mr Elahi.  
“We are holding talks with the Tareen group and will finalise our candidate with mutual consultations,” a party leader told Dawn.  
PML-N’s Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and PTI’s Fawad Chaudhry reportedly spoke to the Tareen group’s leader Awn Chaudhry on Tuesday to seek their support for both the no-confidence motion and the chief minister’s election. “Fawad told Awn that the prime minister had accepted their group’s demand of replacing Usman Buzdar, and now it should support the premier,” a source said.  
The Tareen group, meanwhile, held a meeting in Lahore and discussed support for Mr Elahi. However, it said the final decision would be taken by Mr Tareen, who is currently in London for his treatment.  
PML-N MNA Javed Latif told a private TV channel that Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Hamza Shehbaz or disgruntled PTI MPA Aleem Khan might be the joint opposition’s candidate for the provincial chief minister.  Interestingly, Aleem could not produce a single lawmaker in his support; his claims of having the backing of 30 to 40 MPAs turned out to be a ‘hoax’.  
In the 371-member Punjab Assembly, the PML-N has 165 lawmakers, PPP seven, PML-Q 10 and around 20 belong to the disgruntled Tareen group.  
Former president Zardari claimed that Mr Elahi could not become the CM as the opposition had the ‘required numbers’. PML-N Punjab president Rana Sanaullah claimed that on the insistence of Moonis Elahi, the PML-Q leadership had decided to support the PTI coalition. He added the opposition had agreed to the PML-Q’s demand for the chief ministership, yet the party preferred to stay in the coalition. 
Meanwhile, the six dissenting PML-N MPAs, led by Jalil Sharaqpuri, announced their support for Mr Elahi.  
Buzdar’s term
In a related development, outgoing Punjab CM Usman Buzdar is likely to stay in office till the outcome of the no-confidence motion against the premier.  
“Buzdar’s resignation has not yet been accepted by the governor. If it’s accepted, a session is supposed to be called within two to three days and this does not suit the government in the wake of the no-confidence motion against the premier,” a source told Dawn.  
Meanwhile, Mr Buzdar said he would leave his office once his resignation is accepted, vowing to stand by the premier for the greater good of the country. 
In a series of tweets, he said: “I have never been desirous of any position as ministries and positions do not last long. The interest of the country is dearer to me than my own self.”  
He said he would always stand by PM Khan in fulfilling his commitment to the nation for a ‘Naya Pakistan’. “The party and commitment to the nation are always important.”

1,‘Stars not aligned’ for MQM announcement,MQM-P spokesperson says draft agreement finalised; party will announce decision once it is ratified by the coordination committee.,"KARACHI: A late night meeting between opposition leaders and the government-allied MQM-P created quite a stir in the capital. 
While the combined opposition tried with all its might to prevail upon the party to announce a decision there and then, MQM-P avoided making a definitive statement at such a late hour and announced that it would make its decision public the next day. 
An MQM-P spokesperson said that while the draft agreement had been finalised, the party would only announce its decision once the same was ratified by the coordination committee. 
Initially, an opposition delegation consisting of Khawaja Asif, Sherry Rehman, Naveed Qamar, Ayaz Sadiq, Akhtar Mengal, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and others reached Parliament Lodges a little before midnight.
Editorial: The fate of yet another govt will be written by parties with few seats and even fewer principles 
They held talks with MQM convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and other leaders, which continued well into the early hours of Wednesday.
Later, the main cohort of opposition leaders – Asif Ali Zardari and his son Bilawal, Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Shehbaz Sharif – also reached the venue around 2:00am in a bid to persuade the government ally to switch sides. 
TV channels were inundated with news about the possible outcome of the meeting throughout the night. While multiple outlets reported that opposition sources claimed the MQM-P had all but agreed to join them, some channels quoted Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and Waeem Akhtar as saying that nothing had been decided. 
Sources privy to the meeting said that the sitting discussed certain clauses about a future agreement between the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and MQM-P regarding Sindh’s administrative and local government issues in the presence of senior leadership of other opposition parties.
The draft agreement is not only with the PPP, but with the whole opposition, a source said, adding that Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Shehbaz Sharif would ensure implementation on the agreement if it was approved by the coordination committee.
If MQM-P were to throw its weight behind the opposition, it would drastically tilt the scales in the their favour. According to some estimates, the ruling coalition has a strength of 171 members, since the lone Jamaat lawmaker has elected to stay neutral in the no-confidence vote. 
The opposition, on the other hand, seems to have 169 members on its side after the Balochistan Awami Party joined its ranks. 
This precarious balance could easily be tilted if the MQM-P’s seven members cross over to the opposition’s side.

2,Female seminary teacher killed by her students,DERA ISMAIL KHAN: A woman teacher at a girls’ seminary was killed after she was allegedly stabbed in the neck by...,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN: A woman teacher at a girls’ seminary was killed after she was allegedly stabbed in the neck by three female students, police said on Tuesday.  
The students accused of carrying out the fatal attack have been arrested.  
Initial investigations indicated that the deceased and the accused had developed some differences over religious issues. The assailants thought the slain teacher, Safoora Bibi, 21, had committed blasphemy, said Imtiaz Janjua, a spokesperson for the district police.  
The incident took place at Jamia Islamia Falah Al-Banat, situated in the Anjumabad area on Dera Multan Road, at about 7am on Tuesday.  
According to the FIR, the three girls — Umra Aman, 24, daughter of Deen Badshah; and Razia Hanifia, 21, and Aisha Noman, 17, daughters of Allah Noor — allegedly injured the teacher with a stick at the gate of the madressah and later stabbed her in the neck, killing her.  
The accused students told police that a religious personality appeared in the dream of one of their relatives — a 13-year-old girl — and said the teacher had committed blasphemy, sources said.  
Police said that upon receiving information about the incident, a contingent of policemen led by DSP Saghir Gilani rushed to the madressah and took the teacher’s body to District Headquarters Hospital Dera for postmortem.  
According to the FIR, at about seven in the morning, Safoora Bibi got off a rickshaw and entered the gate of her madressah. As soon as she entered the gate she was attacked by the three students and died on the spot.  
According to police, a knife and a stick were recovered from the arrested girls.

3,Pakistan seeks early end to Russia-Ukraine conflict,ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday underscored Pakistan’s potential role for mediation in the...,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday underscored Pakistan’s potential role for mediation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
In a telephone conversation with President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr Khan said: “Non-partisan countries like Pakistan are in a position to play a helpful role in reinforcing efforts for cessation of hostilities and a diplomatic solution.” 
This was the first time that the two leaders spoke to each other since Russia started the war against Ukraine. 
Mr Khan was visiting Moscow when Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb 24. 
Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had, in a conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on Feb 28, explained Pakistan’s perspective to him and emphasised the need for resolution of the conflict through peace and dialogue. 
Though Pakistan opted for neutrality on the conflict and abstained from the vote in the UNGA asking Russia to end its military operations in Ukraine, Islamabad has strong defence ties with Kyiv and the two were undertaking several projects on the basis of transfer of technology. 
In 2020, Ukraine won the tender for repair of IL-78 air-refueller in PAF fleet. Meanwhile, Ukrainian-built T-80UD tanks are crucial part of Pakistan’s armoured corps. 
Ukraine was, moreover, a major market for import of wheat for Pakistan. In 2020-21, Pakistan imported nearly 1.2 million tonnes of wheat from Ukraine. It is feared that prolonged conflict between Russia and Ukraine could threaten Pakistan’s food security. 
Talking to Mr Zelensky, the PM regretted the continued military conflict and reiterated Pakistan’s principled position in support of immediate cessation of hostilities and resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy. 
He said that he had been persistently highlighting the adverse economic impact of the conflict on developing countries as manifested in rising prices of oil and other commodities.
The PM said that foreign ministers of Islamic countries had expressed deep concern at the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation triggered by the conflict in Ukraine, and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities. 
While speaking at the OIC meeting, Mr Khan had asked China and countries in the Muslim bloc to mediate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. 
Mr Zelensky, meanwhile, said that he had told Mr Khan about his country’s struggle against Russian aggression. “The people of Ukraine seek peace. This is our unconditional priority,” he said.

4,PM can only show ‘threat letter’ to CJP: minister,"Opposition asks PM to present document before parliament, summon envoys of countries involved in ‘anti-govt conspiracy’","ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday said it intended to take the issue of the “international conspiracy” against it to the Supreme Court, and claimed that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supreme leader Nawaz Sharif was a part of the conspiracy.  
In the PTI’s public meeting in Islamabad on Sunday, Prime Minister Imran Khan had pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and waved it at the crowd, claiming the “letter” was evidence of an “international conspiracy” being hatched to topple his government.  
On the other hand, the opposition believed the PM had used the so-called letter as an excuse to woo his government’s allies and dissident MNAs of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) for the no-trust resolution against him, and urged the premier to present the “secret” and “threatening” letter before parliament and summon envoys of the countries allegedly involved in hatching the conspiracy. 

Opposition asks PM to present document before parliament, summon envoys of countries involved in ‘anti-govt conspiracy’ 

In a joint press conference on Tuesday, Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar and Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the prime minister had decided to present the letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial. “If someone has doubts, the prime minister says if necessary, and for the people’s satisfaction, he is ready to present the letter to the chief justice of the Supreme Court, as he enjoys a good reputation,” Mr Umar said, adding that only three to four people, including him, had seen the letter. 
“The letter has been shared with the top civil and military leadership and only two or three cabinet members,” he added. 
The letter was written and dated prior to the day the opposition submitted its no-trust motion against the prime minister to the National Assembly. “It was mentioned in the letter that a no-confidence motion will be moved against the PM. I myself have read the letter many times,” the minister claimed. 
Mr Umar, who is also the PTI’s secretary general, alleged the principal character behind this plot against the government was Nawaz Sharif, who was facilitating the international establishment from London, while the senior leadership of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) could also be knowingly involved in this conspiracy. 
When asked why the government was not presenting the letter in parliament, he said: “Due to the sensitivity of the letter, it cannot be shared with the over 340 members of parliament, but just to satisfy the people, the prime minister has agreed to show it to the most reliable person with good reputation, the CJP,” he added. 
Terming the letter a threat, the minister claimed it clearly said that if the no-confidence motion did not succeed, and PM Khan remained in office, it would have unfortunate repercussions. 
Mr Umar maintained that the letter focused on Pakistan’s foreign policy, which made it clear that it was linked to foreign elements. It also states the senior leadership of the PDM was in contact with those foreign elements, the minister alleged. 
He said after these ‘realities’ were unearthed, except a few, almost all the MNAs, who were unknowingly becoming part of this “international plot”, would distance themselves from the motion. 
Opposition’s demand
Separately, frontline opposition leaders — Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif and former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi — demanded the prime minister present the letter before parliament.  
In a press conference, Bhutto-Zardari asked the PM to make the letter public. Shehbaz Sharif, in a statement, asked if the letter was not fake, then why the PM was reluctant to make it public. Abbasi, in a separate press conference, said it was imperative that the letter be shared with the highest institution of the country — parliament — in an in-camera session. “If the letter and the threat are authenticated, the opposition would stand with Pakistan’s sovereignty and interest,” he stressed. 
The former premier said the diplomats of the country or countries that had supposedly threatened Pakistan must be immediately declared persona non grata and expelled from Pakistan. 
“If there is any such threat it must be presented in an in-camera session of parliament and the National Security Committee,” he demanded. 
PM chairs PTI meeting
Later, presiding over PTI’s Political Committee meeting, Prime Minister Khan claimed that when the rulers had clear intentions, all the conspiracies hatched internally or externally were bound to fail.  
The PM thanked the opposition parties for ‘hatching a conspiracy’, which further increased the PTI’s popularity and triggered a new fervour in the party’s ranks. The PTI was the only grassroots-level national political party, he said, adding that when a nation resolved to change the fate of a country, the result was reflected in the form of public gatherings like the one recently held by the PTI in Islamabad.
