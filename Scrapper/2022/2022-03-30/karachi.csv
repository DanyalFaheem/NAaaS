They said a young man, Arif Sheikh, was driving home with his mother when they were intercepted by armed motorcyclists near Khandu Goth in North Nazimabad, Block B.
“One of the riders got off the motorbike, pulled out a pistol and snatched cell phones of the young man and his mother as well as her gold chain,” said an official at the North Nazimabad police station.
“As he returned to get on the bike with his aide, the young man pulled out his licensed pistol, which he carries in his car, and fired multiple shots,” the official said, adding that both the suspects were hit, but the one who snatched the valuable from them, fell on the ground with serious wounds.
He said his accomplice, however, managed to speed away.
The wounded suspect was taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where he died, the official said.
The suspect was later identified as Shan. He was booked in several cases registered with different police stations in district Central.
“The citizen who fired shot had both licence and permit to carry the gun. The police also recovered their cell phones and gold chain from the deceased bandit,” the official added.

1,"Over 3,000 cops given offer to stay on after five-year deputation in Karachi",The cops were recruited from different districts in 2016 and transferred to the metropolis.,"KARACHI: While more than 3,200 personnel of the city traffic police are set to be transferred to their hometowns in different districts of Sindh after completion of their five-year deputation period in Karachi, a ‘serious human resource crisis’ is emerging before the law-enforcement department, which is now struggling to meet the shortage of personnel by offering them the option to stay on in Karachi. 
The Karachi police have offered the personnel to be absorbed in the city police service structure, officials and sources told Dawn. 
Recruited in 2016 in different Sindh districts, some 3,200 personnel were transferred to Karachi for a five-year period in the name of meeting the shortage in the traffic section of the police department. 
Immediately after their transfer in the second half of 2016, they started serving in the city traffic police and had completed their five-year term in late 2021. 

These policemen were recruited in different districts in 2016 and transferred to metropolis

“These 3,200 personnel would be transferred in phases,” said an official. 
“To avoid sudden shortage in the Karachi traffic police department, which is already serving under its sanctioned strength, each month around 300 personnel will be sent back to their respective districts. It is expected that the process will take nine to 10 months to complete. The process of transfer is well-defined and has been conveyed to all these personnel.” 
500 to be absorbed in Karachi police
However, a crisis-like situation is likely to emerge and it may badly impact the management and operation of the traffic police in Karachi, the officials added. 
“It will not be easy to transfer 300 personnel every month without new induction in police,” the officials said. 
“So to avoid this crisis, we have moved a few things to adjust the maximum number of these 3,200 personnel into the Karachi police force,” DIG-traffic Ahmed Nawaz told Dawn. “We want to retain them, but at the same time, the personnel have their own different apprehensions regarding their stay in the Karachi traffic police. So we have devised a strategy.”
“We took it to the inspector general of Sindh police and the promotion board and finally came up with a proposal. Under the proposal, the personnel are offered to stay on in Karachi. The personnel, who want to stay on in Karachi and serve here, will be absorbed in the Karachi police with due seniority and other benefits,” the DIG said, adding: “So far, some 500 of them have showed willingness to accept the offer to continue to serve in Karachi.” 
New inductions 
The DIG said with this new arrangement and some 7,000 new recruitments being made as part of the Karachi police induction process, the city traffic police would be able to tackle the situation within a few months. 
With the sanctioned strength of 10,000 personnel, the Karachi traffic police were serving with a little more than 6,500 personnel, he added. 
The Sindh police department is in the process of inducting more than 10,000 men and women — with a major chunk of recruitment from Karachi youth having city domicile — in one of its massive recruitment drives announced after years. 
The Sindh police are filling 10,490 vacancies with 6,655 recruitments for Karachi Range alone. 
Under the plan announced by the Sindh police for the Karachi police force, the law-enforcement agency is inducting 6,655 youngsters as constables from all eight districts — South, West, Central, East, Keamari, Malir, City and Korangi — of its organisational structure in the metropolis.

2,"New prices of roti, samosa, pakoras, jalebi notified",KARACHI: While the recently notified prices of chicken meat and mutton were not yet enforced fully in parts of the...,"KARACHI: While the recently notified prices of chicken meat and mutton were not yet enforced fully in parts of the city, the local administration on Tuesday determined the new prices of roti, naan, and other edible items in the advent of the holy month of Ramazan.
A meeting, chaired by Commissioner Muhammad Iqbal Memon, decided to fix the price of 180-gram naan and 120-gram naan at Rs15 and Rs12, respectively, while Afghani naan was at Rs10. The price of a 90-gram chapatti was fixed at Rs8. 
However, different types of rotis, including naan and chapatti are being sold at exorbitant prices in the city depending on the weight of the commodities kept by tandoor operators. 
Consumers said that the pounder naans were sold at higher prices of Rs18 to 25, while the tandoor operators offering naan at lower prices kept the weight of different varieties of roti as there was no monitoring mechanism to ascertain the weight of naan and chapatti. 
Patties and fritters
The price of ‘A’ category samosa, sold at expensive shops, (weight 35 grams with mince) has been fixed at Rs22 and ‘B’ category samosa, sold at pushcarts, has been fixed at Rs18 per piece, while A category potato samosa (60g weight) at Rs22 and B category at Rs18. 
However, patties (mince and potato) are not available for less than Rs25 per piece in most parts of the city.  
The price of A category fritters, or pakoras, was fixed at Rs360 per kilogram and B category at Rs320 per kg. 
The price of A category sweet pretzels, or jalebi, was fixed at Rs320 per kg and B category at Rs280 per kg. 
It may be noted here that the sweet pretzels are sold at Rs400 kg at pushcarts and makeshift stalls in many areas. 
On Friday last, the city administration had notified the chicken meat price at Rs356 per kg and mutton at Rs1,220 per kg, but the retailers are selling live birds, chicken meat and mutton at the prices of their choice, much higher than those officially notified. 
Residents complained that the mutton was being sold openly at a much higher price, ranging from Rs1,500 to Rs1,800 in different parts of the city. The authorized price controlling officers did not monitor the enforcement of official prices of essential food items.
In a separate meeting, the commissioner fixed the prices of pulses and rise after consultation with wholesalers and retailers.
The margin on pulses and rice was fixed at Rs5 per kg.
The commissioner said that the prices of pulses and rice were decided for one month to provide relief in Ramazan, adding that 90 per cent of pulses were imported and the prices could be revised after one month in terms of dollar value.

3,"ATC judge hearing key cases against PPP, Muttahida men removed","Sindh govt denotifies Nuzhat Ara Alvi as ATC-II judge on ""recommendation"" of SHC chief justice.","KARACHI: The Sindh government on Tuesday removed the judge of an antiterrorism court after Sindh High Court Chief Justice Ahmed Ali M. Shaikh asked the home department to denotify the judge from her post.
The chief justice recommended the removal of retired district and sessions judge Nuzhat Ara Alvi, who has been serving as the presiding officer of the ATC-II, Karachi since August 2021.
In a letter, issued by SHC registrar Abdul Razzaq, the high court directed the home secretary to take necessary steps to de-notify Ms Alvi at the earliest.

Sindh govt denotifies Nuzhat Ara Alvi as ATC-II judge on ‘recommendation’ of SHC chief justice

“I am directed to refer to Notification No. Reg(HD)/1-541/2021 dated 10.8.2021 and to inform you that the Hon’ble Chief Justice has been pleased to recommend for removal of Miss. Nuzhat Ara Alvi, retired District & Sessions Judge from the post of presiding officer, Anti-terrorism Court-II, Karachi, as laid down under Section 14(4) of Anti-Terrorism Act [ATA], 1997,” reads the registrar’s letter.
According to Section 14(4) of ATA, a judge may be removed from his office prior to the completion of the period for which he / she has been appointed after consultation with the chief justice of the high court.
Ms Alvi was appointed as the presiding officer of ATC-II on Aug 10, 2021 for a period of two and half years.
In compliance with the chief justice’s order, Sindh Home Secretary Dr Saeed Ahmed Mangejo issued a notification to denotify Ms Alvi from the post of presiding officer of the ATC-II with immediate effect. 
A few days ago, the same ATC-II had issued a non-bailable warrant for the arrest of PPP MNA Qadir Petal after he failed to appear in court as an accused in a case pertaining to allegedly facilitating medical treatment of suspected gangsters and criminals.
Last month, the same court had also issued a non-bailable warrant against Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan leader and former Karachi mayor Wasim Akhtar, who is also one of the accused along with Qadir Patel, for the same reason and in the same case. 
In December, the ATC-II had also cancelled the bail of MQM leader Gulfaraz Khattak, who is facing trial in another case, over his alleged “inappropriate behaviour” with the judge.

4,Family ties,The Father is last play at Napa’s Young Directors Festival...,"KARACHI: Before the unreadily digestible psychological theories such as Oedipus Complex and Electra Complex began to be interwoven into the subtexts of plays and novels, the parent-child relationship was seen in a light which in today’s world can be called conventional. Both the father and the mother own their child, each trying to prove how much they love or have sacrificed their lives for their offspring. But even in its conventional sense, it’s not a simple association to explore. This was the subject of The Father, the last play staged on Monday evening at the Young Directors Festival held by the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa). 
It’s an Urdu adaptation of August Strindberg’s drama translated by Ishtiaq Ur Rasool Umer and directed by Kiran Siddiqui for the festival. 

The Father is last play at Napa’s Young Directors Festival

The play focuses on an armyman, Adolf (Farhan Alam Siddiqui), and his wife Lara (Bazelah Mustafa). They have a daughter Bertha (Nafees). The first scene of the drama doesn’t have Lara in it. Instead, Adolf is seen talking to his brother-in-law Pastor John (Zohair Zubair), which is actually a sequence that reveals a little bit about the former’s character. Things elucidate when Lara makes her first appearance on stage. It is evident that both, after years of togetherness, are not on the same wavelength. Adolf is an atheist, a man of science, something Lara jibes at. Things heat up when the future of Bertha is discussed — both want to have diametrically opposed occupations for their daughter.
Lara is a clever woman. During a meeting with a doctor (Ahad Touqeer) she convinces him that Adolf is not mentally stable. At the same time she also sows the seed of doubt in her husband’s mind that Bertha is not his daughter. And from then on, a series of events unfold where the clash for the possession of the young girl results in psychological and physical destruction of Adolf. 
The Father is a serious study of the power tussle between the sexes. Despite the fact that it was written more than a century ago, it’s become all the more relevant to contemporary times where the man-woman equation is being examined and re-examined on a regular basis. But the production suffers due to the lack of tonal variation in the script. 
While the actors do a reasonably good job, the intensity graph (for want of a better phrase) of the play doesn’t go up and down, not necessarily in the same order, to emphasise what the text is actually trying to put across.

5,Hindutva-driven ideologies damage strategic stability of region: naval chief,"Highlights regional environment infested with massive competition of interest, political instabilities and simmering conflict.","KARACHI: Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Muhammad Amjad Khan Niazi has underscored the Hindutva-driven ideologies as Pakistan’s arch rival, which continues to impinge upon strategic stability in the region. 
He was speaking as chief guest at the closing session of Pakistan Navy’s major maritime exercise Seaspark-2022 held at Karachi. It was conducted in north Arabian Sea to validate operational plans designed under realities of ever-evolving geo-strategic environment.  
During the session, the deputy chief of naval staff (operations) presented an overview of the exercise. Later the exercise was discussed in detail to draw pertinent lessons. Towards the end, recommendations were presented to refurbish war plans and strategies. 
In his concluding remarks, the chief of the naval staff highlighted the regional environment that continues to be infested with massive competition of interest, political instabilities and simmering conflict.  
He stressed the evolving character of war under the scenarios that possess complexity in understanding enemy’s behaviour and determining response possibilities.  
The chief asserted that Pakistan Navy was vigilant to offset enemy’s quantitative leverages through superior professionalism, innovative tactics, perseverance and above all faith in Allah. He reiterated the resolve that Pakistan Navy stood fully prepared to ensure seaward defence and safeguard national maritime interest at all costs. 
Seaspark-22 was aimed at assessing the combat readiness and operational preparedness of Pakistan Navy and to validate war plans duly aligned with National Security Policy and military strategies while synergising naval operations with land and air operations in conflict situations.

6,IHC grants protective bail to PPP lawmaker Patel,Directs the petitioner to appear before the ATC by April 13...,"ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday granted protective bail to Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) lawmaker Qadir Patel to enable him to appear before an antiterrorism court in Karachi, while on a similar plea before the Sindh High Court, his lawyer was directed to first produce the power of attorney executed by the lawmaker in his favour to move the SHC.
Non-bailable arrest warrants for the PPP’s member of the National Assembly were issued by the ATC in Karachi last week due to his absence in the case related to providing healthcare facilities to the suspects of terrorism. Other suspects in the case are Anees Qaimkhani, Dr Asim Hussain, Rauf Siddiqui, Waseem Akhtar and Usman Moazzam. 
The IHC division bench, headed by Chief Justice Athar Minallah, took up the MNA’s petition seeking protective bail. His counsel apprised the court that the opposition leader was scheduled to appear before the ATC on March 26, but it was due to the crucial National Assembly session that he could not appear before the court. The counsel also expressed the apprehension that the opposition MNA might be arrested while travelling to the court and sought bail.

Directs the petitioner to appear before the ATC by April 13

The bench granted him protective bail till April 13 with the direction that he would appear before the ATC by then. As per court order, the protective bail will stand expired on April 13 or whenever the lawmaker would appear before the court of competent jurisdiction.
The Sindh High Court, meanwhile, directed another lawyer to produce the power of attorney executed by MNA Petal in his favour to move the court on his behalf for protective bail.
The PPP lawmaker, who was in Islamabad on Tuesday, through his attorney filed a petition in the SHC to seek protective/transitory bail in order to appear before the ATC.
The counsel said the petitioner regularly attended the trial court at every hearing, but it was due to the NA session only that he could not attend the court last week when the ATC issued arrest warrants against him.
When the two-judge bench, headed by Justice K. K. Agha, asked the attorney if he had a power of attorney to approach this court on the behalf of the lawmaker, he replied in the negative.
“The learned counsel for the petitioner is directed to produce power of the attorney, if any, executed by the petitioner in favour of his attorney namely Adnan Hussain. To be fixed in court after compliance,” the court order stated.

8,"10pc of Covid survivors to face unrelated symptoms, say experts",KARACHI: While the mass vaccination against Covid-19 and the natural immunity built against the virus will likely...,"KARACHI: While the mass vaccination against Covid-19 and the natural immunity built against the virus will likely help prevent return of the infection in the form of a pandemic, outbreaks in pockets will continue across the world, though with less severity. 
The disease has also ‘shaped’ certain illnesses that will continue to affect lives of some recovered patients.
This was stated by experts at a seminar titled Covid-19: End of Pandemic? organised by the Infection Control Society of Pakistan (ICSP) at the Dow Medical College on Tuesday.
Presenting local and international perspective on Covid-19, Prof Nizam Damani, a senior consultant at the Infection Prevention Control Unit of WHO, said majority of the countries including Pakistan were reporting significant reduction in the number of Covid-19 cases and spread of the virus.
“The situation has improved due to mass vaccination drives and the natural immunity built against the virus in recovered patients,” he said, adding that the virus would continue to undergo changes.
ICSP president Prof Rafiq Khanani shared that some 10 per cent of the patients, who contracted coronavirus over the past two years, would continue to experience symptoms that appeared unrelated to Covid-19.
“The disease has shaped certain illnesses involving heart, lungs and neuropsychiatric health and will continue to affect lives of some 10 per cent of the recovered patients,” he said.
Prof Khanani also talked about the challenge posed by drug-resistant germs and called for urgent measures in this respect.
Prof Saeed Khan, a professor of pathology and focal person of Covid-19 testing at Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS), emphasised the need for setting up an active surveillance system for all major diseases.
“Early detection plays a key role in limiting the spread of an infectious disease. We have also learnt from the pandemic that skilled manpower is important in prevention and disease treatment and management,” he said.
Giving her presentation on the subject, Prof Tehreem Ansari of DUHS said Pakistan despite having limited resources had fought the war against Covid better than some developed countries.
“The healthcare workers, despite having lot of challenges, stood tall and worked tirelessly. The strategy to involve subject experts and law enforcement agencies, have a multidisciplinary approach, use technology and set up coordination centre worked well for us,” said Prof Ansari.

10,"57 presiding officers tampered with ballots in NA-196 election, says report",PTI’s Muhammedmian Soomro had won NA-196 (Jacobabad)...,"KARACHI: The returning officer of NA-196 (Jacobabad) has informed an election tribunal in Sukkur that apparently, presiding officers of 57 polling stations were involved in tampering with ballots.
The RO Ghulam Ali Kanasiro said in report on vote recount and rechecking of election record of NA-196 submitted recently to the tribunal that 165 ballot paper books (15,100 ballot papers) were found missing at 57 polling stations as their presiding officers had the record disappeared or handed over to someone interested in election process.
The tribunal had ordered vote recount after many hearings of a petition filed by Pakistan Peoples Party candidate Aijaz Jakhrani in 2018 challenging the victory of federal minister for privatization and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf candidate Muhammedmian Soomro on NA-196.

PTI’s Muhammedmian Soomro had won NA-196 (Jacobabad)

The RO said that they had tampered with the papers by causing disappearance of ballot paper books, counterfoils, valid/invalid votes as pointed out at relevant polling stations, said the report.
The report contended that the number of ballot paper books was more than the number of books mentioned in packaging invoice, which showed the presiding officers had compromised due process of election for their ulterior motives and it was clearly evident that valid votes were destroyed or stolen or included in favour of a contestant.
“I am of considered view that the act of presiding officers and assistant presiding officers of polling stations, pointed out above, appears to rig the process of election and its outcome, for the reasons best known to them, for which Honourable Election Tribunal can take any action as it deemed fit and proper,” it concluded.
Mr Soomro had won the NA-196 seat by securing 92,307 votes in the 2018 general election while Mr Jakhrani was runner-up with 86,881 votes. After the vote recount, ordered on Mr Jakhrani’s application, Mr Soomro was found to have 88,542 and the PPP candidate with 83,896 votes.

These views were expressed by scholars and experts speaking at a seminar on ‘Menstrual health and hygiene — a neglected agenda’, organised by the Centre of Excellence in Women and Child Health of Aga Khan University (AKU) here the other day. 
During the event, speakers described in detail AKU’s intervention on menstrual hygiene management that was carried out in collaboration with the Swiss Red Cross in Dadu. 
Under the project, about 25,000 adolescent girls and women were provided knowledge and information on menstruation, menstrual cycle, and importance and ways of hygiene management through awareness group sessions. 
The data collected before the intervention showed poor baseline knowledge and practices regarding menstruation among young women and that 75 per cent girls were uninformed about menstruation prior to menarche. 
It also showed that around 40 per cent of menstruating adolescent girls and women did not use an absorbent. Following the intervention, non-users of absorbents reduced to 11 per cent, meaning that 90 per cent of them are now using an absorbent in the study area. 
“There was a significant positive behavioural change among adolescent girls and women who previously used to avoid certain foods, bathing, and going outside of the house while menstruating,” said Dr Sidrah Nausheen, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the AKU. 
The data, she said, demonstrated that the implementation of an intervention package comprising educational sessions, and a low-cost, culturally acceptable absorbent made with locally available materials, helped in improving their knowledge and practices. 
“Common myths and misconceptions were also addressed during these sessions. They were also taught how to make homemade reusable sanitary pads using cloth available at home,” Dr Nausheen noted. 
That intervention, the audience was told, also engaged men so that they could extend their support to women in terms of expenses, access to material and medical care regarding menstrual issues like any other health concern. 
Moreover, menstrual health management corners were established in the taluka headquarter hospital of Johi for awareness on the subject. Four women healthcare providers of this facility were imparted two weeks’ training by the AKU, who played a key role in the delivery of healthcare services whereas a team of community health workers and mobilisers carried out activities in the field.

Officials from Karachi and other districts were being posted in the authority in violation of directives of superior courts apparently on the request of HDA director general Mohammad Sohail Khan, said sources. 
LG Secretary Najam Shah had issued a notification on March 26, 2021, cancelling “assignment of any charge on OPS basis, additional charge(s) and look-after charges”. 
The notification required all heads of local councils, directorates, projects, authorities, commissions and boards to provide certificates of compliance with the orders of Sindh High Court. Both the outgoing and the incumbent DG of HDA did not bother to follow this notification.
The sources said that the DG of HDA had brought officers and officials from other LG departments like Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, district municipal corporations, municipal committees and district councils etc.
The LG secretary himself had allowed these deputations on the DG’s request and not only this but officers within HDA were also given ‘additional charges’ of various other posts, said the sources.
The DG defended his actions by saying that he was trying to restructure HDA to bring it at par with Lahore Development Authority (LDA) and Karachi Development Authority (KDA). 
“The DG doesn’t know that Karachi Water and Sewerage Board is almost independent but Wasa has been deprived of its financial autonomy through centralisation of HDA and Wasa accounts,” said a Wasa source, adding that centralisation of accounts was not mentioned in HDA Act 1976. 
The sources said that a number of new vehicles were being purchased by HDA for the DG, Wasa’s MD and project director at a time when Wasa workers were holding protests, demanding unpaid salaries and pension. 
“Contractors receive payments for works regularly while employees are told to wait for approval of summary forwarded by HDA to Sindh government,” said a Wasa worker, adding that one needed to get contractors’ works verified if they were really being executed.

14,Pesticides becoming dangerous for crops: experts,"HYDERABAD: Proposing that pretest effects of agrochemicals and their quality should be made mandatory, national and...","HYDERABAD: Proposing that pretest effects of agrochemicals and their quality should be made mandatory, national and international agricultural experts have said pesticides are becoming increasingly dangerous for crops and living organisms.
They were speaking at the inaugural function of the first two-day international conference on ‘Plant Protection’ organised by Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) Tandojam on Tuesday.
Vice Chancellor (VC) Dr Fateh Marri said on the occasion that most the land in Sindh was desert.
“We have attached great importance to agriculture in the irrigated areas from the very beginning, but most of the desert lands remained unproductive due to neglect. By focusing rain-fed agriculture, organic farm production could be expanded,” he said.
Founding SAU VC Dr A.Q.Ansari said farmers were not fully educated and they believed that only solution to get rid of harmful pests and diseases in crops was to use pesticides. “Due to lack of testing laboratories, effects of pesticides have not been tested, which raises many questions around the world about country’s agricultural products and their quality,” he said.
Former chairman of the Pakistan Science Foundation, Prof Dr Manzoor Hussain Soomro, said the importance of plant protection in agriculture was very important. 
He said the developed countries used natural methods to eradicate harmful diseases and germs from agricultural crops as harmful effects of pesticides were being studied. But technical expertise was required among farmers and related institutions in that regard, he added.
Conference host Prof Dr Jan Mohammad Marri said the event would focus on agricultural research through expert suggestions and their research, especially in agriculture, would benefit farmers about temperature, climate change and environment.
Conference secretary Dr Muhammad Ibrahim Khaskheli briefed about the event.
Addressing through video recording, Sindh Higher Education Commission Chairman Dr Tariq Rafi said the international conference would produce positive results and a message regarding agriculture in Sindh and Pakistan would reach the world.
University of Agriculture Faisalabad VC Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan said the SAU had played a major role in agriculture research.
Present on the occasion were Dr Syed Asadullah Shah from Malaysia, Dr Marshall from Netherlands, Dr Hisham Naseeruddin from Sudan, Dr Bhai Khan Shar, Shaheed Allah Bakhsh Soomro University Jamshoro VC Noor Mohammad Baloch, DG Research Islamuddin Rajput, Syed Nadeem Shah, Zahida Detho, experts, farmers and a large number of students.

A single bench of Justice Salahuddin Panhwar passed the order on Monday while hearing different bail applications. 
As the judge directed SP (investigation) of Shaheed Benazirabad to appear before the court, DSP of Kazi Ahmed informed him that there was no practice of posting an SP (investigation) in interior of Sindh. The SP (investigation) was posted only in Karachi division, he said. 
“It is very strange that two policies are being followed in Sindh as investigation is supervised by SSP in all districts except Karachi division,” the judge said. 
He directed the IGP to depute a focal person not below the rank of AIGP to assist the court on next date of hearing and submit an explanation about the reasons behind discriminating against other districts of the province by depriving them of an SP level officer to supervise investigation when such was the practice in Karachi. 
In case the focal person did not appear, the court ordered, IGP Sindh would appear in person. The copy of the order be communicated to IGP for compliance, it said. 
The court noted that applicants Allah Bux, Buxan Khan, son of Ghualm Hyder; Buxan Khan, son of Allah Parto; Sabir and Akhtar, were absent whereas Buxan Khan was in custody, therefore the application for his pre-arrest bail was not pressed as per order dated March 21, 2022.
