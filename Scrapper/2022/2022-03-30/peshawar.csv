0,Two health officers facing dismissal over fake degrees,"Dept issues show cause notices to Dr Kabir, Dr Ikramullah...","PESHAWAR: The health department has issued show cause notices to two officers for ‘possessing fake educational degrees and not getting themselves registered with the regulator, Pakistan Medical Commission.
It warned that if the two, including Mardan deputy district health officer Dr Ikramullah Safi and Mohmand medical officer Dr Mohammad Kabir, failed to respond to the notices, they would be sacked.
The decision comes on the directives of Chief Minister Mahmood Khan following separate inquiries.
The department is currently verifying educational documents of its employees.
The health department said the show cause notices had been issued to the two officers under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 2011, on the completion of inquiries, which found the two officers to be recruited on fake documents.

Dept issues show cause notices to Dr Kabir, Dr Ikramullah

It added that it had decided to impose penalty of the ‘Removal from Service’ tentatively on both officers and asked them show cause as to why they should not be dismissed from service permanently.
The two were asked to inform the department if they wanted to be heard in person.
“If this notice isn’t responded within seven to 15 days of its delivery, it shall be presumed that you have no defence to put for yourself, and in that case, ex-parte action shall be taken against you,” the department said in the notice.
Both the doctors were appointed on contractual basis in 2016 and were later regularised under the relevant law.
Sources in the health department said many doctors claimed to have degrees from abroad and therefore, they got themselves appointed.
They said several inquiries were under way against the employees with suspected degrees.
The officials said those found to be carrying fake degree would be sacked, while the employees who facilitated their appointments would be dealt with strictly.
They said more than 1,000 doctors were appointed on contractual jobs in 2020 but currently 550 of them were in the service as all others were terminated for doing dual jobs.
The officials said some were trainee medical officers in teaching hospitals and worked as ad hoc medical officers in the health department simultaneously.
They said from time to time, the department scrutinised appointments and those found with double jobs were shown the door and that more than 120 doctors were removed on that count.
When contacted, health secretary Mohammad Tahir Orakzai said inquiries against Dr Ikramullah and Dr Kabir were conducted by the provincial inspection team, governor’s inspection team and health department, which found their educational certificates to be fake.
He said the health department had started verification of the degrees of all suspected employees and would take strict action against those involved in the forgery of documents.
“We have initiated several inquiries to find out illegal appointments, postings and transfers, and documents, and in light of those findings, legal action will be taken which may include dismissal from service, recovery of the salary paid, and referring of cases to the relevant authorities for action,” he said.
The secretary said the department had 80,000 employees, which included regular ones, project employees and ad hoc ones.
“We are striving to streamline our human resources.  Dual jobs and fake posting and transfer orders in the department need investigation to ensure the deployment of qualified people where needed. Such employees will be blacklisted for any future job,” he said.

3,Clerics advocate end to Afghanistan ban on girls’ secondary education,Call for synergised efforts to promote female population’s access to education.,"PESHAWAR: Religious scholars from different schools of thought in a conference here on Tuesday called upon Afghanistan’s Taliban leadership to re-visit its decision to bar girls from secondary education and ensure the people’s access to education without discrimination.
Afghan clerics also participated in the event on ‘Girls Education: Importance in Islam and Role of Religious Leaders’, the organisers said.
The conference was held by the Muttahida Shariat Mahaz, a syndicate of the leaders of all sects, and attended by a delegation of the Council of Islamic Ideology, and women lawmakers.
In a joint declaration carrying their signatures, Islamic scholars and ulema highlighted the importance of the girls’ education in light of the teachings of Holy Quran and Sunnah and sought the reopening of secondary schools for girls in Afghanistan to ensure that all Afghan children can continue getting education without discrimination.

Call for synergised efforts to promote female population’s access to education

The Taliban government recently banned girls from secondary education by ordering high schools to re-open for boys only. The ban sparked outcry around the world.
Speakers in the conference emphasised the role of motivated and committed religious and community leaders for the promotion of girls’ education and transformation and said those leaders worked individually and collectively to convert their commitments into meaningful actions.
They also demanded the Afghan Taliban government allocate all required resources and facilities to support and promote the local girls’ access to secondary education and ensure that girls have an access to education without fear and intimidation and can play their role in social, political and economic development of their country.
In the declaration, the participants said for the girls’ education, the social transformation needed to tackle entrenched stereotypical norms and structures, which resisted the change.
Addressing the conference, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief khateeb Maulana Tayyab Qureshi said for the sustainable change towards girls’ education across Muslim countries, religious leaders should play their due role at the community level.
He said the Afghan Taliban’s decision to bar girls from education had created uncertainty.
“We must work in collaboration with civil society actors for the implementation of innovative approaches and cultural transformation on the girls’ and women’s education and empowerment, especially to increase the rates of the completion of education by girls at all levels across Muslim countries,” he said.
Former chief khateeb Qari Rohullah Madani, who had also served as a religious affairs minister, said Islam had declared seeking education mandatory for its followers more than 1400 years ago.
He said the world had accepted that as the women’s right not long ago.
Mr Madani said women had never been barred from getting education in the Islamic history. He said a controversy had been generated over the girls’ education, which was regrettable. The former chief khateeb, however, expressed reservations about co-education.
Senior researcher at the Council of Islamic Ideology Ghulam Majid said Islam encouraged women to be educated and have an active participation in public life. He said synergised efforts and actions by governments, faith groups, traditional leaders, non-governmental organisations, civil society groups, young people, practitioners, communities, international organisations, media and the private sector must be strengthened to promote girls’ access to education at all levels.
Allama Syed Hashim Musavi, a religious leader of Hazara community from Madressah Baaqirul Uloom, Quetta, expressed concern about the closure of secondary schools for women in Afghanistan and said the Afghan government’s move had deprived girls of their basic right to education.
“We must facilitate women and girls to avail themselves of opportunities for economic growth for which we call upon Muslim governments to invest money for improving girls’ education so that they have the knowledge, education, skills and self-confidence to participate in economic spheres,” he said.
The conference concluded with the declaration endorsed by religious leaders on girls’ secondary education and women’s empowerment, announcing girls’ access to education at all levels a fundamental right, and calling the Muslim government across the world to redouble efforts and work together to ensure that all children, especially girls, have access to 12 years of safe and quality education.

5,"Govt asked to protect rights of small, landless farmers","PESHAWAR: Representatives of farmers, agriculture workers and non-governmental organisations said here on Tuesday...","PESHAWAR: Representatives of farmers, agriculture workers and non-governmental organisations said here on Tuesday that the government was allowing free market forces to take over land, livestock, food production and processes as well as markets instead of promoting small and landless farmers. 
They vowed to fight all forms of feudal encroachments and grabbing of agricultural land by big corporations and to strive for food security. 
Addressing a press conference at Peshawar Press Club, representatives of Pakistan Kisan Mazdoor Tehreek (PKMT) and peasant movements demanded of the federal government to provide substantial economic relief through social protection initiatives to all the marginalised people, especially women. 
The presser was organised in connection with the Day of the Landless. It was addressed by representatives from across the country, including PKMT general secretary Tariq Mehmood, Dr Azra Saeed of Roots for Equity, Zahoor Joya from Multan, Ali Nawaz from Ghotki, Nabi Jan from Peshawar and others. 
Tariq Mehmood said that rich governments were representing big corporations while governments of poor countries were subservient to foreign and private capital of so-called climate friendly schemes under the pretext of sustainable food systems. 
“Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, instead of promoting and implementing policies that would promote sustainable food system, the United Nations supported mega business platforms and corporations to promote industrial-chemical methods of agricultural production,” he said. 
Mr Mehmood said that corporate farming systems, including those being used in the dairy and livestock sector, were responsible for eviction of small and landless farmers from their communities. A key example, he claimed, was the authority’s taking away control of the fresh milk sector from small producers and giving it to huge corporations. 
He said that digitalisation of the food production system would allow further encroachment of not only agro-chemical corporations, but also financial and IT corporations to control agriculture.
