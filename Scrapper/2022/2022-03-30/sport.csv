0,Imam’s century in vain as Australia rout Pakistan in first ODI,Australia took 38 balls to finish the job as Pakistan fell 88 runs short in reply to the tourists’ 313.,"LAHORE: It was out of Pakistan’s hands as opener Imam-ul-Haq walked towards the pavilion dejected after posting his eighth One-day Inter­national hundred. 
With the required run rate soaring at 10 by the end of the 39th over, a collapse waited for the hosts, and that’s exactly what happened after a slower one by Nathan Ellis rattled Imam’s exposed stumps.
Australia took 38 balls to finish the job as Pakistan fell 88 runs short in reply to the tourists’ 313 in the first ODI here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Tuesday.
Scoring 103 off 96 (six fours and three sixes) Imam had done well to carry Pakistan to a point from where an onslaught towards the target could be launched, but may be not well enough as his Australian counterpart Travis Head, who also scored a ton, a way quicker one, after Aaron Finch’s were put in to bat by Pakistan.
What Imam also lacked was support from the other end as Australian spinners thrived on a slow pitch. Other than Pakistan skipper Babar Azam (57 off 72), who put up a 96-run partnership for the second wicket with Imam, no other batter spent enough time on the crease with the left-hander. 
Babar arrived at the crease following opener Fakhar Zaman’s (18 off 18) early dismissal, and the reigning ICC ODI cricketer of the year reached 4,000 runs in the format off his third boundary.  
The right-hander hit three more classy boundaries in the next 13 overs before misjudging a fuller delivery by leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson and finding himself trapped lbw in front of the middle stump before wasting a review.
With Pakistan at 120-1, the asking rate was nearly seven and a half and Imam, settled at 45, knew he had to up the ante. The 26-year-old took only three more balls to show he had the intent to do so when he launched Swepson over wide long-on for a six to bring up his 50.
Before Imam could increase more momentum, Pakistan two overs later lost Saud Shakeel, who came in at number four, to a soft dismissal off Head’s off-spin. Three overs later, Mohammad Rizwan followed as Adam Zampa (4-38) opened up his account for the day, making the wicket-keeper/batter sweep it into the hands of his Australian counterpart Alex Carey.
Imam kept scoring boundaries despite seeing all-rounder Iftikhar Ahmed fail on the other end as well and took only 35 balls to reach the second half of his century by the 38th over, six balls before Ellis cleaned him up and Zampa wrapped up Pakistan’s tail.
“We let them score too many runs in the first ten overs,” Babar said after the match. 
“We started poorly and then gave away too many runs at the death. 
“While Imam and I were batting, we felt we had the chase under control but then lost wickets in clumps and couldn’t recover.”
While Imam’s effort was commendable, he would have wished it was as good as that of Head, who marked his return to one-day cricket with a blistering 72-ball 101 — his second ODI hundred — while opener Ben McDermott hit 55 from 70 balls.

Playing his first ODI since November 2018, Head plundered the Pakistan bowlers for 12 fours and three sixes, combining for 110 runs with opening partner and captain Aaron Finch (23). 
Finch fell when he edged a sharp leg-spinner from debutant Zahid Mahmood to Rizwan behind the wickets.      
Head brought up his century off only 70 balls when he took a single off Iftikhar’s off-spin, only to throw his wicket away five balls later as he miscued another big-hitting attempt for Khushdil Shah to take a comfortable catch at long-off half way through the innings. 
With their scoring rate slowed down, Australia reached 209-2 in the 33rd over and from that point, Pakistan pulled back with three wickets for just 21 runs in the space of 39 balls, dismissing McDermott, Marnus Labuschagne (25) and Alex Carey (four). 
McDermott was run out when he tried to take a third off Khushdil when it was not on while Labushagne holed out Khushdil to Saud Shakeel at long-off before Carey was cleaned up by Zahid in the 39th over. 
Australia were 232-5 with 10 overs to go with all-rounder Cameron Green and Marcus Stoinis at the crease. The pair took their time to settle in as Pakistan kept it tight. But Australia managed to add 50 runs in the last five overs, thanks to cameos from Stoinis (26) — who was bowled by a skidding full length delivery by pacer Haris Rauf in the 47th over — and Sean Abbot (14). 
Green ended up scoring an unbeaten 40 runs off 30 balls which included three boundaries and a six. For Pakistan, Haris took 2-44 and Zahid finished with figures of 2-59. 
“Nice to get a look at the top, get an opportunity and take it. I felt like we set the platform really well,” said Head, who also registered 2-35 with ball.
“Finchy and I, so we knew that with the dew coming in it may be tough to bowl later in the innings. 
“So runs at the top against the new ball were going to be crucial and it was nice to play a role.”
Australia, already without key players David Warner, Steve Smith, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc for various reasons, were further depleted after spinner Ashton Agar tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday.

1,"Root should step down as England captain, says Michael Vaughan","“If he rings me in the next week and asks for some advice I’ll be dead honest — I’d tell him to step down,"" he says.","LONDON: Joe Root should step down as England Test captain following his side’s series loss to the West Indies, former skipper Michael Vaughan told the BBC.
Root’s position is under the spotlight after a 1-0 series defeat which came on the back of a woeful 4-0 Ashes thrashing by Australia.
That extended England’s poor run to four successive Test series defeats.
The 31-year-old Yorkshire star batter has skippered England in a record 64 Tests, winning 27 games — more than any other captain — but lost 26, which is also more than any other captain.
Vaughan, who captained England 51 times from 2003-08, has known Root for many years but says it is better to have Root in the side without the burden of the captaincy. 
“He’s taken it as far as he possibly can,” Vaughan told the BBC. 
“If he rings me in the next week and asks for some advice I’ll be dead honest — I’d tell him to step down. 
“Will England be any worse off not having him as a captain? I don’t think they would, because they are going to get his runs and a senior player.” Vaughan said he would prefer it if Root, who has expressed his desire to remain captain, resigned rather than was fired by the future permanent director of cricket and the head coach.
Former captain Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood are filling the roles of director of cricket and coach respectively following the departures of Ashley Giles and Chris Silverwood prior to the West Indies series. 
“I wouldn’t want the new director of cricket or head coach to sack him — he’s deserved the right to go on his own ground,” said Vaughan. “During his reign I don’t think he has been helped at all. 
“His first Ashes series there was the Ben Stokes incident (a late night fracas outside a Bristol bar), then we had the white-ball reset, then he’s had Covid and it’s been very difficult. 
“But, I always think captains should pride themselves on maximising every ounce of potential in the changing room. 
“I just look at the team and ask ‘Why did they perform so under their potential?’ That would be a real concern for me.” 
Vaughan says Root has lacked a clinical touch when it has come to matches that are delicately poised. “Tactically he has been poor,” said Vaughan. 
“It has been a common trend under Joe — he hasn’t managed to grab a game.
“If he does carry on he’ll really need someone who can drive the tactical side of the game with him.”
Root, however, has been adamant he wants to carry on as captain and is resolute in his belief that England are on the brink of a bright future. “A difficult defeat to take because I really think there were a lot of positives to come from the way we played for the vast majority of this series,” Root posted on his social media channels on Tuesday. “After a long winter, it’s time to take a break and recharge ahead of the summer, but I believe in the future of this team.” 
Root did receive support from England’s record wicket-taker James Anderson who, along with fellow opening bowler Stuart Broad, was controversially omitted from the West Indies tour. “If you get the right people in those two jobs above him then he can still do a really good job,” Anderson said.

2,Thorpe named Afghanistan head coach,"The 52-year-old, who played 100 test matches for England between 1993-2005, stepped down as England batting coach in February.","KABUL: Former England batsman Graham Thorpe has been named head coach of the Afghanistan senior men’s team, the country’s cricket board (ACB) announced on Tuesday.
Thorpe, who played 100 test matches for England between 1993-2005, stepped down as England batting coach in February, following their 4-0 Ashes defeat by Australia.
The 52-year-old was among a number of departures from the England set-up, including head coach Chris Silverwood and managing director Ashley Giles, and faced criticism for several batting collapses by the team in Australia.
Thorpe will be replacing South African Lance Klusener, who left the Afghanistan role in November last year.
“The ACB had launched the recruitment process for hiring a new head coach, through which Graham Thorpe was selected as the best available nominee for the position,” the board said in a statement.
“He will step up into the role of head coach ahead of the upcoming international events of Afghanistan.”

3,"Australia lose Perry, England face SA again in semi-finals","Twenty-year-old all-rounder Annabel Sutherland is likely to replace the accomplished Perry, 31, in Wednesday’s semi-final.","WELLINGTON: Tournament favourites Australia suffered a major setback on Tuesday on the eve of their Women’s World Cup semi-final against the West Indies, losing all-rounder Ellyse Perry to injury.
Captain Meg Lanning confirmed the six-time champions Australia would be without Perry, who suffered back spasms during the group stage win over South Africa last week.
Twenty-year-old all-rounder Annabel Sutherland is likely to replace the accomplished Perry, 31, in Wednesday’s semi-final, as she did against Bangladesh last Friday, when Australia completed a seven-from-seven record in the group stage.
Lanning would not rule Perry out of contention if they qualify for Sunday’s final in Christchurch against either South Africa or England, who clash on Thursday. 
“She batted a little bit in the nets and felt okay, but she certainly just wasn’t in a position, unfortunately, to be able to perform at the level needed,” Lanning said. 
“We will keep assessing her as we go if we are to progress but the team and the squad is very focused on tomorrow and making sure that we’re putting out our best game because everything else is irrelevant.” 
Perry claimed figures of 3-22 against the West Indies two weeks ago, in a seven-wicket win which was achieved with nearly 20 overs to spare, typical of their dominant performances at the tournament.
The Caribbean side have exceeded expectations by qualifying in fourth place for the semi-finals.
Their progress went down to the final ball of the last group game on Sunday when South Africa dramatically eliminated India, prompting scenes of wild celebration at the West Indies’ team hotel. 
KNOCKOUT EXPERIENCE
Defending champions England will carry momentum into Thursday’s game in Christchurch — a replay of the 2017 semi-final — having won four straight matches after losing their opening three.
England captain Heather Knight believes her team’s experience of playing “knockout cricket” in the latter half of the group stage — they could not afford to lose a match if they were to qualify — is invaluable. 
“Having that mentality to have the pressure on you and that if you lose you’re out, we’ve had that for a while now,” said Knight. 
“So I think that will be a really useful thing for us.” 
Second-ranked South Africa lost only one match, to Australia, in the group stage. Their powerful batting line-up, led by Laura Wolvaardt, will fancy their chances of turning the tables on England, who got up to pip them by two wickets with two balls to spare at the same stage in 2017.
Wolvaardt has plundered 433 runs at an average of 61.85 in the tournament, more than any other batter. Australia’s Lanning comes next with 358 at 59.66.

Usyk beat Joshua in front of a sell-out crowd at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in September to seize the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO belts.
Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a  “special military operation”, Usyk returned to his homeland to join a territorial defence battalion, raising doubts about a rematch with Joshua.
However, ESPN reported last week that a fight bet­ween the two boxers would take place this summer after the Ukrainian sports minister gave Usyk permission to leave the country.
“(Saudi Arabia) is under discussion at the moment,” Usyk’s promoter Alexander Krassyuk told Sky Sports.  “Late June is also the timing we are considering now. Many things will depend on how fast we manage to ink the papers.
“The good thing is that Usyk is already in Europe to start his preparation.”
The winner could be in line for a unification bout with WBC heavyweight champion Tyson Fury of Britain.

Svitolina, who has been outspoken in support of Ukraine amid the invasion, has competed at the Monterrey Open, Indian Wells and the Miami Open in recent weeks.
She lost in the opening round at Indian Wells and Miami, but reached the Monterrey Open quarter-finals and pledged to donate her prize money from the tournament to the Ukrainian army.
Russia calls its actions a  “special military operation”.
“It’s been an extremely difficult couple of months for me, not only mentally but also physically,” Svitolina wrote on Twitter.  “For a quite long time I’ve been struggling with my back.
“The pain didn’t let me prepare for the tournaments at my best. Observing with unbearable pain in my heart what is happening in my homeland Ukraine ... gave me a huge push to continue and fight on court.
“Now, my body can’t handle it anymore and I need to rest.”
Svitolina added that she would also miss some of her  “favourite” tournaments in Europe, but did not provide any other details.
Ukraine will take on the US in a best-of-five qualifier in the Billie Jean King tournament formerly known as the Fed Cup on April 15-16. The tie will be played at an indoor hard court venue in Asheville, North Carolina.
The winners will qualify for the 2022 Finals, scheduled to be held in November.

The winner of that match with then face the fifth-placed team in the South American qualifiers with a berth in the finals in Qatar at stake.
Abdullah struck against the run of play for the Emiratis, who were facing a Korean side that had not conceded a goal in their previous five qualifiers and were looking for a victory that would secure them top spot in Group ‘A’.
Striker Hwang Hee-chan hit the woodwork in the first half as the Koreans dominated but, nine minutes after the restart, Abdullah scored.

The 19-year-old, deputising for suspended first-choice forward Ali Mabkhout, latched onto Mohammed Al Baloushi’s pass and calmly stroked the ball past Jo Hyeon-woo.
South Korea hit the frame of the goal again six minutes later when Hwang Ui-jo’s header clipped the top of the bar but they could not deny the UAE, who are looking to qualify for the finals for the first time since making their debut in 1990.
The Emirates finished in third place in the group ahead of Iraq, who were held to a 1-1 draw by Syria.
Abdulghani Shahad’s side needed to beat the Syrians and hope the UAE lost to South Korea, only to go behind in the fourth minute when Alaa Al Dali shot into the roof of the net.
Aymen Hussein headed in an equaliser 14 minutes before the break to give his side a lifeline but the Iraqis were unable to claim a second win in the qualifiers.
Iran earned a 2-0 win over Lebanon in Mashhad through goals from Sardar Azmoun and Alireza Jahanbakhsh to ensure Dragan Skocic’s side finished on top of Group A, two points ahead of the Koreans.

“Russia and Belarus have violated the humanitarian obligations for member federations,” the International Biathlon Union said in a statement.
The IBU also noted the Russian military invasion has stopped the activities of the Ukrainian Biathlon Federation so it would be unfair for the attacking countries to enjoy membership rights while biathlon in Ukraine is disrupted.
Russia has retained active membership in most sports governing bodies, including football’s FIFA which has its annual congress on Thursday in Doha, Qatar. 
It was unclear on Tuesday if Russian football officials will take up their rights to attend and speak to more than 200 fellow members.
The IBU executive board moved to suspend its Russian and Belarusian members one week after the World Cup season ended.
“The decisions, which can be challenged at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, will be reviewed in the event of a change of circumstances in Ukraine, and at the IBU congress in September,” the governing body said.

Medvedev, who can replace Novak Djokovic in the rankings if he reaches the Miami semi-finals, fired down 14 aces and broke Martinez three times to secure victory in 84 minutes.
“I just felt like I had to be more consistent, and the more consistent one today would win,” Medvedev said.
“I managed to just make a few less errors at important moments, serve even better, and it was a small margin but I managed to win and I’m really happy.”

Spanish 14th seed Carlos Alcaraz will meet Stefanos Tsitsipas after both enjoyed straight-set wins over Marin Cilic and Alex de Minaur respectively.
Alcaraz,18, beat Tsitsipas in their only previous meeting, a five-set thriller at last year’s US Open.
“He is a great player,” the Greek third seed said of Alcaraz. “For me it will be a great challenge, the ones that I like.”
Indian Wells champion Taylor Fritz dispatched fellow American Tommy Paul 7-6(2), 6-4 and will meet Serbian Miomir Kecm­anovic, a 7-6(4). 6-3 winner over Sebastian Korda.

“I didn’t really think about winning Indian Wells until I had match point in the final,” he said.
“So I’m approaching this one the same way. I don’t expect to win the tournament, but I take it one match at a time, and you never know.”

After the match the unseeded Osaka said she was in a different state of mind than last year when arriving at the Miami Open after winning the Australian Open.
“It’s really funny for me because last year I made it to the [Miami] quarters too but it was after I won Australia and I wasn’t that grateful, I kind of expected to win,” said Osaka.
“But I’m in the same position this year and I am so like, this is really like one of the funnest times of my life.”

Badosa, who won the Sydney title this year and reached the semis at Indian Wells, told reporters it had been a tough day.
“I didn’t wake up feeling well so I didn’t know if I’d be able to finish the match,” she said.  “I always say I want to be a fighter no matter what so that’s what I did. I kept fighting and I don’t really know how I won.”
