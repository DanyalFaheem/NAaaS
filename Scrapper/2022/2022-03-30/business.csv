0,Bank account holders can invest in equity market,SBP Governor Dr Reza Baqir says the move will pave the way for wider outreach of the equity market.,"KARACHI: Under the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) ‘Shared KYC (Know Your Customer) Project’ resident investors can open accounts in the capital market using their bank’s portal or app, central bank governor Dr Reza Baqir said on Tuesday, adding that the move will pave the way for wider outreach of the equity market. 
During a visit to the Central Depository Company (CDC) to mark the successful operations of important projects for Pakistan Capital Market, namely Roshan Equity Investment for Roshan Digital Account (RDA) holders and Raast for dividend payments, Dr Baqir appreciated the CDC’s role. The successful roll-out of important projects of national interest like RDA, of which Roshan Equity is a component, and Raast have been initiated by the central bank and very well executed by commercial banks, he said. 
He acknowledged that CDC has played an active role in the operations of Roshan Equity.
“This is only the beginning of what our vision is for the development of Pakistan’s Capital market,” said Dr Baqir.
“For the Shared KYC Project, CDC will again act as the information sharing bridge for the digital opening of capital market accounts through banking portals for local resident investors with the objective of removing duplication of information capture and KYC processes,” said CDC CEO Badiuddin Akber.
The CDC is already processing thousands of transactions related to Roshan Digital Accounts and Raast for the Pakistan Stock Exchange. 
Meanwhile, brokerage houses said the Shared KYC Project is good for the growth of the equity market. 
“This will save a lot of time and effort for opening a broker account and may help in increasing the investor base,” said Mohammad Sohail, the CEO of Topline Securities.
“I think this is very helpful as account opening has been a major issue in Pakistani market,” said Samiullah Tariq, head of research at the Pak-Kuwait Investment and Development Company. “The investment ratio is very low on per capital basis compared to regional countries,” he said, adding that the number of investors is almost one tenth of Bangladesh market.
He was of the view that this initiative should help increase penetration in the domestic investors and attract domestic investors towards formal avenues including investment in the equity market.
“It will also help grow companies and raise capital when new investors are seeking investment avenues,” he added.

1,‘Sludge costing Pakistan 39pc of GDP’,IBA academics say inequality in resource distribution giving rise to inter-regional economic disparities.,"BHURBAN: Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) — a public sector think tank — has concluded that the country’s institutional processes and frictions cost Pakistan almost 40 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) and the exercise of political power by public representatives exacerbate inequalities across the country.
On the conclusion of the two-day conference ‘Research for Social Transformation and Advancement’ (Rasta), economist and PIDE Vice-Chancellor Dr Nadeem Ul Haque said fresh findings, ideas and things have come to light at the event that required policymakers to take note of. 
Dr Ahmed Waqar Qasim, Senior Research Economist at PIDE, in his study ‘Sludge: The Administrative Burden’ found that “in various sectors sludge at the national level costs Pakistan 39pc of its GDP”. 
PIDE defines the term sludge as excessive and unjustified frictions that make it difficult for the people to get things done or achieve what they want as such frictions make processes unnecessary difficult and lead to unwarranted interaction between citizens and the public institutions.

IBA academics say inequality in resource distribution giving rise to inter-regional economic disparities 

This involves excessive paperwork, unnecessary NOCs to be obtained, excessive hierarchy involved in approvals, centralised decision-making and rent-seeking attempts, which cost time and money and frustrates people by depriving them of access to goods, opportunities, and services. This imposes costs upon the economy in terms of waste of resources and the opportunity costs incurred. This discourages investments, lowers productivity and therefore constrains GDP growth while imposing psychological costs as well frustration, humiliation and stigma.
Dr Faiz Ur Rehman of IBA Karachi in a joint study “Political Dynasties and Local Economic Development in Pakistan’ noted that despite considerable attention paid by previous governments to the underdeveloped regions, intra-regional economic disparities were on the rise in Pakistan. “While there can be several reasons for exasperating inter-regional inequality across regions, political institutions and politicians may explain a significant size of this inequality,” he noted, adding that politicians exercise considerable de facto political power to redirect resources towards their regions which had a substantial cost for least developed regions.
Pakistan is among those countries where the share of elected political dynasties in parliament is one of the highest in the world. It represents more than 50pc of the elected legislature since 1970, he said adding that since 2008 the debate on the subject intensified at many levels, but little evidence or research was ever presented.
The study finds that constituencies with non-dynast winners perform better than the dynast winners in terms of local economic development. The reason for the worse performance of dynasts could be associated with lower political participation, besides other factors. The report recommended, “abolishing discretionary funds and minimising the influence of legislators over PSDP spending can be an effective deterrent to cut down the divergence between the performance of dynasts and non-dynasts”.
Professor Adeel Malik of Oxford University in his study ‘The Political Economy of Non-Tariff Protection in Pakistan’ examined the impact of political influence on trade protection in the country and noted that the GSP engagement with European Union entailed a major harmonisation of regulatory standards and led to a dramatic increase in the application of non-tariff measures (NTMs) across the entire manufacturing space.
He found that most-favoured nation (MFN) tariffs were consistently higher for politically organised sectors. However, a clear divergence emerged between politically organised and unorganised sectors from 2008 onwards when regulatory duties were introduced. In a crux, regardless of how the sectors are defined, politically influenced sectors have higher levels of trade protection in the guise of import duties, particularly after 2013.

2,SME development strategy for Sindh in the offing,The strategy has been designed by the Department of Indus­tries and Commerce.,"ISLAMABAD: The formulation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Competitive Strategy for Sindh began on Tuesday at a meeting chaired by the provincial Chief Secretary Syed Mumtaz Ali Shah. 
The SMEs development strategy has been designed by the Department of Indus­tries and Commerce and initiative supported under technical assistance from the International Trade Centre (ITC) through its Growth for Rural Advance­ment and Sustainable Pro­gress (GRASP), a project funded by the EU.
The Sindh Provincial Working Group for the development of SMEs, at its meeting in Karachi, approved a technical paper setting the strategic orientations for the strategy. The orientations are based on thorough analysis of SME performance using results of a SME competitive survey, quantitative analyses, and bilateral meetings with key institutions.
A press release issued by the Geneva-based ITC said that the strategic orientations for the SME strategy are also derived from consultations held November last in Karachi and Hyderabad with more than 200 public and private stakeholders from agriculture, manufacturing and services sectors of Sindh.
Chairing the meeting of the provincial working group in Karachi, Mr Shah said he was encouraged by the progress and was optimistic that the strategy will encapsulate the rural SMEs in addition to those based in urban areas. The Sindh chief secretary described it to be the cornerstone of the plan to build a conducive eco-system for SMEs in close collaboration between the public and private sectors.

3,"Islamabad needs to curtail imports, says Chinese envoy",Says the  “heavy imbalance” in bilateral trade is a “problem” that Islamabad should resolve through import substitution.,"KARACHI: China’s Consul General Li Bijian said on Tuesday Pakistan should reduce imports from the largest Asian economy as the bilateral trade is highly skewed against Islamabad.
At a ceremony to mark the beginning of the local assembling of Chinese home appliances brand Midea, Mr Li said the “heavy imbalance” in the bilateral trade is a “problem” that Islamabad should resolve through import substitution.
“You import more and export less, even though my government in collaboration with your government is trying to narrow down the trade deficit. We want to see balanced trade,” he said.
According to import payments data issued by the central bank, almost one-fourth of the total import bill in 2020-21 originated from China alone. In contrast, China’s share in Pakistan’s export rec­eipts was less than 8pc in the same year.
The Chinese diplomat said the trade situation was “not developing as we wish” despite the free trade agreement that allows Pakistan to export more than 300 items to export to China without tariff.
He praised Midea products, saying the brand is “one of the most popular” ones in China. “It’ll narrow down Pakistan’s trade deficit,” he said.
Tri-Angels Electronics Ltd has imported machinery worth $1 million to assemble Midea’s microwave ovens and water dispensers in Pakistan. Since 2018, it has separately invested $2.3m to assemble products of Hisense Electronics, a Chinese brand that makes LED TV sets besides other items.
Speaking to the press, Tri-Angels Electronics CEO Imran Ghani said the company’s capacity to assemble microwave ovens is 500 units a day. Its capacity for assembling water dispensers is 300 pieces a day.
Pakistanis buy about 500,000 water dispensers every year, with household and corporate segments holding a 50pc market share each. The total market for microwave ovens is 700,000 units a year, he said.
The company began assembling water dispensers last week in Karachi. The assembling of microwave ovens will commence in the second week of April, said Mr Ghani.
In the face of tough competition from local and other Chinese brands operating in the white consumer goods industry, the Tri-Angels Electronics CEO plans to play up “product features and design” while keeping retail prices on a par with existing players.
Mr Ghani claimed to enjoy a 5pc share in the LED TV market that, he says, consists of 1.4m units a year. “We’re growing our market share rapidly. Our average revenue growth has been 30pc a year,” he said.
Going forward, the company plans to export its products to the countries belonging to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation bloc. “We’re holding discussions with Midea, which already has buyers in those countries,” he said.

4,Oil prices sink,LONDON: World oil prices dived and European stocks rallied on Tuesday as apparent progress in peace talks between...,"LONDON: World oil prices dived and European stocks rallied on Tuesday as apparent progress in peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv sparked hope of an end to the Ukraine conflict.
Oil price fell by more than five percent, with New York’s WTI contract dipping under $100 per barrel as traders eyed easing Russian oil supply fears amid face-to-face talks in Istanbul aimed at resolving the nearly five-week-old war.
Russia said it would scale down military activity around Kyiv following the “meaningful” talks in Turkey, as Ukraine’s negotiators called for international guarantees for the country’s security.
Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia also said there were now  “sufficient” conditions for a direct meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“It’s looking more promising than at any stage since the invasion,” OANDA foreign exchange platform analyst Craig Erlam told AFP.
“While the removal of sanctions is unlikely as part of the peace process, it could remove further risks to Russian exports.” Europe’s major stock markets jumped higher, with Frankfurt soaring 3.5pc, Paris winning 3.1pc and London adding 1.2pc in afternoon deals.
Wall Street also opened slightly higher.

The government has collected record revenues reflecting the high performance of the domestic companies. The prime minister earlier said that the 100 big companies of Pakistan earned a profit of Rs950bn in 2021 and urged them to share it with their employees.
